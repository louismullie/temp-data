## Question

Urine leukocyte esterase

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the urine leukocyte esterase test — specifically, how to interpret and apply it across clinical contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what leukocyte esterase actually detects and how the test performs in general. Then, I should verify the best-supported clinical role, which I suspect is as a rule-out test rather than a rule-in. Next, I will examine age-specific guidance in infants and children, followed by older adults, then pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, and finally nonurinary applications. After that, I need to check specimen quality, collection method, and interferences. Finally, I will integrate a practical decision algorithm and acknowledge limitations, including where guidelines conflict or where culture remains indispensable.

> Let me first confirm the basics. Leukocyte esterase is an enzyme released by neutrophils. A positive dipstick suggests pyuria, i.e. WBCs in the urine, but it does not prove bacteriuria or infection by itself because pyuria is nonspecific and can be sterile or from nonurinary inflammation, so I should not overinterpret a positive result without clinical correlation or culture confirmation when appropriate [^113jyM3S] [^112KNEot].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-yield clinical role. Multiple high-quality syntheses indicate that a dipstick negative for both leukocyte esterase and nitrite has a high negative predictive value for clinically relevant UTI, making the best-supported use of leukocyte esterase its ability to help rule out UTI when combined with nitrite negativity in appropriately selected patients; this is where the test most reliably changes pretest to posttest probability downward [^112yE1He] [^114AHHdU] [^117R7Uff] [^1161SvQk].

> I will now examine infants and young children. Guidelines endorse using a positive leukocyte esterase (or nitrite or microscopy) as a preliminary UTI signal in febrile children 2–24 months, but emphasize obtaining a catheterized or suprapubic specimen for culture if urinalysis is positive, and recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not fully exclude UTI. Meta-analytic pediatric data show that the sensitivity of leukocyte esterase or nitrite is about 88% with specificity around 79%, and microscopy for bacteria performs best, though none replace culture in children [^115gMj28] [^116Ciijs] [^113uY6g7] [^114Ffzkq].

> Hold on, I should verify how concentration affects interpretation in young children. Studies suggest that urine specific gravity modestly influences likelihood ratios for pyuria thresholds, but leukocyte esterase positivity remains a strong predictor across dilute and concentrated samples; still, I need to ensure I do not rely on a single cutoff without considering concentration and, more importantly, the clinical picture and culture when stakes are high [^111zuXw3] [^notfound] [^116hGe7J].

> Next, I should review older adults. High-quality evidence and contemporary reviews argue that dipsticks, including leukocyte esterase, have poor specificity in older adults due to high asymptomatic bacteriuria prevalence. A positive result is not diagnostic and risks overtreatment, whereas a negative dipstick can support ruling out UTI in the right clinical context, reinforcing a stewardship-first approach in this population [^115jggxv] [^114AHHdU] [^1145uCfe].

> Let me consider pregnancy. I initially thought leukocyte esterase might be a good screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria, but wait, I should double-check that. Evidence shows dipsticks have low sensitivity for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, so a negative screen does not reliably exclude it; therefore, culture-based screening remains the standard in pregnancy, and relying on leukocyte esterase alone risks missed diagnoses [^112ZRqQT] [^112CWCqa].

> I need to check sexually transmitted infection contexts. In adolescent and young adult males with urethritis, a positive leukocyte esterase on first-void urine is a useful screening marker and, when combined with clinical features, can support empiric treatment while confirmatory testing proceeds; guidelines endorse leukocyte esterase on first-void urine as part of urethritis evaluation when microscopy is not immediately available [^112bqwoy] [^114BDHA4].

> But wait, what about nonurinary uses. Leukocyte esterase strips have been adapted for ascitic fluid to rapidly screen for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, with reasonable sensitivity and excellent specificity when read at the correct time. However, I should confirm timing and potential interferences, as delayed reading or discolored fluids can mislead interpretation in these off-label applications [^116h4W5A] [^115EyEnw].

> Next, I should review specimen quality and collection. Bagged specimens in infants have high contamination and false-positive rates. A positive screen from a bag should prompt catheterized culture rather than treatment, and in older children and adults, clean-catch midstream specimens are preferred, with prompt processing to avoid lysis of cells that would blunt leukocyte esterase sensitivity [^114T7zrd] [^113jyM3S] [^117XeZs7].

> I need to ensure I account for interferences and false results. High protein, glucose, specific dyes like methylene blue, and improper timing can distort dipstick results; leukocyte esterase can be falsely negative with low pyuria or certain pathogens and falsely positive with contamination or nonurinary inflammation, so I should correlate with symptoms and, when results and clinical suspicion diverge, obtain a culture before committing to antibiotics [^116uVgiB] [^113jyM3S] [^1126CRh8].

> Let me integrate a practical decision pathway. In a child with fever and no obvious source, if the pretest probability is not low, obtain a catheterized urinalysis and culture. If leukocyte esterase or nitrite is positive, treat presumptively while awaiting culture, and if both are negative and the child is well, observation with close follow-up is reasonable, recognizing a residual risk. In older adults, avoid dipstick-only diagnoses. Use a negative dipstick to help de-escalate when symptoms are nonspecific, and reserve antibiotics for those with compatible localizing symptoms plus supportive labs or culture. In pregnancy, do not rely on dipsticks for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Screen with culture. In symptomatic women with classic lower tract symptoms, a positive nitrite or moderate pyuria increases the likelihood of UTI, but culture can still clarify when the presentation is atypical or recurrence is suspected [^116Ciijs] [^114AHHdU] [^112ZRqQT] [^1173wmU7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about replacing culture. Across settings, culture remains the reference standard for definitive diagnosis and for guiding targeted therapy. Leukocyte esterase contributes to screening and triage but cannot stand alone, particularly in children where missing a UTI has consequences and in older adults where overtreatment is common [^112KNEot] [^113uY6g7] [^114AHHdU].

> Finally, I should acknowledge evolving tools and stewardship. Machine learning and refined reflex algorithms can optimize urinalysis thresholds to predict culture positivity and reduce unnecessary cultures and antibiotics, but they complement rather than replace clinician judgment and culture; I need to ensure local protocols reflect patient populations, collection practices, and resistance patterns when implementing such systems [^1117n9TS] [^115Dno19] [^112yE1He].

Urine leukocyte esterase (LE) is a **rapid screen for pyuria** [^115fqDqw] that detects neutrophil enzymes, indicating inflammation or infection [^113jyM3S] [^115VAcoR]. It is **sensitive but not specific** for UTI [^1116DtDy]; false positives occur with contamination, vaginal discharge, or sterile inflammation, and false negatives with dilute urine or low pyuria [^1174tKiQ] [^114FaYoP]. LE is most useful as part of a **dipstick panel** (with nitrite, microscopy) [^114Ffzkq] to raise suspicion of UTI, but results must be confirmed by **urine culture** [^113fKJxy] and clinical correlation [^116Ciijs]. In older adults, LE has low specificity due to asymptomatic bacteriuria [^115jggxv]; in pregnancy, screen all for asymptomatic bacteriuria with culture, not LE alone [^112ZRqQT]. LE is not reliable for ruling out UTI in high-risk patients or when symptoms persist [^116m7CLs].

---

## Clinical significance

LE is a **marker of pyuria** — elevated WBCs in urine — and suggests inflammation or infection, most commonly UTI [^113jyM3S]. It is a **rapid, inexpensive, and widely available** screening tool, but it is not specific for UTI and must be interpreted in clinical context [^112KNEot].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy

LE has moderate sensitivity and specificity for UTI, with performance varying by population and method [^114pfeLa] [^114Ffzkq]:

| **Population** | **Sensitivity (%)** | **Specificity (%)** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | 72–95 | 9–59 |
| Pediatric population | 83–94 | 64–92 |
| Elderly population | 50–60 | 85–95 |

---

False positives occur with contamination, vaginal discharge, or sterile inflammation; false negatives occur with dilute urine, low pyuria, or early infection [^113jyM3S] [^117Qwkiu].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Pediatric patients**: LE is recommended as part of initial screening for UTI in febrile infants and young children, but results must be confirmed by culture [^116Ciijs] [^111oBfVB].
- **Elderly patients**: LE has low specificity due to high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria; diagnosis should rely on clinical criteria and culture [^114AHHdU] [^115jggxv].
- **Pregnant patients**: LE is not recommended for screening asymptomatic bacteriuria; culture is the gold standard [^112ZRqQT] [^112CWCqa].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Contamination**: Vaginal discharge, skin flora, or improper collection can cause false positives [^1174tKiQ].
- **Dilute urine**: Low specific gravity can reduce sensitivity, causing false negatives [^114FaYoP].
- **Non-infectious inflammation**: Sterile pyuria from interstitial nephritis, glomerulonephritis, or recent instrumentation can yield false positives [^113jyM3S].
- **Antibiotic use**: Recent antibiotics can reduce pyuria, causing false negatives [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios and interpretation

- **Positive LE with symptoms**: Strongly suggests UTI; obtain culture and treat empirically [^1119PSn9].
- **Positive LE without symptoms**: May indicate asymptomatic bacteriuria or contamination; confirm with culture before treating [^114AHHdU].
- **Negative LE with symptoms**: Does not exclude UTI; obtain culture if suspicion remains [^116Ciijs].

---

## Alternative and complementary tests

- **Urine culture**: Gold standard for definitive diagnosis of UTI [^114k2Aho].
- **Microscopy**: Direct visualization of WBCs and bacteria improves diagnostic accuracy [^113uY6g7].
- **Nitrite test**: Complements LE by detecting nitrite-producing bacteria [^1119PSn9].
- **Molecular tests**: PCR and other advanced methods offer high sensitivity and specificity but are not widely available [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

LE is a useful screening tool for UTI, but results must be interpreted in clinical context and confirmed by culture [^116m7CLs]. Positive LE should prompt further evaluation and empiric treatment when clinically indicated, whereas negative LE does not exclude UTI, particularly in high-risk patients or when symptoms persist [^116Ciijs].

---

Urine leukocyte esterase is a **rapid screen for pyuria** and suggests UTI, but it is not specific and must be confirmed by culture and clinical correlation [^113jyM3S]. It is most useful as part of a **dipstick panel**, with results interpreted in clinical context and confirmed by **culture** [^112KNEot].

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^111sfDpY]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections in nursing homes (NHs). A high error rate of a UTI diagnosis based solely on clinical criteria is to be expected in older persons as they often present infections in an atypical way. A study was set up to assess the diagnostic value of signs/symptoms and urine dipstick testing in identifying UTIs in NH residents and to explore whether C-reactive protein (CRP) measured by point-of-care testing (POCT) can help in the diagnosis.

Methods

During a three month prospective multicentre study, urine sampling for culture, POCT CRP and urinary dipstick testing were performed in each NH resident with a suspected UTI. UTIs were defined according to Stone et al. i.e. criteria based upon the presence of a set of signs/symptoms and a positive urine culture.

Results

Eleven NHs and 1 263 residents participated. Sixteen out of 137 recorded UTI suspicions were confirmed. Acute dysuria (positive likelihood ratio (LR +): 7.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.94–14.5) and acute suprapubic pain (LR +: 11.4, 95% CI: 3.58–35.9) were found to be significant predictors. The combined nitrite and leucocyte esterase urine dipstick test (one or both positive) had a 96.0% negative predictive value (95% CI: 80.5–99.3%). The sensitivity of a positive CRP test (≥ 5 mg/L) was 60.0% (95% CI: 32.3–83.7%). Antimicrobials were prescribed in 60.2% of suspected but unconfirmed UTIs and in 92.3% of confirmed UTIs.

Conclusions

Using a stringent definition, only 11.7% of our suspicions were confirmed. Besides acute dysuria and suprapubic pain, we were not able to prove that any other clinical sign/symptom or POCT CPR adds useful information to the UTI diagnosis. We confirmed the findings of earlier research that urine dipstick tests are useful in ruling out UTIs and identified a potential overuse of antimicrobials in our NH population.

### Unsatisfactory performance of flow cytometer UF-100 and urine strips in predicting outcome of urine cultures [^114G4cQo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

UF-100 flow cytometer and urine strip results were cross-interpreted to predict culture outcomes. The best negative predictive value was obtained with bacteria at ≥ 1,000/microl, white blood cells at ≥ 20/microl, or leukocyte esterase positivity. Nine of 24 false negatives were clinically significant. Thus, UF-100 and urine strip results do not accurately predict the outcome of cultures.

### Evaluation of the nitrite and leukocyte esterase activity tests for the diagnosis of acute symptomatic urinary tract infection in men [^116C12Hu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

For 422 male patients with symptoms indicative of a urinary tract infection, nitrite and leukocyte esterase activity dipstick test results were compared with results of culture of urine samples. The positive predictive value of a positive nitrite test result was 96%. Addition of results of the leukocyte esterase test did not improve the diagnostic accuracy of the nitrite test.

### Urethritis: rapid evidence review [^112bqwoy]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Urethritis refers to inflammation of the urethra and is classified as gonococcal (caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae) or nongonococcal in origin (most commonly caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, or Trichomonas vaginalis). The most common signs and symptoms include dysuria, mucopurulent urethral discharge, urethral discomfort, and erythema. Diagnostic criteria include typical signs, symptoms, or history of exposure in addition to mucopurulent discharge, Gram stain of urethral secretions showing at least two white blood cells per oil immersion field, first-void urinalysis showing at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field, or a positive leukocyte esterase result with first-void urine. First-line empiric treatment consists of ceftriaxone and doxycycline; however, the antibiotic regimen may be targeted to the isolated organism. Repeat testing is not recommended less than three weeks after treatment because false-positive results are possible during this time. Patients treated for a sexually transmitted infection should have repeat screening in three months, with shared decision-making about future screening intervals. Patients treated for urethritis should abstain from sex for seven days after the start of treatment, until their partners have been adequately treated, and until their symptoms have fully resolved.

### A negative urinalysis rules out catheter-associated urinary tract infection in trauma patients in the intensive care unit [^111191tB]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in trauma patients is associated with increased mortality. Whether the urinalysis (UA) is an adequate test for a urinary source of fever in the ICU trauma patient has not been demonstrated. We hypothesized that the UA is a valuable screen for UTI in the febrile, critically ill trauma patient.

Study Design

All trauma ICU patients in our surgical ICU who had a fever (temperature > 38.0°C), urinary catheter, UA, and a urine culture between January 1, 2011 and December 13, 2011 were reviewed. A positive UA was defined as positive leukocyte esterase, positive nitrite, WBC > 10/high power field, or presence of bacteria. A positive urine culture was defined as growth of ≥ 10⁵ colony forming units (cfu) of an organism irrespective of the UA result or ≥ 10³ cfu in the setting of a positive UA. A UTI was defined as positive urine culture without an alternative cause of the fever.

Results

There were 232 UAs from 112 patients that met criteria. The majority (75%) of patients were men; the mean age was 40 (± 16) years. Of the 232 UAs, 90 (38.7%) were positive. There were 14 UTIs. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the UA for UTI were 100%, 65.1%, 15.5%, and 100%, respectively.

Conclusions

A negative UA reliably excludes a catheter-associated UTI in the febrile, trauma ICU patient with a 100% negative predictive value, and it can rapidly direct the clinician toward more likely sources of fever and reduce unnecessary urine cultures.

### Accuracy of leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests for diagnosing bacteriuria in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115jggxv]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urine dipsticks are commonly used for the diagnosis of bacteriuria and/or urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Objectives

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of positive leukocyte esterase and/or nitrite results from dipsticks (index test) for diagnosing bacteriuria in older individuals, using urine culture as the reference standard.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (Pubmed), EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from the inception date up to April 2025. We also searched the reference lists of all the studies identified.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Both prospective observational cohort and case-control diagnostic studies were included. No language restriction was applied.

Participants

Individuals aged 60 or more with or without symptoms of UTI in the community, nursing homes or hospitalised.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

We used the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool for assessing risk of bias.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

A random-effect meta-analysis was performed to determine the pooled sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of leukocyte esterase and/or nitrites for the detection of bacteriuria. PROSPERO identifier: CRD42024561882.

Results

Of 1,933 articles screened, 16 met inclusion criteria and had moderate risk of bias. Ten studies were hospital-based; six were in nursing homes. Pooled urine dipstick sensitivity and specificity for bacteriuria were 90% (95% CI, 84–94%), and 56% (43–68%), respectively (diagnostic odds ratio [DOR] 11.4; 10.4–12.7). In symptomatic older adults, the sensitivity and specificity for predicting UTI were 92% (76–97%) and 39% (19–62%), respectively, with a DOR of 7.3 (5.2–10.3).

Discussion

A positive dipstick result is inconclusive and does not confirm bacteriuria or UTI in symptomatic older adults. Due to high asymptomatic bacteriuria prevalence in older individuals, bacteriuria alone lacks diagnostic value. These findings support discontinuing dipstick testing for UTI diagnosis in this population.

### Development, evaluation, and multisite deployment of a machine learning decision tree algorithm to optimize urinalysis parameters for predicting urine culture positivity [^1117n9TS]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

PittUDT, a recursive partitioning decision tree algorithm for predicting urine culture (UC) positivity based on macroscopic and microscopic urinalysis (UA) parameters, was developed in support of a broader system-wide diagnostic stewardship initiative to increase appropriateness of UC testing. Reflex algorithm training utilized results from 19,511 paired UA and UC cases (26.8% UC positive); the average patient age was 57.4years, and 70% of samples were from female patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified urine white blood cells (WBCs), leukocyte esterase, and bacteria as the best predictors of UC positivity, with areas under the ROC curve of 0.79, 0.78, and 0.77, respectively. Using the held-out test data set (9,773 cases; 26.3% UC positive), the PittUDT algorithm met the prespecified target of a negative predictive value above 90% and resulted in a 30 to 60% total negative proportion (true-negative plus false-negative predictions). These data show that a supervised rule-based machine learning algorithm trained on paired UA and UC data has adequate predictive ability for triaging urine specimens by identifying low-risk urine specimens, which are unlikely to grow pathogenic organisms, with a false-negative proportion under 5%. The decision tree approach also generates human-readable rules that can be easily implemented across multiple hospital sites and settings. Our work demonstrates how a data-driven approach can be used to optimize UA parameters for predicting UC positivity in a reflex protocol, with the intent of improving antimicrobial stewardship and UC utilization, a potential avenue for cost savings.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^115edraS]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection rapid tests — meta-analysis performance in children is summarized as follows: A Class II meta-analysis of 95 studies in 95,703 children aged 18 years or younger reported nitrite-only sensitivity 49% (95% CI 41% to 57%) and specificity 98% (95% CI 96% to 99%); leukocyte esterase or nitrite sensitivity 88% (95% CI 82% to 91%) and specificity 79% (95% CI 69% to 87%); urine WBC counts (> 10/μL) sensitivity 74% (95% CI 67% to 80%) and specificity 86% (95% CI 82% to 90%); unstained bacteria sensitivity 85% (95% CI 75% to 94%) and specificity 92% (95% CI 84% to 96%); and Gram's-stained bacteria sensitivity 91% (95% CI 80% to 96%) and specificity 96% (95% CI 92% to 98%). These rapid diagnostic tests were negative in about 10% of children with urinary tract infections and "cannot replace urine culture".

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^1116DtDy]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urine dipstick tests (nitrite and leukocyte esterase) — Dipstick assays detect leukocyte esterase (LE) and urinary nitrite, and bacterial conversion of dietary nitrates to nitrites requires approximately 4 hours in the bladder; because infants void frequently, a nitrite test is not sensitive and negative results have little value in ruling out urinary tract infection (UTI), although a positive nitrite is highly specific. In clinically suspected UTI, LE sensitivity is 94%, with overall reported sensitivity 83% and specificity average 72% (range: 64%–92%); positive LE results should be interpreted with caution because false-positive results are common and pyuria is nonspecific.

Accuracy of individual signs/symptoms and diagnostic tests

Factors associated with confirmed UTIs and positive urine cultures are explored in Additional file 4. The individual test performances of the signs/symptoms and diagnostic tests in diagnosing a UTI can be found in Fig. 2. Only acute dysuria and acute suprapubic pain were significant predictors of a confirmed UTI. The sensitivity and specificity of the nitrite urine dipstick test alone was 56.3% and 45.8%, respectively. The sensitivity of the leucocyte esterase test alone equalled that of the combined nitrite and leucocyte esterase test (both 93.8%), but specificity was less than 30.0% for both (Fig. 2). The combined dipstick test had a 96.0% negative predictive value (95% CI: 80.5–99.3%). In just less than half of all UTI suspicions CRP was < 5 mg/L (n = 65/131; 49.6%). The CRP value was between 5 and 49 mg/L in 38.9% of the cases (n = 51), between 50–99 mg/L in 3.05% (n = 4) and > 100 mg/L in 8.0% (n = 11). The sensitivity and specificity of a positive CRP test (≥ 5 mg/L) was 60.0% and 50.9%, respectively.

### Should the absence of urinary nitrite influence empiric antibiotics for urinary tract infection in young children? [^114FRGep]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Screening for urinary tract infection (UTI) includes urinary nitrite testing by dipstick urinalysis. Gram-negative enteric organisms produce urinary nitrite and represent the most common uropathogens. Enterococcus, a less common uropathogen, does not produce nitrite and has a unique antibiotic resistance pattern. Whether to adjust empiric antibiotics in the absence of urinary nitrite has not been established. Our primary objective was to determine prevalence of enterococcal UTI among young children with a nitrite negative urinalysis.

Methods

A retrospective study of children aged less than 2 years evaluated in the emergency department for possible UTI and had a paired urinalysis and urine culture was performed. Urinary tract infection was defined by catheterized culture yielding greater than or equal to 50,000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single uropathogen. Prevalence of uropathogens among nitrite negative samples was studied.

Results

A total of 7599 children were studied. Median (interquartile range) age was 5.6 (2.3–11.2) months, and 57% were female. Prevalence of UTI was 8.1%. Enterococcus was the uropathogen in 2.1% of UTIs, and all cases had negative dipstick nitrite. Among nitrite negative UTIs, 95.6% of uropathogens were gram-negative and only 3.2% (confidence interval, 1.8%-5.3%) were enterococcus. None of the 200 UTIs with positive nitrite yielded enterococcus (upper confidence interval, 1.4%). Among children with positive leukocyte esterase and negative nitrite, only 0.7% of cases had enterococcal UTI.

Conclusions

Only 3% of nitrite negative UTIs were caused by enterococcus. Given the low prevalence of enterococcal UTI, the absence of dipstick nitrite should not affect routine empiric antibiotic choice for presumptive UTI in young children.

### 2016 European guideline on the management of non-gonococcal urethritis [^114BDHA4]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-gonococcal urethritis, more specifically with respect to first void urine, IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a leukocyte esterase dipstick on the remains of the first void urine specimen to detect urethritis in symptomatic male patients with a negative urethral smear.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^115rWDXz]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP clinical practice guideline — Action Statement 2 (assessment and initial testing pathway): If a clinician assesses a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever as not being so ill as to require immediate antimicrobial therapy, then the clinician should assess the likelihood of UTI. If the clinician determines the febrile infant to have a low likelihood of UTI, then clinical follow-up monitoring without testing is sufficient (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). If the clinician determines that the febrile infant is not in a low-risk group, then there are 2 choices (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation): Option 1 is to obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or SPA for culture and urinalysis; Option 2 is to obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means and to perform a urinalysis, proceeding to catheterization or SPA and culture if urinalysis suggests UTI, whereas if urinalysis of fresh (less than 1 hour since void) urine yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, it is reasonable to monitor the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty. When illness severity and UTI risk are extremely low, the patient may be observed without assessing the urine, and this 2-step process (Option 2) has been shown feasible and beneficial in a pediatric emergency department, with the catheterization rate decreasing from 63% to fewer than 30% without increasing length of stay or missing UTIs.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^111SLBpi]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The growing incidence of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria poses a significant public health threat, driven heavily by inappropriate antibiotic use. Diagnostic stewardship, including tools like reflex urine culture, can help reduce unnecessary testing and subsequent unwarranted antibiotic treatments, though optimal thresholds are not well-defined. In our analysis of urinary parameters, urine microscopy WBC count demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting the presence of uropathogens.

Our study findings show that no single urinalysis parameter achieves both high sensitivity and specificity for detecting uropathogens from urine culture. However, WBC count on the microscopic portion of the urinalysis showed the best test performance with an AUC of 0.72, indicating acceptable or fair discriminative power.

Our results align with an analysis of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center healthcare system data, which assessed urinalysis parameters for diagnostic accuracy of "significant bacteriuria", a proxy definition for UTI. They found that WBC had the best diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.79), followed by leukocyte esterase (AUC = 0.78) and bacteria (AUC = 0.77). Interestingly, our AUC values were lower. Differences may stem from test ordering practice variation, with some systems performing urinalysis with urine cultures more or less discriminately, including ordering tests for patients without UTI symptoms. The bias introduced by selecting patients based on clinician-initiated urinalysis ordering, rather than on symptoms, has been shown to underestimate diagnostic accuracy and may have contributed to inter-study variability in AUC results. Another key difference is our mean population age was lower (48 versus 57 years), attributed to our inclusion of children, whereas the other study included only adults. Increased age is associated with a higher prevalence of pyuria and colonization in women, – which might contribute to test performance differences. Finally, uropathogen definition differences may explain discrepant AUC values. The previous study's outcome was > 10,000 colony forming units (CFU)/mL, whereas our definition was organisms likely to prompt clinical action.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^111c2ts7]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

We combined the nitrite and leukocyte esterase dipstick test results because studies showed that the urine dipstick test seems most useful in all populations, including older adults, to exclude the presence of infection if the results of both nitrites and leukocyte esterase are negative.

In the absence of formal cut-off values for CRP, we used the most common cut-offs, i.e. < 5 mg/L (normal range) and ≥ 5 mg/L (elevated values). In real life practice, general practitioners are most likely to apply these cut-offs that are also stated in the manufacturer's instructions. NH staff could report the CRP test result to the resident's general practitioner, but we do not know whether this was always done and if this influenced UTI management.

One study found that a serum CRP cut-off value of 60 mg/L was the best predictor for early detection of bacterial infections, including UTIs, in an older hospitalised population. The mean CRP value in their non-infection control group was however 21.3 mg/L, suggesting that ageing and frailty can increase serum inflammation protein levels. In our study, we did not explore CRP levels in residents without UTI suspicions.

We identified one similar study that explored the sensitivity of POCT CRP and procalcitonin to diagnose UTIs in Dutch NH residents. They used the same POCT device, but applied a more stringent definition of a confirmed ('true') UTI, namely a positive urine leucocyte esterase test and symptom resolution in the course of adequate antibiotic treatment (i.e. proven susceptibility of isolated uropathogens to the administered antibiotic) in addition to the presence of at least two urinary or non-specific symptoms. They registered 266 episodes of suspected UTIs (out of the targeted 440 episodes), and 19.8% of these met their definition of a 'true' UTI, a percentage slightly higher than ours (11.7%). With an empirically estimated cut-off of 6.5 mg/L, their sensitivity (57.2%, 95% CI: 48.9–65.4%) and specificity (54.4%, 95% CI: 51.8–57.0%) of POCT CRP were similar to ours (60.0% and 50.9%, respectively). Signs/symptoms triggering UTI suspicion were not reported.

### Urine specific gravity and the accuracy of urinalysis [^116hGe7J]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A recent study in young infants found that different cutoffs maximized the accuracy of the urine white blood cell count in dilute versus concentrated urine samples. We aimed to confirm this finding and to determine its impact on clinical care.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of data gathered on consecutive children < 24 months of age with visits to the emergency department during a 5-year period. We evaluated the accuracy of screening tests for urinary tract infection (UTI) in dilute and concentrated urine samples. We also calculated the number of children who would have been treated differently in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 children presenting with fever had urine specific gravity (SG) been taken into consideration.

Results

We included 10078 children. The ability to rule in UTI (as measured by the positive likelihood ratio [LR]) was similar in dilute and concentrated urine for the leukocyte esterase test (11.76 vs 10.71, respectively). The positive LR for urine white blood cell count per high-powered field was higher in dilute urine (9.83 vs 6.12). In contrast, the positive LR for the nitrite test was lower in dilute urine (20.54 vs 47.44). Despite these differences, we found little change in the number of children treated with antibiotics in predictive models that took urine SG into consideration.

Conclusions

Although we found that urine SG influences the accuracy of some components of the urinalysis, its inclusion in the decision-making process had negligible effect on the clinical care of children with UTI.

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^1145uCfe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

In asymptomatic controls, median urine leukocyte values were higher than the most commonly used cutoff value of 10 leukocytes/µL. Therefore, applying the current pyuria threshold to older women leads to misclassification of many of these women, both with and without ASB. This has several consequences. First, the true cause of the symptoms (eg, vaginal atrophy, Candida vulvovaginitis, and overactive bladder) remains unidentified and thus untreated if symptoms are wrongfully attributed to UTI. Second, it leads to overprescription of antimicrobials, contributing to gut dysbiosis, side effects, and selection of resistant pathogens. Gupta et al show that 25% of asymptomatic patients with pyuria on routine preoperative urinalysis (without urine cultures) were treated with antimicrobials, and that the degree of pyuria predicted prescribing of antimicrobials. These findings, combined with our own data, imply that separate, higher reference values are needed for older women with regard to pyuria. For instance, a threshold of 300 leukocytes/µL would be a considerable improvement, increasing specificity to avoid overtreatment while still maintaining a fair sensitivity. As in any diagnostic test, pyuria levels should be interpreted within the clinical context of individual patients and should not be the only deciding factor when diagnosing UTI. Since both older women with UTI and asymptomatic older women have a high pre-test probability of pyuria, and leukocyte esterase activity is a very rough estimate of the absolute number of leukocytes in the urine, the role of urine dipsticks in older patients should, at best, be limited to ruling out UTI. In addition to clinical implications, there are also implications for research, as misclassification influences the validity of UTI studies.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of our study include the use of a stringent UTI definition instead of urine culture as a reference standard, the consistency of results across 2 quantification methods (identical AUCs), inclusion of participants from multiple settings, and the rapid analysis of urine samples, increasing the reliability of results. Our study also has several limitations. Results may not be generalizable to institutionalized older people with high frailty and/or advanced dementia. However, our population was chosen to prove a concept for which a clear definition and reliable assessment of UTI and ASB were deemed necessary. Moreover, our control group contained a higher proportion of LTCF residents than our UTI group. Nonetheless, ADL dependency scores were similar between the UTI and control groups, and median leukocyte values within the LTCF subgroup were comparable to the values of the overall group.

### A blinded observational cohort study of the microbiological ecology associated with pyuria and overactive bladder symptoms [^116b6afN]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The relationship between infection, inflammation and the generation of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms has not been scrutinised in a prospective, controlled study, and our dismissal of an infective association for this symptom group may be compromised by deficiencies in urinalysis on which we rely heavily. Quantitative microbiological bacterial culture remains the reference gold standard in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI). However, it is now appreciated that in patients with nonacute lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), a midstream urine culture (MSU) that does not show ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU) μl⁻¹ of a single species of a known urinary pathogen does not exclude significant UTI. There is growing evidence of polymicrobial infections of the urinary tract. Traditional culture methods assume, without evidence, dominant pathogenicity from the Enterobacteriaceae species, notably E. coli, so the MSU culture is performed on selective media, favouring Enterobacteriaceae under aerobic conditions. This culture method will miss a number of potential pathogens. Microscopic counting of pyuria remains the best surrogate marker of UTI that we have. However, in some clinical settings, dipstick tests to detect leucocyte esterase have replaced leucocyte counting by fresh-urine microscopic examination, without validation. Despite this, some laboratories use dipsticks to screen urine samples; others use microscopy, only culturing urine samples that are pyuria-positive. Where microscopy is used, the delay caused by specimen transit compromises the specimen. In assessing anyone who presents with OAB, a mandatory step is the exclusion of UTI, but given the deficiencies in the tests, an OAB diagnosis may be flawed.

Studies of patients in the broader category of LUTS report increased inflammatory activity and bacterial colonisation not seen in asymptomatic controls. Bacterial strains from LUTS patients were shown to invade urothelial cell lines, whilst bacteria isolated from controls did not. It is possible that LUTS may be associated with urothelial microbial changes that stimulates an inflammatory response, generating the symptoms. OAB is an important subclass of LUTS that merits specific attention. Lunawat et al. found that in all 61 patients with OAB and pyuria but negative routine microbial culture, bladder biopsies manifested all the uroepithelial features of chronic cystitis; no features of inflammation were identified in control samples. Vijaya et al. found increased bacterial growth on culturing bladder biopsies obtained at cystoscopy from patients with OAB despite negative MSU culture.

Urinalysis parameter combinations

When WBCs, which had the highest AUC (0.722 [95% CI 0.718–0.725]) among urinalysis parameters, were combined with bacterial counts of "few" or more, the AUC was slightly lower (0.711[95% CI 0.706–0.714)). Combinations of WBCs with other microscopic parameters resulted in even lower AUCs (Table 3). Among the macroscopic parameter combinations, leukocyte esterase combined with nitrite (whether positive or negative) had an AUC of 0.695, which was identical to that of leukocyte esterase alone (AUC = 0.700 [95% CI 0.690–0.701], p = 0.08) but higher than nitrites alone (AUC = 0.627 [95% CI 0.625–0.630]), p = 0.001) (Table 3).

2.3.1 Clinical and microbiological considerations

Following the EAU guidelines on urological infections, the diagnosis of AC was made by the treating physician based on the clinical history and the typical clinical symptoms of patients referred to the clinic. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of AC underwent urinalysis and urine culture, obtaining a urine sample collected in the middle of urination. UTI–AC is defined microbiologically, according to the recommendations of the Infectious Disease Society of America, by the presence of ≥ 10⁵ CFU (colony‐forming units)/ml of a bacterial species isolated in a urine culture. In patients with the typical symptoms of UTI, a cut‐off point of ≥ 10³ CFU/ml was also accepted. Women clinically diagnosed with AC based on symptoms and with a positive urine leukocyte esterase test but without significant bacteriuria of ≥ 10³ CFU/ml in urine culture were not excluded from the study, as there is evidence that AC can occur with a low bacterial count. The results of urine analysis were usually evaluated in the midstream as the number of cells in a chamber's cell (high power field [HPF]). Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false‐positive and false‐negative results can occur. According to publications, the normal reference value for women is 0–5 white blood cells/HPF. However, it can vary depending on regulatory issues, equipment, local guidelines, clinical protocols.

### Rapid tests and urine sampling techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^115CCwfn]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common sources of infection in children under 5. In a small proportion of children UTI may lead to renal scarring. This outcome of infection is of concern as it is associated with significant future complications and ultimately with end stage renal disease. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is therefore important to reduce the risk of future scarring.

Clinical history and examination is the first step in any diagnosis and is the means of identifying children with suspected UTI. Elements of the clinical examination have also been evaluated as diagnostic tests for UTI but there is little data available on these. Urine tests are commonly used for the diagnosis of UTI.

The reference standard for the diagnosis of UTI in children is considered to be any bacterial growth on a culture of urine obtained by suprapubic aspiration. Culture has the disadvantage of taking at least 48 hours to give a result. More rapid methods of UTI diagnosis are therefore desirable. The most widely used rapid tests are dipsticks. Analytes commonly tested by dipsticks include leukocyte esterase, nitrite, blood and protein. Dipstick tests have the advantage of being quick and easy to perform and can be carried out in primary care giving an immediate result. Microscopic examination of urine samples for leukocytes or bacteria is considerably more time consuming and labour intensive than the dipstick method. However, unlike culture, it can be used to give results within the primary care setting. An uncontaminated sample is necessary to reach an accurate diagnosis. Obtaining this is a particular issue when investigating young children. Table 1 presents a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of these tests.

### Rapid detection of pyuria by leukocyte esterase activity… [^115fqDqw]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To evaluate whether leukocyte esterase activity is a useful biochemical marker of pyuria, we examined urine from 20 healthy volunteers, 47 patients with renal disease, and 399 specimens from 72 hospitalized patients with catheters. Microscopic quantification of leukocytes was compared with esterase activity in the urine. The three tests were closely correlated. The coefficients were esterase vs chamber. 85; esterase vs sediment. 74; and chamber vs sediment.
82. The chamber count and esterase test were more sensitive than the sediment in detecting pyuria. Using ten or more cells per cubic millimeter as denoting significant pyuria, the esterase test gave a sensitivity of 87. 9% and a specificity of
94. 3%. Esterase activity did not require intact cells and was not affected by urinary pH, protein, bacteriuria, underlying disease, renal function, or receipt of a variety of drugs. Kusumi RK, Grover PJ, Kunin CM.

Outcome assessment

A urine test that shows leukocyturia (more than five white blood cells per field of vision), a positive result for bacteria, nitrite, and/or leukocyte esterase, or any combination of these, is used to diagnose a urinary tract infection. Urine cultures were taken from individuals who had been diagnosed with UTIs after the results of the urinalysis were obtained and the clinical symptoms had been evaluated.

The study employed descriptive statistics to assess various subject characteristics, including age, gender, and indication for urodynamic testing. To evaluate the association between treatment groups and the occurrence of UTI, chi-square analysis was used. Data were processed using SPSS version 24, and p < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.

### Absolute and relative accuracy of rapid urine tests for urinary tract infection in children: a meta-analysis [^113uY6g7]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

Rapid urine tests, such as microscopy, for bacteria and white cells, and dipsticks, for leucocyte esterase and nitrites, are often used in children that are unwell to guide early diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection. We aimed to establish whether these tests were sufficiently sensitive to avoid urine culture in children with negative results and to compare the accuracy of dipsticks with microscopy. Medline, Embase, and reference lists were searched. Studies were included if urine culture results were compared with rapid tests in children. Data were analysed to obtain absolute and relative accuracy estimates. Data from 95 studies in 95 703 children were analysed. Summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity for microscopy for Gram-stained bacteria were 91% (95% CI 80–96) and 96% (92–98), for unstained bacteria were 88% (75–94) and 92% (84–96), for urine white cells were 74% (67–80) and 86% (82–90), for leucocyte esterase or nitrite positive dipstick were 88% (82–91) and 79% (69–87), and for nitrite-only positive dipstick were 49% (41–57) and 98% (96–99). Microscopy for bacteria with Gram stain had higher accuracy than other laboratory tests with relative diagnostic odds ratio compared with bacteria without Gram stain of 8.7 (95% CI 1.8–41.1), white cells of 14.5 (4.7–44.4), and nitrite of 22.0 (0.7–746.3). Microscopy for white cells should not be used for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection because its accuracy is no better than that of dipstick, laboratory facilities are needed, and results are delayed. Rapid tests are negative in around 10% of children with a urinary tract infection and cannot replace urine culture. If resources allow, microscopy with Gram stain should be the single rapid test used.

Evidence base and diagnostic performance for urinalysis components: Searches included January 2003 through recent search dates of February 6, 2015 and March 13, 2015, identifying four hundred ninety-two articles; one hundred nine were selected for further review, with 10 studies included for this critical question, consisting of 2 Class II and 8 Class III studies including infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years. In a subset of the Pediatric Research in Office Settings febrile infant study of 38,066 infants aged 0 to 3 months with a fever (≥ 38°C [100.4°F]), urinary tract infection was defined as pure growth of a single pathogen with ≥ 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL for bag samples and ≥ 10,000 CFU/mL for catheterization samples; of the 1,482 infants who had urinalysis and urine cultures, 1,384 specimens were bag or catheterization, and for all specimens nitrites had better specificity (99% nitrites versus 91% leukocyte esterase).

### Diagnostic and treatment difficulties of pyelonephritis in pregnancy in resource-limited settings [^1132d69D]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Pyelonephritis is essentially a clinical diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity of leukocyte esterase and nitrites in this cohort are in agreement with a meta-analysis that found sensitivity and specificity of nitrites were around 50% and 95%, whereas leukocyte esterase was highly variable, with a sensitivity of 50–60% and a lower specificity than nitrites. It has been suggested that nitrites alone indicate the need for further urine testing and could be used to initiate treatment, which would overtreat a large percentage of patients in this setting. Urine sediment microscopy proved more sensitive than urine dipsticks for diagnosis of pyelonephritis. A WBC count of ≥ 7/HPF in the presence of bacteria and with epithelial cell count < 5/HPF predicted a positive urine culture with the highest sensitivity, but this was not as specific as WBC count of ≥ 10/HPF or the presence of leukocytes and nitrites on urine dipstick. In areas where microscopy is practiced routinely to diagnose malaria and microbiological facilities are not available, the urine sediment is likely to provide a cheap alternative for urine examination. Cut-offs are best confirmed with microbiological support, but this could be done as a survey. Known limitations of the dipstick nitrite test in diagnosing bacteriuria include infection with non–nitrite-producing pathogens and insufficient time since the last void for nitrites to appear at detectable levels (ideally, at least 4 hours); in this setting, another limitation is possibly a lack of dietary nitrate.

### The urine dipstick test useful to rule out infections. A meta-analysis of the accuracy [^117R7Uff]. BMC Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Many studies have evaluated the accuracy of dipstick tests as rapid detectors of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections (UTI). The lack of an adequate explanation for the heterogeneity of the dipstick accuracy stimulates an ongoing debate. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to summarise the available evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of the urine dipstick test, taking into account various pre-defined potential sources of heterogeneity.

Methods

Literature from 1990 through 1999 was searched in Medline and Embase, and by reference tracking. Selected publications should be concerned with the diagnosis of bacteriuria or urinary tract infections, investigate the use of dipstick tests for nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase, and present empirical data. A checklist was used to assess methodological quality.

Results

70 publications were included. Accuracy of nitrites was high in pregnant women (Diagnostic Odds Ratio = 165) and elderly people (DOR = 108). Positive predictive values were ≥ 80% in elderly and in family medicine. Accuracy of leukocyte-esterase was high in studies in urology patients (DOR = 276). Sensitivities were highest in family medicine (86%). Negative predictive values were high in both tests in all patient groups and settings, except for in family medicine. The combination of both test results showed an important increase in sensitivity. Accuracy was high in studies in urology patients (DOR = 52), in children (DOR = 46), and if clinical information was present (DOR = 28). Sensitivity was highest in studies carried out in family medicine (90%). Predictive values of combinations of positive test results were low in all other situations.

Conclusions

Overall, this review demonstrates that the urine dipstick test alone seems to be useful in all populations to exclude the presence of infection if the results of both nitrites and leukocyte-esterase are negative. Sensitivities of the combination of both tests vary between 68 and 88% in different patient groups, but positive test results have to be confirmed. Although the combination of positive test results is very sensitive in family practice, the usefulness of the dipstick test alone to rule in infection remains doubtful, even with high pre-test probabilities.

The unexplored potential of longitudinal monitoring of drug exposure, host-response, and infection biomarkers in urine

Dipstick tests are frequently used to detect biomarkers qualitatively to support UTI diagnosis. Below, we categorise biomarkers frequently used in dipstick tests, and recently described as promising for UTI diagnosis, into host-response and bacteria-specific biomarkers. The detected ranges of these biomarkers are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Biomarker levels in non UTI and UTI patients

Reported ranges of commonly used biomarkers for UTI diagnosis.

LE Leucocyte esterase, XO Xanthine Oxidase, MPO Myeloperoxidase.

Despite the development of quantitative point-of-care technologies for nitrite, leucocyte esterase(LE), xanthine oxidase (XO)and myeloperoxidase (MPO)in urine, these biomarkers are frequently reported in a yes or no fashion. The sensitivity and specificity of XO and MPO for diagnosing UTIs show promising diagnostic values (100% and 87% sensitivity for XO and MPO, 100% specificity for both). Sensitivity and specificity of a positive nitrite and LE test vary depending on UTI prevalence and the bacterial count threshold used to define a UTI. Sensitivities in different studies range from 36–57% for nitrite and 72–95% for LE, and specificities 78–98% for nitrite and 9–59% for LE.

Few studies have evaluated biomarker concentration at more than one time point during UTI, and the possibility of using quantitative measurements serially to estimate PD remains unexplored (Fig. 1). Longitudinal, quantitative monitoring of biomarkers in UTI using point-of-care technologies, alongside drug measurement, could facilitate novel approaches to real-time PK-PD monitoring and individualised antimicrobial dosing (Fig. 2).

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^111ta799]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Microbiological Assessments

The remaining urine in the sterile container was used for bacteriological culture at the microbiology department. For all included patients with UTI and control patients, 10 µL of noncentrifuged urine was placed on routine culture media and incubated for 1 day. A culture result was deemed positive in case of growth of 10⁴ CFU/mL or more and defined as a monoculture if 90% or more of the cultured colonies were of 1 microorganism.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 27.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Data are presented as percentages, means with standard deviations, or medians with interquartile ranges, as appropriate. A Mann–Whitney U test was performed to compare leukocyte medians between patients with UTI and controls. As a pyuria threshold for UTI in older women is not known, sensitivity–specificity pairs with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all possible cutoffs and plotted in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using GraphPad Prism version 9.3.1 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to determine the discriminative ability of the index tests (automated microscopy and urine flowcytometry). Youden's index was used to determine the cutoff value with the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. In a fraction of UTI cases, automated microscopy results were missing (eg, only semiquantitative results were available [leukocyte esterase or leukocytes/hpf]). The impact of missing automated microscopy results on estimates of accuracy was evaluated by a sensitivity analysis consisting of best- and worst-case scenarios (all missing pyuria results were either considered true positive and negative or false positive and negative, respectively). Twenty-seven patients presenting with LUTSs were not included in the primary analysis because they did not meet the urine culture criteria for the UTI group. Their urine leukocyte counts were evaluated separately, in the secondary analysis.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^112KNEot]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinalysis with reflex-to-culture algorithms — pyuria thresholds and exceptions indicate there is no single laboratory parameter or combination of parameters that can sufficiently predict whether the patient has a urinary tract infection or if bacteria will be recovered in culture, and that pyuria alone is likely the best marker in terms of negative predictive value, with leukocyte esterase or white blood cells (WBCs) increasing the likelihood of a positive culture, although detection methods have not been standardized. Although > 10 WBCs per low power field is a commonly adopted threshold for a urinalysis with reflex to culture (UARC) algorithm, this threshold cannot be effectively applied to all patient groups, and exceptions are recommended for patients who are pregnant and for patients with urologic abnormalities or undergoing urologic procedures. Laboratory algorithms should take into account local patient populations and should be guided by both clinicians and laboratorians, and in older adults with mental status changes or other signs classically localizing UTI symptoms, bacteriuria may be unrelated and a thoughtful approach should be taken before interpretations are made.

### Pyuria and urine cultures in patients with acute renal colic [^114tAsph]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Renal colic caused by stone(s) is common in the emergency department. Often, urinalysis reveals white blood cells, but it is unknown how frequently pyuria is sterile or infectious.

Objectives

We sought to determine the incidence of pyuria in patients with renal colic and to correlate the incidence with a positive urine culture.

Methods

A 1-year retrospective review of adult patients with renal colic presenting to three community emergency departments was performed. Patients without confirmed renal stone(s) or completed urinalysis were excluded. Hematuria is defined as ≥ 5 red blood cells per high power field (RBC/HPF) and pyuria as > 10 white blood cells per high power field (WBC/HPF). A positive urine culture is defined as > 100,000 colony forming units per milliliter. Student's t-test, chi square, or Fisher's exact tests were performed as appropriate, with significance set at 0.05.

Results

There were 339 patients who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 14.2% of these patients had associated pyuria. There were 153 (45.1%) urine cultures performed, and 16 (10.5%) were positive. Patients with pyuria were more likely to have a positive urine culture (36.4% vs. 3.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). The percentage of positive urine cultures increased (p < 0.001) with increasing pyuria from 9.1% (10–20 WBC/HPF) to 60.0% (> 50 WBC/HPF). Positive cultures also increased (p < 0.001) with increased leukocyte esterase observed on macroscopic samples, from 1.6% (small or less leukocyte esterase) to 77.8% (large-volume leukocyte esterase).

Conclusion

Pyuria was found in 14.2% of patients with renal colic. Patients with pyuria had 36.4% positive cultures compared to 3.3% of patients without pyuria. The degree of pyuria or leukocyte esterase was significantly associated with the risk of a positive culture. Urine cultures are recommended for all patients with renal colic and pyuria.

This was an ancillary study within a trial comparing single-day with 7-day therapy in treating asymptomatic bacteriuria. Clean-catch midstream samples were collected from pregnant women seeking routine care. Positive and negative likelihood ratios and sensitivity and specificity for the culture-based dipslide to detect and chemical dipsticks (nitrites, leukocyte esterase, or both) to screen were estimated using traditional urine culture as the "gold standard".

Results

A total of 3,048 eligible pregnant women were screened. The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria was 15%, with Escherichia coli the most prevalent organism. The likelihood ratio for detecting asymptomatic bacteriuria with a positive dipslide test was 225 (95% confidence interval [CI] 113–449), increasing the probability of asymptomatic bacteriuria to 98%; the likelihood ratio for a negative dipslide test was 0.02 (95% CI 0.01–0.05), reducing the probability of bacteriuria to less than 1%. The positive likelihood ratio of leukocyte esterase and nitrite dipsticks (when both or either one was positive) was 6.95 (95% CI 5.80–8.33), increasing the probability of bacteriuria to only 54%; the negative likelihood ratio was 0.50 (95% CI 0.45–0.57), reducing the probability to 8%.

Conclusion

A pregnant woman with a positive dipslide test is very likely to have a definitive diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria, whereas a negative result effectively rules out the presence of bacteriuria. Dipsticks that measure nitrites and leukocyte esterase have low sensitivity for use in screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during gestation.

### Office-based urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^113jyM3S]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive urinalysis involves inspection of the urine, dipstick chemical analysis, and microscopy and can be performed in the office setting. When testing for urinary tract infection, midstream urine should be collected using the clean-catch technique. A urine collection bag specimen can be used for clinically stable febrile infants with suspected urinary tract infection; however, the presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrites warrants more invasive urine collection. Urine specific gravity shows hydration status. Urinary pH levels can indicate diet, metabolism, or the presence of stones. Bilirubin and urobilinogen may suggest hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis. Glucosuria often indicates uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and ketones suggest illness and inadequate nutrition. Hematuria on dipstick testing can be confirmed in the office using a spun urine sample. Proteinuria on dipstick testing should be followed by a quantitative test such as a spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio. In patients with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, the presence of nitrites is more specific for bacterial infection, and a positive leukocyte esterase result may occur from inflammation and infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is often unnecessarily treated in older patients. Without symptoms of urinary tract infection, urine culture is useful only in pregnancy and preparation for endoscopic urologic procedures.

### The use of urinary dipstick tests to exclude urinary tract infection: a systematic review of the literature [^1161SvQk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Several systematic reviews have examined the use of dipstick tests to diagnose or rule in urinary tract infection (UTI). We examined the evidence relating to the use of urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests in adults to exclude or rule out UTI. A search of the literature from 1966 to 2003 revealed 30 studies as containing relevant and suitable information and 23 of these, which used a cut-off of 108 colony-forming units per liter, were combined in a meta-analysis. The leukocyte esterase or nitrite test combination, with one or the other test positive, was used in 14 studies, showed the highest sensitivity and the lowest negative likelihood ratio. While there was significant heterogeneity between the studies, 7 of 14 demonstrated significant decreases in pretest to posttest probability with a pooled posttest probability of 5% for the negative result. In certain circumstances, there is evidence for the use of urinalysis as a rule-out test for UTI.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116Lq8ka]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Future directions for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — the guideline highlights that A better understanding of rUTI pathophysiology will greatly aid in our ability to design more effective, mechanistically-based treatments, that Relying on results from the urinary dipstick test, including leukocyte esterase and nitrate, lacks the necessary level of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic accuracy, and that Currently, there are no symptoms that are definitively predictive of acute cystitis, and no good quality evidence that can support a specific pathogen. It states Urine culture results or any other current methods of bacterial detection do not reflect any aspect of the host response and calls for defining initiatives for algorithms to predict treatment and partnering with our primary care colleagues and patients to provide education regarding rUTI definitions, evaluation, and treatment. It notes Advanced molecular technologies give a more complete characterization of genitourinary microbes and that PCR and NGS-based diagnostic tests have some enticing preliminary studies suggesting their utilization may facilitate equivalent or even better clinical outcomes than standard urine culture while decreasing the time to diagnosis and reducing empiric antibiotic prescriptions, while cautioning These early studies, however, are complicated by some methodological limitations and a high risk of bias and More data are needed before identifying what role these tests play in UTI diagnostics.

### The leukocyte esterase test strip is a poor rule-out test for periprosthetic joint infection [^1146X2fF]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The urinary leukocyte esterase (LE) test strip has been suggested as a good screening test for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic profile of LE assays from different manufacturers and determine whether the LE test strip is a good rule-out test.

Methods

Synovial fluid samples (N = 344), sent to 1 laboratory for PJI testing, were used in this prospective study. Four different tests for synovial fluid LE were simultaneously evaluated for their performance in detecting white blood cell (WBC) positive samples (> 3000 cells/µL).

Results

Both neutrophil elastase immunoassays demonstrated greater sensitivity than urinary LE test strips (92.0% and 90.8% vs 72.4% and 80.3%; all P < 0.011). Fifty-three percent of false-negative urinary LE test strip results clearly missed the presence of elevated levels of synovial fluid LE. Invalid urinary LE test strip results were 4-fold more likely among WBC (+) compared with WBC (-) samples (27.0% vs 6.8%; P < 0.0001). The combined failure to detect an elevated WBC count, because of either false-negative or invalid results, was 47.1% and 41.4% for the Roche and Siemens test strips, respectively.

Conclusions

This study agrees with the existing literature demonstrating that the LE test strips are among the lowest sensitivity tests for PJI. The urinary LE tests strips should not be used to rule-out PJI, as they often fail to detect abundant levels of LE in synovial fluid. Instead, it is more appropriate to use the (++) LE test strip result as a secondary confirmatory rule-in test for PJI because of its high specificity.

### Can a simple urinalysis predict the causative agent and the antibiotic sensitivities? [^111dDjxv]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was (1) to determine the reliability of urinalysis (UA) for predicting urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile children, (2) to determine whether UA findings can predict Escherichia coli versus non-E. coli urinary tract infection, and (3) to determine if empiric antibiotics should be selected based on E. coli versus non-E. coli infection predictions.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of children from 2 months to 2 years of age who presented to the emergency department with fever (rectal temperature > 100.4°F) and had a positive urine culture. This study was conducted between January 2004 and December 2007. Negative UA was defined as urine white blood cell count less than 5 per high-power field, negative leukocyte esterase, and negative nitrites. Urine cultures were classified into E. coli and non-E. coli groups. These groups were compared for sex, race, and UA findings. Multivariate forward logistic regression, using the Wald test, was performed to calculate the likelihood ratio (LR) of each variable (eg, sex, race, UA parameters) in predicting UTI. In addition, antibiotic sensitivities between both groups were compared.

Results

Of 749 medical records reviewed, 608 were included; negative UA(-) was present in 183 cases, and positive UA(+) was observed in 425 cases. Furthermore, 424 cases were caused by E. coli, and 184 were due to non-E. coli organisms. Among 425 UA(+) cases, E. coli was identified in 349 (82.1%), whereas non-E. coli organisms were present in 76 (17.9%); in contrast, in 183 UA(-) cases, 108 (59%) were due to non-E. coli organisms versus 75 (41%), which were caused by E. coli. Urinalysis results were shown to be associated with organism group (P < 0.001). Positive leukocytes esterase had an LR of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–4.2), positive nitrites had an LR of 2.8 (95% CI, 1.4–5.5), and urine white blood cell count had an LR of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.4) in predicting E. coli versus non-E. coli infections. Antibiotic sensitivity compared between UA groups demonstrated equivalent superiority of cefazolin (94.7% sensitive in UA(+) vs 84.0% in UA(-) group; P < 0.0001), cefuroxime (98.2% vs 91.7%; P < 0.001), and nitrofurantoin (96.1% vs 82.2%; P < 0.0001) in the UA(+) group. In contrast, the UA(-) group showed significant sensitivity to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (82.2% vs 71.3% in UA(+); P = 0.008).

Conclusions

Urinalysis is not an accurate predictor of UTI. A positive urine culture in the presence of negative UA most likely grew non-E. coli organisms, whereas most UA(+) results were associated with E. coli. This study also highlighted local patterns of antibiotic resistance between E. coli and non-E. coli groups. Negative UA results in the presence of strong suspicion of a UTI suggest a non-E. coli organism, which may be best treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Conversely, UA(+) results suggest E. coli, which calls for treatment with cefazolin or cefuroxime.

### Urinary interleukin-8 with asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^1149QMsN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate urinary interleukin-8 (IL-8), an inflammatory cytokine, as a screening method for detecting asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

Methods

Clean-catch urine samples from 200 pregnant women undergoing screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria were evaluated by urine culture, urine dipstick analysis, and measurement of IL-8. Interleukin-8 levels were measured by a chemiluminescent immunoassay (Immulite IL-8, Diagnostic Products Corp, Los Angeles, CA), and a receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the optimal cutoff point. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was defined as at least 100,000 colony-forming units of a single organism per mL. Dipstick testing included nitrite assessment as positive or negative and leukocyte esterase as negative, trace, 1+, 2+, or 3+. Dipstick testing was considered positive if nitrite was positive or leukocyte esterase was trace or greater. Sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values were determined for urinary leukocyte esterase and nitrite and compared with those of IL-8. chi(2) and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for statistical analyses.

Results

Twenty women were identified with asymptomatic bacteriuria by urine culture. The median urinary IL-8 levels for women with and without asymptomatic bacteriuria were 356 pg/mL and 125 pg/mL, respectively (P < .01, Mann-Whitney U test). Using an optimal cutoff point of 264 pg/mL, IL-8 had a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 70%, 67%, 19%, and 95% for predicting asymptomatic bacteriuria. Urine dipstick analysis with either a positive leukocyte esterase or nitrite had a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 45%, 62%, 12%, and 91%, respectively, for detecting asymptomatic bacteriuria. The differences between these testing methods were not statistically significant.

Conclusion

Urinary interleukin-8 is not an acceptable screening method for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy because it fails to detect 30% of women with this condition.

### Serologic and urinary characteristics of laboratory-confirmed genitourinary tuberculosis at a tertiary hospital in the Philippines [^111jda7H]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary findings were defined as: (1) acidic urine as urine pH ≤ 5.5, (2) low specific gravity as urine specific gravity ≤ 1.010, (3) hematuria as three or more erythrocytes per high-power field, (4) proteinuria as detection of proteinuria by dipstick examination, and (5) pyuria as detection of more than 5 white blood cells per high-power field in urine microscopy or positive leukocyte esterase dipstick testing.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were used in the analysis of this study. Frequency and percentage were used to describe categorical variables and proportions of patients who improved, expired, or developed short-term outcomes such as the need for pressors or renal replacement therapy. Continuous variables were expressed as median.

Associations were determined by bivariate analysis using Fisher's exact test for characteristics involving 2 categories or Chi-square test for those with > 2 categories. Mean lengths of hospital stay between those with and without the identified clinical, serologic, and urinary characteristics were compared using Mann–Whitney U-test for characteristics involving 2 categories or Kruskal–Wallis test for those with > 2 categories. For all tests, p value of at most 0.05 indicate significance.

### A new highly sensitive point of care screen for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis using the leukocyte esterase method [^115EyEnw]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Urine reagent strips measuring leukocyte esterase activity have been studied to screen spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) but are insensitive. We calibrated a strip specifically for ascitic fluid to achieve high sensitivity in this diagnosis.

Methods

Experiments were conducted on ascitic fluid from patients with cirrhosis. Samples with SBP were diluted with native acellular ascitic fluid to achieve PMN counts below, above, and close to the diagnostic threshold of 250 PMN/microl. A model of SBP was created by spiking negative ascitic fluid samples (< 250 PMN/microl) with activated PMN from blood of patients with sepsis, and diluted to achieve a range of PMN. Aliquots were tested at 2, 3, 4, and 10 min with the Periscreen leukocyte esterase strip. PMN/microl was correlated to timings and color scales: white defined negative (PMN < 250/microl); and shades of brown, purple, and pink defined positive. Ascitic fluid samples were obtained from 58 patients. Negative ascitic fluid was used from 32 to generate the model SBP.

Results

One thousand three hundred and four experiments were performed with a median PMN count of 492/microl (0–7510). After exclusion of uninterpretable colorimetric results, 1089 experiments were analyzed [PMN of 444/microl (0–7510)]. The best result was obtained at 3 min (n = 299), with Se: 100%, Sp: 57.9%; NPV: 100%, PPV: 76.5%. The test was not interpretable in bloody, chylous or bilious ascitic fluid, or concurrent imipenem treatment.

Conclusions

This new leukocyte esterase strip calibrated to an ascitic fluid PMN count 250/microl is a robust screening tool when the strip turns any hue of tan/brown at 3 min.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women? [^112humPF]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Performance of urine dipstick

We collected the results of a total of 417 urine dipsticks (91.4%) performed in the emergency department, including 66 for the UTI group (95.6%) and 351 for the control group (90.7%). Urine dipsticks were considered negative if leukocyte esterase and nitrite were negative (AUC = 0.7405 [0.706–0.775]) and positive otherwise (Table S5). Sensitivity of urine dipstick for UTI (95.45% [87.47–98.44]) was lower than the sensitivity of UBC threshold of 150 bacteria/µL (98.48% [91.90–99.79]) (p < 0.01) but similar to the sensitivity of the U-WBC threshold of 50 leukocytes (95.45% [87.47–98.44]) (p < 0.99). However, specificity was higher for both the UBC threshold of 150 bacteria/µL (67.81% [62.75–72.48]) and the U-WBC threshold of 50 leukocytes (70.66% [65.69–75.17]) compared to the specificity of the urine dipstick (57.83% [52.61–62.89]) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). The LR- was < 0.1 for all test methods. Urine dipstick in patients with at least one major symptom had a sensitivity of 91.43% [77.62–97.04], a specificity of 73.08% [53.92–86.30], a LR- of 0.117 [0.059–0.234] and a LR + of 3.396 [2.55–4.42].

### The importance of urine concentration on the diagnostic performance of the urinalysis for pediatric urinary tract infection [^111zuXw3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The presence of leukocyte esterase by urine dipstick and microscopic pyuria are both indicators of possible urinary tract infection. The effect of urine concentration on the diagnostic performance of the urinalysis for pediatric urinary tract infection has not been studied. Our objective is to determine whether the urinalysis performance for detecting urinary tract infection varies by urine concentration as measured by specific gravity.

Methods

This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of the urine laboratory results of children younger than 13 years who presented to the emergency department during 68 months and had a paired urinalysis and urine culture obtained. Urinary tract infection was defined as pure growth of a uropathogen at standard culture thresholds. Test characteristics were calculated across 4 specific gravity groups (1.000 to 1.010, 1.011 to 1.020, 1.021 to 1.030, and > 1.030).

Results

In total, 14,971 cases were studied. Median age was 1.5 years (interquartile range 0.4 to 5.5 years) and 60% were female patients. Prevalence of urinary tract infection was 7.7%. For the presence of leukocyte esterase and a range of pyuria cut points, the positive likelihood ratios decreased with increasing specific gravity. From most dilute to most concentrated urine, the positive likelihood ratio decreased from 12.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.7 to 13.7) to 4.2 (95% CI 3.0 to 5.8) and 9.5 (95% CI 8.6 to 10.6) to 5.5 (95% CI 3.3 to 9.1) at a threshold of greater than or equal to 5 WBCs per high-power field and presence of leukocyte esterase, respectively. The negative likelihood ratios increased with increasing specific gravity for leukocyte esterase and microscopic pyuria.

Conclusion

For the detection of pediatric urinary tract infection, the diagnostic performance of both dipstick leukocyte esterase and microscopic pyuria varies by urine concentration, and therefore the specific gravity should be considered when the urinalysis is interpreted.

### Urine lipoarabinomannan glycan in HIV-negative patients with pulmonary tuberculosis correlates with disease severity [^114aY6iT]. Science Translational Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the area under the curvewas calculated to be 0.95 (95% CI, 0.9005 to 0.9957; fig. S11) as an overallROCperformance [n = 48 cases, n = 53 controls; significance level, 0.05; power, 1]. At a threshold of 14 pg/ml, this ROC analysis yielded a sensitivity of 0.96 and a specificity of 0.81 for true-positive pulmonary TB patients in the present study set (positive predictive value, 0.82; negative predicted value, 0.95; power, 0.96) (Fig. 3C). By these criteria, the single false-positive urine in the diseased controlswas patient #234, whose urinalysis had +++ leukocyte esterase, +++ protein, +++ blood, and + bilirubin (table S3). These urinalysis values would meet the exclusion criteria for clinical urine diagnostic testing. Notably, eight of the nine culture-positive but smear-negative patients were positive for urinary LAM.

Dipstick tests

A total of 39 studies reporting 107 data sets evaluated dipstick tests for the diagnosis of UTI. These studies assessed the utility of dipstick tests for nitrite, leukocyte esterase (LE), protein, glucose and blood, alone and in combination. Table 2 summarises the results of these studies.

Table 2
Summary of results for studies of dipstick tests

* There was significant heterogeneity in all pooled estimates therefore these should be interpreted with caution

Figure 3 shows the estimates of sensitivity and 1-specificity plotted in ROC space for glucose, and dipstick tests for nitrite and LE, alone and in combination. This graph suggests that glucose is considerably better than the other tests, both for ruling in and ruling out disease, this is supported by the pooled likelihood ratios. However, the confidence intervals around the pooled likelihood ratios are very large, especially for the negative likelihood ratios (ruling out disease), suggesting considerable uncertainty in these estimates. It should also be noted that very few studies of glucose tests were available and that they were all conducted over 30 years ago and the test used ("Uriglox") is no longer commercially available.

### The α-defensin test for periprosthetic joint infection outperforms the leukocyte esterase test strip [^112Ljp3F]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

The LER test was developed for and cleared regulatory approval for urinalysis, and its performance and interpretation are predicated on the assumption that urine is being tested. The high viscosity and varied chemical properties of synovial fluid do not parallel urine, so it remains unclear whether the subjective interpretations made by the trained personnel in the larger academic studies described would be translated to all surgeons when using synovial fluid. Second, because the LER test pad causes lysis of leukocytes, the LER test is not measuring secreted esterase activity, but instead is measuring total intracellular and extracellular activity, essentially acting as a proxy to the leukocyte count. Therefore, if the LER test is performing in synovial fluid as intended to perform in urine, the diagnostic characteristics of the test should be reasonably equivalent, but not superior, to those of a synovial fluid leukocyte count. It must also be noted that the LER test carries a warning of potential interference from elevated protein, elevated glucose, and several antibiotics, which may be present in synovial fluid.

The α-defensin test used in this study is based on an immunoassay platform, which is a common technology currently used in medicine. The α-defensin immunoassay was developed and optimized specifically for use in synovial fluid, minimizing any potential chemical and viscosity effects as a result of variations in synovial fluid. Finally, the α-defensin immunoassay only measures extracellular levels of α-defensin, potentially avoiding falsely elevated results from elevated white blood cell counts in the setting of aseptic disease.

This study benefited from consistent application of the MSIS definition of PJI in the classification of all patients and from the inclusion even of patients with potentially confounding conditions (such as systemic inflammatory diseases and antibiotic treatment), which we believe increases the generalizability of our findings to routine clinical practice. We found that the α-defensin immunoassay outperformed the LE colorimetric tests strip in this study and provided reliable results even when the LE test strip failed as a result of blood interference. The simple analytic results provided by the α-defensin immunoassay when compared with the more complex and interpretive nature of both the MSIS criteria and LE colorimetric test strip make it a highly attractive diagnostic tool for clinical use.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, evaluation, AAP 2016 guidelines recommend to assess the likelihood of UTI in a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever if immediate antimicrobial therapy is not required, to guide further decisions:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Low risk|- Obtain clinical follow-up monitoring only without testing|
|Non-low risk, first option|- Obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture and urinalysis|
|Non-low risk, second option|- Obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means for urinalysis <br/> - Obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture if urinalysis results suggest a UTI (positive leukocyte esterase test results, nitrite test, or microscopic analysis results for leukocytes or bacteria) <br/> - Consider monitoring the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy if urinalysis of fresh urine (less than 1 hour since void) yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty.|

### Urinary tract infections in older women: a clinical review [^114AHHdU]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in older women are commonly encountered in outpatient practice.

Objective

To review management of asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic UTI and review prevention of recurrent UTIs in older community-dwelling women.

Evidence Review

A search of Ovid (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase) for English-language human studies conducted among adults aged 65 years and older and published in peer-reviewed journals from 1946 to November 20, 2013.

Results

The clinical spectrum of UTIs ranges from asymptomatic bacteriuria, to symptomatic and recurrent UTIs, to sepsis associated with UTI requiring hospitalization. Recent evidence helps differentiate asymptomatic bacteriuria from symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is transient in older women, often resolves without any treatment, and is not associated with morbidity or mortality. The diagnosis of symptomatic UTI is made when a patient has both clinical features and laboratory evidence of a urinary infection. Absent other causes, patients presenting with any 2 of the following meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for symptomatic UTI: fever, worsened urinary urgency or frequency, acute dysuria, suprapubic tenderness, or costovertebral angle pain or tenderness. A positive urine culture (≥ 105 CFU/mL) with no more than 2 uropathogens and pyuria confirms the diagnosis of UTI. Risk factors for recurrent symptomatic UTI include diabetes, functional disability, recent sexual intercourse, prior history of urogynecologic surgery, urinary retention, and urinary incontinence. Testing for UTI is easily performed in the clinic using dipstick tests. When there is a low pretest probability of UTI, a negative dipstick result for leukocyte esterase and nitrites excludes infection. Antibiotics are selected by identifying the uropathogen, knowing local resistance rates, and considering adverse effect profiles. Chronic suppressive antibiotics for 6 to 12 months and vaginal estrogen therapy effectively reduce symptomatic UTI episodes and should be considered in patients with recurrent UTIs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Establishing a diagnosis of symptomatic UTI in older women requires careful clinical evaluation with possible laboratory assessment using urinalysis and urine culture. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should be differentiated from symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older women should not be treated.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^111qMvi2]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline — diagnostic thresholds and pyuria: For urine obtained by catheterization, 50 000 cfu/ml was proposed as the appropriate threshold; lower colony counts are sufficient if obtained by SPA, and most (80%) cases of UTI documented with urine obtained by SPA have 10⁵ cfu/ mL or more. Colony counts lower than 50 000 cfu/mL are currently being considered for the diagnosis of UTI if 10 000 cfu/ml is coupled with symptoms (eg, fever) and evidence of inflammation (pyuria), and significant pyuria is ≥ 10 white blood cells/mm3 on an "enhanced urinalysis" or ≥ 5 white blood cells per high power field on a centrifuged specimen of urine or any leukocyte esterase on a dipstick.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^113vD2ya]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is the leading reason why patients seek treatment in primary care. One in three women will be treated with antibiotics for UTI by the age of 24 and 40% to 50% of women will experience one or more UTIs in their lifetime, with 10–15% experiencing recurrent infections. A UTI is commonly identified among young adolescents attending sexual health centres and accounts for 17% of treatment cases. In the adult population of 65 years and older, a UTI is the second most common cause of infectious disease related to hospitalisations in the USA. A UTI is a debilitating condition causing the onset of painful urination (dysuria), increased urinary frequency, the inability to start urinating (hesitancy) and the sensation of a sudden need to urinate (urgency), all of which are classified as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Many clinical guidelines advocate urinary dipstick testing for leucocyte esterase and nitrite as a means of detecting UTI, but evidence suggests that their utility might be limited. Dipstick analyses are surrogate tests, referenced not to microscopic pyuria but to a gold standard urine culture threshold for UTI, which guidelines accept as being between 10³ cfu mL⁻¹ and 10⁶ cfu mL⁻¹ of the pure growth of a single urinary pathogen. This test has attracted criticism too. Furthermore, the literature shows that the methods of sample collection for urine culture have never been validated in appropriate clinical trials. Justification for the use of such methods is based on plausible assumptions without supporting evidence. It is now recognised that routine urinalyses, including dipstick and culture, are insensitive, thus missing genuine infection in many symptomatic patients.

### Urinalysis findings and urinary kidney injury biomarker concentrations [^117GgmrA]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this post-hoc analysis of a subcohort of a large, multicenter prospective cohort study of cardiac surgery patients without creatinine-based acute kidney injury, we did not find evidence of association between either pre- or postoperative biomarker levels and age or sex. However, there were significant differences in biomarker levels associated with urine dipstick findings, including proteinuria, hematuria, leukocyte esterase and nitrites.

All biomarkers were mildly correlated with hematuria, indicating that blood might interfere with biomarker levels or their measurement even in the absence of overt kidney injury evidenced by creatinine rise. Preexisting substances in the urine interfering with assays for novel analytes has been previously described.

We found evidence that proteinuria is associated with all four biomarkers both pre- and post-operatively. Dipstick proteinuria is a marker of preexisting kidney damage and is associated with both the incidence and outcomes of acute kidney injury. In addition, there is evidence that proteinuria may represent subclinical or early acute tubular necrosis, which has not yet manifested as a rise in creatinine. Thus, the part of the correlation we observed between proteinuria and biomarker levels may be the association between proteinuria and subclinical kidney injury. When we adjusted for measures of discrimination of AKI for urine protein, all of the pre-op AUCs diminished and 2 of the 4 post-operative AUCs diminished. Since dipstick proteinuria is a readily available and inexpensive test, future studies should assess the impact of accounting for dipstick proteinuria in evaluating the predictive and diagnostic performance of novel biomarkers.

We also found evidence of an association between NGAL levels and leukocyte esterase/nitrites. Urinary NGAL has been previously shown to be elevated in patients with septic shock. This is especially important, since critically ill patients, in whom novel biomarkers could potentially be deployed for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, have high rates of urinary tract infections or may have leukocyturia/urine nitrites secondary to urinary catheters. This may lead to false positive AKI diagnosis in patients with no kidney injury but leukocyturia/urinary nitrites. Although, currently the mainstay of AKI management is supportive, if future therapies for AKI develop, misdiagnosis may expose patients with no kidney injury to unnecessary risk of a novel therapy.

Our study has several limitations. Since our study population was predominantly white, we could not assess racial differences in biomarker levels. In addition, we did not have urine sediment or histology to discern acute tubular necrosis in absence of serum creatinine rise and for correlation with biomarker levels. Thus, there may have been underlying subclinical injury that resulted in the correlations between the dipstick findings and the biomarkers levels.

Among 101 nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infection (UTI), we determined the negative predictive value of dipstick testing for leukocyte esterase and nitrite to be 100% (95% confidence interval, 74%-100%), compared with laboratory evidence of UTI (greater than 10 white blood cells/mm(3) on urinalysis and greater than 100,000 colony forming units/mL on urine culture). Nursing home dipstick testing effectively excluded the possibility of UTI.

Introduction

Antimicrobial drugs are used to treat bacterial infections and have revolutionised modern medicine. However, the inappropriate use and dosage of antimicrobials increases the risk of treatment failure, toxicity to the patient, and the development of drug resistance, rendering antimicrobials ineffective and putting medicine and global health at risk. Bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) affects 150 million people globally each year. On average, one in two adult women will experience a UTI during their lifetime. Treating UTIs with empirical antibiotics when patients report symptoms results in overuse of antimicrobials, as more than half of the gold standard urine culture results of symptomatic females do not confirm a UTI. Developing novel antimicrobials, enhancing diagnostic precision, and optimising the use of current treatments are approaches that can be used to mitigate the impact of drug resistance and maintain access to effective antimicrobial drugs.

Both bacteria-specific and immune response biomarkers directly measured from the urine are frequently used to diagnose UTI, as the direct quantification of bacterial load in urine through culture is slow. Their diagnostic value has been extensively explored, specifically compared to the gold standard culture and count. It is generally agreed that conventional biomarkers tested with urinary dipstick tests, such as nitrite and leucocyte esterase, have limited accuracy in the diagnosis of UTIs –. Only a few of these biomarkers have been explored longitudinally in the literature, such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin or leucocyte esterase –. Similar to the diagnosis of UTIs through biomarker detection, the need for rapid susceptibility testing has also been addressed in the literature. In vitro models mimic the urinary environment to understand the action and find the optimal dose of antimicrobial drugs. But pharmacokinetic optimisation has not been explored in-vivo. Real-time monitoring of known biomarkers used for UTI diagnosis alongside drug concentration in urine has not yet been explored and could enable real-time estimation of treatment success.

In this Comment, we aim to present the unexplored potential of using current and emerging technologies to monitor biomarkers alongside urinary antimicrobial drug concentration in UTI to gain an understanding of the relationship between drug exposure linked with host and pathogen response. We argue this could be used towards real-time pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) monitoring and support truly individualized approaches to the antimicrobial treatment of UTI.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^114T7zrd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection in pediatric patients — bag versus catheter urine and white blood cell thresholds are reported as follows: Leukocyte esterase had higher sensitivity (84% leukocyte esterase versus 39% nitrites), and leukocyte esterase specificity was lower in bag urine (84%) than catheterization urine (94%). Urine white blood cells per high-power field (WBC/hpf) showed graded likelihood ratios (LRs): LR = 19 for WBC count greater than 20/hpf, LR = 18.2 for 11 to 20 WBCs/hpf, LR = 2.8 for 6 to 10 WBCs/hpf, LR = 1 for 3 to 5 WBCs/hpf, and LR = 0.3 for 0 to 2 WBCs/hpf. Relative risk of an ambiguous culture was higher for bag specimens at 2.7 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.5), with absolute risks 7.4% in bag urine versus 2.7% with catheterization; 21 cultures (95% CI 13 to 53) by catheterization would be required to avoid 1 ambiguous bag culture. With a 5% prevalence and bagged urine specificity of 70%, the positive predictive value of a bag culture is 15% and 85% of positives would be false; a positive bagged urinalysis result should prompt a urine culture obtained by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration.

Who needs evaluation for UTI

Clinical diagnosis of UTI is unreliable, so many children with fever or symptoms of UTI need a urine sample to exclude or make the diagnosis. Urine samples should be collected before starting antibiotics, but therapy should not be delayed in the septic child.

Children with localising signs or suspected UTI need a urine sample to confirm the diagnosis.

Children with fever without focus, particularly neonates and infants, need a urine sample to evaluate potential UTI. Outside early infancy and if the child is not unwell, it may be reasonable to wait 24 hours for collection to see if an alternative focus emerges.

Children with an alternative focus of illness generally do not need a urine sample. Exceptions are septic infants, children with predisposing conditions (eg, renal anomalies), children at risk of complications (eg, single kidney) and febrile illness not following the expected clinical course.

Screening – dipstick and microscopy

Urine dipsticks are a quick, inexpensive bedside screening tool. Chemical reagent strips change colour in the presence of leucocyte esterase (an enzyme present in leucocytes) and nitrites, which may arise from UTI. Leucocytes generally appear in the urine in response to UTI. However, sterile pyuria can occur with other infections. Enterococcus, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas species are also less likely to produce pyuria than E.coli in children with symptomatic UTI. Most uropathogens convert dietary nitrates into urinary nitrites. However, not all do, including Enterococcus and Klebsiella species. Dipsticks are also less reliable in young infants, where frequent voiding flushes substrates out of the bladder.

Neither leucocytes or nitrites are fully sensitive or specific for UTI, but they are a useful screening test, particularly when used in combination. If UTI is thought unlikely, dipsticks have a good negative predictive value to exclude the diagnosis. In the presence of suggestive symptoms and either leucocytes or nitrites, empirical antibiotics while awaiting culture is indicated.

Urine microscopy also identifies leucocytes and bacteria, augmenting dipstick screening.

### Lack of clinical utility of urine Gram stain for suspected urinary tract infection in pediatric patients [^114k2Aho]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections in children. Urine culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis, but the utility of urine Gram stain relative to urinalysis (UA) is unclear. We reviewed 312 pediatric patients with suspected UTI who had urine culture, UA, and urine Gram stain performed from a single urine specimen. UA was considered positive if ≥ 10 leukocytes per oil immersion field were seen or if either nitrates or leukocyte esterase testing was positive. Urine Gram stain was considered positive if any organisms were seen. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated using urine culture as the gold standard. Thirty-seven (12%) patients had a culture-proven UTI. Compared to urine Gram stain, UA had equal sensitivity (97.3% versus 97.5%) and higher specificity (85% versus 74%). Empirical therapy was prescribed before the Gram stain result was known in 40 (49%) patients and after in 42 (51%) patients. The antibiotics chosen did not differ between the two groups (P = 0.81), nor did they differ for patients with Gram-negative rods on urine Gram stain compared to those with Gram-positive cocci (P = 0.67). From these data, we conclude that UA has excellent negative predictive value that is not enhanced by urine Gram stain and that antibiotic selection did not vary based on the urine Gram stain result. In conclusion, the clinical utility of urine Gram stain does not warrant the time or cost it requires.

### Urine dipstick for diagnosing urinary tract infection… [^116fagD4]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

In low-risk patients with a low pretest probability of UTI, the urine dipstick alone is useful to exclude infection if both nitrites and leukocyte esterase are negative. 1 Sensitivity using nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase was highest in the outpatient primary care setting and lowest in pregnant women. Specificity was lowest in the outpatient primary care setting. Table 1 1, 2 discusses the performance of the urine dipstick test for diagnosing UTI in selected populations. One systematic review 2 reported that the pretest probability of UTI in otherwise healthy women with classic UTI symptoms is 60 percent. In women with classic symptoms who do not have any vaginal discharge or irritation, the pretest probability of UTI increases to 90 percent.

2 Patients presenting with at least one poorly defined symptom had a pretest probability of UTI of 50 percent. In this setting, a positive dipstick increased the probability of a UTI to 81 percent whereas a negative dipstick reduced the probability to 23 percent.
2. Urinary complaints in children are commonly caused by noninfectious problems. Two meta-analyses 1, 3 found that the pretest probability of UTI in children was between 5 and 20 percent. A completely negative dipstick reduces the probability of a UTI to 5 percent in this setting, whereas a positive leukocyte esterase or nitrite increases the probability to only 58 percent. 1 These patients therefore require further diagnostic confirmation. A second meta-analysis 4 of diagnosis in children suggests that a dipstick testing positive for both nitrite and leukocyte esterase provides strong evidence in favor of UTI.

This study also confirms the usefulness in ruling out disease with a dipstick negative for both nitrites and leukocyte esterase.
4. In low-risk patients with a low pretest probability of UTI, the dipstick adequately rules out infection when both leukocyte esterase and nitrites are negative. This also has the benefit of cost containment because fewer urine cultures are needed in low-risk patients. Given the more serious consequences of a missed diagnosis of UTI in children, a backup urine culture is recommended.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1174tKiQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Which Investigations Are Needed at Diagnosis and During Complicated UTI?

Patient history and clinical review underpin the diagnosis of UTI and assessment of complicating features at presentation (GRADE D).
Urine collection should be done by clean catch, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration and urine analysis, culture and susceptibility testing should be undertaken for all children (GRADE C).
Additional blood investigations for cUTI may include inflammatory markers, full blood count, blood culture, urea, creatinine and electrolytes (GRADE C).
An acute ultrasound scan is helpful in some clinical situations (GRADE D).
All children with cUTI should be reassessed for treatment response at 48 hours. If progress is atypical, consider complications and/or differential diagnosis (GRADE D).
Repeat urine testing is only needed if there is inadequate treatment response (GRADE D).

All children, irrespective of uUTI or cUTI, need urinary investigations to confirm UTI diagnosis – (Table 2). Key investigations and their interpretation are given below.

TABLE 2.
Summary of Diagnostic and Other Initial Investigations in Children With cUTI

As with uncomplicated UTI, clean catch urine collection is preferred due to its noninvasive nature, with catheterization or suprapubic aspiration being the gold standards if collection is difficult or diagnosis is uncertain. In infants under 2 months, clean catch methods are challenging and can result in up to 38% contaminated samples, so catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is advised. Up to 88% of specimens collected via a urine bag with a positive culture will be false positives, so they should only be used in nonurgent situations as an initial screening measure; a negative result confirms the absence of a UTI.

Urine Dipstick Analysis

If leukocyte esterase is greater than trace, pyuria is present. Dipsticks may be false negatives in children with < 3 months with high voiding frequency or with Enterococcus spp. or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These pathogens have a reduced ability to convert nitrate to nitrite, and Enterococcus spp. may not induce a strong inflammatory response to increase leukocyte esterase.– Dipsticks may be false positives due to contamination, fever of a different cause, localized or systemic inflammatory processes, for example, Kawasaki disease.

Urine Microscopy

Pyuria is present with ≥ 5 WBC/high-powered field with standardized or automated microscopy or ≥ 10 WBC/mm³ on a hemocytometer. Because of low sensitivity, negative urine microscopy does not exclude UTI.

### Can urine dipstick testing for urinary tract infection at point of care reduce laboratory workload? [^112XhLot]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust microbiology laboratory receives 150 000 urine samples each year, approximately 80% of which prove to be culture negative. The aim of this study was to reduce the proportion of culture negative urines arriving in the laboratory, by producing local evidence based guidelines for the use of urine dipstick testing at point of care within the trust's three acute hospitals.

Methods

One thousand and seventy six unborated urine samples were dipstick tested at the point of care using an automatic strip reader. Quantitative results for the four infection associated markers-leucocyte esterase, nitrite, blood, and protein-were compared with the results of conventional laboratory microscopy and culture.

Results

The performance of different marker combinations was calculated against the routine laboratory methods. One hundred and seventy five (16.3%) samples were negative for all four markers. Of these dipstick negative samples, only three (1.7% of all true positives) were positive by culture. The absence of all four infection associated markers was found to have a greater than 98% negative predictive value and a sensitivity and specificity of 98.3% and 19.2%, respectively.

Conclusions

A urinary dipstick testing algorithm for infection associated markers was derived for use in hospital patients to screen out negative urines. Two years after distributing the algorithm and promoting access to reagent strips and strip readers, a reduction in the urine workload has been seen against an otherwise increasing laboratory specimen load.

### Pyuria and urine concentration for identifying urinary tract infection in young children [^114FaYoP]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Accuracy of pyuria for urinary tract infection (UTI) varies with urine concentration. Our objective of this study was to determine the optimal white blood cell (WBC) cutoff for UTI in young children at different urine concentrations as measured by urine specific gravity.

Methods

Retrospective cross-sectional study of children < 24 months of age evaluated in the emergency department for suspected UTI with paired urinalysis and urine culture during a 6-year period. The primary outcome was positive urine culture result as described in the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline culture thresholds. Test characteristics for microscopic pyuria cut points and positive leukocyte esterase (LE) were calculated across 3 urine specific gravity groups: low < 1.011, moderate 1.011 to 1.020, and high > 1.020.

Results

Of the total 24171 patients analyzed, urine culture result was positive in 2003 (8.3%). Urine was obtained by transurethral in-and-out catheterization in 97.9%. Optimal WBC cutoffs per high-power field (HPF) were 3 (positive likelihood ratio [LR+] 10.5; negative likelihood ratio [LR-] 0.12) at low, 6 (LR+ 12; LR- 0.14) at moderate, and 8 (LR+ 11.1; LR- 0.35) at high urine concentrations. Likelihood ratios for small positive LE from low to high urine concentrations (LR+ 25.2, LR- 0.12; LR+ 33.1, LR- 0.15; LR+ 37.6, LR- 0.41) remained excellent.

Conclusions

Optimal pyuria cut point in predicting positive urine culture results changes with urine concentration in young children. Pyuria thresholds of 3 WBCs per HPF at low urine concentrations whereas 8 WBCs per HPF at high urine concentrations have optimal predictive value for UTI. Positive LE is a strong predictor of UTI regardless of urine concentration.

### Interleukin-6 concentrations in the urine and dipstick analyses were related to bacteriuria but not symptoms in the elderly: a cross sectional study of 421 nursing home residents [^112QFEXX]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Differentiating ABU versus UTI

It is interesting to note that a positive urine culture was not commoner among residents with nonspecific symptoms compared to residents without symptoms. There was a trend (p = 0.057) toward a lower proportion of positive urine cultures among residents with confusion occurring during the last month (Table 1). This suggests that nonspecific symptoms are not caused by bacteria in the urine. Not considering other more plausible causes of the symptoms places the patient at risk for having other undiagnosed conditions. The UTI diagnosis is all too often made in the absence of newly onset focal urinary tract symptoms.

Procedures utilizing presence of symptoms or outcomes of prior dipstick testing to influence setting of cut-off levels for CFU/mL in urine cultures to label growth as clinically significant may enhance the diagnostic procedure. These procedures are common in microbiologic laboratories in Sweden and internationally. Using the routine clinical procedure increases clinical usefulness of the study results.

Residents with positive urine cultures had higher concentrations of IL-6 in the urine. However, among residents with positive urine cultures there were no differences in IL-6 concentrations between those with or without nonspecific symptoms. Thus IL-6 concentrations are not useful when assessing elderly residents with nonspecific symptoms and bacteria in the urine. If nonspecific symptoms are not caused by bacteria in the urine, IL-6 concentrations cannot identify a subgroup of residents with more severe inflammation in the bladder correlating to nonspecific symptoms.

There were no differences either in urine dipstick analyses for nitrite or leukocyte esterase ≥ 3+ between residents with positive urine cultures when comparing those with or without symptoms. Subsequently urine dipsticks are not useful when assessing elderly residents with nonspecific symptoms and bacteria in the urine.

Dipstick urinalysis

Urine dipsticks were analysed for nitrite and leukocyte esterase in urine specimens from 408/421 residents. Urine dipstick analyses were not performed in 13/421 residents, mostly due to insufficient urine volume. Among all residents, regardless of bacteriuria or not, 26% (106/408) of nitrite dipsticks were positive and 22% (90/408) of leukocyte esterase dipsticks were ≥ 3 +.

Leukocyte esterase dipsticks ≥ 3 + were more common (p < 10⁻⁶) among residents with significant growth of bacteria in the urine; 46% (61/132) versus 11% (29/276) in residents with negative urine cultures. Positive nitrite dipsticks were more common (p < 10⁻⁶) among residents with positive urine cultures; 64% (84/132) versus 8.0% (22/276) in residents with negative urine cultures.

Symptoms, bacteriuria and antibiotic treatments

The prevalence of new or increased symptoms, occurring during the last month and still present when urine specimens were obtained are presented in Table 1. There were no significant differences in the proportion of positive urine cultures among those with or without nonspecific symptoms, however there were less positive urine cultures among residents with urinary frequency (Table 1). Residents with some of the symptoms had a higher prevalence of antibiotic treatments during the last month (Table 2).

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most common bacterial infections, with estimates of up to 150 million cases a year worldwide. In the United States alone, UTI symptoms account for almost 1% of all clinic visits, and the societal costs associated with these infections are calculated to cost the United States approximately $3.5 billion a year based on health care costs and lost productivity. The high occurrence of UTIs and the ease of specimen collection create a large burden on clinical laboratories, accounting for 24 to 80% of all cultures set up, depending upon the laboratory's serviced population.

Laboratory diagnosis of UTIs is based on urinalysis, including several markers such as nitrite, leukocyte esterase, and microscopic urinalysis white blood cell count; however, bacterial culture is necessary for definitive diagnosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic UTIs. Interpretation of bacterial culture is dependent upon the bacterial burden, diversity, and clinical scenario, including assignment of uncomplicated versus complicated infection. Complicated UTIs are typically defined as a patient with a structural or functional urinary tract abnormality or altered immune system, whereas uncomplicated UTIs are characterized as females of childbearing age with symptoms of dysuria or urgency but lacking systemic symptoms. For uncomplicated UTIs, current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines define a bacterial burden of ≥ 10⁴ CFU/ml as significant. This threshold is reduced to 10³ CFU/ml when specimens are tested from patients with complicated UTIs due to their increased risk and likelihood of disseminated or severe infection.

Urinalysis performance and interpretation in recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) — A negative urinalysis (i.e., negative nitrites and < 5 WBC/hpf) is useful in ruling out acute cystitis and is associated with a very low risk of progression to bacteremia; in a study of more than 12,000 urinalyses, a negative urinalysis showed high predictive accuracy for absence of clinically relevant UTI with specificity 92.2% and positive predictive value (PPV) 97.4%, and stewardship programs that reflex culture only after a positive urinalysis are estimated to reduce inappropriate antibiotics by five-fold; by contrast, positive leukocyte esterase (≥ 1+), pyuria (≥ 10 WBC/hpf), nitrite (≥ 1+), and bacteriuria (≥ 50 cells/field) all have PPVs for UTI lower than 50%, and discordance such as urine culture with > 100,000 CFU/mL E. coli but absent urine nitrites may reflect sampling or handling issues, where identifying epithelial cells or mucus can suggest contamination and obtaining a catheterized specimen may be reasonable; overall, urinalysis is specifically helpful due to its high negative predictive value, but positive findings should not be interpreted as evidence of a clinically significant UTI.

### Effecting the culture: impact of changing urinalysis with reflex to culture criteria on culture rates and outcomes [^115Dno19]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of changes to urinalysis with reflex to culture (UARC) reflex criteria on culture performance and clinical decision outcomes.

Design

Retrospective study utilizing interrupted time series analysis from December 2018 to November 2020. Primary outcomes were measures of culture performance. Secondary outcomes were rates of antimicrobial prescription for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). We also assessed harmful events related to antimicrobial prescription for all causes and UTI, UTI symptoms, and sepsis.

Setting

A 415-bed, academic, tertiary-care, medical center.

Patients

Hospitalized adult patients with urine testing performed.

Intervention

UARC reflex criteria were changed on October 22, 2019, from ≥ 5×10⁹/L white blood cells (WBCs) or trace leukocyte esterase or positive nitrite units on urinalysis to only ≥ 15×10⁹/L WBCs.

Results

The study included 11,322 unique UARC tests. We detected a significant decrease in the rate of urine cultures performed from UARC after the intervention (32.5–8.7 cultures per 1,000 patient days; P < .001), with improved diagnostic efficacy (ie, culture positivity increased from 34.8% to 62.1%). CAUTI rates did not change. We detected a significant decrease in antimicrobial prescription rates (P = 0.05), this was primarily driven by preintervention changes. One case of sepsis occurred secondary to a missed UTI, and UTIs were rarely missed after the intervention.

Conclusions

Implementation of a stricter UARC reflex criterion was associated with a decrease in culture rates with improved diagnostic efficacy without significant adverse events. Continued education is needed to change antimicrobial prescribing practices.

Febrile infants and young children in emergency departments — dipstick and urinalysis accuracy are reported from multiple Class III studies. In a retrospective review of 375 pediatric ED patients aged 0 to 10 years, urinary tract infection prevalence was 10.7%, urine dipstick sensitivity 92.5% (95% CI 84.3% to 100%) and specificity 39.4% (95% CI 34.2% to 44.6%). In the 0- to 2-year group (160 patients), prevalence was 15%, sensitivity 87.5% (95% CI 74.3% to 100%), and specificity 39.7% (95% CI 31.5% to 47.9%); in the 2- to 10-year group, prevalence was 7.0%, sensitivity 100% (95% CI 100% to 100%), and specificity 39.2% (95% CI 32.4% to 46%). In another study of febrile patients younger than 2 years (mean age 9.3 months) at a United Kingdom pediatric ED, a test positive for nitrite, leukocyte esterase, and blood was 97.12% specific (95% CI 94.17% to 98.96%) with a positive LR of 15.13 (95% CI 6.99 to 32.76), and a test negative for nitrite, leukocyte esterase, blood, and protein had a sensitivity of 97.44% (95% CI 91.12% to 99.29%) with a negative LR of 0.10 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.39). A multicenter febrile infant study from Spain (N = 649; ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL sterile collection; < 90 days; ≥ 38°C) reported leukocyte esterase mean sensitivity 82.1%, mean specificity 92.4%, mean negative predictive value 97.8% for female patients (N = 176) and 94.1% for male patients (N = 473), and mean positive predictive value 58% for female patients and 79.4% for male patients. Another pediatric ED Class III study of febrile patients younger than 5 years (half the patients were ≤ 12 months) with a urinary tract infection prevalence of 17.6% found, for all patients, sensitivities and negative predictive values respectively: nitrite 20% and 85%, hemoglobin 44% and 88%, leukocyte esterase 48% and 90%, 2 to 5 or more WBCs/hpf in sediment 48% and 90%, centrifuge Gram's stain 60% and 92%, and unspun WBC count greater than 10/μL 67% and 96%; for infants aged 12 months or younger versus older than 12 months, respective sensitivities were nitrite 7% and 23%, hemoglobin 33% and 53%, leukocyte esterase 42% and 53%; 2 to 5 or more WBCs/hpf in sediment 42% and 53%, centrifuge Gram's stain 42% and 76%, and unspun WBC count greater than 10/μL 67% and 96%.

### What is the optimal timing for reading the leukocyte esterase strip for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection? [^115VAcoR]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The LE strip test is routinely used as an early screening test for patients with suspected PJI in outpatient and intraoperative settings since it is simple, quick, and inexpensive. This test for diagnosing PJI is believed to be effective and useful and has an important place in the ICM 2018 diagnostic criteria. We usually read the LE strips 3 minutes after sample application as per the manufacturer's recommendation. This timepoint applies to urine, but no relevant clinical studies have confirmed that it also pertains to synovial fluid. Our study demonstrated that the color of LE strips deepened over time, leading to a higher grade. The cause of this phenomenon is unclear, but the LE strip test is biochemically based on diazoreaction, in which LE secreted by activated neutrophils causes hydrolysis of indophenol ester to produce free phenol, which, via phenol oxidation and coupling reaction, combines with diazonium salt in the paper to develop color. We suggested that as a strip with synovial fluid is exposed to air for a protracted time, oxidation and coupling reactions will be more complete and the strip will be darker. In addition, LE synovial fluid may take longer to fully react with substrate on the strips because the synovial fluid is more viscous than urine. This assumption is also premised on the aforementioned principles. Therefore, we began to read the result 1 minute after sample application to allow the synovial fluid to react with the substrate. Although the timepoint at which reaction between the synovial fluid and LE substrate ends may vary, we found that the results of the LE strip test eventually stabilized. The stabilization could be seen as the end of the reaction. Reading the strip at the time of termination (13 or 14 minutes after application) is inappropriate because the prolonged reaction resulted in more false positives (10 false positives before centrifugation and four false positives after centrifugation). Reading the test 3 minutes after application as previously recommended resulted in too many false negatives due to short reaction time (eight false negatives before centrifugation and 27 false negatives after centrifugation). Therefore, it is necessary to determine the optimal timing for reading the strip to improve the accuracy of the LE strip test for diagnosing PJI.

### Urine concentration and pyuria for identifying UTI in infants [^1147nsVu]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Varying urine white blood cell (WBC) thresholds have been recommended for the presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) among young infants. These thresholds have not been studied with newer automated urinalysis systems that analyze uncentrifuged urine that might be influenced by urine concentration. Our objective was to determine the optimal urine WBC threshold for UTI in young infants by using an automated urinalysis system, stratified by urine concentration.

Methods

Retrospective cross-sectional study of infants aged < 3 months evaluated for UTI in the emergency department with paired urinalysis and urine culture. UTI was defined as ≥ 50000 colony-forming units/mL from catheterized specimens. Test characteristics were calculated across a range of WBC and leukocyte esterase (LE) cut-points, dichotomized into specific gravity groups (dilute < 1.015; concentrated ≥ 1.015).

Results

Twenty-seven thousand infants with a median age of 1.7 months were studied. UTI prevalence was 7.8%. Optimal WBC cut-points were 3 WBC/high-power field (HPF) in dilute urine (likelihood ratio positive [LR+] 9.9, likelihood ratio negative [LR‒] 0.15) and 6 WBC/HPF (LR+ 10.1, LR‒ 0.17) in concentrated urine. For dipstick analysis, positive LE has excellent test characteristics regardless of urine concentration (LR+ 22.1, LR‒ 0.12 in dilute urine; LR+ 31.6, LR‒ 0.22 in concentrated urine).

Conclusions

Urine concentration should be incorporated into the interpretation of automated microscopic urinalysis in young infants. Pyuria thresholds of 3 WBC/HPF in dilute urine and 6 WBC/HPF in concentrated urine are recommended for the presumptive diagnosis of UTI. Without correction of specific gravity, positive LE by automated dipstick is a reliably strong indicator of UTI.

### Implementation of an algorithm for testing, diagnosis, and antibiotic stewardship of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^112CWCqa]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria affects 2% to 15% of pregnant women, with 20% to 40% developing symptoms later. Symptomatic urinary tract infections are more common in pregnancy, with a prevalence of 33%, posing risks, such as preterm delivery, low birthweight, and maternal pyelonephritis. The gold standard for urinary tract infection detection is a urine culture, but point-of-care urinalysis dipsticks are frequently performed as screens during regular obstetrical visits. Leukocyte esterase has been used to justify the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, even with low sensitivity and specificity. Confirmatory tests are crucial for avoiding false positives and ensuring optimal outcomes. Current guidelines for urinalysis dipstick interpretation and the decision to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy are limited. It remains unclear whether an evidence-based algorithm can improve test utilization, diagnosis, and treatment decisions for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

Objective

The primary objective of our study was to develop, implement, and evaluate an evidence-based algorithm to guide urinalysis interpretation, culture, diagnosis, and antibiotic stewardship of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant patients during routine obstetric visits.

Study Design

The project involves both retrospective and quasi-experimental prospective medical record reviews of pregnant patients aged ≥ 18 years, beyond 20 weeks of gestation, from routine obstetrical visits with urinalysis dipstick tests. A doctorate in clinical laboratory sciences student developed an educational algorithm to guide urinalysis dipstick interpretation, culturing necessity, and treatment decisions based on evidence-based practice. Our study considered patient records from February 1, 2022, to February 28, 2022, as retrospective (prealgorithm implementation) data and January 24, 2023, to February 22, 2023, as prospective (postalgorithm implementation) data. Data collected from the electronic medical record included deidentified patient information, urinalysis results, culture dates and outcomes, antibiotic prescriptions, urinary tract infection or asymptomatic bacteriuria diagnoses, provider details, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and demographics. Data analysis using SPSS (version 29; SPSS IBM, Armonk, NY) involved chi-square tests, likelihood ratios, and effect size calculations, with P values of < .05 considered statistically significant.

Results

This study examined a total of 1176 patient records. Preimplementation data included 440 records, of which 224 were abnormal urinalyses and 216 were normal urinalyses. Postimplementation data included 736 records, of which 255 were abnormal urinalyses and 481 were normal urinalysis. The patient demographics predominantly featured White individuals (87%), with a median maternal age of 27 years and a gestational age of 32 weeks. Our preimplementation analyses revealed significant associations of algorithm deviations with both culture utilization (P < .001) and antibiotic stewardship (P < .001). However, no significant association was observed between algorithm deviations and adverse patient outcomes. Culture underutilization decreased significantly from 43.0% (189/440) before implementation to 29.5% (217/736) after implementation (P < .001). The overall reduction in asymptomatic bacteriuria prevalence from 16.3% (8/49) to 6.7% (10/67) suggests a decrease of nearly 60.0%. In addition, antibiotic overprescription decreased significantly from 1.6% (4/258) before implementation to 0.8% (4/522) after implementation (P = 0.003), with a reduction from 7.1% (3/42) to 2.4% (1/41) among abnormal urinalyses.

Conclusion

Our findings show a strong alignment between the use of the algorithm and subsequent clinical decisions, underscoring its potential to enhance patient care and management in obstetrical settings. Adherence to the algorithm was higher among providers displaying prudent antibiotic use.

### The abnormal urinalysis [^1126CRh8]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The urinalysis is one of the most commonly performed tests in pediatrics, and whether expected or incidental, abnormal findings are common. Understanding the strengths and limitations of the urinalysis allows one to maximize its use as a screening tool while avoiding expensive and unnecessary evaluations. This article reviews the significance of abnormal results on urine dipstick testing and urine microscopy. Causes of false positive and false negative results are summarized. Initial diagnostic considerations of abnormal urinalysis findings are provided where appropriate.

### Diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks for urinary tract infections in acutely hospitalised patients: a prospective population-based observational cohort study [^116MoKZi]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine the added diagnostic value of dipsticks for urinary tract infections (UTI) in acutely hospitalised individuals.

Design

Prospective population-based cohort study.

Setting

North Denmark.

Participants

All adults (≥ 18 years) examined with dipsticks at emergency departments in North Denmark Region from September 20 through 23 October 2021.

Main outcome measures

UTI was defined as ≥ 1 symptom of new-onset frequency, dysuria or suprapubic tenderness combined with a positive urine culture. Positive dipsticks were defined as any reaction for leucocyte esterase and/or nitrite.

Results

Dipsticks were used in 1052/2495 (42%) of acutely hospitalised patients with a median age of 73 years (IQR 57–82) and 540 (51%) were female. Overall, 89/1052 (8%) fulfilled the UTI criteria and urine cultures were done in 607/1052 (58%) patients. Among patients examined with both dipstick and urine culture, sensitivity and specificity for UTI were 87% (95% CI 78% to 93%) and 45% (95% CI 41% to 50%). Positive and negative predictive values were 21% (95% CI 17% to 26%) and 95% (95% CI 92% to 98%), whereas positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.58 (95% CI 1.41 to 1.77) and 0.30 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.51). Pretest probabilities of UTI ranged from 29% to 60% in participants with specific UTI symptoms with corresponding post-test probabilities of 35–69% if dipsticks were positive and 12–27% if dipsticks were negative. Results remained comparable if final clinical diagnosis was used as outcome among all patients examined with dipsticks. Modified Poisson regression yielded an adjusted relative risk of 4.41 (95% CI 2.40 to 8.11) for empirical antibiotics for UTI in participants without specific UTI symptoms and a positive dipstick.

Conclusions

Dipsticks yielded limited clinical decision support compared with a symptom-driven approach in this study and were independently associated with excess antibiotics for UTI.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^115BHX2y]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results by healthcare settings

The AUC for urinalysis WBC as a predictor for uropathogen prediction was consistent across settings, (P > 0.05 for all comparisons, Supplemental Table): 0.720 [95% CI 0.715–0.725] in the outpatient setting, 0.727 [95% CI 0.714–0.730] in the emergency department, and 0.722 [95% CI 0.714–0.730] in the inpatient setting (Table 3). Additional results of other urinalysis parameters are summarized in Table 3.

The diagnostic accuracy of combined macroscopic urinalysis parameters stratified by healthcare setting is presented in Table 3. The AUC of combining a positive leukocyte esterase result with nitrite test of any result as a predictor of detecting a uropathogen was 0.681 [95% CI 0.676–0.690] in the outpatient setting, 0.701 [95% CI 0.694–0.708] in the emergency department, and 0.719 [95% CI 0.711–0.727] in the inpatient setting. These AUC values were lower than the values obtained from combining WBC results with any bacteria result, which were 0.720 [95% CI 0.715–0.725], 0.727 [95% CI 0.719–0.733], and 0.722 [95% CI 0.714–0.729] for the outpatient setting (p < 0.001), emergency department (p < 0.001), and inpatient setting (p = 0.60), respectively.

Results by age group

Stratifying our pediatric population into different age categories showed that WBCs as a predictor of detecting a uropathogen had the highest AUC expect the very young (3 months–2 years), in which leukocyte esterase performed best (AUC = 0.739 [95% CI 0.693–0.786], Supplemental Table). Full age stratified results are similar to the overall population and outlined in Supplemental Tablesand.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^117DtL44]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic approach in febrile infants — If a clinician assesses a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever as not being so ill as to require immediate antimicrobial therapy, then the clinician should assess the likelihood of UTI. If the clinician determines the febrile infant to have a low likelihood of UTI, then clinical follow-up monitoring without testing is sufficient (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). If the infant is not in a low-risk group, there are 2 choices (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation): obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA) for culture and urinalysis, or obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means and perform a urinalysis; if the urinalysis suggests a UTI (positive leukocyte esterase test results or nitrite test or microscopic analysis results positive for leukocytes or bacteria), then a urine specimen should be obtained through catheterization or SPA and cultured; if urinalysis of fresh (< 1 hour since void) urine yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite test results, then it is reasonable to monitor the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy, recognizing that negative urinalysis results do not rule out a UTI with certainty.

### Rapid diagnosis of infected ascitic fluid using leukocyte esterase dipstick testing [^116h4W5A]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Ascitic fluid infection is presumptively diagnosed when the fluid polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) concentration equals or exceeds 250 cells/microl. The leukocyte esterase (LE) test has been shown to be a good predictor of the presence of PMNs and bacteria in urine and other body fluids. This study examines the value of the Multistix 10 SG LE Dipstick test for the rapid diagnosis of infected ascitic fluid.

Methods

One hundred thirty-six ascitic fluid samples were evaluated by PMN count, culture, and LE Dipstick testing. LE dipstick values of "small" or greater were considered positive. For each sample, the LE test result was compared to the corresponding PMN count and culture result.

Results

Ten of the 11 LE-positive samples had PMN ≥ 250 cells/microl, while 10 of 12 samples with PMN ≥ 250 cells/microl were also LE-positive. Of the 125 LE-negative samples, 123 were also negative by PMN count. One hundred twenty-three of the 124 samples with PMN < 250 cells/microl had negative LE tests. There was a less concordant relationship between the LE test and culture results. The sensitivity and specificity of the LE test for detecting ascitic fluid PMN ≥ 250 cells/microl were 83% and 99%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 91% and a negative predictive value of 98%.

Conclusions

The Multistix leukocyte esterase test is useful for the prompt detection of an elevated ascitic fluid PMN count, and represents a convenient new method for the rapid diagnosis of infected ascitic fluid.

### Urinary leukocyte esterase screening test for asymptomatic chlamydial and gonococcal infections in males… [^112zWZ8d]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

We evaluated the ability of the urinary leukocyte esterase test to predict culture-verified chlamydial and gonococcal urethritis among asymptomatic adolescent males. Nine hundred forty-eight sexually active males provided first-catch urine samples for esterase screening, and 76 tested positive. Among 435 boys who agreed to undergo urethral culture, the esterase was positive in 66, Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 39, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated from 14. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the esterase test were 72%, 93%, and 58% and 96%, respectively. Using the esterase test to screen asymptomatic males for urethritis, we identified 38 culture-verified infections that otherwise would have remained undetected. The urinary leukocyte esterase test is a noninvasive and cost-effective screening method to detect urethritis among asymptomatic adolescent males.

### Relationship between urinalysis findings and responsible pathogens in children with urinary tract infections [^1156c867]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pyuria, presence of bacteria, leukocyte esterase, and nitrite positivity in urinalysis should be considered together, and simultaneous urine culture test should be performed in the diagnostic evaluation of urinary tract infection (UTI). The absence of pyuria in urinalysis cannot exclude UTI in patients with suggestive clinical findings.

Objective

It was aimed to assess relationship between urinalysis tests and uropathogen and to evaluate antibiotic resistance in children.

Methods

The study included patients (aged 0–18 years) with significant uropathogen growth in urine culture tests. The patients' data regarding age, gender, results of urine microscopy, urine culture, and antibiogram were recorded retrospectively.

Results

Overall, 705 patients (562 girls, 143 boys) with significant growth in urine culture test were included. Median age was 72 months among girls and 12 months among boys. Most common uropathogens were Escherichia coli (79.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.2%). E. coli was more commonly among girls (87%) and Klebsiella spp. among boys (53.3%). Pyuria was positive in urinalysis in 75% of patients. Pyuria presence was more common in patients with E.coli or Proteus spp. (80.6% and 71.4%, respectively) than those with Enterococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp. (52.0% and 53.3%, respectively). In culture antibiogram tests, ampicillin resistance was 100% in Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterobacter spp. and 72% in E. coli strains. No ceftriaxone resistance was observed in K. oxytoca, Citrobacter spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.

Discussion

Most UTIs were seen in older girls. Pyuria might be lacking in UTIs associated to Klebsiella spp. and Enterococcus spp., and absence of pyuria may not exclude UTI in patients with compatible clinical findings. Ceftriaxone is still an option in empirical treatment; unnecessary use of third-generation cephalosporins should be avoided, particularly in infections other than UTI.

Conlusions

It was found that E. coli more commonly caused leukocyturia, leukocyte esterase positivity, and pyuria; that pyuria might be lacking in UTIs associated to Klebsiella spp. and Enterococcus spp. and that pyuria was more prevalent among girls. It is though that urine culture tests should be performed in children with suspected UTI even in the absence of pyuria because lack of pyuria may lead delay in diagnosis and treatment as well as renal scar formation.

### Improving urinary tract infection diagnostics in oncology: reliability of reflex urine culture in immunosuppressed neutropenic and non-neutropenic cancer patients [^114GHFCb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are prone to overdiagnosis, and reflex urine culture protocols offer a valuable opportunity for diagnostic stewardship in this arena. However, there is no recommended standard testing approach. Patients with cancer are often excluded from reflex urine culture protocols, especially if they are severely immunosuppressed or neutropenic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of urine screening studies, including dipstick urinalysis for nitrite and leukocyte esterase and urine microscopy for white blood cell count, to detect significant pathogen growth.

Methods

A retrospective study of 58 098 urine cultures with a paired dipstick urinalysis with or without urine microscopy was performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, evaluating data from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020. A dipstick urinalysis was considered negative only if leukocyte esterase and nitrite were undetected.

Results

A negative dipstick urinalysis had a negative predictive value of 98% for clinically significant bacteriuria in voided urine and 95% for catheterized urine. Notably, a negative urine dipstick test screen maintained a high negative predictive value among patients with neutropenia and in those with antibiotic exposure before testing. Finally, the presence of pyuria ≥ 10 white blood cells per high-power field on urine microscopy offered negligible incremental diagnostic benefit in samples with a negative dipstick urinalysis.

Conclusions

Reflex urine culture protocols contingent upon a screening dipstick urinalysis are a safe and effective platform for diagnostic stewardship in patients with cancer including those with neutropenia.

### Dipstick leukocyte esterase activity in first-catch urine specimens… [^111i9eyS]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Although sexually active female adolescents are often routinely screened for sexually transmitted diseases, indications for culturing adolescent males for sexually transmitted urethral infections are controversial. A study of 54 sexually active males was undertaken to assess the reliability of using dipstick leukocyte esterase activity in first-catch urine specimens to detect urethritis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Eighteen males had sexually transmitted diseases: N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, and N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis. First-catch urine specimens with a 1 + or 2 + reaction on dipstick testing had a leukocyte count of 10 WBCs per high-power field or greater on microscopic analysis, with an 83% sensitivity, 100% specificity, a 100% positive predictive value, and a 92% negative predictive value for the presence of N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, or both.

Clinical criteria for screening plus a dipstick-positive first-catch urine specimen had a 94% sensitivity, 89% specificity, an 81% positive predictive value, and a 97% negative predictive value.

### Accuracy of screening tests for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections in young children [^117Qwkiu]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of available tests for pyuria, including newer automated tests, and to examine the implications of requiring them for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Methods

We included children between 1 and 36 months of age undergoing bladder catheterization for suspected UTIs who presented to 1 of 3 pediatric centers. Using a positive urine culture result as the reference standard, we compared the sensitivity of 5 modalities for assessing pyuria at the cutoffs most often used clinically for detecting children with a positive culture result: leukocyte esterase on a dipstick, white blood cell (WBC) count on manual microscopy with and without using a hemocytometer, automated WBC enumeration using flow cytometry, and automated WBC enumeration using digital imaging with particle recognition.

Results

A total of 4188 children were included. Among febrile children, the sensitivity of the 2 most widely available modalities, the leukocyte esterase test and WBC enumeration using digital imaging, had sensitivity values of 84% (95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.87) and 75% (95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.83), respectively.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that for febrile children < 36 months of age undergoing bladder catheterization for suspected UTI, pyuria will be absent in ∼20% of children who are eventually shown to have pure growth of a pathogen on a culture. This raises questions about the appropriateness of requiring pyuria for the diagnosis of UTIs.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^114WvDzQ]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study looked at signs/symptoms triggering a UTI diagnosis and explored whether or not CRP could be of added value in the diagnosis of a UTI. Only 11.7% of our UTI suspicions corresponded to the applied definition of a confirmed UTI. Strong or foul smelling urine and acute change in mental status mainly triggered a UTI suspicion. However, only acute dysuria and acute suprapubic pain were found significant and increased the post-test probability. The combined nitrite and leucocyte esterase urine had a high negative predictive value. Antimicrobials were prescribed in more than half of the events with a suspected but unconfirmed UTI, indicating a potential significant overuse in this NH population.

Conducting research in LTCFs can be challenging. We also experienced some major limitations in our study. As there was no funding for this study (diagnostic material payed with own resources) we relied on the voluntary participation of NHs and on their staff to carry out the study. The observation period was limited to three months to make the study as feasible as possible and to limit the time investment. Three non-hospital laboratories were willing to take part in this study and invited all their surrounding NHs. Unfortunately, the majority of facilities were not eager to participate, either because they were not interested in the topic, had other projects going on or because they perceived the study as a significant time investment. In one region, we found no participants and therefore continued the study with only two microbiological laboratories. Because of this and a slower than expected inclusion of residents with a UTI suspicion, we reached only half of our intended sample size and only half of our expected confirmed UTI diagnoses. This led to larger confidence intervals around our estimates.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^117XeZs7]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### Predicting bacteriuria in urogynecology patients [^115DNVeu]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to determine whether reagent strip testing can predict bacteriuria in urogynecology patients.

Study Design

All women undergoing urodynamic evaluations from June 1997 to October 2001 were identified by using a computerized database. Urine culture results were compared with reagent strip testing. Significant bacteriuria was defined as greater than 10⁵ colony-forming units per milliliter.

Results

Bacteriuria prevalence was 8.6% (n = 51). Sensitivity and specificity of nitrites were 0.51, (95% CI, 0.31–0.66) and 0.991, (95% CI, 0.974–0.998), respectively. Blood had a lower sensitivity (0.35, 95% CI, 0.20–0.54) and specificity (0.80, 95% CI, 0.75–0.84). Leukocyte esterase was similar to blood with a sensitivity of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.14–0.45) and specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.78–0.87). No combination of tests offered improved sensitivity or specificity over nitrites alone.

Conclusion

Nitrite dipstick testing has excellent specificity for bacteriuria in urogynecologic patients. These results support the treatment of women with positive nitrites who are preparing to undergo urodynamics without obtaining culture.

### Rapid tests and urine sampling techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^114EjrBU]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common sources of infection in children under five. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is important to reduce the risk of renal scarring. Rapid, cost-effective, methods of UTI diagnosis are required as an alternative to culture.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review to determine the diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests for detecting UTI in children under five years of age.

Results

The evidence supports the use of dipstick positive for both leukocyte esterase and nitrite (pooled LR+ = 28.2, 95% CI: 17.3, 46.0) or microscopy positive for both pyuria and bacteriuria (pooled LR+ = 37.0, 95% CI: 11.0, 125.9) to rule in UTI. Similarly dipstick negative for both LE and nitrite (Pooled LR- = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.26) or microscopy negative for both pyuria and bacteriuria (Pooled LR- = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.23) can be used to rule out UTI. A test for glucose showed promise in potty-trained children. However, all studies were over 30 years old. Further evaluation of this test may be useful.

Conclusion

Dipstick negative for both LE and nitrite or microscopic analysis negative for both pyuria and bacteriuria of a clean voided urine, bag, or nappy/pad specimen may reasonably be used to rule out UTI. These patients can then reasonably be excluded from further investigation, without the need for confirmatory culture. Similarly, combinations of positive tests could be used to rule in UTI, and trigger further investigation.

### Biomarkers for diagnosing serious bacterial infections in older outpatients: a systematic review [^1158WGdK]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing guidelines

SIGN guidelines for UTI in older adults advise against the use of the urine dipstick as a diagnostic test due to lack of high quality evidence. This advice is echoed by Public Health England guidance, because positive urine dipsticks are often be caused by asymptomatic bacteriuria. The results of our review contradict these recommendations, and suggest that a positive urine dipstick for nitrites and leucocytes is helpful in diagnosing UTI in symptomatic older adults. Further studies in this area are required to corroborate or refute these findings.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^115tJ7Au]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Symptom control

The upper confidence intervals for the main outcome (frequency symptoms) suggest that alternative strategies are unlikely to result in poor symptom control (around 18% worsening for the midstream urine or delayed groups, and 2% in dipstick and symptom score groups). There was some evidence that if women waited more than 48 hour they reconsulted less but had poorer control of symptoms, particularly for the midstream urine group. The finding of worse symptoms in such patients is in agreement with evidence of the effect of antibiotics from observational studies and trials. Why the delayed group who waited a similar time did not have increased symptoms, however, is unclear. This might be a chance finding, but it might be because women in the midstream urine group find passively waiting for a laboratory result to be more distressing than being given the freedom to choose when to stop the delay according to their symptoms (the empirical delayed group). A previous study treated women negative for nitrite and leucocyte esterase with antibiotics and found symptomatic benefit, but as about a third of women who have negative results for all important dipstick tests (that is, not only nitrite and leucocyte but also blood) still have urinary tract infection based on rigorous laboratory confirmation, the finding of a benefit in women with negative dipstick resultsmight be expected. The poor negative predictive value of dipsticks suggests that the offer of some kind of antibiotic safety net — such as delayed prescribing — to women with negative dipstick results is reasonable.

Antibiotic use

A modest reduction in antibiotic use (20–25%) was achieved in all groups except the symptom score group. While these reductions are probably useful for public health, and the effect might plausibly increase with time as patient expectations change, the magnitude of the effect is in contrast to delayed antibiotic prescription among patients with respiratory infections. This is perhaps not surprising given that few respiratory infections are bacterial whereas most suspected urinary tract infections are (66% of the midstream urine group had confirmed infection, similar to the previous study). There was some evidence that delayed prescribing might reduce reconsultation as we hypothesised, but this was not significant, probably because of the relatively low power of this analysis.

### Predicting urinary tract infections with interval likelihood ratios [^113eQdWf]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Protocols for diagnosing urinary tract infection (UTI) often use arbitrary cutoff values of urinalysis components to guide management. Interval likelihood ratios (ILRs) of urinalysis results may improve the test's precision in predicting UTIs. We calculated the ILR of urinalysis components to estimate the posttest probabilities of UTIs in young children.

Methods

Review of 2144 visits to the pediatric emergency department of an urban academic hospital from December 2011 to December 2019. Inclusion criteria were age < 2 years and having a urinalysis and urine culture sent. ILR boundaries for hemoglobin, protein, and leukocyte esterase were "negative", "trace", "1+", "2+" and "3+". Nitrite was positive or negative. Red blood cells and white blood cells (WBCs) were 0 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 50, 50 to 100, and 100 to 250. Bacteria counts ranged from negative to "loaded". ILRs for each component were calculated and posttest probabilities for UTI were estimated.

Results

The UTI prevalence was 9.2%, with the most common pathogen being Escherichia coli (75.2%). The ILR for leukocyte esterase ranged from 0.20 (negative) to 37.68 (3+) and WBCs ranged from 0.24 (0–5 WBCs) to 47.50 (100–250 WBCs). The ILRs for nitrites were 0.76 (negative) and 25.35 (positive). The ILR for negative bacteria on urinalysis was 0.26 and 14.04 for many bacteria.

Conclusions

The probability of UTI in young children significantly increases with 3+ leukocyte esterase, positive nitrite results, 20 to 50 or higher WBCs, and/or many or greater bacteria on urinalysis. The probability of UTI only marginally increases with trace or 1+ leukocyte esterase or 5 to 20 WBCs. Our findings can be used to more accurately predict the probability of true UTI in children.

### Comparison of test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points [^1173eXVD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We compare the test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points in women presenting to emergency departments and an intermediate care center with symptoms of urinary tract infection.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational study of adult women presenting to 1 of 2 community hospital EDs or an intermediate care center with dysuria, urgency, or urinary frequency on history, or suprapubic or costovertebral angle tenderness on examination. Patients who had taken antibiotics in the past 72 hours, had indwelling Foley catheters, symptomatic vaginal discharge, diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency disorders, or were unable to provide a reliable history were excluded. The patient's clean-catch or catheterized urine specimen was tested immediately by a nurse using a Multistix 9 SG reagent strip. A second aliquot was sent within 1 hour of collection to the hospital laboratory, where a semiautomated microscopic urinalysis and a urine culture were performed. A positive urine culture was defined as more than 100,000 colonies of 1 or 2 uropathogenic bacteria per mL of urine at 48 hours. Dipstick and urinalysis data were compared with urine culture results. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated at various definitions of a positive test, or "test cutoff points", for combinations of leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and blood on dipstick and for RBCs and WBCs on urinalyses. The probability of an erroneous decision to withhold treatment on the basis of a negative test result was defined as "undertreatment", or 1 minus the negative predictive value. "Overtreatment" was defined as 1 minus the positive predictive value.

Results

Three hundred forty-three patients were enrolled in this study. Twelve patients were withdrawn because of missing laboratory results. Forty-six percent (152/331) of patients had positive urine cultures. If urine dipstick results are defined as positive when leukocyte esterase or nitrite is positive or blood is more than trace, the overtreatment rate is 47% (156/331) and the undertreatment rate is 13% (43/331). If urinalysis results are defined as positive when WBCs are more than 3 per high-power field or RBCs are more than 5 per high-power field, the overtreatment rate is 44% (146/331) and the undertreatment rate is 11% (36/331). Matched pairs of test characteristics were identified when the analysis was repeated using more than 10,000 colonies per mL as a positive culture.

Conclusion

In this patient population, similar overtreatment and undertreatment rates were identified for various test cutoff points for urine dipstick tests and urinalysis. Although a urine dipstick may be equivalent to a urinalysis for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection, the limitations in the diagnostic accuracy of both tests should be incorporated into medical decisionmaking.

### History and physical examination plus laboratory testing for the diagnosis of adult female urinary tract infection [^1173wmU7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians often encounter females presenting with symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, and bedside laboratory tests for female UTIs in emergency departments (EDs) have not been quantitatively described.

Objectives

This was a systematic review to determine the utility of history and physical examination (H&P) and urinalysis in diagnosing uncomplicated female UTI in the ED.

Methods

The medical literature was searched from January 1965 through October 2012 in PUBMED and EMBASE using the following criteria: Patients were females greater than 18 years of age in the ED suspected of having UTIs. Interventions were H&P and urinalysis used to diagnose a UTI. The comparator was UTI confirmed by a positive urine culture. The outcome was operating characteristics of the interventions in diagnosing a UTI. Study quality was assessed using Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated using Meta-DiSc.

Results

Four studies (pooled n = 948) were included with UTI prevalence ranging from 40% to 60%. H&P variables all had positive LRs (+LR, range = 0.8 to 2.2) and negative LRs (-LR, range = 0.7 to 1.0) that are insufficient to significantly alter pretest probability of UTI. Only a positive nitrite reaction (+LR = 7.5 to 24.5) was useful to rule in a UTI. To rule out UTI, only a negative leukocyte esterase (LE; -LR = 0.2) or blood reaction on urine dipstick (-LR = 0.2) were significantly accurate. Increasing pyuria directly correlated with +LR, and moderate pyuria (urine white blood cells [uWBC] > 50 colony-forming units [CFUs]/ml) and moderate bacteruria were good predictors of UTI (+LR = 6.4 and 15.0, respectively).

Conclusions

No single H&P finding can accurately rule in or rule out UTI in symptomatic women. Urinalysis with a positive nitrite or moderate pyuria and/or bacteruria are accurate predictors of a UTI. If the pretest probability of UTI is sufficiently low, a negative urinalysis can accurately rule out the diagnosis.
