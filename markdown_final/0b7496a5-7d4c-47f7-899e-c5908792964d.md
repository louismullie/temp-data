## Question

right hemispheric stroke features

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about right hemispheric stroke features. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about epidemiology and recognition biases that shape presentation and treatment. Then, I should verify the core neuropsychological hallmarks such as spatial neglect and anosognosia. Next, I will examine associated perceptual and attentional deficits, followed by motor phenotypes including ipsilesional deficits. After that, I need to consider cognitive-behavioral syndromes and their network substrates. Finally, I will synthesize prognostic implications and assessment strategies, ensuring high-credibility references anchor key claims while I double-check for potential pitfalls or overstatements.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiological and recognition context before drawing conclusions about phenotype prevalence, because right–left imbalances in hospital cohorts can bias what we see. Hospital registries overrepresent left hemispheric strokes (about 56% left vs 44% right), likely reflecting easier recognition of language-dominant symptoms on the left, not a true population incidence difference, so I should be cautious about extrapolating inpatient proportions to the community burden [^1119CWjV]. Wait, let me verify the treatment gap claim as well: patients with right hemisphere strokes are indeed less likely to receive rt-PA (about 45% less), and although neglect itself sometimes increases treatment likelihood once detected, the net effect still disadvantages right hemisphere presentations, underscoring assessment bias and system-level delays [^115pBjQw]. I should also confirm NIHSS asymmetry: standard NIHSS underweights neglect relative to aphasia, and tripling neglect points improves lesion volume prediction in right MCA strokes, supporting the concept that current scales underestimate right hemisphere severity and that modified scoring can mitigate this bias [^117GVzVU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about neglect until I double-check the prevalence and its functional impact with sensitive measures. Using behavioral measures like the Catherine Bergego Scale, neglect signs are extremely common in right hemisphere stroke admissions to rehab, approaching 80–86%, with moderate–severe neglect linked to less daily functional gains and reduced rates of community discharge, so I need to factor severity into prognostication and care planning [^11297YWZ]. I should also verify test sensitivity differences: comprehensive batteries are more sensitive than any single test, and real-world behavioral assessments detect neglect in about 85% of right hemisphere cases, which explains why bedside paper-and-pencil tests may miss clinically meaningful neglect in daily life [^113zsVaf]. Next, I will examine subtype anatomy carefully: viewer-centered neglect severity tracks with angular gyrus and posterior frontal hypoperfusion, whereas stimulus-centered neglect severity aligns with superior temporal hypoperfusion, indicating dissociable reference frames and emphasizing the need for precise phenotyping in the acute phase [^114t7Xmy].

> Hmm, wait a minute — anosognosia for hemiplegia is often transient, so I should verify its time course and correlates to avoid overattribution. In prospective cohorts, prevalence falls from roughly one-third in the hyperacute phase to under one-fifth at one week and around 5% at six months, with shifting determinants from proprioceptive loss early to visuospatial neglect and disorientation later, implying dynamic monitoring systems and the need for repeated assessment rather than a single timepoint conclusion [^114wgmW1]. I need to check subcortical contributions too: recent lesion mapping suggests basal ganglia and thalamic involvement in body ownership disturbances and anosognosia, reinforcing that cortex-only models are incomplete and that cortico-subcortical disconnection may be central to impaired self-awareness after right hemisphere stroke [^117J5KgR].

> Let me now examine perceptual-attentional syndromes adjacent to neglect, but I should confirm they are not conflated. Visual extinction can co-occur with neglect yet is dissociable, with lesion-symptom mapping implicating right inferior parietal cortex for extinction severity and more distributed dorsal fronto-parietal substrates for classic neglect, so I should screen for both and not assume one from the other [^117NiC5c]. I should double-check with higher-cred lesion mapping too: multivariate analyses in acute stroke corroborate the distinct neural correlates of extinction using performance-based indices, strengthening the evidence that extinction is not merely "mild neglect" but a separable deficit needing targeted testing [^113HZvkp]. Regarding conjugate eye deviation, I need to be careful: it is more frequent and persistent after right hemisphere injury and correlates with larger infarct volumes and frontal–temporoparietal involvement, but I should avoid overinterpreting localization specificity since patterns are heterogeneous across cohorts [^1139MTM9] [^1176qoPe].

> I will now examine motor features, ensuring I separate primary contralesional weakness from ipsilesional control deficits, because the latter are easy to miss. Contralateral hemiparesis is expected, but I should confirm ipsilesional abnormalities after right hemisphere damage, particularly impaired final position accuracy and underuse of the ipsilesional limb in motor neglect — phenomena that reflect lateralized control and failures of action inhibition rather than mere compensation [^112b7Sbb]. Let me verify the neuroanatomy of motor neglect: right putamen and motor association areas are implicated in a failure to suppress ipsilesional motor programs, supporting a mechanism of disinhibited competing actions that delays intended contralesional movements [^113c24ZX]. But wait, I should also link motor recovery to spatial attention recovery cautiously: longitudinal data show neglect recovery tracking with contralesional upper-limb motor control improvements, indicating neglect as a negative prognostic factor for motor rehabilitation, though causality likely reflects shared fronto-parietal network recovery dynamics [^115Dkkuf].

> Next, I should review cognitive and behavioral syndromes tied to right hemisphere network dominance for arousal and attention, but let me verify each association. Post-stroke delirium is more frequent with right hemisphere damage and coexists with neglect, with fMRI connectivity showing decreased right basal forebrain–brainstem coupling predicting neglect severity and compensatory hyperconnectivity to the unaffected hemisphere correlating with delirium, highlighting arousal-network dysfunction and interhemispheric imbalance as treatment targets [^115mJurC]. I need to check language findings carefully to avoid implying crossed aphasia: sentence comprehension impairments after right IFG damage often reflect domain-general executive disruption rather than atypical language lateralization, and these deficits can be long-lasting, so counseling should anticipate nonaphasic comprehension challenges in right hemisphere stroke survivors [^115b14Pi]. Let me also verify spatial delusions: place misidentification syndromes are not rare after right hemisphere stroke, typically cluster toward "home-biased" mislocalizations, last a median of several days, and relate to decoupling of belief-associated networks with a dual frontothalamic and occipitotemporal disconnection pattern, so mislabeling as delirium can lead to mismanagement if we do not examine phenomenology carefully [^1162Gh4X] [^116ZgmpY].

> I need to ensure the anatomical synthesis reflects network, not single-node, pathology. The right fronto-parietal attention network is central for spatial orienting and neglect persistence across acute and chronic stages, and broad cognitive-stroke reviews emphasize network-level disruption over focal lesions alone, which aligns with clinical heterogeneity observed at the bedside [^113sS4pk]. Wait, let me verify insular contributions before overstating: lesion-behavior mapping implicates right insular involvement across multiple vestibular-spatial and self-awareness phenomena, though isolated insular lesions are insufficient, implying the insula is a crucial hub within wider vestibular–attention circuits rather than a sole generator of these deficits [^112QvTgL]. I should also anchor neglect subtypes anatomically with perfusion data: viewer-centered neglect's association with angular gyrus and posterior frontal hypoperfusion, and stimulus-centered neglect's link to superior temporal hypoperfusion, reinforce a reference frame–specific topology that can guide targeted neurorehabilitation strategies [^114t7Xmy].

> Now, let me evaluate prognosis and functional implications, but I should separate system-level effects from patient-level biology. Right hemisphere stroke patients often have longer hospital stays in some cohorts, likely reflecting underrecognition and delayed treatment in the hyperacute window, although this can vary by system and adjustment strategy, so I should not assume universal prolongation without context [^115pBjQw]. I need to check functional recovery patterns: spontaneous partial recovery of neglect occurs in fewer than half during the acute period, with persistent deficits in attention and executive function commonly observed chronically, which aligns with clinical experience of incomplete remediation despite therapy [^115Dkkuf] [^113sS4pk]. I should also confirm domain-specific impacts: right hemisphere lesions disproportionately impair driving-related directed and sustained attention, and caregiver strain increases with anosognosia and poorer survivor function, highlighting the need for caregiver support and fitness-to-drive assessments during recovery planning [^113F8qUJ] [^112Q9u9Y]. Finally, I should remember that psychosis and delusional misidentifications are more often linked to right frontal–temporal–parietal and caudate lesions after stroke, warranting proactive neuropsychiatric screening in appropriate cases [^112TQy7j].

> Next, I should review assessment implications with an eye toward reducing right–left measurement bias. The standard NIHSS underweights right hemisphere deficits such as neglect relative to language, and empiric modification by increasing neglect weighting improves correlation with lesion volume in right MCA stroke, suggesting a path toward more equitable severity scoring when right hemisphere involvement is suspected [^117GVzVU]. Hold on, I should verify the comparative sensitivity of tools: behavioral measures of daily-life neglect outperform single paper-and-pencil tests, and high detection rates in right hemisphere cohorts argue for systematic use of instruments like the CBS and functional batteries rather than relying solely on cancellation or line bisection, which can miss ecologically relevant deficits [^113zsVaf] [^11297YWZ]. I need to ensure domain coverage too: integrating BIT performance and driving simulator metrics captures extrapersonal neglect and sustained attention lapses that bear directly on safety and independence, complementing bedside screens [^113F8qUJ].

> Let me now articulate critical distinctions, double-checking that I do not overgeneralize across hemispheres. As a rule of thumb, right hemisphere stroke preferentially produces spatial-awareness and attention-arousal deficits while left hemisphere stroke preferentially produces language deficits, but individual variability in lateralization is substantial and must be considered in precision neurology, so I should always anchor in the patient's phenotype, not only laterality heuristics [^113sS4pk] [^114JpSVv]. I should confirm dissociations: extinction and neglect are dissociable at the behavioral and anatomical levels, and anosognosia for hemiplegia reflects distinct monitoring processes separate from neglect awareness, which prevents conflating syndromes during prognosis and counseling [^117NiC5c] [^113HZvkp] [^114wgmW1]. But wait, what if the bedside picture blurs these boundaries? That is precisely why structured batteries and repeated assessments over time are necessary to track syndrome evolution and recovery trajectories in right hemisphere stroke [^113sS4pk].

> In summary, I need to synthesize a clinically usable cluster without losing the network perspective. Right hemispheric stroke typically manifests as a syndromic constellation dominated by spatial attention failure (neglect, extinction, gaze deviation), self-awareness disturbances (anosognosia, spatial delusions), behavioral dysregulation linked to arousal-network imbalance (delirium), bilateral motor impact including ipsilesional control deficits, and right-dominant attention–arousal network dysfunction, with prognosis tightly coupled to neglect severity and network recovery rather than lesion size alone, especially when severity scales are adjusted to capture right hemisphere deficits more equitably [^113sS4pk] [^117GVzVU] [^114t7Xmy] [^113HZvkp] [^115mJurC]. I should double-check the strength of evidence underpinning key nodes in this chain: high-credibility sources support the centrality of cognitive networks, the benefit of neglect-weighted severity scoring, reference frame–specific neglect substrates, and dissociation of extinction from neglect, which collectively justify targeted assessment and rehabilitation strategies tailored to right hemisphere network dysfunctions [^113sS4pk] [^117GVzVU] [^114t7Xmy] [^113HZvkp].

Right hemispheric stroke typically presents with **left-sided hemineglect** [^11297YWZ] [^114t7Xmy] and **anosognosia for hemiplegia** [^114wgmW1], often with left visual field deficits, left hemiparesis, and left hemisensory loss. Patients may show **conjugate eye deviation to the right** [^1139MTM9] [^1176qoPe], impaired spatial orientation, constructional/apraxic errors, and prosopagnosia [^113sS4pk] [^114JpSVv]. Right hemisphere strokes are frequently under-recognized, leading to delayed treatment and worse outcomes [^1119CWjV] [^115pBjQw].

## Cognitive and perceptual deficits

### Hemispatial neglect

- **Definition**: Failure to attend to the left side of space or body [^113sS4pk].
- **Prevalence**: 86% in right hemisphere stroke [^113zsVaf]; severity predicts poorer functional outcomes [^11297YWZ].
- **Types**: Egocentric (viewer-centered) and allocentric (stimulus-centered) neglect [^114t7Xmy].
- **Associated regions**: Right inferior parietal lobule, superior temporal cortex, posterior frontal cortex [^114t7Xmy].

---

### Anosognosia

- **Definition**: Unawareness or denial of deficits, especially hemiplegia [^114wgmW1].
- **Prevalence**: 32% hyperacute, 18% subacute, 5% chronic [^114wgmW1].

---

### Visual extinction

- **Definition**: Failure to perceive left stimuli when presented bilaterally [^113HZvkp].
- **Prevalence**: 24.3% in right hemisphere stroke [^111FpGVc].
- **Associated regions**: Right inferior parietal cortex [^117NiC5c] [^113HZvkp].

---

### Spatial disorientation and navigational deficits

Spatial disorientation and navigational deficits involve **impaired spatial orientation and navigation**. These impairments are associated with the right posterior hippocampus and parietal cortex [^113s49rg] [^114JpSVv].

---

### Constructional and dressing apraxia

Constructional and dressing apraxia involve **difficulty with spatial tasks and dressing**. They are linked to the right parietal and frontal lobes [^113sS4pk].

---

### Prosopagnosia

Prosopagnosia is **impaired recognition of familiar faces**. It localizes to the right fusiform gyrus and inferior occipital cortex [^114JpSVv] [^113sS4pk].

---

## Motor and sensory deficits

### Left hemiparesis and hemisensory loss

Left hemiparesis and hemisensory loss describe **weakness and sensory loss on the left**. These deficits arise from involvement of the right motor and sensory cortices, internal capsule, and thalamus.

---

### Conjugate eye deviation

Conjugate eye deviation is characterized by **rightward gaze deviation** [^1139MTM9]. It is associated with the right frontal eye fields and temporoparietal cortex [^1176qoPe].

---

### Motor neglect

Motor neglect denotes **underuse of the left limb** [^113c24ZX] that is not explained by weakness. It is associated with the right putamen and motor association areas.

---

## Emotional and behavioral changes

### Emotional lability and flat affect

Emotional lability and flat affect present as **emotional instability** or a blunted affect. These changes are linked to involvement of the right frontal and temporal lobes [^114JpSVv].

---

### Impulsivity and disinhibition

Impulsivity and disinhibition present as **inappropriate behavior and poor impulse control**. They are associated with right frontal lobe dysfunction [^114JpSVv].

---

### Depression and anxiety

Depression and anxiety are **mood disturbances** after stroke. They are associated with right frontal and temporal lobe involvement.

---

## Clinical implications and management

### Diagnostic challenges

Diagnostic challenges include **under-recognition** [^1119CWjV], as neglect and anosognosia lead to delayed presentation and treatment. The NIHSS also underestimates right hemisphere deficits, leading to underestimation of severity [^117GVzVU].

---

### Rehabilitation strategies

Rehabilitation employs a **multidisciplinary approach** with occupational, physical, and speech therapy. Neglect-specific interventions include visual scanning, prism adaptation, and optokinetic stimulation [^114NnHAm]. Management of anosognosia emphasizes education, safety training, and caregiver involvement.

---

### Prognosis

Prognosis is influenced by neglect and anosognosia, which predict **poorer recovery and higher dependency** [^11297YWZ]. Although partial improvement occurs over time, persistent deficits are common [^115Dkkuf].

---

Right hemispheric stroke features include **left-sided neglect**, anosognosia, visual extinction, spatial disorientation, constructional and dressing apraxia, prosopagnosia, left hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, conjugate eye deviation, motor neglect, emotional lability, impulsivity, and mood disturbances. These deficits are linked to specific right hemisphere regions and require **targeted assessment and rehabilitation** [^113sS4pk].

### How we assess spatial neglect matters: Prevalence of spatial neglect as measured by the Catherine Bergego Scale and impact on rehabilitation outcomes [^11297YWZ]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and functional impact of unilateral spatial neglect on right hemisphere stroke patients in an inpatient rehabilitation facility using a multidimensional, functionally based behavioral measure (Catherine Bergego Scale [CBS]).

This was a retrospective cohort study of 742 consecutive admissions of patients with right hemispheric stroke to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Spatial neglect was assessed using the CBS. Functional impact of neglect was measured by hospital length of stay, Functional Independence Measure change per day, discharge destination, and number of falls.

As measured by the CBS, 86% of the right hemisphere stroke patients had symptoms of spatial neglect. Moderate and severe neglect was associated with less Functional Independence Measure change per day and lower rates of community discharge. The presence of neglect was not significantly associated with fall rate or length of hospital stay after controlling for admission Functional Independence Measure scores and age. The "difficulty looking left" CBS item had the strongest relationship with total CBS scores and effectively predicted Functional Independence Measure change per day and discharge destination.

Using a sensitive measure, the CBS, rates of spatial neglect are extremely high in right hemisphere stroke patients entering inpatient rehabilitation. Both identification and determination of neglect severity are extremely important given their significant relationship to rehabilitation outcomes and discharge destinations.

### Anosognosia for hemiplegia: a clinical-anatomical prospective study [^114wgmW1]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Anosognosia for hemiplegia is a common and striking disorder following stroke. Because it is typically transient and variable, it remains poorly understood and has rarely been investigated at different times in a systematic manner. Our study evaluated a prospective cohort of 58 patients with right-hemisphere stroke and significant motor deficit of the left hemibody. These patients were examined using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery at 3 days (hyperacute), 1 week (subacute), and 6 months (chronic) after stroke onset.

Anosognosia for hemiplegia was frequent in the hyperacute phase (32%) but reduced by almost half 1 week later (18%) and was only rarely seen at 6 months (5%). Anosognosia for hemiplegia was correlated with the severity of several other deficits, most notably losses in proprioception, extrapersonal spatial neglect, and disorientation. While multiple regression analyses highlighted proprioceptive loss as the most determinant factor for the hyperacute period, visuospatial neglect and disorientation were more determinant for the subacute phase. Patients with both proprioceptive loss and neglect had a significantly higher incidence of anosognosia for hemiplegia than those with only one deficit or no deficits, although a few double dissociations were observed.

Personal neglect and frontal lobe tests showed no significant relation with anosognosia for hemiplegia, nor did psychological traits such as optimism and mood. Moreover, anosognosia for neglect and prediction of performance in non-motor tasks were unrelated to anosognosia for hemiplegia, suggesting distinct monitoring processes are involved.

### Hemispheric asymmetry of gaze deviation and relationship to neglect in acute stroke [^1139MTM9]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Using data from the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST), the authors studied the anatomy of gaze deviation (GD) after stroke and its co-occurrence with neglect. GD was more frequent and persistent after right hemisphere damage. GD was most common with lesions involving the frontal lobes, although rates with lesions restricted to other hemispheric regions were not significantly different. There was no difference in its rate of co-occurrence with neglect between right- and nonright-handed patients.

### Cognitive deficits after stroke [^113sS4pk]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Cognition is a central feature of human existence and brain function. Cognitive deficits are common following a stroke and may strongly impact functional outcomes. Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of cognitive functions in the healthy state, and this new body of knowledge promises to open new avenues for understanding and treating poststroke impairments, including cognitive deficits. The five reviews in this Focused Update, authored by an international cast of experts, provide excellent insights on cognitive syndromes that commonly contribute to poststroke disability: neglect, aphasia, apraxia, loss of executive function, and memory disorders.

Cognitive impairment remains a major source of morbidity after stroke; these reviews address this problem by considering clinical presentations, pathophysiology, measurement tools, and treatment approaches. In doing so, they highlight several key questions and critical gaps. Several issues emerge as common across cognitive domains poststroke and are summarized herein. There is a need for improved methods to measure cognitive impairments, as well as for improved insights into the pathophysiology of symptom onset and mechanisms of recovery after stroke, including validated biomarkers. These five state-of-the-art summaries are sure to prove useful toward these goals.

### Difference in recognition of right and left hemispheric stroke [^1119CWjV]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

Symptoms of cerebrovascular events differ depending on the hemisphere in which the lesion arises, thereby affecting disease recognition and management. We aimed to establish whether left and right hemispheric strokes are unequally distributed in inpatients. We obtained data from a large hospital-based stroke registry in Germany. Of the patients, 11,328 (56%) had left hemispheric events, and 8,769 (44%) had right-sided lesions (p < 0.0001). Age, stroke severity, and time from symptom onset to admission were significantly associated with left hemispheric stroke, suggesting a selection effect. Difficulties in the recognition of symptoms due to right hemispheric stroke challenge efforts to optimize stroke management, particularly in the critical early hours of stroke.

### Neglect scoring modifications in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improve right hemisphere stroke lesion volume prediction [^117GVzVU]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) does not equitably assess stroke severity in the two cerebral hemispheres. By attributing a maximum of two points for neglect and seven for language, it undervalues right hemisphere deficits. We aimed to investigate if NIHSS equally predicts right hemisphere lesion volumes in patients with and without neglect, and if a modification of the neglect scoring rules could increase its predictive capacity.

- **Methods**: We analyzed a prospective cohort of acute right middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke patients. First, we calculated the correlation between NIHSS scores and lesion volume and analyzed the partial correlation of neglect. Then, we applied different modifications in the neglect scoring rules and investigated how they interfered with lesion volume predictive capacity.

- **Results**: A total of 162 ischemic stroke patients were included, 108 with neglect and 54 without. The correlation between lesion volume and NIHSS was lower in patients with neglect (r = 0.540 vs. r = 0.219, p = 0.004) and neglect was a statistically significant covariate in the partial correlation analysis between NIHSS and lesion volume (p = 0.017). With the neglect score tripled and with the duplication or triplication of all neglect modalities, the correlation was significantly higher than with the standard NIHSS (p = 0.043, p = 0.005, p = 0.001, respectively). With these modifications, neglect was no longer a significant covariable in the partial correlation between lesion volume and NIHSS.

A modification of NIHSS improves the equitable assessment of stroke severity across both cerebral hemispheres by adjusting the neglect scoring rules, enhancing its predictive accuracy for right hemisphere stroke lesion volume.

### Clinical presentation and neural correlates of stroke-associated spatial delusions [^116ZgmpY]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

In this work, we analyzed the clinical phenomenology and neural correlates of stroke‐associated spatial delusions. First, we characterized the location of misidentified places and described the general phenotypic features of the syndrome. We demonstrated that the duration of spatial delusions is moderately correlated with the structural decoupling of belief‐associated functional networks. Second, we reported associated clinical features, such as the patients' knowledge about the location of the misidentified places and their orientation in time. Third, we described the most common patterns of patients' responses according to spatial delusion subtypes and provided representative examples to facilitate recognition and diagnosis. Finally, we showed that case clustering based on structural disruption of familiarity/unfamiliarity‐associated functional regions poorly matches the clinical classification.

The large majority of patients localized the misidentified place closer to their homes than to the hospital. Limbic‐related models of delusional misidentifications support that misidentified stimuli tend to be emotionally relevant for patients, and an association between spatial delusions and structural disconnection of limbic structures has been established.

Belief, as a neural process, can be defined as the integration of perceived information with internal representations of personal significance and emotional value. Distinct neural systems in the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system mediate the states of assent, dissent, and uncertainty.

### Visual extinction in relation to visuospatial neglect after right-hemispheric stroke: Quantitative assessment and statistical lesion-symptom mapping [^117NiC5c]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Visual neglect and extinction are two common neurological syndromes in patients with right-hemispheric brain damage. Whether and how these two syndromes are associated or share common neural substrates is still a matter of debate.

- **Methods**: To address these issues, the authors investigated 56 patients with right-hemispheric stroke using a novel diagnostic test to detect extinction and neglect. In this computerized task, subjects responded to target stimuli in uni- and bilateral stimulation conditions, with detection probabilities being assessed. A cluster-analytical approach identified 18 patients with neglect and 13 patients with extinction. Statistical lesion-symptom mapping analyses with measures for extinction and neglect were performed.

- **Results**: Extinction and neglect co-occurred in a subset of patients but were also observed independently from each other, thereby constituting a double dissociation. Lesions within the right inferior parietal cortex were significantly associated with the severity of visual extinction. Visuospatial neglect was related to damage of fronto-parietal brain regions, with parieto-occipital areas affecting line bisection and dorsal fronto-parietal areas affecting cancellation task performance, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: Quantifying lesion-induced symptoms with this novel paradigm shows that extinction and neglect are dissociable syndromes in patients with right-hemispheric stroke. Furthermore, extinction and neglect can be related to differential neural substrates, with extinction being related to focal brain damage.

### Right-hemispheric processing of non-linguistic word features: Implications for mapping language recovery after stroke [^112ioeRG]. Human Brain Mapping (2013). Low credibility.

Verbal stimuli often induce right-hemispheric activation in patients with aphasia following a left-hemispheric stroke. This right-hemispheric activation is commonly attributed to functional reorganization within the language system. Yet, previous evidence suggests that functional activation in right-hemispheric homologues of classic left-hemispheric language areas may partly be due to processing nonlinguistic perceptual features of verbal stimuli.

We used functional MRI (fMRI) to clarify the role of the right hemisphere in the perception of nonlinguistic word features in healthy individuals. Participants made perceptual, semantic, or phonological decisions on the same set of auditorily and visually presented word stimuli.

- **Perceptual decisions**: Required judgements about stimulus-inherent changes in font size (visual modality) or fundamental frequency contour (auditory modality).
- **Semantic judgement**: Required subjects to decide whether a stimulus is natural or man-made.
- **Phonological decision**: Required a decision on whether a stimulus contains two or three syllables.

Compared to phonologic or semantic decision, nonlinguistic perceptual decisions resulted in a stronger right-hemispheric activation. Specifically, the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), an area previously suggested to support language recovery following a left-hemispheric stroke, displayed modality-independent activation during perceptual processing of word stimuli. Our findings indicate that activation of the right hemisphere during language tasks may, in some instances, be driven by a "nonlinguistic perceptual processing".

### Clinical implications of brain asymmetries [^114JpSVv]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2024). High credibility.

No two human brains are alike, and the rise of precision medicine in neurology underscores the importance of understanding individual variability in brain structure and function, rendering every brain unique. Functional and structural brain asymmetries are a fundamental principle of brain organization. Recent research suggests substantial individual variability in these asymmetries, which must be considered in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an overview of brain asymmetries, variations in such asymmetries, and their relevance in the clinical context. We review recent findings on brain asymmetries in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as in specific learning disabilities, with an emphasis on large-scale database studies and meta-analyses.

We also highlight the relevance of asymmetries for disease symptom onset in neurodegenerative diseases and their implications for lateralized treatments, including brain stimulation. We conclude that alterations in brain asymmetry are not sufficiently specific to act as diagnostic biomarkers. However, they can serve as meaningful symptom or treatment response biomarkers in certain contexts. Based on these insights, we provide several recommendations for neurological clinical practice.

### The importance of the insular cortex for vestibular and spatial syndromes [^112QvTgL]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to identify the neuroanatomical correlates and associations of neuropsychological syndromes after acute unilateral right-hemisphere brain lesions. The neuropsychological syndromes considered were orientation in three-dimensional space, such as tilts of the subjective visual vertical or the subjective haptic vertical, pusher syndrome, visual neglect, and unawareness of paresis (anosognosia for hemiparesis). These neuropsychological phenomena have been found to occur separately or in different combinations after lesions to the right insular cortex.

- **Method**: Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 82 patients with acute right-hemispheric stroke. A lesion-behavior mapping analysis was conducted to specify the neuroanatomical correlates of the above-mentioned neuropsychological syndromes.

- **Results**: In all analyses of the individual neuropsychological syndromes, the insular cortex was affected.

- **Conclusions**: Thus, the insular cortex is involved in (self-)perception and orientation within a three-dimensional space. Since isolated lesions of the insular cortex did not induce the above neuropsychological phenomena, other regions must also be involved.

### Mentalizing the body: Spatial and social cognition in anosognosia for hemiplegia [^11299Ev2]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with anosognosia for hemiplegia after right-hemisphere stroke deny the existence of contralesional motor deficits. Besharati et al. show that such patients are impaired in social cognition tasks requiring third-person perspective-taking. A reduced ability to disengage from the first-person perspective may explain the patients' reduced bodily self-awareness.

### Brain network dysfunction in poststroke delirium and spatial neglect: An fMRI study [^115mJurC]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Delirium, an acute reduction in cognitive functioning, hinders stroke recovery and contributes to cognitive decline. Right-hemisphere stroke is linked with higher delirium incidence, likely due to the prevalence of spatial neglect (SN), a right-brain disorder of spatial processing. This study tested if symptoms of delirium and SN after right-hemisphere stroke are associated with abnormal function of the right-dominant neural networks specialized for maintaining attention, orientation, and arousal.

- **Methods**: Twenty-nine participants with right-hemisphere ischemic stroke undergoing acute rehabilitation completed delirium and SN assessments and functional neuroimaging scans. Whole-brain functional connectivity of four right-hemisphere seed regions in the cortical-subcortical arousal and attention networks was assessed for its relationship to validated SN and delirium severity measures.

- **Results**: Of 29 patients, 6 (21%) met the diagnostic criteria for delirium and 16 (55%) for SN. Decreased connectivity of the right basal forebrain to the brain stem and basal ganglia predicted more severe SN. Increased connectivity of the arousal and attention network regions with the parietal, frontal, and temporal structures in the unaffected hemisphere was also found in more severe delirium and SN.

- **Conclusions**: Delirium and SN are associated with decreased arousal network activity and an imbalance of cortico-subcortical hemispheric connectivity. Better understanding of the neural correlates of poststroke delirium and SN will lead to improved neuroscience-based treatment development.

### Network dynamics engaged in the modulation of motor behavior in stroke patients [^115dNbvP]. Human Brain Mapping (2018). Low credibility.

Stroke patients with motor deficits typically exhibit enhanced neural activity in several cortical areas when moving their affected hand. However, healthy individuals may also show higher levels of neural activity in tasks with greater motor demands. This raises the question of whether stroke-related overactivity reflects performance-level-associated recruitment of neural resources or stroke-induced neural reorganization.

We investigated which areas in the lesioned brain enable flexible adaptation to varying motor demands compared to healthy subjects. Eleven well-recovered left-hemispheric chronic stroke patients were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Motor system activity was assessed for fist closures at increasing movement frequencies, performed with either the affected/right or unaffected/left hand.

- **Neural activity in stroke patients**: In patients, an increasing movement rate of the affected hand was associated with stronger neural activity in the ipsilesional/left primary motor cortex (M1). Unlike healthy controls, this activity was also observed in the contralesional/right dorsolateral premotor cortex (PMd) and the contralesional/right superior parietal lobule (SPL).

- **Connectivity analyses**: Analyses using dynamic causal modeling revealed stronger coupling of the right SPL onto the affected/left M1 in patients, but not in controls, when moving the affected/right hand, independent of movement speed. Furthermore, coupling of the right SPL was positively correlated with the "active" ipsilesional/left M1 when stroke patients moved their affected/right hand with increasing movement frequency.

In summary, these findings indicate distinct patterns of neural activity and connectivity in stroke patients, highlighting the adaptive potential of the lesioned brain regions in response to varying motor demands.

### The right hemisphere is important for driving-related cognitive function after stroke [^113F8qUJ]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). High credibility.

Considering the quality of life following a stroke, car driving is one of the most important abilities for returning to the community. In this study, directed attention and sustained attention, which are thought to be crucial for driving, were examined. Identification of specific brain structure abnormalities associated with post-stroke cognitive dysfunction related to driving ability would help in determining fitness for car driving following a stroke.

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 57 post-stroke patients (51 men; mean age, 63 ± 11 years) who were assessed for attention deficit using a standardized test (the Clinical Assessment for Attention, CAT), which includes a Continuous Performance Test (CPT)-simple version (CPT-SRT), the Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT), and a driving simulator. The simulator included handle tasks for dividing attention and measurements of simple and selective reaction times for sustained attention. A statistical non-parametric map (SnPM) that displayed the association between lesion location and cognitive function for car driving was created.

- **Map analysis**: From the SnPM analysis, overlay plots were localized to the right hemisphere during handling the hit task for bilateral sides (left hemisphere damage is related to right-side neglect, and right hemisphere damage is related to left-side neglect) and during simple and selective reaction times (false recognition was related to damage of both hemispheres).

- **Regression analysis**: A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the importance of both hemispheres, especially the right hemisphere, for cognitive function and car driving ability.

### Poststroke psychosis: a systematic review [^112TQy7j]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The majority of patients were found to have right hemisphere lesions, in line with a large body of evidence suggesting that right hemisphere pathology is associated with a range of perceptual anomalies and pathologies of belief. The regions most affected included the right frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, as well as the right caudate nucleus, supporting findings from previous case series on poststroke psychosis and mirroring findings in psychosis after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, it is worth bearing in mind that left hemisphere strokes are more likely to result in language and communication problems, which may impede the assessment of psychosis; therefore, these patients may be under-represented in the literature. It is also worth noting that these findings are largely based on clinical radiological assessments. At the time of writing, we are only aware of two studies that have used voxel-based lesion mapping across patients with stroke to generate maps of common lesions associated with psychosis. Devine et al. examined lesion location in three patients with poststroke psychosis, finding that damage to the right inferior frontal gyrus and connecting white matter tracts were common across patients. More recently, Darby et al. used lesion network mapping in 17 stroke patients with misidentification delusions, identifying the left retrosplenial cortex as the only brain area functionally connected to all lesion sites, potentially highlighting its role in the etiology of poststroke psychosis. Additional studies using these more systematic approaches are clearly needed to better clarify how damage to these areas contributes to the condition.

### Randomized controlled trial on hemifield eye patching and optokinetic stimulation in acute spatial neglect [^114NnHAm]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

Right hemisphere stroke patients frequently experience spatial neglect, a severe lack of awareness for contralesional hemispace. Although neglect is among the strongest predictors for poor functional outcomes after stroke, there is no established therapy, particularly not for the acute stage.

- **Methods**: In a randomized controlled trial, we compared the combined treatment of hemifield eye patching and repetitive optokinetic stimulation in acute stroke patients with neglect to the spontaneous course. Outcome measures included a neuropsychological test battery for neglect, scales of functional independence, and clinical impairment. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (day 1), post-treatment (day 8), and at 1-month follow-up (day 30).

- **Results**: Final analysis included 21 acute right hemisphere stroke patients with neglect (23 enrolled, 2 lost to follow-up) allocated either to the treatment (1-week hemifield eye patching and daily sessions of optokinetic stimulation, n = 11) or the control group (no neglect-specific treatment, n = 10). At baseline, both groups did not differ in neuropsychological test performance, clinical impairment, or functional disability. At the post-treatment session, both groups had improved in all these measures, and results were stable or further improved at follow-up. However, there was no significant difference in this change between the treatment and the control group.

- **Conclusions**: An early intervention of combined hemifield eye patching and optokinetic stimulation in acute stroke patients with spatial neglect has no additional benefit over spontaneous recovery.

### Hyperacute cognitive stroke syndromes [^113d1DmB]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Cognitive syndromes are common clinical manifestations of hyperacute stroke and may be the single or dominant presenting features. They are related to acute dysfunction of complex integrated distributed functional networks serving different cognitive domains. The most common cortical syndromes include nonfluent or fluent aphasia, neglect, color agnosia, pure alexia, and Balint's syndrome. Disturbances of declarative memory are common following posterior cerebral artery and thalamic strokes. Abulia can follow thalamic, caudate, and capsular lesions. Intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhages can cause prominent neuropsychological changes. Disorientation is present in about 40% of acute stroke patients, and delirium complicates the course of 25% of acute strokes. Some hyperacute cognitive stroke syndromes are useful indicators of later disability. Cognitive syndromes may pose special difficulties to neurology residents unless formal teaching in neuropsychology and psychiatry is included in their training programs.

### Clinical presentation and neural correlates of stroke-associated spatial delusions [^116LPecm]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Different forms of spatial delusions have been described, representing different poles of pathological familiarity. Place reduplication typifies hypofamiliarity for places and corresponds to the original description made by Pick; that is, the patients are convinced that they are in a replica of the original place. Chimeric assimilation is characterized by the fusion or combination of two different places (e.g. the hospital is inside the patient's home). In confabulatory mislocation, patients believe that they are in a place that is substantially different from the real one (e.g. believing to be at home instead of being at the hospital). Both embody place hyperfamiliarity.

At the structural and functional levels, spatial delusions are associated with a dual pattern of structural disconnection involving right frontothalamic and right occipitotemporal circuits, which prompts structural–functional decoupling of belief, familiarity, and place‐associated functional networks. At the clinical level, the striking incongruence between the patient's conviction and the surrounding environment may markedly disturb the patient's behavior. Although traditionally seen as a rare syndrome, evidence suggests that spatial delusions can be a frequent manifestation of right hemisphere lesions, particularly in the acute phase of right hemisphere strokes. So far, the available knowledge about spatial delusions' clinical features is mainly based on case reports and small case series. Misdiagnosis of spatial delusions as delirium or psychomotor agitation may lead to erroneous approaches in terms of treatment and management.

### The neuroanatomy of visual extinction following right hemisphere brain damage: Insights from multivariate and Bayesian lesion analyses in acute stroke [^111SnDDG]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Low credibility.

For a subset of 39 patients without visual field defects (mean age = 56.7 years, SD = 11.2; 15 females, mean time between stroke and testing 3.4 days, SD = 2.1, range 0–7 days), visual extinction was additionally assessed using a computerized test with time‐critical target presentation that allowed measurement of performance during both unilateral and bilateral trials and the calculation of a so-called "extinction index" (Vossel et al.). Each trial started with a central white fixation cross (0.6° × 0.6° visual angle) presented on a black background for a duration of 500 ms. Patients were instructed to continuously fixate this fixation cross.

This was followed by the presentation of a peripheral white target stimulus on the horizontal midline at an eccentricity of 10.0° visual angle for a duration of 180 ms. The target stimulus was a white geometrical shape (circle, square, triangle, or diamond; 1.5° × 1.5° visual angle), that was presented either unilaterally left, unilaterally right, or bilaterally. During bilateral presentations, the target stimuli were never identical. Patients were required to vocally report the location and shape of the target(s) presented (i.e. "circle left" or "diamond left and triangle right") while the neuropsychologist logged these vocal responses on a sheet of paper.

Finally, after the neuropsychologist had made sure the patient was fixating on the central fixation cross, the next trial was initiated by the neuropsychologist with a keyboard response. In a single session, patients were presented with 10 unilateral left, 10 unilateral right, and 10 bilateral trials.

### How right hemisphere damage after stroke can impair speech comprehension [^112iJbNz]. Brain (2018). Low credibility.

Rather than investigate all the different ways that language can break down after right hemisphere damage, the goal of Experiment 1 was to investigate the language processing impairment that was most frequently observed after right hemisphere strokes. This involved:

- **Identifying which language task** from our standard assessment battery was most frequently impaired in 109 stroke survivors (all right-handed and native English speakers) who had unilateral right hemisphere damage.
- **Selecting a sample of patients** that were impaired on this language task in the context of spared performance on other tasks (e.g. they were all able to recognize objects and match the semantic content of pictures).
- **Considering what underlying processing deficit** could explain why the selected patients were impaired on the identified language task.

By including data from 369 right-handed patients with unilateral left hemisphere strokes, we were also able to compare the language task that was most frequently impaired after right hemisphere strokes to the language task that was most frequently impaired after left hemisphere strokes.

In Experiment 2, we investigated:

- **Which right hemisphere regions** were most frequently damaged in those patients with impaired performance on the language task identified in Experiment 1.
- **How frequently damage to these regions** was observed in other patients who had right hemisphere lesions that did not impair performance on the language task identified in Experiment 1.

This allowed us to establish whether the identified lesion sites were common or…

### What are the functional outcomes of right hemisphere stroke patients with or without hemi-inattention complications? A critical narrative review and suggestions for further research [^116Adc4Z]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

- **Strengths and limitations of the review**: The review extended the work carried out by Jehkonen et al. by examining a homogeneous (versus mixed) patient sample with respect to the right hemispheric lesion (RHS). A relatively more rigorous and systematic approach to study selection and the overall review process was undertaken.

The review focused on group comparisons of functional outcomes of RHS patients with and without hemi-inattention (HI) and the relationship of HI status with functional change over time since stroke, whereas Jehkonen et al. conducted a generalized review of methodological issues from a wider range of studies, which did not always include patient comparisons in the design (HI ±). Group comparisons allow for the calculation of mean differences between patient groups and the estimation of the modeled relationship between HI (group) status and functional outcome.

This approach resulted in new insights into the data, such as identifying the lack of adjustment for established confounding factors in past studies (e.g. stroke severity, time since stroke, and age). This led to a different conclusion; no inferences could be made from the data available on either the relationship between neglect and functional outcome or the magnitude of the difference in measurable scores between patients with and without HI due to considerable heterogeneity in design and methods used to statistically analyze the data. Currently, there is an urgent need for valid predictors and indicators to support the transfer of in-patient stroke rehabilitation services to appropriate stroke survivors living in the community.

### Contralesional motor deficits after unilateral stroke reflect hemisphere-specific control mechanisms [^114Uuu7Q]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

We have proposed a model of motor lateralization, in which the left and right hemispheres are specialized for different aspects of motor control: the left hemisphere for predicting and accounting for limb dynamics and the right hemisphere for stabilizing limb position through impedance control mechanisms. Our previous studies, demonstrating different motor deficits in the ipsilesional arm of stroke patients with left or right hemisphere damage, provided a critical test of our model. However, motor deficits after stroke are most prominent on the contralesional side. Post-stroke rehabilitation has also, naturally, focused on improving contralesional arm impairment and function. Understanding whether contralesional motor deficits differ depending on the hemisphere of damage is, therefore, of vital importance for assessing the impact of brain damage on function and also for designing rehabilitation interventions specific to the laterality of damage.

We, therefore, asked whether motor deficits in the contralesional arm of unilateral stroke patients reflect hemisphere-dependent control mechanisms. Because our model of lateralization predicts that contralesional deficits will differ depending on the hemisphere of damage, this study also served as an essential assessment of our model. Stroke patients with mild to moderate hemiparesis in either the left or right arm because of contralateral stroke and healthy control subjects performed targeted multi-joint reaching movements in different directions. As predicted, our results indicated a double dissociation; although left hemisphere dama.

### The impact of lesion side on acute stroke treatment [^115pBjQw]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Only a small percentage of patients with acute stroke are treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). To investigate why patients with right-hemisphere strokes seem at high risk of not receiving rt-PA, the study was conducted in two phases.

- **Methods**: Phase 1 involved comparing demographic, clinical, and outcome measures between patients with right- and left-hemisphere strokes in the rt-PA Registry of Southwestern Ontario (RSWO). Phase 2 tested the hypotheses generated in Phase 1 using the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network (RCSN). A multiple logistic analysis was applied to detect independent predictors of rt-PA administration.

- **Results**: In Phase 1, of 179 rt-PA-treated patients, 39% had right-hemisphere syndrome. Patients with right-hemisphere strokes had a longer hospital stay (15 vs. 9 days; p = 0.03). In Phase 2, of 990 stroke patients in the RCSN, 505 (51%) had right- and 485 (49%) a left-hemisphere syndrome. Of 110 rt-PA-treated patients, 37 (34%) had a right-hemisphere syndrome (p = 0.0001). Negative independent predictors of rt-PA administration were right-hemisphere stroke (OR, 0.55; CI: 0.31 to 0.96; p = 0.037), onset-to-emergency department time (OR, 0.99; CI 0.98 to 0.99; p = 0.04), and CNS score (OR, 0.78; CI 0.71 to 0.86; p < 0.0001). Neglect predicted rt-PA administration (OR, 2.32; CI 1.29 to 4.16; p = 0.004).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with right-hemisphere strokes are 45% less likely to be treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) compared to patients with left-hemisphere strokes. The presence of neglect was associated with a higher likelihood of receiving rt-PA treatment.

### Neglect scoring modifications in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improve right hemisphere stroke lesion volume prediction [^115E4SJp]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) does not equitably assess stroke severity in the two cerebral hemispheres. By attributing a maximum of two points for neglect and seven for language, it undervalues right hemisphere deficits. We aimed to investigate if NIHSS equally predicts right hemisphere lesion volumes in patients with and without neglect, and if a modification of the neglect scoring rules could increase its predictive capacity.

- **Methods**: We analyzed a prospective cohort of acute right middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke patients. First, we calculated the correlation between NIHSS scores and lesion volume and analyzed the partial correlation of neglect. Then, we applied different modifications in the neglect scoring rules and investigated how they interfered with lesion volume predictive capacity.

- **Results**: A total of 162 ischemic stroke patients were included, 108 with neglect and 54 without. The correlation between lesion volume and NIHSS was lower in patients with neglect (r = 0.540 vs. r = 0.219, p = 0.004), and neglect was a statistically significant covariate in the partial correlation analysis between NIHSS and lesion volume (p = 0.017). With the neglect score tripled and with the duplication or triplication of all neglect modalities, the correlation was significantly higher than with the standard NIHSS (p = 0.043, p = 0.005, p = 0.001, respectively). With these modifications, neglect was no longer a significant covariable in the partial correlation between lesion volume and NIHSS.

- **Conclusion**: A modification of NIHSS neglect scoring might improve the prediction of right hemisphere stroke lesion volume.

### Pure representational neglect after right thalamic lesion [^117FfNs4]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

After a right thalamic stroke, an 86-year-old man presented with acute pure left representational neglect in the absence of any perceptual neglect. On spatial mental imagery tasks, the patient systematically omitted items located on his left side, but only when a vantage point was given. This suggests that (1) pure representational neglect is not just a residual finding after recovery from global (perceptual and representational) neglect; (2) space representation can be coded by two independent processes: in viewer-centered or world-based (allocentric) coordinates; and (3) the right thalamus serves as a relay in the processing of spatial visual imagery.

### Predictors of cognitive level and depression severity are different in patients with left and right hemispheric stroke within the first year of illness [^115sMiSP]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Causes of cognitive impairment after stroke are not yet clear because a large number of sociodemographic and clinical variables complicate the understanding of the phenomenon. We aim to evaluate sociodemographic and clinical predictors of cognitive level and depression in subjects with different lesion laterality. We assessed 153 right (n = 87) and left (n = 66) unilateral first-ever stroke patients within the first year of illness using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-Patient Edition, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, the Barthel Index, and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Sociodemographic variables were also measured.

Sixty-two patients (41%) suffered from Major Depression (MDD), and 26 (17%) suffered from Minor Depression (MIND). An univariate analysis of variance showed that MMSE scores differed among groups of left and right stroke patients with MDD, MIND, and without depression. Notably, left stroke patients with MDD were more cognitively impaired than all other groups. This result remained valid after controlling for the effect of lesion location on cognitive level differences between the groups.

A series of stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that depression severity was a predictor of cognitive level and vice versa in left hemispheric stroke patients only. Moreover, educational level was identified as a predictor of cognitive level in right hemispheric stroke patients, while state-anger and the number of regions affected were predictors in left hemispheric stroke patients.

### Clinical presentation and neural correlates of stroke-associated spatial delusions [^1162Gh4X]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Incongruent beliefs about self-localization in space markedly disturb patients' behavior. Spatial delusions, or reduplicative paramnesias, are characterized by a firm conviction of place reduplication, transformation, or mislocation. Evidence suggests they are frequent after right hemisphere lesions, but comprehensive information about their clinical features is lacking.

- **Methods**: We prospectively screened 504 acute right-hemisphere stroke patients for the presence of spatial delusions. Their behavioral and clinical features were systematically assessed. We analyzed the correlation of their duration with the magnitude of structural disruption of belief-associated functional networks. Additionally, we described the syndrome subtypes and evaluated whether the clinical categorization could be predicted by the structural disruption of familiarity-associated functional networks using an unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm.

- **Results**: Sixty patients with spatial delusions were identified and fully characterized. Most (93%) localized the misidentified places closer to home rather than the hospital. The median time duration was 3 days (interquartile range = 1–7 days), and it was moderately correlated with the magnitude of structural-functional decoupling of belief-associated functional networks (r = 0.39, p = 0.02; beta coefficient regressing for lesion volume = 3.18, p = 0.04). Each clinical subtype had characteristic response patterns, which were reported, and representative examples were provided. Clustering based on structural disruption of familiarity and unrelated networks revealed distinct subtypes.

### Long-term cognitive outcomes after decompressive hemicraniectomy for right-hemisphere large middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke [^1123gVjZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The strengths of our study lie in the systematic cognitive screening in a substantial number of patients treated with DH, the standardization of surgical treatment aligning with indications from major trials, a long follow-up, and comprehensive clinical and radiological patient characterization. However, our study has limitations. It is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data conducted at a single center, potentially raising questions about the generalizability of our results. The lack of information on prestroke cognitive status might have, to some extent, influenced the interpretation of the results; nevertheless, in accordance with existing guidelines for performing DH, the patients included were typically young and very unlikely to have prestroke cognitive impairment.

The inclusion of patients for this study spanned approximately 20 years; although new effective reperfusion treatments for the acute stroke phase have been approved during this period, the indications for performing DH as well as the surgical techniques did not change substantially. We acknowledge that cognitive impairment was defined based on a cutoff value on MMSE, a screening tool rather than a comprehensive battery. Consequently, it is likely that higher rates of cognitive impairment might have been found if comprehensive testing had been administered. We recognize that the exclusion of a subset of patients who were not assessed at any timepoint may have led to an underestimation of the prevalence of cognitive impairment. However, MMSE is easily employed in clinical practice and serves

### Patterns of spontaneous recovery of neglect and associated disorders in acute right brain-damaged patients [^115Dkkuf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The evolutionary pattern of spontaneous recovery from acute neglect was studied by assessing cognitive deficits and motor impairments. Detailed lesion reconstruction was also performed to correlate the presence of and recovery from neglect to neural substrates.

- **Methods**: A consecutive series of right brain-damaged (RBD) patients with and without neglect underwent weekly tests in the acute phase of the illness. The battery assessed neglect deficits, neglect-related deficits, and motor impairment. Age-matched normal subjects were also investigated to ascertain the presence of non-lateralised attentional deficits. Some neglect patients were also available for later investigation during the chronic phase of their illness.

- **Results**: Partial recovery of neglect deficits was observed at the end of the acute period and during the chronic phase. Spatial attention was impaired in acute neglect patients, while non-spatial attentional deficits were present in RBD patients with and without acute neglect. A strong association was found between acute neglect and fronto-parietal lesions. Similar lesions were associated with neglect persistence. In the chronic stage, neglect recovery was paralleled by improved motor control of the contralesional upper limb, thus emphasising that neglect is a negative prognostic factor in motor functional recovery.

- **Conclusions**: These findings show that spatial attention deficits partially improve during the acute phase of the disease in less than half the patients investigated. There was an improvement in left visuospatial neglect at a later stage.

### Task-induced brain activity in aphasic stroke patients: What is driving recovery [^114mfupT]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

It is claimed that one-third of all stroke patients have an aphasic deficit as part of their presenting symptoms. Although half of these patients recover much or all of their language function, the remainder are left with a persisting and disabling impairment of communication. It is estimated that in the United States and the UK alone, the prevalence of post-stroke aphasia is 1 million and 250,000, respectively.

Not surprisingly, most studies and subsequent meta-analyses that have investigated prognosis have concluded that the initial severity of the overall stroke deficit, and of the aphasic deficit specifically, and the size of the lesion afford the most reliable indicators of prognosis. However, these factors explain only about one-third of the variability in recovery from aphasia, with lesion volume contributing little to the variance in one multiple regression analysis on 22 patients. The contribution of demographic factors, such as sex, age, premorbid intelligence, and handedness, as explanatory variables for prognosis appears to contribute even less to the prediction of final outcome; although, in one large series, it has been demonstrated that increasing age is associated with a worse prognosis.

Periodically, it is reported that infarction of certain small regions reliably results in a specific and lasting aphasic deficit, but such reports may attract further studies suggesting that the anatomical-behavioral association is not as strong as originally suggested. Publication bias also adds to the uncertainty.

### Ipsilesional motor deficits following stroke reflect hemispheric specializations for movement control [^112b7Sbb]. Brain (2007). Low credibility.

Recent reports of functional impairment in the 'unaffected' limb of stroke patients have suggested that these deficits vary with the side of the lesion. This not only supports the idea that the ipsilateral hemisphere contributes to arm movements, but also implies that such contributions are lateralized. Previous studies suggest that the left and right hemispheres are specialized for controlling different features of movement. In reaching movements, the non-dominant arm appears better adapted for achieving accurate final positions, whereas the dominant arm is better for specifying initial trajectory features, such as movement direction and peak acceleration.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether different features of control could characterize ipsilesional motor deficits following stroke. Healthy control subjects and patients with either left- or right-hemisphere damage performed targeted single-joint elbow movements of different amplitudes in their ipsilateral hemispace. We predicted that left-hemisphere damage would result in deficits in the specification of initial trajectory features, while right-hemisphere damage would lead to deficits in final position accuracy.

Consistent with our predictions, patients with left-hemisphere damage, but not those with right-hemisphere damage, showed reduced modulation of acceleration amplitude. Conversely, patients with right-hemisphere damage, but not those with left-hemisphere damage, exhibited significantly larger errors in final position, corresponding to reduced modulation of acceleration duration. Neither patient group differed from controls in terms of movement speed.

### Sensitivity of clinical and behavioural tests of spatial neglect after right hemisphere stroke [^113zsVaf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The lack of agreement regarding assessment methods is responsible for the variability in the reported rate of occurrence of spatial neglect after stroke. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity of different tests of neglect after right hemisphere stroke.

- **Methods**: Two hundred and six subacute right hemisphere stroke patients were given a test battery including a preliminary assessment of anosognosia and of visual extinction, a clinical assessment of gaze orientation and of personal neglect, and paper and pencil tests of spatial neglect in the peripersonal space. Patients were compared with a previously reported control group. A subgroup of patients (n = 69) received a behavioural assessment of neglect in daily life situations.

- **Results**: The most sensitive paper and pencil measure was the starting point in the cancellation task. The whole battery was more sensitive than any single test alone. About 85% of patients presented some degree of neglect on at least one measure. An important finding was that behavioural assessment of neglect in daily life was more sensitive than any other single measure of neglect. Behavioural neglect was considered as moderate to severe in 36% of cases. A factorial analysis revealed that paper and pencil tests were related to two underlying factors. Dissociations were found between extrapersonal neglect, personal neglect, anosognosia, and extinction. Anatomical analyses showed that neglect was more common and severe when the posterior association cortex was damaged.

The automatic rightward orientation bias is the…

### Frontotemporoparietal asymmetry and lack of illness awareness in schizophrenia [^115LoBBW]. Human Brain Mapping (2013). Low credibility.

Lack of illness awareness, or anosognosia, occurs in both schizophrenia and right hemisphere lesions due to stroke, dementia, and traumatic brain injury. In the latter conditions, anosognosia is thought to arise from unilateral hemispheric dysfunction or interhemispheric disequilibrium, which provides an anatomical model for exploring illness unawareness in other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.

- **Methods**: Both voxel-based morphometry using Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) and a deformation-based morphology analysis of hemispheric asymmetry were performed on 52 treated schizophrenia subjects, exploring the relationship between illness awareness and gray matter volume. Analyses included age, gender, and total intracranial volume as covariates.

- **Results**: Hemispheric asymmetry analyses revealed illness unawareness was significantly associated with right < left hemisphere volumes in the anteroinferior temporal lobe (t = 4.83, P = 0.051) using DARTEL, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (t = 5.80, P = 0.003) and parietal lobe (t = 4.3, P = 0.050) using the deformation-based approach. Trend level associations were identified in the right medial prefrontal cortex (t = 4.49, P = 0.127) using DARTEL. Lack of illness awareness was also strongly associated with reduced total white matter volume (r = 0.401, P < 0.01) and illness severity (r = 0.559, P < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest a relationship between anosognosia and hemispheric asymmetry in schizophrenia, supporting previous volume-based MR findings.

### What are the functional outcomes of right hemisphere stroke patients with or without hemi-inattention complications? A critical narrative review and suggestions for further research [^114T5JaX]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to critically appraise relevant studies comparing outcomes from patients with right hemisphere stroke (RHS) with or without hemi-inattention (HI). There is a widespread belief that patients with HI underachieve functionally compared to those without, although empirical evidence for this is lacking. The goal is to suggest more robust follow-up research.

- **Method**: Twelve studies published between 1995 and 2013 were critically reviewed. Two independent reviewers evaluated the design features, including sample representation, assessment, and data analysis methods. Strengths and limitations were highlighted.

- **Results**: Results were largely inconsistent. There was considerable heterogeneity within patient groups and across studies, complicating interpretation. Evidence suggested an average group disparity in scores between patients with and without HI at discharge. However, the cause of this functional disparity could not be specifically attributed to HI based on the available data and modeling results.

- **Conclusion**: The relationship between HI status and functional recovery requires further investigation in studies with stronger methodologies to ensure rigor and robustness in the results. Pending further research, HI status should not be seen as a key predictor of functional recovery or rehabilitation potential in patients with RHSs. This group should continue to receive appropriate therapeutic interventions aimed at maximizing their functional recovery post-stroke. Implications for rehabilitation derive from the findings of this review.

### Severity of hypoperfusion in distinct brain regions predicts severity of hemispatial neglect in different reference frames [^114t7Xmy]. Stroke (2009). High credibility.

Hemispatial neglect is among the most common and disabling consequences of right hemisphere stroke. Although a variety of variables have been associated with the presence or severity of neglect, the independent effects of location, severity, and volume of ischemia have not been thoroughly evaluated. Few studies have determined the specific areas involved in different types of neglect. This study aimed to identify the contributions of these variables to the severity of viewer-centered versus stimulus-centered neglect in acute ischemic right hemisphere stroke.

We studied 137 patients within 24 hours of stroke onset, utilizing MR diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging alongside a test of hemispatial neglect that distinguishes between viewer-centered and stimulus-centered neglect. Using multivariable linear regression, we identified the independent contributions of the severity of ischemia in specific locations, the volume of ischemia, and age in accounting for the severity of each neglect type.

- **Results**: Severity of hypoperfusion in the angular gyrus was the only variable that significantly and independently contributed to the severity of viewer-centered neglect. Additionally, the volume of dysfunctional tissue and hypoperfusion in the posterior frontal cortex contributed to some variability in the severity of viewer-centered neglect. In contrast, severity of hypoperfusion in the superior temporal cortex was the only variable that independently and significantly contributed to the severity of stimulus-centered neglect.

- **Conclusions**: The location, severity, and volume of ischemia collectively determine the type and severity of neglect following a right hemisphere stroke. Results also indicate that…

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

### Right hemisphere language network plasticity in aphasia [^11775jKv]. Brain (2025). Low credibility.

The role of the right hemisphere in aphasia recovery has been controversial since the 19th century. Imaging studies have sometimes found increased activation in right hemisphere regions homotopic to canonical left hemisphere language regions, but these results have been questioned due to small sample sizes, unreliable imaging tasks, and task performance confounds that affect right hemisphere activation levels even in neurologically healthy adults.

Several principles of right hemisphere language recruitment in aphasia have been proposed based on these studies: that the right hemisphere is recruited primarily by individuals with severe left hemisphere damage, that transcallosal disinhibition results in recruitment of right hemisphere regions homotopic to the lesion, and that increased right hemisphere activation diminishes to baseline levels over time. It is debated whether engagement of language homotopes reflects upregulation of weakly active right hemisphere processors in a bihemispheric language network, versus recruitment of new processors into the network.

We address these issues in 76 chronic left hemisphere stroke survivors with ongoing or prior aphasia and 69 neurologically healthy older adults using a semantic decision fMRI paradigm that elicits reliable and strongly left-lateralized individual-participant language activation and adapts to require effortful performance irrespective of participant ability levels. Right hemisphere activation was greater in stroke survivors than controls, and related to younger age, left-handedness, and higher education.

### Motor neglect associated with loss of action inhibition [^113c24ZX]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Motor neglect, the underuse of one side of the body not explained by weakness or sensory impairment, is a common consequence of stroke that is surprisingly little understood. The behavioral and neuroanatomical hallmarks of the disorder are investigated. Using a masked prime task, it was shown that when patients with left motor neglect plan to move their left hand, irrelevant right limb motor programs intrude, causing delay. Lesion analysis reveals that such asymmetry of motor programming occurs after infarcts of the right putamen and motor association areas. This demonstration of the failure to inhibit ipsilesional limb motor plans suggests potential benefit from interventions that might act to restore balance in action planning.

### The neuroanatomy of visual extinction following right hemisphere brain damage: Insights from multivariate and Bayesian lesion analyses in acute stroke [^113HZvkp]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). High credibility.

Visual extinction was assessed using a variation of the clinical confrontation technique, requiring the patient to detect the movement of the examiner's left and/or right index finger presented in the patient's left and/or right visual field. Each patient was presented with 10 unilateral left, 10 unilateral right, and 10 bilateral movements. If a patient displayed a visual field defect, care was taken to present the movements in the intact part of the visual field. In patients with lower or upper left visual field quadrantanopia (n = 3), movements were presented in the intact upper or lower visual field, respectively. In patients with left visual field hemianopia (n = 5), movements were presented in the near and/or far periphery of the intact ipsilesional visual field.

An extinction score was calculated as the percentage of bilateral trials in which the patient failed to detect the contralesional movement. The percentage of correct detection of contralesional movements during unilateral stimulation and ipsilesional movements was not recorded during the neuropsychological assessment for visual extinction. However, the extinction assessment protocol stipulated that any patient who correctly detected less than 90% of the contralesional movements during unilateral stimulation was classified as "not assessable", and these patients were excluded from the study. Moreover, trials in which the patient did not respond to the ipsilesional movement were excluded, and in those instances, a check was performed to ensure the patient understood the task.

### Distribution pattern analysis of cortical brain infarcts on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging: A hypothesis-generating approach to the burden of silent embolic stroke [^1123TC6Z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

It is well known that left hemisphere stroke lesions are overrepresented among hospitalized patients, although ischemic strokes disperse equally among both hemispheres in the general population. This lateralization inequality is commonly attributed to linguistic, dominant‐hemisphere cortical symptoms in territorial MCA and thalamic stroke. In the study, no significant differences between the left and the right side were found in small infarctions. In all likelihood, lesions of 2640 cc are assumably associated with territorial infarcts.

### Subcortical contributions to the sense of body ownership [^117J5KgR]. Brain (2024). Low credibility.

Disturbances in bodily awareness can offer important insights into the processes underlying the development of a sense of body ownership. Right-hemisphere stroke can result in disorders of self-awareness, such as disturbances of body ownership or disturbances of body agency, as well as anosognosia for hemiplegia, defined as the unawareness of sensorimotor deficits following a stroke. Anosognosia for hemiplegia has been linked to distortions in the sense of body ownership.

Traditionally, there has been a relatively strong focus on cortical functions in the neuropsychological literature on disorders of body ownership. For example, subcortical lesions damaging white matter tracts have often been interpreted as interrupting cortical functions of the areas connected by the damaged anatomical pathways (e.g. frontoparietal connections). Still, there is a growing interest in the involvement of subcortical structures themselves and their connections to cortical areas. Lesions caused by subcortical strokes are typically relatively large and involve damage to multiple cortical and subcortical regions as well as cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical white matter connections.

An examination of 85 patients with anosognosia following right-hemisphere stroke showed the involvement of subcortical damage, with areas including the thalamus, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, internal capsule, corona radiata, insula, lateral ventricles, and amygdala. In particular, basal ganglia and thalamus lesions were the most likely to account for the disturbances in body ownership observed in these patients.

### Right hemisphere dominance for understanding the intentions of others: Evidence from a split-brain patient [^115WiztQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Understanding the actions performed by other people is a key aspect of social interaction, including in clinical settings where patients learn from therapists and caregivers. While lesions of the left cerebral hemisphere induce praxic disorders, the hemispheric specialization of intention understanding remains unclear. Do patients with a right hemispheric lesion understand the intentions of other people properly? This study investigates how a split-brain patient comprehends the means (what) and intentions (why) of the actions of others.

The results show a significant left hemispheric dominance for understanding what is done and a significant right hemispheric dominance for understanding why an action is carried out. This discovery might have important clinical implications for neurological patients, especially when those with right hemisphere lesions are faced with important decisions related to interpreting others' intentions.

### How right hemisphere damage after stroke can impair speech comprehension [^115b14Pi]. Brain (2018). Low credibility.

By combining behavioral, lesion, and functional MRI data, our results demonstrate that:

- **Long-lasting speech comprehension impairments**: Frequently observed in our right-handed patients with right inferior frontal damage.
- **Explanation**: This can be explained by disruption to normal functional anatomy rather than indicating crossed aphasia or atypical language lateralization.
- **Right hemisphere regions**: The same right hemisphere regions contribute to both sentence comprehension and executive functions. Seemingly domain-specific cognitive deficits, such as language processing, can therefore be explained by disruptions to domain-general cognitive mechanisms, such as non-linguistic executive processing.

Conversely, these findings are consistent with previous reports that attribute increased right inferior frontal activity during speech comprehension, in patients with left hemisphere lesions, to a greater reliance on domain-general cognitive processing.

Clinically, our study highlights the possibility that speech comprehension difficulties after right hemisphere stroke may be long-lasting and not due to atypical language lateralization. Given that around 10 million people worldwide survive a stroke each year, the number of patients with speech comprehension difficulties after right hemisphere damage is likely to be substantial, in right-handed as well as left-handed patients. Clinical advice should therefore alert patients with right hemisphere stroke to the possibility that they may suffer from long-lasting speech comprehension difficulties rather than informing them otherwise.

### How is carer strain related to the recovery of stroke survivors with right hemisphere dysfunction? Implications for practice [^112Q9u9Y]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

Right hemisphere strokes are associated with neuro-behavioral impairments, including hemi-inattention, impulsiveness, and anosognosia, which can impede stroke recovery and adversely affect carer health. This study explored the impact of associated impairments on carer strain and depression through a mixed methods approach.

Fifty-one carer-survivor dyads were recruited from inpatient rehabilitation units and followed up for six months. Validated measures assessed survivors' physical and cognitive function, as well as carers' strain and depression levels. Survey methods captured qualitative experiences of the caring role. Data collection occurred at baseline, discharge, six weeks post-discharge, and six months. Multilevel modeling and thematic data analysis were employed.

Carer strain median scores were within normal ranges of the Caregiver Strain Index scale. Carer strain was positively linked to carer depression, the number of carers' concerns reported, and survivors' anosognosia levels. Carer strain was negatively linked to the survivors' functional and cognitive abilities. Carers' experiences differed qualitatively, with caring concerns increasing over time.

Carer strain worsens with increases in significant concerns about the rehabilitation process and poor survivor functioning skills, which potentially increase the risk of depression in carers. Consequently, improving right-hemisphere stroke survivors' recovery and nurturing the carer-survivor relationship are likely to enhance overall outcomes and caring experiences.

### Lesioned hemisphere-specific phenotypes of post-stroke fatigue emerge from motor and mood characteristics in chronic stroke [^111x8zCw]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

No clear differences were observed in motor thresholds that could enable us to distinguish left- and right-hemisphere strokes with high fatigue, despite the overall sample showing a positive relationship between threshold and fatigue level in left-hemisphere strokes. CSE assessed using TMS thresholds is highly variable in the general population, which was evident from the threshold values of the entire cohort in the present study.

CSE of the left and right hemispheres behaves differently during motor control, with asymmetries in CSE seen between the two hemispheres. The left hemisphere plays a dominant role in motor control, which is characterized by higher CSE when compared to the right hemisphere, broader activation patterns during movement, and greater thickness of the motor cortex. The asymmetry in CSE between the two hemispheres is driven by inter-hemispheric connectivity.

In a normal brain, inter-hemispheric connectivity is characterized by a net left-to-right inhibitory dominance and right-to-left excitatory dominance within the motor cortices and outside primary motor areas, resulting in higher CSE of the left hemisphere when compared to the right. In post-stroke fatigue, opposite patterns of inter-hemispheric connectivity in primary motor cortices are seen, with a shift from net left-to-right to a net right-to-left inhibitory dominance.

Given the shift in inter-hemispheric inhibition balance, those with high fatigue and left-hemisphere stroke will present with lower excitability than those without fatigue. The results of the present study are in line with this expectation.

### Conjugate eye deviation in acute stroke: Incidence, hemispheric asymmetry, and lesion pattern [^1176qoPe]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

The study focused on the clinical features and lesion patterns associated with conjugate eye deviation (CED) in acute stroke.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with supratentorial stroke (less than 6 hours after symptom onset) were prospectively recruited. CED was classified according to the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) item "gaze palsy" as forced, partial, or absent. Lesion patterns on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were analyzed in 46 patients using a normalization procedure for direct comparisons. Perfusion data were analyzed for a subset of patients.

- **Results**: Partial CED was found in 7 (6%) and forced CED in 31 (26.7%) of 116 patients. Forced and partial CED were associated with higher initial NIHSS scores compared with patients without CED (16 and 10 versus 5; P < 0.05). DWI lesion volume was larger in patients with CED (103.24 ± 102.4 mL, mean ± SD) as compared with patients without CED (17 ± 34.98 mL, P < 0.001). CED was more frequent in right hemispheric stroke (44.6% versus 23%, P < 0.02). DWI pattern analysis in patients with CED and right hemispheric stroke revealed a network of affected regions, including basal ganglia and temporoparietal cortex. In left hemispheric CED, lesions were larger than in patients without CED, but no consistent pattern could be established. In a subset of selected patients with CED, a small temporoparietal perfusion deficit was sufficient to elicit CED.

- **Conclusions**: Selective dysfunction of cortical areas involved in spatial attention and control of eye movements is sufficient to cause CED.

### Right hemisphere structural adaptation and changing language skills years after left hemisphere stroke [^114W3PgZ]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Stroke survivors with acquired language deficits are commonly thought to reach a 'plateau' within a year of stroke onset, after which their residual language skills will remain stable. Nevertheless, there have been reports of patients who appear to recover over years. Here, we analyzed longitudinal change in 28 left-hemisphere stroke patients, each more than a year post-stroke when first assessed — testing each patient's spoken object naming skills and acquiring structural brain scans twice. Some of the patients appeared to improve over time while others declined; both directions of change were associated with, and predictable given, structural adaptation in the intact right hemisphere of the brain. Contrary to the prevailing view that these patients' language skills are stable, these results imply that real change continues over years. The strongest brain-behavior associations (the 'peak clusters') were in the anterior temporal lobe and the precentral gyrus.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we confirmed that both regions are actively involved when neurologically normal control subjects name visually presented objects, but neither appeared to be involved when the same participants used a finger press to make semantic association decisions on the same stimuli. This suggests that these regions serve word-retrieval or articulatory functions in the undamaged brain. We teased these interpretations apart by reference to change in other tasks. Consistent with the claim that the real change is occurring here, change in spoken object naming was correlated with change in t

### Ptosis in patients with hemispheric strokes [^112qtP6b]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Cerebral ptosis is considered rare; it has been reported with unilateral, usually right hemispheric lesions. However, the frequency of cerebral ptosis in patients with strokes has not received systematic study.

- **Objective**: To determine the frequency of ptosis in patients with acute hemispheric stroke and to identify stroke features associated with ptosis.

- **Methods**: Eyelid function was studied in 64 consecutive patients with acute hemispheric stroke and 40 age-matched subjects with no known neurologic disease. All underwent comprehensive neuro-ophthalmologic and general neurologic examination within 48 hours of admission, including measurement of palpebral fissures, marginal reflex distance, and range of upper lid movement. Only patients who could cooperate with eyelid testing were included. Brain CT scans were obtained for all patients who had had strokes.

- **Results**: Twenty-four (37.5%) of the patients with strokes had neurogenic ptosis, which was bilateral in 10 and unilateral in 14. None of the control subjects had neurogenic ptosis. All patients with strokes with ptosis had a hemiparesis. Rightward gaze deviation and upgaze paresis were more common (p < 0.05) in the patients with ptosis compared with others who had had strokes. CT evidence of right-sided hemispheric cortical infarction was more common in patients with strokes with ptosis (p < 0.05). In five patients with large hemispheric infarction, complete bilateral or asymmetric ptosis was the first sign of imminent herniation, preceding pupillary dilation and ocular motor deficits.

Ptosis occurrence in post-stroke patients indicates association with certain stroke features, suggesting a need for further research to understand its implications and management.

### Does hemispheric lateralization influence functional and cardiovascular outcomes after stroke? an analysis of placebo-treated patients from prospective acute stroke trials [^113FpEB2]. Stroke (2008). Low credibility.

The influence of stroke lateralization on functional and cardiovascular outcomes after stroke is not well established. We evaluated the influence of hemispheric lateralization among patients enrolled in prospective acute stroke trials.

- **Methods**: We obtained data from the VISTA database for acute stroke trials which reported lateralization. Baseline data, cardiac adverse events, and 90-day outcomes were compared between right and left hemisphere stroke patients. A "hemisphere unbiased" subscore of the NIHSS, which omitted items strongly associated with lateralized cognitive deficits, was also compared for trials which reported individual NIHSS item scores. A multivariable analysis of outcome predictors was performed.

- **Results**: Three acute stroke trials met the prespecified inclusion criteria. A total of 1,644 placebo-treated patients with documented hemispheric lateralization were included in the analysis. Baseline NIHSS was higher for left hemisphere patients (mean 16.2) compared to right hemisphere patients (mean 12.8, P < 0.001); there was no difference in the "hemisphere unbiased" NIHSS subscore (10.88 left, 11.08 right, n = 687, P = 0.49). There was no significant difference between hemispheres in 90-day modified Rankin Score (3.43 left, 3.29 right, P = 0.13), mortality (22.1% left, 19.5% right, P = 0.20), or cardiac adverse events (P = 0.71). Hemispheric lateralization was not an independent predictor of outcome in the multivariable analysis after controlling for the hemispheric bias intrinsic to the NIHSS.

- **Conclusions**: There is no difference in functional outcome between patients with right or left hemisphere stroke.

### What are the functional outcomes of right hemisphere stroke patients with or without hemi-inattention complications? A critical narrative review and suggestions for further research [^1132P4tk]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Hemi-inattention (HI), commonly referred to as "neglect", is a complex, heterogeneous, and disabling condition which acutely affects up to 80% of patients with right hemisphere stroke (RHS) dysfunction. Despite considerable research and advances in the field, HI remains poorly defined as a condition per se, as supported by the use of multiple descriptors (e.g. unilateral neglect, unilateral inattention) and taxonomies in the literature.

Clinically, HI is characterized by reduced attention and/or spatial awareness to details in the environment, commonly towards the left side of the body. HI can affect one or more functional domains (e.g. sensory-motor, visual-spatial) and often co-exists with anosognosia and depression. It has been regarded as responsible for delayed and challenging rehabilitation, reduced safety awareness, poor functional outcomes, increased dependency levels, and a higher risk of institutional care.

Historically, findings from published studies have reported a disparity in functional ability scores, with patient groups affected by HI (HI+) underachieving compared to those without (HI−). Traditionally, this disparity has been largely attributed to the presence of HI, although findings from predictive models have been conflicting and inconclusive. This has led to considerable confusion and uncertainty about the clinical importance and significance of differences thought to be associated with HI. The paucity of relevant evidence-based reviews has not helped to clarify the predictive role of HI or to promote good rehabilitation practice.

### Long-term cognitive outcomes after decompressive hemicraniectomy for right-hemisphere large middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke [^111SJ24N]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

According to our in-house protocol, patients were followed up at 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years. At each follow-up, we evaluated the functional status with the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and neurological deficit with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). We also performed a cognitive screening using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). MMSE was administered by an experienced stroke specialist to all patients who attended the on-site follow-up appointment. Being one of the most widely used screening tests for cognitive functions, MMSE is composed of 11 questions encompassing orientation, attention, memory, visuospatial, and language skills, with scores ranging from 0 to 30. When patients were not able to attend the outpatient clinic, they were interviewed by telephone to record vital status, and the mRS was assessed with the help of their caregivers, attending physician, or both.

- **Cognitive outcome definition**: We set a cutoff of MMSE < 24 to define cognitive impairment. For the purpose of this study, we analyzed data from patients alive 3 months after decompressive hemicraniectomy (DH) who underwent at least one cognitive screening using MMSE over the 3-year follow-up. Because only a minority of patients with left-side strokes (15%) were able to undergo cognitive screening, we only included patients with right-sided strokes to avoid biases attributable to severe aphasia. For the same reason, we also excluded patients undergoing DH for a right-hemisphere middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction who also had contralateral territory ischemic involvement.

### Incidence of visual extinction after left versus right hemisphere stroke [^111FpGVc]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Generally, it is accepted that spatial neglect occurs predominantly following a stroke of the human right hemisphere. In contrast, it remains controversial whether extinction follows the same hemispheric asymmetry. The prevailing opinion is that the laterality of visual extinction is not as pronounced as it is for spatial neglect.

- **Methods**: To directly compare the incidence of the two disorders within the same sample, spatial neglect and visual extinction were investigated during a 1-year period in 83 consecutively admitted patients with unilateral right or left hemisphere stroke.

- **Results**: The incidence of visual extinction and spatial neglect was not significantly different, neither after left hemisphere (2.4% neglect; 4.9% extinction) nor after right hemisphere (26.2% neglect; 24.3% extinction) stroke.

- **Conclusions**: Visual extinction seems to be as asymmetrically associated with the human right hemisphere as is spatial neglect.

### Acute loss of spatial navigational skills in a case of a right posterior hippocampus stroke [^113s49rg]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

The ability to accurately navigate within an environment (known or new) is not fully understood but involves a number of highly complicated cognitive processes related to both central and peripheral nervous system structures and neuronal networks. We describe a patient who developed loss of his spatial navigational skills associated with an acute ischemic right posterior hippocampal lesion. Neuropsychological assessment displayed clear evidence of impaired visuospatial/visuoconstructional abilities with relative preservation of many other cognitive functions involving orientation, language, and verbal memory.

The underlying anatomy responsible for the navigational impairment seen in our patient could be due to impairment in the function of the right hippocampus to form, store, and retrieve new 'cognitive/spatial maps'. To our knowledge, this is one of the few documented cases demonstrating impaired navigational abilities with a relatively discrete right-sided, posterior hippocampal lesion.
