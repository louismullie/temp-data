## Question

Is Verapamil bad for the kidneys

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether verapamil is "bad for the kidneys". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether verapamil is intrinsically nephrotoxic. Then, I should review pharmacokinetics and elimination in renal impairment and dialysis. Next, I will check FDA labeling for cautions, monitoring, and any dose adjustments. After that, I will examine interaction-related risks for acute kidney injury. Finally, I will place verapamil within the chronic kidney disease care context and synthesize practical recommendations [^1161ixF3].

> Let me first confirm the question of direct nephrotoxicity. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — labels and reviews matter here. The FDA labeling for multiple verapamil products does not list intrinsic nephrotoxicity or acute kidney injury as expected adverse effects, and major reviews of drug-induced renal injury do not implicate verapamil as a typical nephrotoxin, which argues against inherent nephrotoxicity of verapamil itself [^1161ixF3] [^113T7toR] [^117WDsVr] [^115rd67s] [^113RZx3p] [^114DkfEo].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetics in renal impairment. Wait, let me verify the elimination pathways. Verapamil is extensively hepatically metabolized, with urinary excretion primarily of metabolites rather than parent drug, and it is not removed by hemodialysis; labeling therefore advises caution and clinical monitoring in patients with impaired renal function, emphasizing observation for conduction effects such as PR prolongation that would signal excess pharmacologic exposure [^115xegvx] [^111RrvD4] [^1133KeJc] [^116A4D4e].

> Now, dose adjustments — do we need them in CKD? I initially thought routine renal dose reduction was required, but wait, I should double-check the labeling. Let me reconsider: across formulations, FDA language consistently says "use with caution" in renal impairment with careful monitoring, without mandating a specific renal dose adjustment; practically, starting conservatively and titrating to effect while monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, and PR interval is the prudent approach rather than an automatic dose reduction [^115xegvx] [^111AQerQ] [^114RWHmG].

> But what about reported AKI signals with calcium channel blockers? I need to check for confounding by interactions. The well-described increased AKI risk arises when CYP3A4-inhibiting macrolides like clarithromycin are co-prescribed with CCBs, which elevates CCB exposure and can precipitate hypotension and renal hypoperfusion; importantly, this reflects an interaction-driven hemodynamic kidney injury signal rather than intrinsic nephrotoxicity of verapamil per se [^115yEMki].

> I will now examine its role in CKD beyond blood pressure control. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs such as verapamil may reduce proteinuria and can be useful adjuncts, but hold on, I should verify the hierarchy of renoprotective therapy. Guidelines and comparative evidence still prioritize renin–angiotensin system blockade (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) as first-line for renoprotection, with combinations that include a CCB often used to achieve BP targets and further reduce albuminuria when needed [^1119fbw5] [^114iftkn] [^111oHDPt].

> Let me consider advanced CKD and dialysis. Verapamil and other CCBs are not dialyzable, and their pharmacokinetics are not substantially altered by renal failure, so they can be used in dialysis patients with attention to hemodynamics; trials in dialysis populations support class use for hypertension without unique kidney safety concerns attributable to verapamil itself, again with the caveat for careful monitoring [^113acg6q] [^116hSypE] [^111RrvD4].

> I should also check the kidney transplant context. Cochrane evidence in kidney transplant recipients suggests that CCBs as a class can improve graft function and may prevent graft loss, reinforcing that CCBs are not inherently "bad for kidneys" and can be beneficial in selected renal populations when clinically indicated [^114KYp4A].

> Synthesizing this, verapamil is not "bad for the kidneys" in the sense of intrinsic nephrotoxicity; the main renal concerns are indirect and revolve around hemodynamics and drug–drug interactions. In CKD, use verapamil cautiously, avoid CYP3A4 inhibitors that raise exposure, and monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and PR interval for signs of excess effect; no routine renal dose adjustment is mandated, and the drug is not dialyzable. For renoprotection, prioritize ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, adding verapamil when clinically appropriate for blood pressure or antiproteinuric goals, with vigilant monitoring to prevent hypotension-related kidney injury [^1161ixF3] [^115xegvx] [^111oHDPt].

No, verapamil is not inherently nephrotoxic and does not directly harm the kidneys. It is generally safe for patients with normal renal function, but in those with impaired renal function, it should be used with caution and close monitoring [^113T7toR] due to the risk of **hypotension and bradycardia** that can reduce renal perfusion and precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI) [^115xegvx] [^115rd67s]. Verapamil is not removed by dialysis, so dose adjustments and careful monitoring are essential in dialysis patients [^115xegvx]. The main renal risk is from hemodynamic effects, not direct toxicity, and the risk increases with **CYP3A4 inhibitors** (e.g. clarithromycin) that raise verapamil levels [^115yEMki].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and renal excretion

Verapamil is extensively metabolized in the liver [^115xegvx], with about 70% of the dose excreted as metabolites in urine; only ~3–4% is excreted unchanged. In renal impairment, metabolites may accumulate, but verapamil itself is **not dialyzable**, so dialysis does not remove it [^1133KeJc].

---

## Clinical evidence of renal effects

### Acute kidney injury (AKI)

- **Direct nephrotoxicity**: There is no strong evidence that verapamil directly causes AKI in patients with normal renal function.

- **Hemodynamic AKI**: Verapamil can cause hypotension and bradycardia [^113T7toR], reducing renal perfusion and potentially precipitating AKI, especially in patients with preexisting renal impairment or volume depletion [^113RZx3p] [^115xegvx].

- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin) can increase verapamil levels, heightening hypotension risk and AKI [^115yEMki].

---

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression

Verapamil may reduce **proteinuria**, particularly in diabetic nephropathy, suggesting potential renoprotective effects [^114iftkn] [^115TnAhc]. Evidence does not show that verapamil accelerates **CKD progression**; it is considered safe for blood pressure control in CKD [^112G2Aap] [^114iftkn].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend cautious use of verapamil in patients with renal impairment:

- **Dose adjustment**: Start at lower doses and titrate cautiously in renal impairment [^115xegvx] [^1155PmGW].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor renal function, blood pressure, heart rate, and PR interval during therapy [^113T7toR] [^1175YE8a].

- **Dialysis patients**: Use with caution; monitor closely due to lack of dialyzability [^115xegvx] [^116A4D4e].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Populations at **higher risk** of renal complications from verapamil include patients with preexisting renal impairment, who have an increased risk of hypotension-related AKI [^115xegvx]; elderly patients [^114DkfEo], who are more susceptible to hypotension and renal perfusion changes; and those on interacting medications such as CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin), which raise verapamil levels and AKI risk [^115yEMki].

---

## Clinical management strategies

To minimize renal risks associated with verapamil:

- **Baseline assessment**: Evaluate renal function before starting therapy [^113RZx3p].

- **Dose titration**: Start low and titrate cautiously, especially in renal impairment [^1127asFK].

- **Regular monitoring**: Track renal function, blood pressure, heart rate, and PR interval [^113T7toR].

- **Avoid interactions**: Avoid or adjust interacting drugs that increase verapamil levels [^1161pVUz].

- **Patient education**: Teach patients to recognize hypotension and renal dysfunction symptoms [^115rd67s].

---

## Summary of renal risks and benefits

| **Renal risks** | **Renal benefits** |
|-|-|
| Hypotension-induced AKI [^115rd67s] | Potential reduction in proteinuria [^114iftkn] |
| Accumulation of metabolites in renal impairment [^115xegvx] | Safe blood pressure control in CKD [^115TnAhc] |
| Increased risk with interacting medications [^115yEMki] | No evidence of accelerated CKD progression [^112G2Aap] |

---

Verapamil is **not inherently nephrotoxic** but can cause hypotension-related AKI, especially in renal impairment or with interacting drugs. Use cautiously with dose titration and monitoring; it may reduce **proteinuria** [^114iftkn] and is generally safe for blood pressure control in CKD [^115TnAhc].

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^115xegvx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Use in patients with impaired hepatic function: Since verapamil is highly metabolized by the liver, it should be administered cautiously to these patients. Severe liver dysfunction prolongs the elimination half-life of verapamil to about 14 to 16 hours; hence, approximately 30% of the dose given to patients with normal liver function should be administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. Careful monitoring for abnormal prolongation of the PR interval or other signs of excessive pharmacologic effects is necessary.

Use in patients with attenuated (decreased) neuromuscular transmission: It has been reported that verapamil decreases neuromuscular transmission in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, prolongs recovery from the neuromuscular blocking agent vecuronium, and exacerbates myasthenia gravis. A dosage reduction of verapamil may be required when administered to patients with attenuated neuromuscular transmission.

Use in patients with impaired renal function: About 70% of an administered dose of verapamil is excreted as metabolites in the urine, and verapamil is not removed by hemodialysis. Until further data become available, verapamil should be administered cautiously to patients with impaired renal function. These patients should be carefully monitored for abnormal prolongation of the PR interval or other signs of overdosage.

### Calcium-channel blocker-clarithromycin drug interactions and acute kidney injury [^115yEMki]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Calcium-channel blockers are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4; EC 1.14.13.97) enzyme. Blood concentrations of these drugs may rise to harmful levels when CYP3A4 activity is inhibited. Clarithromycin is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, and azithromycin is not, which makes comparisons between these two macrolide antibiotics useful in assessing clinically important drug interactions.

- **Objective**: To characterize the risk of acute adverse events following the coprescription of clarithromycin compared with azithromycin in older adults taking a calcium-channel blocker.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, from 2003 through 2012, involving older adults (mean age, 76 years) who were newly coprescribed clarithromycin (n = 96,226) or azithromycin (n = 94,083) while taking a calcium-channel blocker (amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, or verapamil).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Hospitalization with acute kidney injury was the primary outcome, while hospitalization with hypotension and all-cause mortality were secondary outcomes examined separately. Outcomes were assessed within 30 days of a new coprescription.

- **Results**: There were no differences in measured baseline characteristics between the clarithromycin and azithromycin groups. Amlodipine was the most commonly prescribed calcium-channel blocker, used by more than 50% of patients. Coprescribing clarithromycin versus azithromycin with a calcium-channel blocker was associated with a higher risk of hospitalization with acute kidney injury (420 patients of 96,226 taking clarithromycin).

### Pharmacology behind common drug nephrotoxicities [^115rd67s]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients are exposed to numerous prescribed and over-the-counter medications. Unfortunately, drugs remain a relatively common cause of acute and chronic kidney injury. A combination of factors, including the innate nephrotoxicity of drugs, underlying patient characteristics that increase their risk for kidney injury, and the metabolism and pathway of excretion by the kidneys of the various agents administered, enhances the risk for drug-induced nephrotoxicity. This paper reviews these clinically relevant aspects of drug-induced nephrotoxicity for the clinical nephrologist.

### Drug-associated renal dysfunction and injury [^117Y69nr]. Nature Clinical Practice. Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Renal dysfunction and injury secondary to medications are common occurrences and can present as subtle injury and/or overt renal failure. Some drugs perturb renal perfusion and induce a loss of filtration capacity. Others directly injure vascular, tubular, glomerular, and interstitial cells, leading to specific losses of renal function. Clinical findings from these injuries can include microangiopathy, Fanconi syndrome, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, obstruction, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, electrolyte abnormalities, and chronic renal failure.

Understanding the mechanisms involved and recognizing the clinical presentations of renal dysfunction arising from the use of commonly prescribed medications are important for early detection and prevention of injury. This article reviews the clinical features and basic processes underlying renal injury related to the use of common drugs.

Overdosage

There is no specific antidote for verapamil overdosage; treatment should be supportive. Delayed pharmacodynamic consequences may occur with sustained-release formulations, and patients should be observed for at least 48 hours, preferably under continuous hospital care. Reported effects include hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac conduction defects, arrhythmias, hyperglycemia, and decreased mental status. In addition, there have been literature reports of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema in patients taking large overdoses of verapamil (up to approximately 9g).

In cases of acute overdosage, gastrointestinal decontamination with cathartics and whole bowel irrigation should be considered. Calcium, inotropes (i.e. isoproterenol, dopamine, and glucagon), atropine, vasopressors (i.e. norepinephrine, and epinephrine), and cardiac pacing have been used with variable results to reverse hypotension and myocardial depression. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers that was initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to this treatment when the patients received large doses (close to 1g/hour for more than 24 hours) of calcium chloride. Calcium chloride is preferred to calcium gluconate since it provides three times more calcium per volume. Asystole should be handled by the usual measures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Verapamil cannot be removed by hemodialysis.

### Multi-organ dysfunction as a presentation of calcium channel blocker intoxication [^112ydmnh]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) commonly used in managing essential hypertension and angina pectoris. Amlodipine has a low metabolic clearance, unlike other CCBs, and the advantage of a once-daily dosage to maintain a near-constant plasma concentration.

CCBs are widely prescribed cardiovascular medications with potentially lethal adverse effects, even at mild overdoses. The management of CCB overdose is mainly supportive, with various measures including gastrointestinal decontamination, fluid resuscitation, intravenous calcium, vasopressor agents, atropine, high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy (HIET), and cardiac pacing. Recently, intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) therapy has emerged as a promising measure in the management of CCB toxicity. ILE has been used previously in local anesthetic toxicity, but recently, multiple case reports have been published using ILE as an antidote for a wide range of lipophilic xenobiotic poisonings. ILE used in CCB toxicity has demonstrated mixed results, with some efficacy and a unique complication of preventing the use of renal replacement therapy.

We review the literature and discuss the need for further research into CCB intoxication and its fatal consequences.

### Calcium channel blockers and renal protection: insights from the latest clinical trials [^115TnAhc]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blockers have been widely used in clinical practice because of their antihypertensive capacity. Prevention of renal damage is a very important aim of antihypertensive therapy, particularly considering the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the general population. Recent data have shown that CKD is related to the absence of adequate BP control and the clustering of other cardiovascular risk factors seen in the metabolic syndrome.

The knowledge of the capacities of the different antihypertensive drugs or their combinations to simultaneously control BP while protecting the kidney and avoiding the facilitation of metabolic alterations is warranted. Recent data from the Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment trial, Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, and African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) allow the conclusion that, in hypertensive patients with preserved renal function or with CKD, calcium channel blockers are effective antihypertensive drugs to be considered alone or in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.

### Tiadylt ER [^116j5EQQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Diltiazem hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys and in bile. As with any drug given over prolonged periods, laboratory parameters of renal and hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals. The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. In subacute and chronic dog and rat studies designed to produce toxicity, high doses of diltiazem were associated with hepatic damage. In special subacute hepatic studies, oral doses of 125 mg/kg and higher in rats were associated with histological changes in the liver, which were reversible when the drug was discontinued. In dogs, doses of 20 mg/kg were also associated with hepatic changes; however, these changes were reversible with continued dosing.

Dermatological events, as noted in the adverse reactions, may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of diltiazem hydrochloride. However, skin eruptions progressing to erythema multiforme and/or exfoliative dermatitis have also been infrequently reported. Should a dermatologic reaction persist, the drug should be discontinued.

- **Drug interactions**: Due to the potential for additive effects, caution and careful titration are warranted in patients receiving diltiazem hydrochloride concomitantly with other agents known to affect cardiac contractility and/or conduction. Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using beta-blockers or digitalis concomitantly with Tiadylt.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^111xhoU6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Intravenous verapamil HCl has been used concomitantly with other cardioactive drugs, especially digitalis, without evidence of serious negative drug interactions. However, in rare instances, serious adverse effects have occurred when patients with severe cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, or recent myocardial infarction were given intravenous beta-adrenergic blocking agents or disopyramide concomitantly with intravenous verapamil. Concomitant use of verapamil hydrochloride with β-adrenergic blockers may result in an exaggerated hypotensive response. Such an effect was observed in one study following the concomitant administration of verapamil and prazosin. It may be necessary to decrease the dose of verapamil and/or the dose of the neuromuscular blocking agent when the drugs are used concomitantly. Additionally, as verapamil is highly bound to plasma proteins, it should be administered with caution to patients receiving other highly protein-bound drugs.

- **Other interactions**:
	- **Cimetidine**: The interaction between cimetidine and chronically administered verapamil has not been studied. In acute studies involving healthy volunteers, the clearance of verapamil was either reduced or unchanged.
	- **Lithium**: Increased sensitivity to the effects of lithium (neurotoxicity) has been reported during concomitant verapamil-lithium therapy, with either no change or an increase in serum lithium levels. However, the addition of verapamil has also resulted in the lowering of serum lithium levels in patients receiving chronic, stable oral lithium.

### Antihypertensive treatment for kidney transplant recipients [^114KYp4A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

The comparative effects of specific blood pressure (BP) lowering treatments on patient-important outcomes following kidney transplantation are uncertain. Our 2009 Cochrane review found that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) improved graft function and prevented graft loss, while the evidence for other BP-lowering treatments was limited. This is an update of the 2009 Cochrane review.

- **Objectives**: To compare the benefits and harms of different classes and combinations of antihypertensive drugs in kidney transplant recipients.

- **Search methods**: We contacted the information specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 3 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register were identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating any BP-lowering agent in recipients of a functioning kidney transplant for at least two weeks were eligible.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed the risks of bias and extracted data. Treatment estimates were summarised using the random-effects model and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) processes. The primary outcomes included all-cause death, graft loss, and kidney function.

### Are differences in calcium antagonists relevant across all stages of nephropathy or only proteinuric nephropathy [^1119fbw5]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

The main effects of classic calcium antagonists are mediated by the inhibition of L-type calcium channels, which are broadly distributed within the renal vascular bed. These antagonists primarily affect the afferent arterioles. Dihydropyridines can increase glomerular hypertension and exacerbate the progression of kidney diseases, especially when systemic blood pressure is uncontrolled.

Calcium antagonists are widely used in clinical practice for their antihypertensive effects. Preventing renal damage is a key objective of antihypertensive therapy, particularly given the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease globally. Non-dihydropyridines, such as verapamil, have shown an antiproteinuric effect that could be particularly significant in certain cases.

Recent clinical trials indicate that calcium antagonists are effective antihypertensive drugs. In patients with either preserved renal function or chronic kidney disease, they can be considered for use alone or in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. For those with proteinuric kidney disease, non-dihydropyridines might reduce proteinuria more effectively than dihydropyridines.

### Renoprotective effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in experimental chronic renal failure [^114SFQAC]. American Journal of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

We compared the antihypertensive and renoprotective effects of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan and the calcium channel blocker verapamil in rats with chronic renal failure. One month after five-sixths nephrectomy, male WKY rats were treated for two months with either losartan or verapamil. Both treatments resulted in a similar reduction in blood pressure: from 147.1 to 112 mm Hg in losartan-treated rats and from 155 to 118 mm Hg in verapamil-treated rats (p = NS).

Losartan improved creatinine clearance, with a difference of +17.1%, compared to +6.6% for verapamil (p = 0.039). It also prevented the increase in proteinuria: 12.26 ± 2.33 mg/day before and 18.48 ± 2.19 mg/day after therapy in the losartan-treated group, compared to 17.27 ± 2.73 mg/day before and 32.27 ± 10.29 mg/day after therapy in the verapamil-treated group (p = 0.0484).

Additionally, losartan resulted in minimal mesangial proliferation and significantly less glomerular sclerosis and thickening of small arterial and arteriolar walls. The changes in interstitial fibrosis and tubular hypertrophy, however, were similar in both the verapamil- and losartan-treated groups. Treatment with losartan one month after five-sixths nephrectomy in male WKY rats resulted in reduced blood pressure, similar to that of the verapamil-treated group. However, despite similar antihypertensive properties, losartan improved creatinine clearance and reduced proteinuria. The losartan-treated group also experienced a marked reduction in mesangial proliferation, less glomerular sclerosis, and reduced vascular wall thickness in the renal.

The treatment of hypertension has been proven to reduce cardiovascular and renal risk. The role of long-acting calcium channel antagonists in the management of hypertension has been confused in the past due to a lack of controlled clinical trials on people with hypertension and in subpopulations, including those with diabetes and renal disease. In 2002, the results of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial were published. This was the largest ever prospective drug-treatment trial involving 33,357 people with hypertension, including a calcium-antagonist group of 9,048 individuals. Major publications on blood pressure control in those with kidney disease include the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, and publications on those with diabetes include the results of the normotensive arm of the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes trial.

The main finding from the studies reported last year is that blood pressure control can be achieved using one or more of the first-line agents, including diuretics, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Based on the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, diuretics make clinical and economic sense as initial therapy for those with hypertension. Calcium antagonists are well tolerated and effective and should be considered as the initial drug therapy when diuretics are not tolerated or when multiple drug therapy is indicated.

### Cyclosporin a tubular effects contribute to nephrotoxicity: Role for Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions [^112RLU94]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Cyclosporin A (CsA) nephrotoxicity has been attributed primarily to renal hemodynamic alterations caused by afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. However, CsA nephropathy is also characterized by CsA-induced pre-glomerular disturbances and interstitial injury that may occur independently of hemodynamic changes. Given the high lipophilic activity of CsA, we hypothesized that direct tubular injury is likely to contribute to nephrotoxicity.

- **Methods**: To investigate tubular toxicity of CsA, increasing concentrations of CsA (1, 2.5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 µg/ml) and its vehicle (cremophor) were added to isolated rat proximal tubules (PT). Cell injury was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. The role of Ca(2+) ions in tubular toxicity and the effect of calcium channel blockers on CsA toxicity were evaluated by measuring intracellular calcium using the fluorescent dye Fura-2 AM. The role of Mg(2+) ions was assessed using a high extracellular Mg(2+) medium (2 mM).

- **Results**: Whereas cremophor alone was not toxic to PT, CsA caused PT injury but only at the highest concentration (100 µg/ml). After 90 minutes of incubation, LDH was 22.5% in control PT and 41.9% in PT treated with 100 µg/ml CsA (P < 0.001, n = 11). There was a transient increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) after CsA administration. A low calcium medium (100 nM) prevented CsA injury to renal tubules. However, verapamil, but not nifedipine, enhanced cell damage. Only nifedipine completely prevented [Ca(2+)](i) increases following CsA. Finally, a high Mg(2+) medium attenuated CsA-induced effects.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^116vGc3a]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, indicating that it is blood pressure reduction, not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for these benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, although reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality are also regularly observed.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure increases cardiovascular risk, with the absolute risk increase per mmHg being greater at higher blood pressures. As a result, even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. The relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is consistent across populations with varying absolute risk, meaning the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (e.g. patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia). Such patients are expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to achieve a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g. on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide the selection of therapy.

### Preventing contrast-induced nephropathy: Problems, challenges and future directions [^114FZArR]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

A variety of failed approaches has led to skepticism regarding our ability to effectively prevent the injury causing contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Systemically administered vasodilators, such as dopamine agonists, adenosine antagonists, prostaglandins, and endothelin antagonists, have been disappointing despite the rationale behind their use. Antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, and bicarbonate, initially garnered enthusiasm based on single-center trials. However, when considering data presented at society meetings and the increasing number of published negative trials, enthusiasm has waned, and even meta-analyses have not found significant efficacy.

In this context, the article by Meier et al, published this month in BMC Medicine, is particularly valuable as it explores reasons for the heterogeneity in trial results.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^1133KeJc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Treat all verapamil overdoses as serious and maintain observation for at least 48 hours, especially with Verapamil Hydrochloride Tablets SR, preferably under continuous hospital care. Delayed pharmacodynamic consequences may occur with the sustained-release formulation. Verapamil is known to decrease gastrointestinal transit time.

Treatment of overdosage should be supportive. Beta-adrenergic stimulation or parenteral administration of calcium solutions may increase calcium ion flux across the slow channel and have been used effectively in the treatment of deliberate verapamil overdosage. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers has been associated with hypotension and bradycardia, initially refractory to atropine but becoming more responsive to this treatment when patients received large doses (close to 1 gram/hour for more than 24 hours) of calcium chloride. Verapamil cannot be removed by hemodialysis. Clinically significant hypotensive reactions or high-degree AV block should be treated with vasopressor agents or cardiac pacing, respectively. Asystole should be handled by the usual measures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^115Vg4Wy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Verapamil is an antihypertensive agent that, when administered concomitantly with oral antihypertensive agents (e.g. vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, beta-blockers), usually exhibits an additive effect in lowering blood pressure. Patients receiving these combinations should be appropriately monitored. The concomitant use of agents that attenuate alpha-adrenergic function with verapamil may result in an excessive reduction in blood pressure in some patients. Such an effect was observed in one study following the administration of verapamil and prazosin together.

- **Antiarrhythmic agents**:
	- **Disopyramide**: Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide are obtained, disopyramide should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after verapamil administration.
	- **Flecainide**: A study in healthy volunteers showed that the concomitant administration of flecainide and verapamil may have additive effects on myocardial contractility, AV conduction, and repolarization. Concomitant therapy with flecainide and verapamil may result in an additive negative inotropic effect and prolongation of atrioventricular conduction.
	- **Quinidine**: In a small number of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (IHSS), the concomitant use of verapamil and quinidine resulted in significant hypotension. Until further data are obtained, combined therapy of verapamil and quinidine in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should probably be avoided. The electrophysiologic effects of quinidine and verapamil on AV conduction were studied in eight patients.

### Using mendelian randomization study to assess the renal effects of antihypertensive drugs [^111oHDPt]. BMC Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Hypertension is a leading contributor to global years of life lost due to its role in cardiovascular disease. It is also a key risk factor for impaired kidney function, which might be further affected by kidney function itself. Different classes of antihypertensive drugs, acting via different targets, may have varying renal effects. Most guidelines recommend the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as the first-line antihypertensive therapy for the treatment of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines also advocate the combination of an ACE inhibitor with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) as the first-line therapy for patients with proteinuria.

In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), treatment with ACE inhibitors can slow the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the progression to end-stage renal failure, independent of blood pressure reduction. A network meta-analysis of RCTs comparing different classes of antihypertensives suggests that the ACE inhibitor-CCB combination therapy is the most efficacious in reducing albuminuria in patients with diabetes and microalbuminuric kidney disease. However, whether these findings can be generalized to people without these comorbidities is unclear. Given the limited number of often small-scale RCTs, evidence may not be sufficient to support the use of ACE inhibitors as the first-line antihypertensive drug. Evidence from large RCTs comprehensively comparing the effects of different antihypertensive classes is necessary to provide clearer guidance.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^115WstSF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

A range of mostly two-drug antihypertensive single-pill combinations (SPCs) is available. Preferred drug classes for combination regimens target the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and diuretics. The selection depends on individual patient factors, including additional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and comorbidities.

For example, in patients with diabetes and high-normal blood pressure or overt hypertension, which together confer a greater risk of renal damage, combination therapy with a RAS blocker is preferred because these agents offer a superior protective effect against the initiation and progression of nephropathy. In patients with renal disease, antihypertensive therapy should aim to target a range of markers of renal and CV risk, such as serum creatinine, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, microalbuminuria, and proteinuria, usually by RAS blockade. This approach seeks to reduce and slow progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and CV events. Microalbuminuria, in particular, is a marker of global CV risk and is very common in patients with hypertension.

Several position statements recommend combined therapy that includes RAS blockers. The American Society of Hypertension indicated a preference for RAS blockers in combination with either a diuretic or CCB, with SPCs preferred over separate agents when convenience outweighs other considerations. Additionally, the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks (IHSB) recommends a RAS blocker-diuretic or CCB combination in patients.

### Drug-induced nephrotoxicity [^113RZx3p]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Drugs are a common source of acute kidney injury. Compared with 30 years ago, the average patient today is older, has more comorbidities, and is exposed to more diagnostic and therapeutic procedures with the potential to harm kidney function. Drugs shown to cause nephrotoxicity exert their toxic effects by one or more common pathogenic mechanisms. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity tends to be more common among certain patients and in specific clinical situations. Therefore, successful prevention requires knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms of renal injury, patient-related risk factors, drug-related risk factors, and preemptive measures, coupled with vigilance and early intervention.

Some patient-related risk factors for drug-induced nephrotoxicity are age older than 60 years, underlying renal insufficiency (e.g. glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m2), volume depletion, diabetes, heart failure, and sepsis. General preventive measures include using alternative non-nephrotoxic drugs whenever possible, correcting risk factors if possible, assessing baseline renal function before initiation of therapy followed by adjusting the dosage, monitoring renal function and vital signs during therapy, and avoiding nephrotoxic drug combinations.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^114AvQ93]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Two-drug, ARB-based SPCs are available in combination with either HCTZ or amlodipine. Telmisartan, a long-acting ARB with superior 24-hour BP-lowering efficacy compared with several other ARBs — and the only ARB with an indication for the prevention of CV disease progression — is available in two SPC formulations: telmisartan/HCTZ and telmisartan/amlodipine. Reaching a decision about which of these to use in a hypertensive patient with evidence of renal impairment is difficult in the absence of clinical trial data.

However, evidence from the ACCOMPLISH trial supports the use of a RAS blocker combined with a CCB, rather than HCTZ, for high CV risk hypertensive patients, such as those with coronary artery disease with or without stable angina, patients with a metabolic risk profile, and particularly for those with renal disease. Data demonstrating beneficial metabolic and inflammatory effects with ARB/CCB combined therapy (versus ARB/HCTZ therapy) may also lead to the preferred use of RAS blocker-CCB combinations to achieve further BP reductions while avoiding further metabolic disturbances and protecting the kidneys from further damage.

In hypertensive patients at increased CV risk requiring an antihypertensive agent that specifically reduces blood volume, the combination of an ARB to protect the…

### Calcium-channel blockers and end-stage renal disease: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations [^113acg6q]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the different calcium-channel blockers.

Recent findings have shown that calcium-channel blockers have been in use for some time in the end-stage renal disease population. Their primary use has been as antihypertensive and antianginal therapies, and they are effective agents in this regard. Recently, it has been noted that dialysis-related hypotension occurs less frequently in patients treated with calcium-channel blockers. Additionally, access patency and overall patient survival are improved with calcium-channel blocker therapy.

In summary, calcium-channel blockers are useful agents for the control of hypertension in end-stage renal disease patients and appear to favorably influence survival in this population. These blockers are not dialyzable, and their pharmacokinetics do not substantially change with renal failure; therefore, they do not require dose adjustment based on the level of renal function. However, too few studies exist to determine if individual calcium-channel blockers differ in their effects. Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials are needed in the end-stage renal disease population to better understand the role of calcium-channel blockers in addressing the excess cardiovascular disease burden in this population.

### The role of calcium antagonists in chronic kidney disease [^114iftkn]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

To review goals of antihypertensive treatment in chronic kidney disease, we explore the role calcium antagonists play in reducing the progression of kidney disease.

- **Recent findings**: All recently published guidelines recommend a blood pressure goal of less than 130/80 mmHg in patients with chronic kidney disease. Use of calcium antagonists is not recommended as part of the initial armamentarium. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, when used in concert with diuretics, reduce blood pressure as well as both proteinuria and the rate of decline in the glomerular filtration rate. The evidence for calcium antagonists in this regard is more divergent. Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, e.g. amlodipine and felodipine, help achieve blood pressure goals and reduce stroke risk. When used with a renin-angiotensin system blocker, they do not detract from the benefits of this blockade in slowing the progression of kidney disease. Non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, e.g. verapamil or diltiazem, decrease proteinuria and, in studies with 5 to 6 years of follow-up, preserve kidney function similarly to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The reason for this outcome difference between calcium antagonists is partial preservation of renal autoregulation compared to its obliteration by the dihydropyridine subclass.

In summary, the use of calcium antagonists is safe and necessary to achieve blood pressure goals in people with chronic kidney disease. While both subclasses are safe and necessary to achieve blood pressure goals, dihydropyri-

### The 6r's of drug induced nephrotoxicity [^1127asFK]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Drug-induced kidney injury is a frequent adverse event that contributes to morbidity and increased healthcare utilization. Our knowledge of drug-induced kidney disease is limited due to varying definitions of kidney injury, incomplete assessment of risk factors, and lack of long-term outcome reporting. Electronic surveillance presents a powerful tool to identify susceptible populations, improve recognition of events, and provide decision support on preventative strategies or early intervention in the case of injury. Research in the area of biomarkers for detecting kidney injury and genetic predisposition for this adverse event will enhance detection of injury, identify those susceptible to injury, and likely mitigate risk. In this review, we will present a 6R framework to identify and manage drug-induced kidney injury:

- **Risk**: Identification of risk factors.
- **Recognition**: Early detection of kidney injury.
- **Response**: Immediate response to signs of injury.
- **Renal support**: Providing necessary kidney support.
- **Rehabilitation**: Steps for recovery post-injury.
- **Research**: Ongoing research to improve outcomes.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^112fR7qf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with a major associated risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration, and reduced healthcare costs.

Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs compared with corresponding free-drug combinations is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects. A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity and mortality.

This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs.

### T/l-type calcium channel blocker reduces the composite ranking of relative risk according to new KDIGO guidelines in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111aiYi7]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progressively increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in line with its severity. In 2002, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) organization published a guideline providing diagnosis and classification of CKD into five stages according to severity, using the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as the main criterion. Recent studies have shown that individuals with a GFR ≤ 45 ml/min/1.73 m² are at increased risk compared with those with a higher GFR. The presence of proteinuria also increases cardio-renal events significantly. As a result, in 2009, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group recommended that individuals be classified according to proteinuria stage as well as GFR stage. The diagnostic criteria for CKD remained unchanged, but the new KDIGO guideline divided stage 3 (30 < GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m²) into the following two substages: 3a (GFR, 45 to < 60) and 3b (GFR, 30 to < 45). In addition, clinicians and researchers were advised to categorize patients using a "heat map" generated by the composite ranking of relative risk.

Renin-angiotensin system blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered the most effective pharmacological approaches for renoprotection, reducing proteinuria more effectively than other antihypertensive drugs. Guidelines recommend blood pressure (BP) levels < 130/80 mmHg in patients with CKD. However, this reduction is difficult to achieve.

### Onco-hypertension in patients with kidney disease [^111pwvs5]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Cancer, hypertension, and kidney disease are closely interrelated. Knowledge of the potential hypertensive and nephrotoxic effects of antineoplastic medications is critical for minimizing interruptions in cancer treatment.

Antineoplastic medications can cause hypertension, proteinuria, and kidney injury, often mediated by common mechanisms. Notably, inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway have the strongest association with both hypertension and proteinuria, typically acute in onset and often reversible after drug discontinuation. The abrupt rise in blood pressure can cause clinically significant hypertensive syndromes and contribute to overall morbidity. Significant proteinuria can herald kidney failure. Close monitoring of blood pressure and renal function during antineoplastic therapy, and appropriate hypertension treatment, are important. This article reviews available literature and proposes a step-by-step approach to manage cancer patients with concurrent hypertension and kidney disease.

- **Key messages**: For antineoplastic medications with known hypertensive effect, blood pressure should be checked at baseline and serially during cancer treatment. Hypertensive crisis with end-organ damage, significant proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, or unexplained acute kidney injury necessitates drug cessation until further evaluation and resolution. In patients with chronic kidney disease and cancer therapy-related hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker is the preferred antihypertensive choice.

### Cardiovascular and renal protection in type 2 diabetes mellitus: The role of calcium channel blockers [^114LY5iB]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

The most important factor that prevents the progression of renal damage in diabetes mellitus, besides the improvement of blood glucose control, is tight blood pressure (BP) control. The tenet of tight BP control may be defined as the lowest BP level one can achieve using antihypertensive therapy, while remaining free from untoward side effects. Both the Framingham Heart Study in non-diabetic normal subjects and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study in type 2 diabetic patients demonstrated that systolic values as low as 108 to 111 mmHg and diastolic values as low as 70 to 71 mmHg are significantly associated with decreased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.

However, 45 to 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension have systolic BP levels above 140 mmHg during antihypertensive therapy, particularly when using monotherapy. Thus, the choice of drugs for treating hypertension becomes critical from a clinical perspective. Pharmaceutical compounds that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system have become the first-choice treatment for patients with diabetes mellitus and incipient or advanced renal complications.

This brief review analyzes the effects of calcium channel blockers (CCB) on cardiovascular and renal complications in diabetes mellitus. It discusses studies that directly and blindly compared CCB with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II AT(1) receptor blockers (ARB). Furthermore, the size of the population recruited in each trial was assessed.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^111dgmyA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Verapamil hydrochloride is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow-channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that exerts its pharmacological effects by modulating the influx of ionic calcium across the cell membrane of the arterial smooth muscle as well as in conductile and contractile myocardial cells.

- **Mechanism of action**:

	- The precise mechanism of action of verapamil hydrochloride as an antianginal agent remains to be fully determined, but includes the following two mechanisms:

	- **Relaxation and prevention of coronary artery spasm**: Verapamil hydrochloride dilates the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in normal and ischemic regions. It is a potent inhibitor of coronary artery spasm, whether spontaneous or ergonovine-induced. This property increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients with coronary artery spasm and is responsible for the effectiveness of verapamil hydrochloride in vasospastic (Prinzmetal's or variant) as well as unstable angina at rest. Whether this effect plays any role in classical effort angina is not clear, but studies of exercise tolerance have not shown an increase in the maximum exercise rate-pressure product, a widely accepted measure of oxygen utilization. This suggests that, in general, relief of spasm or dilation of coronary arteries is not an important factor in classical angina.

	- **Reduction of oxygen utilization**: Verapamil hydrochloride regularly reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works both at rest and at a given level of exercise by dilating the peripheral arteries.

### Calcium channel blockers for people with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis [^116hSypE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are used to manage hypertension, which is highly prevalent among people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The treatment for hypertension is particularly challenging in people undergoing dialysis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of calcium channel blockers in patients with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 27 April 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared any type of CCB with other CCB, different doses of the same CCB, other antihypertensives, control, or placebo were included. The minimum study duration was 12 weeks.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: This review included 13 studies (24 reports) randomising 1459 participants treated with long-term haemodialysis. Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis (622 participants). No studies were performed in children or in those undergoing peritoneal dialysis.

### Calcium channel blockers: An update [^113tMEg3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the literature pertaining to calcium channel blockers, including their classification, properties, and therapeutic indications, in light of several recent trials that have addressed their safety. Calcium channel blockers are a structurally and functionally heterogeneous group of medications that are used widely to control blood pressure and manage symptoms of angina. They are classified as dihydropyridines or nondihydropyridines. As a class, they are well tolerated and are associated with few side effects.

The question of whether they may precipitate cardiovascular events has been largely settled by recent trials, such as the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), the International Verapamil Slow-Release/Trandolapril Study (INVEST), and the Controlled Onset Verapamil Investigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) study, in which no such association was found. Even so, the use of these agents has been linked with an increased risk of heart failure. Thus, long-acting calcium channel blockers may be safely used in the management of hypertension and angina. However, as a class, they are not as protective as other antihypertensive agents against heart failure.

### Using Mendelian randomization study to assess the renal effects of antihypertensive drugs [^111Wuqbw]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

From the perspective of clinical practice, our findings, together with previous RCTs, add support to guidelines recommending the use of ACE inhibitors or ACE inhibitors plus CCB in people with hypertension and kidney dysfunction. Our findings also suggest these reno-protective associations are generalizable to the general population. Genetic proxies for BBs were associated with lower eGFR; however, given the cardiovascular benefit of BBs, this concern should not outweigh its benefits, especially for patients with cardiovascular disease and without other renal comorbidities.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^113K6wu1]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for calcium channel blocker toxicity, more specifically with respect to high-dose insulin, AAPCC/ACMT/CAEP/CAPCC/CCCS/CPS/EAPCCT/ESEM/ESICM/SCCM 2017 guidelines recommend administering incremental doses of high-dose insulin (up to 10 U/kg/hour) as rescue therapy if not previously administered. This is indicated in the presence of myocardial dysfunction in patients with CCB poisoning who have refractory shock or are peri-arrest despite increasing doses of inotropes and vasopressors.

### Acog practice bulletin no. 203: Chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^116atKPw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the use of verapamil hydrochloride ER PO (also known as Verelan PM) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. Consider safer alternatives for hypertension in pregnancy. The drug verapamil hydrochloride ER PO (also known as Verelan PM) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Renal vulnerability to drug toxicity [^114DkfEo]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced kidney disease occurs primarily in patients with underlying risk factors. A number of factors enhance the vulnerability of the kidney to the nephrotoxic effects of drugs and toxins. They are broadly categorized as patient-specific, kidney-related, and drug-related factors. One, two, or all three of these factor categories can act to promote various forms of renal injury.

Importantly, all compartments of the kidney can be affected, resulting in one or more classic clinical renal syndromes. These include acute kidney injury, various tubulopathies, proteinuric renal disease, and chronic kidney disease. Recognizing the risk factors that increase renal vulnerability to drug-induced kidney disease is the first step in reducing the renal complications of drugs and toxins.

### Initial single-pill blood pressure-lowering therapy: Should it be for most people [^113sYPvG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The importance of lowering blood pressure (BP) to reduce cardiovascular risk and the progression of chronic kidney disease is well established. Clinical trials that randomized various monotherapies to evaluate outcomes ultimately required an average of two or more medications to achieve BP goals. This was also true in trials involving elderly people.

- **Medications required**: Clinical trials demonstrate the need for multiple medications to achieve blood pressure control. Studies such as AASK (African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension), ABCD (Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes), and ACCOMPLISH (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events in Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension) are examples where this was evident. Other notable trials include ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes), ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial), HOT (Hypertension Optimal Treatment), IDNT (Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial), INVEST (International Verapamil-Trandolapril Study), MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease), RENAAL (Reduction in Endpoints in Patients With Non–Insulin‐Dependent Diabetes Mellitus With the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan), SBP (Systolic BP), SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), UKPDS (UK Prospective Diabetes Study), and VA Nephron D (Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes).

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^112XYVaR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy**: Teratogenic effects fall under pregnancy Category C. Reproduction studies in rabbits and rats with oral verapamil doses up to 1.5 (15 mg/kg/day) and 6 (60 mg/kg/day) times the human oral daily dose, respectively, have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. However, in rats, this dosage was embryocidal and retarded fetal growth and development, likely due to adverse maternal effects indicated by reduced weight gain in the dams. This oral dose has also been shown to cause hypotension in rats. No adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women exist, so verapamil should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed, given that animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response.

- **Labor and delivery**: Few controlled studies have assessed the use of verapamil during labor or delivery regarding immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus or whether it prolongs the duration of labor or increases the need for forceps delivery or other obstetric intervention. Despite a long history of intravenous verapamil HCl use in Europe for treating cardiac side effects of beta-adrenergic agonist agents used during premature labor, such adverse experiences have not been reported in the literature.

- **Nursing mothers**: Verapamil crosses the placental barrier and is detectable in umbilical vein blood at delivery. It is also excreted in human milk. Given the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued while verapamil is administered.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^1161pVUz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The administration of verapamil hydrochloride with various other agents has been a subject of study, revealing important interactions:

- **Nitrates**: Verapamil has been given concomitantly with short- and long-acting nitrates without any undesirable drug interactions; the pharmacologic profile of both drugs and clinical experience suggest beneficial interactions.

- **Cimetidine**: The interaction between cimetidine and chronically administered verapamil has not been studied. Variable results have been obtained in acute studies involving healthy volunteers; the clearance of verapamil was either reduced or unchanged.

- **Lithium**: Increased sensitivity to the effects of lithium (neurotoxicity) has been reported during concomitant verapamil-lithium therapy. Lithium levels have sometimes been observed to increase, decrease, or remain unchanged. Patients receiving both drugs must be monitored carefully.

- **Carbamazepine**: Verapamil therapy may increase carbamazepine concentrations during combined therapy, potentially producing side effects such as diplopia, headache, ataxia, or dizziness.

- **Rifampin**: Therapy with rifampin may markedly reduce the oral bioavailability of verapamil.

- **Phenobarbital**: Phenobarbital therapy may increase the clearance of verapamil.

- **Cyclosporine**: Verapamil therapy may increase serum levels of cyclosporine.

- **Theophylline**: Verapamil may inhibit the clearance and increase the plasma levels of theophylline.

- **Inhalation anesthetics**: Animal experiments have shown that inhalation anesthetics depress cardiovascular activity by decreasing the inward movement of calcium ions. When used concomitantly, inhalation anesthetics and calcium antagonists, such as verapamil, should be administered with caution.

This summary emphasizes the necessity of careful monitoring when verapamil is used in conjunction with these agents, given the potential for significant pharmacological interactions.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^111ca5LL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Verapamil was not mutagenic in the Ames test in five test strains at 3 mg per plate, with or without metabolic activation.

Studies in female rats at daily dietary doses up to 5.5 times (55 mg/kg/day) the maximum recommended human dose did not show impaired fertility. Effects on male fertility have not been determined.

- **Pregnancy category C**: Reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits and rats at oral doses up to 1.5 (15 mg/kg/day) and 6 (60 mg/kg/day) times the human oral daily dose, respectively, and have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. In the rat, however, this multiple of the human dose was embryocidal and retarded fetal growth and development, likely due to adverse maternal effects reflected in reduced weight gains of the dams. This oral dose has also been shown to cause hypotension in rats. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Verapamil crosses the placental barrier and can be detected in umbilical vein blood at delivery.

- **Labor and delivery**: It is not known whether the use of verapamil during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, or whether it prolongs the duration of labor or increases the need for forceps delivery or other obstetric intervention. Such adverse experiences have not been reported in the literature, despite a long history of use of verapamil in Europe in the treatment of cardiac side effects of beta-adrenergic agonists.
