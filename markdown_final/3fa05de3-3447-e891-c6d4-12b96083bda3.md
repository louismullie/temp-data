## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which variable — age, gender, cohort, or time of measurement — is most important for gerontological researchers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core research questions and analytic frameworks in gerontology. Then, I should verify how each candidate variable functions methodologically and whether it is indispensable or merely contextual. Next, I will examine longitudinal modeling and cohort-effect issues to see which variable is most central to valid inference. Finally, I will consider practical implications and edge cases before concluding with the most defensible choice.

> Let me first confirm the disciplinary frame. Gerontology is fundamentally concerned with within-person change over time and with distinguishing true aging effects from cohort differences and measurement artifacts, so the analytic backbone is longitudinal and time-aware by definition, not cross-sectional snapshots [^47c630cf] [^e1839525].

> Now, I will examine age. Wait, let me verify whether age is simply a covariate or something more foundational. In longitudinal studies of aging, age is the natural timescale for modeling within-person change; it is the axis along which trajectories of function, frailty, and disease are estimated, and it is used to separate within-person aging from between-person cohort effects, which is why age is typically the primary time variable in mixed-effects and related models [^e1839525] [^f1241f67]. Hold on, I should also confirm that age is not just a static baseline characteristic; in longitudinal gerontology, age-at-measurement is a dynamic time variable that structures repeated observations and enables estimation of age-related slopes and inflection points, reinforcing its centrality to inference [^e1839525] [^ffd580f1].

> Next, I should review gender. Gender is an important demographic stratifier and potential confounder, but it is time-invariant within individuals and is not the axis along which aging is modeled; it modifies associations and may interact with age, yet it is not the core temporal scaffold of gerontologic analysis, so I should not overstate its primacy here [^e1839525].

> I will now examine cohort. Cohort is crucial for distinguishing secular effects from aging, but wait, let me verify its role relative to age. Cohort is typically modeled as a between-person, time-invariant attribute or as a fixed effect that captures shared experiences by birth year; it is essential for avoiding confounding by cohort differences, yet it is not the within-person timescale that structures trajectories, which remains age or time-since-baseline in most longitudinal designs [^e1839525] [^f1241f67]. Hold on, I should double-check that some studies explicitly separate cross-sectional cohort effects from longitudinal age effects to avoid misattribution, which underscores that cohort is important but secondary to age for modeling change [^e1839525].

> Let me consider time of measurement. Time of measurement is a methodological detail that matters for standardization and bias control, especially in circadian-sensitive biomarkers or repeated-measures designs; however, it is not the substantive dimension of interest in gerontology, whereas age is the substantive timescale for modeling change, so time of day is a nuisance or design parameter rather than the most important variable [^ae6b31b3] [^12fdad74].

> But wait, what if the question is about analytic indispensability rather than theoretical salience. I should confirm that without age (or an age-aligned longitudinal timescale), we cannot estimate within-person change, disentangle cohort effects, or test age-varying associations; that is why longitudinal gerontology relies on age-structured models and why age is the pivot for aligning repeated measures and interpreting trajectories, which is not true for gender, cohort, or time of day [^e1839525] [^47c630cf]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even when researchers use time-since-enrollment or reverse-time scales, these are alternative temporal frameworks that still reflect the primacy of time/age in modeling change, reinforcing that age is the most fundamental dimension [^e1839525].

> I should also review practical implications to ensure this isn't purely abstract. Age determines sampling windows, follow-up intervals, and the interpretation of biomarkers and functional outcomes across the life course; it is the variable that links molecular, clinical, and social trajectories in gerontology, and its centrality is reflected in methodological guidance and empirical frameworks that treat age as the primary longitudinal axis [^e1839525] [^f1241f67]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said cohort was equally important because it corrects bias; while cohort adjustment is essential, the question is which variable is most important, and the answer remains age because it is the within-person timescale that enables the field's core questions to be answered [^e1839525].

> Final answer: Age is the most important variable for gerontological researchers because it is the primary longitudinal timescale for modeling within-person change, distinguishing aging from cohort effects, and structuring repeated-measures analyses that define the discipline's inferential core [^e1839525] [^47c630cf] [^f1241f67].

The most important variable for gerontological researchers is **age** because it is the primary determinant of biological, cognitive, and social changes studied in aging. Age is the **key predictor of health outcomes**, functional decline, and mortality, and it is essential for defining study populations, interpreting results, and applying findings to clinical practice and policy [^f4bd3cc6]. While gender, cohort, and time of measurement are important, age is the **fundamental axis** along which aging processes are understood and measured [^e1839525].

---

## Biological and physiological relevance

Age is the **primary driver of biological aging**, including genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, and cellular senescence [^notfound]. These molecular and cellular changes underpin the increased risk of chronic diseases, functional decline, and mortality observed in older adults [^c80e0b10]. Age-related changes in physiological systems — cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurological, and endocrine — are central to gerontological research, making age the most critical variable for understanding health trajectories and developing interventions [^notfound].

---

## Cognitive and psychological dimensions

Age is the **strongest predictor of cognitive decline**, including memory, executive function, and processing speed [^notfound]. Gerontological research frequently examines age-related changes in cognitive function, mental health, and well-being, with age serving as the primary variable for identifying at-risk populations and evaluating interventions [^60bd38ea]. The concept of "successful aging" is often defined in relation to age-specific cognitive and psychological outcomes, further underscoring the centrality of age in gerontological studies [^notfound].

---

## Social and behavioral aspects

Age is a **key determinant of social roles**, relationships, and behaviors, influencing retirement, caregiving, and social participation. Gerontological research examines how age shapes social engagement, support networks, and quality of life, with age-specific analyses informing policy and practice [^notfound]. Age-related transitions, such as retirement or widowhood, are critical events studied in gerontology, and age is the primary variable for understanding their impact on well-being [^notfound].

---

## Methodological considerations

Age is the **fundamental variable** for defining study populations, sampling strategies, and inclusion criteria in gerontological research [^e1839525]. Age-stratified analyses are essential for understanding how aging processes differ across the lifespan, and age is a key covariate in statistical models examining health outcomes, functional decline, and mortality [^e1839525]. Longitudinal studies rely on age-specific trajectories to identify patterns of change and risk factors, making age indispensable for valid inference and generalizability [^f1241f67].

## Comparative analysis with other variables

| **Variable** | **Relevance to gerontological research** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Age | - Primary determinant of biological, cognitive, and social aging <br/> - Essential for defining populations and interpreting outcomes | - Does not capture individual variability in aging processes <br/> - Must be complemented by other variables |
| Gender | - Important for understanding sex-specific aging patterns and health outcomes <br/> - Influences social roles and behaviors | - Less fundamental than age <br/> - Does not capture within-individual aging trajectories |
| Cohort | - Useful for understanding generational effects and historical context <br/> - Helps distinguish period effects from aging effects | - Less directly relevant to individual aging processes <br/> - Cannot replace age as the primary axis of analysis |
| Time of measurement | - Important for longitudinal studies and understanding temporal changes <br/> - Helps account for period effects | - Secondary to age in explaining individual aging trajectories <br/> - Does not define population characteristics |

## Conclusion

Age is the **most important variable** for gerontological researchers because it is the primary determinant of biological, cognitive, and social aging processes. It is essential for defining study populations, interpreting results, and applying findings to clinical practice and policy. While gender, cohort, and time of measurement are important, age remains the fundamental axis along which aging is understood and measured [^e1839525].

### Quantum measurement arrow of time and fluctuation relations for measuring spin of ultracold atoms [^19d99e4b]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

We now discuss our main results in the paper. First, we performed weak quantum measurements of the spin of 87 Rb atoms in the cloud and obtained the entire measurement statistics for spin measurement of a spin state in a single shot. We experimentally reconstructed the arrow of time distributions that show remarkable agreement with the corresponding theoretical prediction in Eq. (6). We also considered different initial conditions that produce statistically rare realizations of the quantum measurement process that correspond to cases where the arrow of time points backwards.

We showed that the average of the arrow of time has a strict positive value, and that it increases with the measurement strength. The increasing average arrow of time is a clear signature of acquiring useful quantum information in the measurement process, which causes the irreversible evolution of the atomic spin states towards a spin eigenstate. This feature is captured by the quantum fluctuation theoremas applied to single-shot measurements in our case, for different initializations of the atomic cloud, and for different measurement strengths. In Fig. 2 b, d, we demonstrated absolute irreversibility (nonzero μ) for quantum measurements in a uniformly spin initialized cloud of atoms.

Ultracold atomic systems have come to the fore as excellent platforms for simulating systems with complex many-body interactions, making it imperative to understand the role of quantum measurement in these dynamics. We extended the scope of our fluctuation theorem to quantum spin measurements performed on an atomic cloud with engineered quantum many-body interactions through an additional quantum degree of freedom, demonstrating absolute irreversibility for the quantum measurement process in this spin–orbit engineered state (see Fig. 3). Such states may display dramatically enhanced interactions and a low-energy structure that depends on the spin–orbit interaction, allowing a wide range of interaction strengths to be explored even in quantum systems that are otherwise weakly interacting. Our experiment lays the groundwork for studying quantum measurement theory in the context of such exotic many-body wavefunctions where a wealth of physics remains to be explored, including the effect of initial correlations on irreversibility, and the possibility of engineering the low-energy states of the system to tune wavefunction collapse.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^027ddd3e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D (D) supplements are indispensable for its world-wide deficiency. Controversy continues on ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3) relative potency as well as on dosing-schedule and sex role in raising 25-hydroxy D (25(OH)D) level, the best indicator of D status.

Methods

We randomized 279 adults to daily D2, D3, D2/D3, or placebo; 2-weekly D2 or D3; or 4-weekly D2 or D3 (250,000 IU over/140 days). Randomization sequence, stratified by body-mass-index (BMI) and sex, was concealed from study coordinators and participants who were then blinded to capsules' content. D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 Serum levels were determined blindly on days 0,1,2,3,4,7,14, and 2-weekly thereafter by high performance liquid chromatography assay. The results of 269 participants were available for analysis. Primary endpoint was area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2+25(OH)D3) adjusted for sex, BMI, and baseline 25(OH)D level.

Results

Mean(SD) age was 33.0(8.5) year, 41% were males, and 85% completed follow-up. Baseline 25(OH)D level was 39.8(11.9) and increased by 3.3(11.6) and 28.6(16.3) nmol/L, in the placebo and active-treatment groups, respectively. AUC from day 0 to 140 (AUC 140) of 25(OH)D was 40% (D3 daily) to 55% (D3 2-weekly) higher with active-treatment than placebo (p < 0.001). 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 was higher in daily than 2-weekly (17%, p = 0.006) and 4-weekly (20%, p = 0.001) D2-treated groups. 25(OH)D3 AUC 140 was lower in daily than 2-weekly (11%, p = 0.002) and 4-weekly D3-treated groups (10%, p = 0.008). In D2-treated groups, there was 16.4 nmol/L decrease in 25(OH)D3 level that correlated (p < 0.001) with 25(OH)D2 level increase (r = 0.48) and baseline 25(OH)D level (r = 0.58), in one participant with measurable baseline 25(OH)D2 level, D3 caused a similar decrease in 25(OH)D2 level, while in the D2/D3-treated group, 25(OH)D3 level didn't increase. Incremental AUC from day 0 to 7 (AUC 7) of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups were 118–243% higher and 31–39% lower, respectively, than incremental AUC 7 of D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups. Incremental AUC 7 of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups and D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups were higher in females than males (55, 13, 64, and 28%, respectively). Baseline 25(OH)D level predicted response to D2 and D3 (p < 0.001), whereas, BMI was significant predictor only for early response to D2.

Conclusions

Effects of D2 and D3 supplements on 25 (OH)D level may be dosing-schedule and sex-dependent. D2-associated reduction in 25(OH)D3 level may be related to total 25(OH)D level rather than being D2-specific. D2 may be 25-hydroxylated faster than D3.

### Choice of reference measurements affects quantification of long diffusion time behaviour using stimulated echoes [^8ed4f3ee]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Reference Images with Varying Diffusion Times

Calculating the ADC necessitates a reference measurement to divide out the signal contributions unrelated to the diffusion gradients. For DW‐STEAM, these contributions come from T 1 and T 2 decay. For measurements at multiple diffusion times, the variable T 1 decay during the mixing times requires a separate reference image for each Δ.

Unlike DW‐SE, DW‐STEAM reference measurements accumulate significant b ‐value at long diffusion times as a result of crusher gradients (Fig. 2 a), which are smaller in amplitude than diffusion‐encoding pulses, but otherwise have similar properties, including separation by the mixing time.

Figure 2
Reference measurements in the DW‐STEAM sequence. (a) DW‐STEAM reference measurements in which the gradient G 0 (fixed‐ q 0; third row) or the b 0 ‐value are kept constant (fixed‐ b 0; fourth row). In the DW‐STEAM sequence, the diffusion gradient (G d; second row) is used as an imaging gradient in the reference measurements (denoted G 0; applied over all three axes) to crush the signal from the third RF pulse. In the b 0 image, the G 0 is chosen according to the minimal q 0 ‐value that achieves this, which might result in a nonnegligible b 0 ‐value at long diffusion times. To obtain a constant b 0 ‐value over diffusion times, the G 0 needs to be increased for Δ < Δ max compared with the minimal value G 0,Δmax. (b) ADC calculation of signals undergoing mono‐exponential and non‐mono‐exponential decay. For mono‐exponential decay (solid line), the behavior is linear in b, and any two‐point fit of (b, b 0) yields the same ADC. For the non‐mono‐exponential, the slope of the linear fit, and thus ADC, decreases if the b 0 ‐value increases over the measurements.

Effect size distribution.

Distribution of Cohen's d effect sizes comparing respiratory rates in two-time windows, for symptomatic individuals: A 7-day period from D −24 to D −18, and a 7 day window from D −1 to D + 5. We only consider subjects with at least 5 days of data in the 7 day period. The curves are normalized to unit area. Also shown is a gaussian fit to the data. The vertical line indicates the mean value of the effect size distribution (+0.70).

We have earlier computed typical values of coefficient of variance (CoV) over a 14 day period and found mean values in the range 4–6% for age < 60 yr. It is instructive to compare the CoV of healthy individuals with those with symptomatic COVID-19. We use data in the date range D −27 − D −14 to simulate a 14 day healthy period. Let us also consider the date range D −6 − D +7 as a 14 day period during which COVID-19 symptoms may affect biometrics. We computed the CoV for each individual in these time windows provided they had 10 or more data points in the selected window. The comparison of the CoV for these periods is shown in Fig. 6 (both curves are normalized to unit area). The blue curve shows the CoV when the participants are presumed healthy, and peaks around ≈4% (mean = 5.05%, std dev = 2.7%). The red curve is the CoV during illness, and shows a larger spread in values compared to the blue curve (mean = 7.9%, std dev = 4.3%).

### Measurement of respiratory rate using wearable devices and applications to COVID-19 detection [^33cc45bc]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The increase in respiratory rate may also be quantified by means of the effect size. Let us consider data from symptomatic individuals, in a 7 day window several days prior to the appearance of symptoms. The period from D −24 to D −18 serves as the control. Let us also consider a 7 day window during which symptoms are likely to manifest, i.e. D −1 to D + 5. The effect size (Cohen's d) for each individual may be computed as, ﻿:where μ 1 and μ 2 are the mean respiratory rate values for the two time windows, and σ is the pooled standard deviation: N 1 and N 2 are the number of days of data in each window.andare the variances of the data in the two windows. We computed the effect size for each individual (provided they had at least 5 days of data in the selected 7 day period) and the distribution of effect sizes is shown in Fig. 5 (normalized to unit area). The mean effect size is +0.70 and the standard deviation is 1.2.

Outcome types, scales and assessors

Times when patients experienced outcomes and when they were measured are described in figure 2 and table 3. In most studies, intraprocedural patient experience was the outcome of interest (60.0%, 147 of 245), followed by overall patient experience (39.6%, 97 of 245) and patient experience from 0 min to 30 min after the procedure (10.2%, 25 of 245). However, 42.9% (105 of 245) of studies included an outcome without specifying the time that the patient experienced the outcome.

Of the 147 studies reporting on intraprocedural patient experience, most (68.0%, 100 of 147) assessed this outcome retrospectively or without reporting when they were measured. Thirty-six studies (32.0%) indicated a contemporaneous time of measurement. Outcomes experienced preprocedure or post procedure were more often measured contemporaneously than retrospectively (figure 2).

Continuous weak measurement of energy

Here we describe the continuous measurement of energy of an accoustic mode through Homodyne-like measurements. To derive the measurement operator that describes the continuous measurement of the energy of an acoustic mode, we consider an acoustic mode of frequency ω l, with the free Hamiltonian, We consider the probe as a continuous variable system (waveguide photons or a quantum LC circuit) with quadratures(equivalently the chargeand phasefor LC circuit implementations). In the following, we assume that the probe is initialized in a zero-mean Gaussian initial state:with variance t m in the x basis, that couples to the acoustic mode via the following interaction Hamiltonian:The measurement operator is given byWe can re-write the measurement operator in terms of the Homodyne signalasTo describe continuous measurements, we assume that the probe is reset to the initial state at each d t. Physically this could mean that, for example, when the probe is a photon, it is a different photon that interacts with the resonator at each instant in time. This represents a continuous stream of single photons that interact with the acoustic mode, and subsequently homodyne detected. For Homodyne sensing of energy of the oscillator, we can represent the readout signal, where ζ (t) is a Gaussian white-noise, δ correlated in time, of variance 1/ d t. Therefore at each instant in time t, the density matrix for the acoustic mode can be updated aswhich describes the quantum evolution of the acoustic mode subject to time-continuous quantum measurements of its energy.

For simulations shown in the main text, we consider the characteristic measurement time t m = 2 s. We measure for a duration t meas = 40 s, after which we re-initialize the detector to its ground state. We also require that t meas < τ c, the coherence time of the acoustic mode for the above-described formalism to apply. In simulations, we confirm that for the optimized mass, maximum absorption occurs in the neighborhood of the resonance for a chirping gravitational wave. Equation (66) can be thought of as the Trotterized representation of the dynamics of an acoustic bar resonator, whose energy is continuously monitored. In the limit of large measurements, t_meas ≫ t_m, the probability of measuring a single quantum in the acoustic bar resonator approaches its optimum value, P(1) = 1/e.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^870c5ea5]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — testosterone measurement timing, variability, and illness effects — Among men with traditional (10p.m. to 6a.m.) sleep patterns, peak testosterone values occur around 8a.m., with 32–39% of the diurnal total decline occurring within the first 30 minutes of waking, and total testosterone values obtained at 4p.m. in men aged 30–40 years were 20–25% lower than measurements taken at 8a.m., while men aged 70 years experienced only a 10% decline between the two time points. Intra-individual testosterone variability is significant, as repeat measures can fluctuate 65–153% between tests and using 2 or 3 measures can reduce this variability by 30–43%, respectively; to minimize these effects, two morning draws for testosterone are recommended before any clinical intervention. In acute respiratory infections in young men, mean total testosterone levels declined by 10%, with some cohorts experiencing reductions of up to 30%.

### Glucose measurement: time for a gold standard [^cf4c8a37]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2007). Low credibility.

There is no internationally recognized reference method for the measurement of blood glucose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlighted the need for standardization some years ago when a project was started. The project objectives were to (1) investigate whether there are significant differences in calibration levels among currently used glucose monitors for home use and (2) develop a reference method for glucose determination. A first study confirmed the assumption that currently used home-use monitors differ significantly and that standardization is necessary in order to minimize variability and to improve patient care. As a reference method, CDC recommended a method based on isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, an assay that has received support from clinical chemists worldwide. CDC initiated a preliminary study to establish the suitability of this method, but then the project came to a halt. It is hoped that CDC, with support from the industry, as well as academic and professional organizations such as the American Association for Clinical Chemistry and International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, will be able to finalize the project and develop the long-awaited and much needed "gold standard" for glucose measurement.

### A test in context: D-dimer [^6b87d302]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product that results from ordered breakdown of thrombi by the fibrinolytic system. Numerous studies have shown that D-dimer serves as a valuable marker of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Consequently, D-dimer has been extensively investigated for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is used routinely for this indication. In addition, D-dimer has been evaluated for determining the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients, for diagnosing and monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation, and as an aid in the identification of medical patients at high risk for VTE. Thus, quantification of D-dimer levels serves an important role in guiding therapy. This review: 1) describes how D-dimer is generated; 2) reviews the assays used for its detection; and 3) discusses the role of D-dimer determination in these various conditions.

### Does being physically active prevent future disability in older people? Attenuated effects when taking time-dependent confounders into account [^d24e92dc]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Informants rated the subjects' instrumental activities of daily living abilities at baseline and on each follow-up on an eight item scale. The outcome "transition to instrumental disability" was reached if a subject scored more than "no impairment" on at least two of eight items. Informants were asked to approximate the time-point of change. Again, both recall bias and measurement error are potentially introduced.

A confounder is considered to be a variable that is a common cause for both treatment and outcome. Whereas this definition may be verifiable in a simple non-time-varying setting with only a limited number of variables, it becomes difficult to empirically select salient confounding factors from a broad range of information in time-varying scenarios: A variable may confound at one time-point and not at another, or a variable may become a confounder only in concert with other selected variables. Referencing Hernán et al. expert knowledge may need to influence the decision if or if not a variable is indeed defined as a confounder. Table 1 shows those variables that we considered a priori to be confounders – selected from over 50 covariates available in the original LADIS study database.

### Diclofenac sodium D / r [^1debe5c4]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.

In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.

Physicians should measure transaminases periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.

If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac should be discontinued immediately.

### Assessment of physiological signs associated with COVID-19 measured using wearable devices [^6fde023d]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Making predictions of illness based on health metrics

The physiological signs can be used to predict the onset of COVID-19. Let us denote the n th day after the start of symptoms as D n. D 0 is the day when symptoms started. We make the assumption that individuals are healthy, i.e. class "Negative" from day D a to day D b where D b < D 0. Subjects are considered to be sick from day D c up to day D d where D c ≥ D 0. The days between D b and D c are treated as a buffer space when subjects may or may not be sick, and hence ignored. The choices of D a, D b, D c, and D d are made through cross validation. As a guide to choosing the days, we note the median incubation period is estimated at 5.1 days. Since we are using the date relative to the start of symptoms as the ground truth label, we consider only symptomatic individuals.

Recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult — measurement considerations and ecological validity emphasize that real-world sleep patterns can produce circadian disruption "equivalent to taking a 2–3 hour "flight" westward on Friday night… only to "fly" back on Sunday night — waking earlier than desired Monday morning". The panel notes "the heterogeneity of sleep duration measurement", with "retrospective self-report, the most common method in epidemiologic studies and in clinical practice", that is easy but limited as "sleep duration can vary substantially over time", questions "may capture time in bed rather than time asleep", and "self-reported sleep duration often differs considerably from objective measures". Among objective tools, "Actigraphy has better sensitivity (detecting sleep) than specificity (detecting wake)" and "often overestimates sleep duration", while "PSG is the only common method that directly measures brain activity", yet is "more intrusive… may interfere with the very thing it measures", is "expensive and less well-suited" for large, home, or multi-night studies; emerging "consumer sleep technologies may create opportunities for accurate, reliable, scalable objective sleep duration assessment".

### Guidelines for reporting methodological challenges and evaluating potential bias in dementia research [^9da73373]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2015). Low credibility.

2.5. Time-varying exposure/time-varying confounding

Pathologic brain changes are evident at least two decades before clinical dementia diagnosis. Effects of exposure on cognitive outcomes may depend on when exposure occurs, and the relevant timing likely differs for exposures influencing pathogenesis, disease progression, and/or maintenance of function. Research identifying relevant etiologic periods is essential for guiding clinical decisions and preventive interventions targeting known risk factors. For example, elevated blood pressure in midlife predicts higher dementia risk, whereas elevated blood pressure late in life does not. Although the explanation for this difference is unclear, recommendations on hypertension treatment for dementia prevention must be tailored to a person's age and existing morbidities. A "critical window" hypothesis has been suggested for hormone therapy effects on dementia, with benefits from initiation in the perimenopausal period but harms from later initiation. A recent systematic review identified only a handful of studies directly addressing this question. For evaluating etiologic periods, cohorts with very long follow-up (e.g. PREVENT or the Framingham Heart Study) are informative because they provide measures of exposure at multiple ages. Quantifying how an exposure's effects on dementia evolve with age of exposure requires care because different methods of analyzing time-varying exposure data can yield results that vary substantially in magnitude and, more crucially, in interpretation (Table 4). Although risk factor-dementia associations that differ by age at exposure may reflect relevant etiologic windows, they could also reflect reverse causation or measurement error that differs across age-specific exposures. When cumulative effects of long-term exposure, rather than variation in exposure or point in time exposure effects, are hypothesized, repeated measures of exposure can be combined (e.g. averaged) to achieve more precise exposure estimates.

Just as exposures may vary over time, so too may confounders. Adding to the challenge are differences across studies in how and when exposures and potential confounders are measured. Similar to analyzing time-varying exposure data, adequately adjusting for confounding when exposures and confounders change over time requires special care, especially when confounders also act as potential mediators.

The Supplementary Appendix 4 provides further detail on and examples of the problems of time-varying exposures and confounders.

### AAAPT: assessment of the acute pain trajectory [^e705c9df]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Timing of Pain Assessments

In both clinical and research settings, repeated acute pain measurements for individual patients may vary in number and timing. For example, in a postoperative acute pain study, patients may have varying timing and frequency of pain intensity assessments, which are influenced by a number of factors, including type of surgery, time of day, and frequency of medication administration. The mixed-effects model provides the flexibility of having unevenly spaced time points, as well as a different number of measurements per patient. The goal of the trajectory approach to multiple pain assessments is not to yield a single summary pain rating but to create a longitudinal trajectory of pain for each patient. Therefore, the timing of the pain assessments does not need to be the same for pain trajectory analyses. More frequent measurements are recommended when rapid, nonlinear changes are expected. This is in line with having more frequent pain assessments during the earlier PODs, when patients are in hospital with acute pain and receiving pain treatments, and having less frequent pain assessments after discharge.

Confounding Variables

There are multiple sociodemographic and clinical factors identified in prior research that should be considered as potential confounding variables in the evaluation of the acute pain trajectory. The initial pain level and the ensuing pain trajectory may differ depending on the sociodemographic and clinical factors for an individual. Several acute postoperative studies have examined potential associations of initial pain level and pain trajectory with demographic factors (sex, age), premorbid pain (preoperative pain intensity, underlying pain conditions) and opioid use, and surgical factors (anatomic location of surgery). Although findings are mixed in the literature, female patients and patients receiving chronic opioids demonstrated a higher acute pain intercept. Pain trajectories after a wide range of inpatient surgeries were shown to decrease more rapidly in younger patients and to differ by anatomic location of the surgery. Effects of demographic variables, comorbidities (e.g. premorbid pain and opioid use), and acute medical and surgical variables may differ depending on the population and context and should be considered as potential confounding factors (i.e. between-subjects fixed-effects variables) in analysis of the pain trajectory.

### Measuring population ageing: an analysis of the global burden of disease study 2017 [^f4bd3cc6]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

In conclusion, having appropriate measures for population ageing is a crucial step towards addressing the challenges and harnessing the opportunities of population ageing. From the perspective of improving the measurement of population ageing, this novel measure supports the comparison of the progression of population ageing across countries and over time without the need for additional and extensive data collection. It also facilitates the shift from thinking not just about chronological age but the health status and disease severity of ageing populations. From the perspective of providing policy recommendations for addressing challenges in population ageing, the findings from this research serve as a starting point for identifying key drivers of variation in the age-related burden and resources required for addressing the burden, and to learn from exemplar countries that have been more successful in suppressing the levels of age-related disease burden over time or delaying the accumulation of age-related disease burden to later ages.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^93dededf]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Postdischarge follow-up for hyperbilirubinemia — timing and testing are guided by using the difference between the bilirubin concentration and the phototherapy threshold at the time of measurement to determine the interval between discharge and follow-up and the need for additional total serum bilirubin (TSB) or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurements. This approach incorporates both gestational age and other hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors into the decision-making process, and should also take into consideration the presence of other hyperbilirubinemia risk factors. These guidelines are based only on the management of hyperbilirubinemia, and other considerations that may influence the timing of follow-up include gestational age, postnatal age, assessment of breastfeeding, weight loss from birth weight, and assessment of the well-being of the infant and parents.

### Choice of reference measurements affects quantification of long diffusion time behaviour using stimulated echoes [^482fa223]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

THEORY

Diffusion Time Dependence of the ADC

In any diffusion‐weighted sequence, varying the diffusion time (Δ) between diffusion‐encoding gradients alters the diffusion‐weighting b if other parameters are kept constant:

Provided the displacement profile is Gaussian, diffusion measurements yield the same ADC, independent of the choice of b or Δ. However, with non‐Gaussian diffusion 23, 24, 25, 26, the choice of b is crucial for interpreting the diffusion time dependence of the ADC. For example, in biexponential diffusion — a simple departure from Gaussian diffusion — the ratio of a diffusion‐weighted signal, S(Δ), and a reference measurement, S 0 (Δ), is governed by

In this scenario, varying Δ with constant q (varying b) induces an apparent dependence of the ADC on diffusion time. This diffusion time dependence occurs for any protocol in which log(S/S 0) is a nonlinear function of b, but would not be observed under constant b (varying q = γδG). Crucially, the need for constant b holds for both diffusion‐weighted and reference acquisitions with nonzero b ‐value. This is particularly important for DW‐STEAM, in which reference measurements have significant b ‐value as a result of the configuration of crusher gradients.

### Longitudinal associations between time perspective and life satisfaction across adulthood [^5874ddba]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications

While theoretical approaches to time perspective provide insights into its link to well-being, theories focusing on well-being rarely elaborate on the role of time perspective (for an exception, see ref.). One reason why time perspective has received little attention in theories of well-being is that a plurality of well-being theories exists and these often remain separate and distinct from each other rather than being integrated into a more comprehensive conceptualization. Given that human beings impose subjective, time-related interpretations on their existence, time perspective is an important construct for research on well-being and emotional aging. The relevance of time perspective for well-being research could be increased by taking a closer look at the current operationalizations and measurements of time perspective. Specifically, there seems to be overlap on the conceptual level. For example, Brandtstädter's facet of affective valence, defined as optimistic outlook on the future, may not be distinguishable from dispositional optimism (generalized positive expectation for the future). Time perspective measures have also been criticized because items are not clearly and exclusively linked to the time perspective they are meant to assess. Based on our findings, it is important to move towards multi-dimensional conceptualizations of time perspective, especially concerning SST which only considers future time, but also concerning SWB which, according to our findings, is only related to specific time perspective aspects such as concreteness or obsolescence. Incorporating a multi-dimensional approach will better capture the complex nature of developmental changes in time perspective and well-being. As age moderation effects of the relation between time perspective and life satisfaction were circumscribed in our study, theories of time perspective should reconsider the role of age in this relation. This could be done by specifying boundary conditions under which age-related changes in time perspective are not or no longer related to higher SWB (e.g. when approaching the end of life). Overall, a more comprehensive understanding of the relation between time perspective and well-being might require more clarification, explication, comparison, and integration of the current conceptualization of time perspective.

### Participation of older adults in drug trials, 2010–2019… [^3fc0f744]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Numbers do not add up to 100% due to rounding. Question Are older adults adequately represented in clinical trials for new drug evaluation. Findings In this cross-sectional study, adults in the oldest age groups above age 75 years or in some therapeutic areas above age 80 years in clinical trials were not enrolled in proportion to the prevalence of selected treatment indications in the US from 2010 through 2019. However, participants between ages 60 and 75 years were reasonably proportional with the prevalence of selected treatment indications. years compared with a prevalence estimate of 50%, 25% were age 65 to 74 years compared with a prevalence estimate of 27%, 2% were age 75 to 79 years compared with a prevalence estimate of 9%, and 1% were age 80 years and above compared with a prevalence estimate of 14%. The data suggest underrepresentation of older age groups in the clinical trials.

Our analyses focused on chronological age representativeness across the older age span in clinical efficacy trials for new drugs and biologics for 7 treatment indications during the past decade. While representation of older age subgroups varied by treatment indication, the most consistent finding was the limited enrollment of the oldest age groups. Specifically, those ages 75 years and above for type 2 diabetes and NSCLC, and 80 years and above for NVAF stroke prevention, insomnia, heart failure, and osteoporosis. Because of the rapidly changing worldwide demographics and patterns of drug use, the ICH updated the Guideline E7 in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics Questions and Answers. 28 The ICH E7 Guideline recommended considering older age subgroups as younger than 65, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and over 85 years. Assessing age-related representativeness of a clinical trial population may still be difficult because of the limitations of available prevalence data.

The prevalence data often lacked sufficient granular age data to allow comparisons across the older age span. In addition, definitions for diseases and conditions collected in surveys may not use the same standardized definitions as those for clinical trials and may not be comprehensive. National health data are collected by different federal agencies at varying intervals but are not routinely used or readily accessible for comparisons during or after drug approvals. Regular reporting, data comparability, and appropriate accessibility to the US prevalence data can help identify the age-related representativeness of clinical trial participants to fill the knowledge gaps.

Heart rate variability (HRV) measurement — domains, recordings, and parameters: Measurement of HRV is performed in the frequency and time domains as well as by nonlinear techniques; frequency-domain parameters require data stationarity and typically employ short-term recordings under controlled conditions but can also be performed over 24 hr from 5-min segments averaged over the entire period; time-domain parameters measure changes in NN intervals often based on long-term recordings, typically 18 hr encompassing morning and night; standard deviation of all NN intervals (SDNN) is the oldest, the simplest, and the most frequently used time-domain HRV parameter; nonlinear HRV analysis is believed to be less dependent on preprocessing and to express better the complexity of RR changes.

### The time is now: accounting for time-of-day effects to improve reproducibility and translation of metabolism research [^ae6b31b3]. Nature Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The constant expansion of the field of metabolic research has led to more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the complex mechanisms that underlie metabolic functions and diseases. Collaborations with scientists of various fields such as neuroscience, immunology and drug discovery have further enhanced the ability to probe the role of metabolism in physiological processes. However, many behaviours, endocrine and biochemical processes, and the expression of genes, proteins and metabolites have daily ~24-h biological rhythms and thus peak only at specific times of the day. This daily variation can lead to incorrect interpretations, lack of reproducibility across laboratories and challenges in translating preclinical studies to humans. In this Review, we discuss the biological, environmental and experimental factors affecting circadian rhythms in rodents, which can in turn alter their metabolic pathways and the outcomes of experiments. We recommend that these variables be duly considered and suggest best practices for designing, analysing and reporting metabolic experiments in a circadian context.

### Guidelines for reporting methodological challenges and evaluating potential bias in dementia research [^e1839525]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2015). Low credibility.

2.4. Alternative timescales and specification of longitudinal models

The specification of the timescale(s) and functions of within-person change in longitudinal studies can dramatically influence results and replicability. Because of the close link between age and dementia, age constitutes a natural and appropriate timescale for studying dementia risk or related binary outcomes. In studies of cognitive ageing, this also applies when studying time-invariant exposures (such as gender or genes). However, research often addresses time-varying exposures that are measured only once during the study (e.g. nutrition, diabetes, treatment) and thus at different ages. In this situation, using the time since exposure measurement (usually enrollment) as the timescale may be more appropriate. When focusing on specific phases of cognitive aging such as the prodromal phase of dementia or terminal decline, reverse time (e.g. years before diagnosis or death) may also be informative. However, using reverse time inherently selects participants who developed the outcome, which might cause biases in estimated longitudinal changes. This is an active area of methods development, with several approaches used in the current literature (see section 2.2). Generally, the fundamental underlying causal process presumed to be relevant should guide the choice of metrics (Table 3).

Most observational studies on cognition recruit participants over a wide age range so that studying cognitive change with age mixes two processes: within-person change with age (usually of main interest) and between-person age differences that are also influenced by birth cohort. Ignoring age differences at baseline when studying cognitive decline with age is appropriate only if individuals "converge" onto the same age trajectory whatever their birth cohort: i.e. if a person entering at 85 years is expected to have the same cognitive level as a person entering at 65 years and followed for 20 years. This may be unrealistic. For example, for women in the Whitehall cohorts, between-person age effects overestimated rate of cognitive decline compared with within-person effects because of large cohort differences in educational levels. The "convergence" issue can be easily disentangled by distinguishing two timescales: a longitudinal timescale (e.g. current age or time since enrollment) for within-person change and a cross-sectional timescale (e.g. age at enrollment) for between-person age differences (Table 3).

### Choice of reference measurements affects quantification of long diffusion time behaviour using stimulated echoes [^1bd8e115]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Future experiments with the DW‐STEAM sequence using variable diffusion times should be designed to avoid variable b ‐values in the reference measurements to draw valid conclusions about quantities related to restriction, such as length scales and permeability. Incorporating the full b ‐matrix is insufficient: To avoid confounding the effects of restriction and possible multiple diffusion coefficients in the system under study, it is important to keep the b ‐value as well as the b 0 ‐value constant over diffusion times. Unlike reference measurements with fixed‐ q 0, use of a constant b 0 ‐value does not induce an apparent diffusion time dependence in the absence of restrictions. Fixed‐ b 0 is therefore preferable in experiments that draw conclusions from the relation between the ADC and diffusion time.

### Time-reflection of microwaves by a fast optically-controlled time-boundary [^ccad7cd9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Time reflection of a single pulse

This section presents our simulated and measured results of both the time-reflected and time-refracted (transmitted) signals of a single Gaussian pulse with a full-width half-maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of 0.35 GHz scattered at a time interface.

Our system contains both spatial boundaries and a time-boundary. It is, therefore, essential to first explore the spatial boundaries, extract their features, and only then isolate the phenomena akin to the time-boundary, which is the purpose of this article. The results of the studies on the spatial boundaries and the extraction of the spatial and time-boundary coefficients are described in the Supplementary Information, Notes 5 and 6, respectively. With the spatial coefficients known, the time-boundary coefficients are extracted from the measured results and are now discussed. Figure 2a, b show the simulated and measured results of the time-reflected single Gaussian pulse referenced at the input voltageand output voltage, respectively. The time-boundary (TB1) is activated atby modulating the characteristic impedance of the line fromtowhen the pulse has fully entered but has yet to exit the microstrip trace. As mentioned previously, the total length of the microstrip line in State 1 is just long enough to contain the spatial spread of a single pulse, thus the pulse has traveled approximately halfway through the line before the time-boundary is activated.

Left ventricular (LV) global systolic function — definitions and fractional shortening: "Global LV function is usually assessed by measuring the difference between the end-diastolic and end-systolic value of a one-dimensional, 2D, or 3D parameter divided by its end-diastolic value". For timing landmarks, "end-diastole is preferably defined as the first frame after mitral valve closure or the frame in the cardiac cycle in which the respective LV dimension or volume measurement is the largest" and "End-systole is best defined as the frame after aortic valve closure or the frame in which the cardiac dimension or volume is smallest". In regular rhythm, "measurements of the timing of valve openings and closures derived from M-mode echocardiography, pulsed-wave (PW) or continuous-wave Doppler may be used for accurate definitions of ventricular time intervals". For measurement choice, "Fractional shortening can be derived from 2D-guided M-mode imaging or preferably from linear measurements obtained from 2D images".

### Aging and economic preferences: cumulative meta-analyses of age differences in risk, time, social, and effort preferences [^bcbd9c77]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations and Future Directions

We should also point out some limitations of our work. First, a wide range of measures has been developed to quantify individuals' economic preferences. In the present study, we focus solely on behavioral tasks, yet self-reported measures (e.g. propensity measures) could also be considered. The convergent validity of different measures within each preference is low, which suggests further research should focus on the comparability of effect size trajectories across different measurement types. For example, recent work suggests that self-reports are more likely to capture systematic age differences in risk preference and a recent quantitative synthesis suggests robust age effects when considering self-report measures. Although past theorizing has largely ignored the role of measurement, the differences between our results and those for self-reported risk propensity suggest that it would be important to develop more specific expectations about the role of operationalization in detecting age differences in economic preferences.

Second, our work focused solely on published results because of our aim of assessing the historical patterns in the literature. However, published results are unlikely to be fully representative of the evidence on age differences thus data from unpublished reports or data sets could be included in future extensions of this work.

Third, although we considered a wide range of moderators to explain effect-size heterogeneity, cultural and sociodemographic factors (e.g. education) were not included. Details on such factors are often missing in primary studies or reported heterogeneously, which can be challenging to incorporate in analyses. However, as such factors can influence economic preferences (cf.), this can be an avenue for future research.

Lastly, we did not preregister this work. We note, however, that we make all the data and code used in this study publicly available to ensure that our work can be assessed transparently and used in future confirmatory efforts.

### Time trends in adolescent depressive symptoms from 2010 to 2019 in Norway: real increase or artifacts of measurements? [^270c7cd8]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The repeated cross-cohort design is informative for studying population-level changes over time (Armitage et al; Collishaw). However, as also noted by Hagquist et al. identical instruments and standardized data collections seem to be the major criteria when evaluating their validity, whereas invariance of measures across cohorts is rarely mentioned. Moreover, many studies compare trends across age and gender, which further necessitates MI between age- and gender groups, an assumption that may not hold (e.g. Black, Humphrey, Panayiotou, & Marquez; Burdzovic Andreas & Brunborg). Given this poor attention to the fundamentals of measurement, it is worrisome that most previous research relies on observed sum scores to document time-trends. Besides the issue of measurement (non)invariance, sum scores also assume that all items contribute an equal amount of information to the construct being measured. If not justified, the use of sum scores can severely affect the validity and reliability of findings (see McNeish & Wolf). These oversights are concerning, as trend research may guide policy and health services.

Against this background, this study aimed to examine whether changing reporting of symptoms may influence the assessment of trends in adolescent depressive symptoms. By drawing on first principles of psychological measurement, we investigate the extent to which measurement noninvariance may bias cross-cohort time trends in symptom scores and potentially explain the rise in depressive symptoms among Norwegian adolescents. To achieve this, we used data from the large-scale Ungdata-surveys with more than half-a-million respondents, the most widely referenced source of the rising trends in adolescent depressive symptoms in Norway. In doing so, a broader aim was to raise awareness among researchers about the importance of assessing the factorial invariance of measures used to document trends in adolescent mental health and well-being.

### ATS / ERS recommendations for standardized procedures for the online and offline measurement of exhaled lower respiratory nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide, 2005 [^517e9fc8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Exhaled NO measurement requirements for clinical use — exhaled NO measurements have primarily been performed in the research setting, and online measurement refers to FE NO testing with a real-time display of NO breath profiles whereas offline testing refers to collection of exhalate into suitable receptacles for delayed analysis. The use of FE NO measurement as a clinical tool requires the adoption of a standardized measurement technique followed by collection of reference data in all age groups. Ideally, there should be interinstitutional agreement of mean FE NO within 10% for each age group, and to establish exhaled NO as a clinical tool, guidelines should be developed.

### Frailty: understanding the difference between age and ageing [^4fda0614]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

In the past, illness and dependence were viewed as inevitable consequences of old age. Now, we understand that there is a difference between age (the passing of chronological time) and ageing (the increased risk of adverse outcomes over time). Over the last 50 years, 'frailty' research has established that ageing is heterogeneous, variable and malleable. Significant advances have been made in frailty measurement (description of clinical features and development of clinical models), mechanisms (insights into pathogenesis) and management (development of interventions to reduce and/or prevent progression). Subsequently, the concept of frailty has informed health policy and clinical practice and started to change perceptions of older age held by the general public and the health sector. Here, we overview key achievements in frailty research and clinical practice and highlight the considerable number of known unknowns that may be addressed in the future.

### Sedentary behavior and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^058b4f75]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Device-based assessments — accelerometers for sedentary time describe methods, placement, outputs, and reporting: Accelerometers have been the most commonly used devices to objectively monitor sedentary time and measure acceleration, defined as change in velocity. Participants have traditionally worn accelerometers on a belt around their waist during waking hours and remove them for water-based activities, and wearing a device on a wrist or ankle can be helpful in quantifying behaviors that have different positions and can be less burdensome than using a waist-worn device. The movement detected by accelerometers is converted to electrical signals or counts that can be summed over a period of time to quantify total sedentary time (minutes) or patterns of sedentary time (eg, duration of bouts or episodes, breaks in sedentary time), and data from accelerometers are typically reported as a percentage of total wear time or absolute hours per day. Although objective devices reduce measurement error associated with self-report, they do have limitations.

### Design of clinical trials to assess diabetes treatment: minimum duration of continuous glucose monitoring data to estimate time-in-ranges with the desired precision [^c5f21e6f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors are increasingly used in research and clinical practice. A recent consensus panelidentified 'time‐in‐ranges' as key outcome metrics to assess glycaemic control based on CGM data. The identified time‐in‐ranges include: time in range (TIR), that is, the percentage of time spent within 70‐180 mg/dL (3.9‐10 mmol/L); time below range (TBR), that is, the percentage of time spent with CGM less than 70 mg/dL (< 3.9 mmol/L); and time above range (TAR), that is, the percentage of time spent with CGM more than 180 mg/dL (> 10 mmol/L). Furthermore, the percentage of readings within 70‐140 mg/dL (3.9‐7.8 mmol/L) is referred to as time in tight range (TITR).

### Measuring population ageing: an analysis of the global burden of disease study 2017 [^c80e0b10]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Governments worldwide are moving with urgency to introduce policies that address population ageing. Whether increased longevity is an opportunity or a threat to the stability of societies largely depends not only on whether populations are living longer but whether they are experiencing the negative health effects of ageing — a progressive loss of physical, mental, and cognitive integrity, leading to impaired functions and increased vulnerability to morbidity and mortality. It is therefore crucial that we measure the extent to which ageing and age-related disease burden occurs in a population over time to inform better policies.

In existing public health literature, there are two main approaches to measuring ageing. The first and most common set of ageing metrics involves measuring changes in the age structure but fails to capture the level of morbidity of the population. They include metrics such as the shift in the population's age distribution toward older ages, increase in the population's median age, increase in average life expectancy, number of remaining years left to live, and changes in the ratio between what are classed as older and working age groups. The second main set of literature focuses on measuring the functional status of older populations, using objective measures such as biomarkers, frailty, and cognitive functioningor subjective measures such as self-reported health and instrumental limitations of activities of daily living. These studies, in our view, more accurately capture the health status of individuals and reflect the heterogeneity in how people age. However, the studies often involve complex, resource-intensive study designs, are conducted among a relatively small sample, and might not be generalisable or comparable across study settings. The measures are often not identical or similarly understood and tested across study populations or over time, making these studies and the longitudinal waves difficult to compare or to be aggregated into population-level metrics. Another challenge is that none of these studies and measures take most diseases and their severity into account.

### Common methodological issues in observational epidemiological studies of older adults [^be0e88a7]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Measurement error

Self-reported diabetes is a commonly available measure but likely has considerable measurement error. If a subsample with ideal measures of diabetes (eg, glycated haemoglobin, electronic health record diagnosis) is available, regression calibration, simulation extrapolation, or multiple imputation could be used to correct analyses in the full sample to account for measurement error due to the use of self-reported diabetes. Otherwise, quantitative bias analyses might be conducted to understand a range of plausible effect estimates after consideration of measurement error.

Long latency periods

Care should be taken to consider when diabetes is most important. Diabetes is not an exposure that occurs at a single time point, but rather a condition that can develop at any point across the life course and has effects that could accumulate with longer duration of illness. If longitudinal life course data were available, potentially from linked data or retrospective life history data, analyses could probe specific questions related to whether timing of diabetes onset matters and other ways in which cumulative measures capturing diabetes severity over time might influence physical functioning in late life. However, even if such data were unavailable, researchers could consider integrating these topics into discussions of how their results fit within the existing knowledge and theoretical hypotheses regarding life course exposure to diabetes.

### Repeated measures designs and analysis of longitudinal data: If at first you Do not succeed-try, try again [^12fdad74]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, while ANOVA gives an overall P value, it does not identify which group means are equal or not. A common approach to answer this question is to perform post hoc tests, which are pairwise comparisons of either selected means of interest or all possible combinations of means. Note that this involves testing of multiple null hypotheses, which leads to an inflated risk of a type I error — unless the significance criterion is adjusted accordingly. A more detailed discussion on multiple testing is found elsewhere.

Commonly, researchers aim to compare 2 or more groups (eg, treatment groups) in which the outcome is repeatedly assessed over time. There are thus 2 factors of interest in the repeated-measures design (time and treatment). Such a study design is traditionally analyzed with two-way (two-factor) repeated-measures ANOVA (Figure 2). This ANOVA model simultaneously tests several null hypotheses: (1) all means at different time points are the same (referred to as "main effect of time"); (2) all means in different treatment groups are the same (referred to as "main effect of treatment"); and (3) there is no interaction between treatment and time (the treatment groups do not differ in their degree of change in the outcome variable over time). The interaction is often the primary interest when researchers aim to study whether treatments differentially affect outcomes over time.

Repeated-measures ANOVA techniques make quite strong assumptions about the underlying data. One important assumption is that the correlation between repeated measurements for the same subject is constant, irrespective how far apart in time the measurements are made (termed "compound symmetry correlation structure"). The closely related assumption of sphericity means that the variances of the differences between any 2 time points is the same, irrespective of how distant the measurements are. Violations of these assumptions are common because correlation between repeated data tend to be highest between adjacent time points and decrease with increasing time intervals, markedly increasing the risk of false-positive claims (type I error). Mauchly's test can be used to test for sphericity, and adjustments, such as the Greenhouse and Geisser correction, can be applied when the assumption of sphericity is violated.

### Time in range – A new gold standard in type 2 diabetes research? [^9d18e597]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is currently the gold standard outcome measure for type 2 diabetes trials. Time in range is a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metric defined as the proportion of time in euglycemia (3.9–10.0mmol/L) and may be valuable not only in type 1 diabetes clinical trials but also as an endpoint in type 2 diabetes trials. This narrative review aimed to assess the relative merits of time in range versus HbA1c as outcome measures for type 2 diabetes studies. It reviews the strengths and limitations of time in range as an outcome measure and evaluates studies in type 2 diabetes that have used time in range as a primary or secondary outcome measure. A literature search was conducted on PubMed and MEDLINE databases using key terms "time in range" AND "diabetes" OR "type 2 diabetes mellitus". Further evidence was obtained from relevant references of retrieved articles. Literature search identified 247 papers, of which 110 were included in this review. These included a broad range of articles, including 45 randomized trials using time in range as an outcome measure in patients with type 2 diabetes, as well as papers validating time in range. Time in range provides valuable and clinically relevant information and should be used as an important endpoint in type 2 diabetes in clinical trial settings, in conjunction with HbA1c.

### Avanafil (Stendra) [^a33c59f0]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Time to Onset of Effect (Study 4)

STENDRA was evaluated in 440 subjects with ED including diabetics (16.4%) and subjects with severe ED (41.4%) in a randomized double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study of 2 months duration. The mean age was 58.2 years (range 24 to 86 years). The population was 75.7% White, 21.4% Black, 1.6% Asian, and 1.4% of other races. Subjects were encouraged to attempt intercourse approximately 15 minutes after dosing and used a stopwatch for measurement of time to onset of effect, defined as the time to the first occurrence of an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse.

STENDRA 100 mg and 200 mg demonstrated statistically significant improvements relative to placebo in the primary efficacy variable, percentage of all attempts resulting in an erection sufficient for penetration at approximately 15 minutes after dosing followed by successful intercourse (SEP3) (see Table 10).

### Temporal context calibrates interval timing [^27df0941]. Nature Neuroscience (2010). Medium credibility.

We use our sense of time to identify temporal relationships between events and to anticipate actions. The degree to which we can exploit temporal contingencies depends on the variability of our measurements of time. We asked humans to reproduce time intervals drawn from different underlying distributions. As expected, production times were more variable for longer intervals. However, production times exhibited a systematic regression toward the mean. Consequently, estimates for a sample interval differed depending on the distribution from which it was drawn. A performance-optimizing Bayesian model that takes the underlying distribution of samples into account provided an accurate description of subjects' performance, variability and bias. This finding suggests that the CNS incorporates knowledge about temporal uncertainty to adapt internal timing mechanisms to the temporal statistics of the environment.

### Does accelerometer-measured physical activity and sedentary time differ between manual, in-office, hybrid and remote workers? [^1755cfef]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Physical activity measurement

Physical activity was measured over seven consecutive days and nights using triaxial ActiGraph wActiSleep-BT accelerometers and the newer wGT3X-BT accelerometers (ActiGraph, Pensacola, Florida, USA), replacing the broken devices. The accelerometer was initialised to record at 80 Hz. Participants were instructed to wear the device on their non-dominant wrist at all times, including during water-based activities such as swimming, but to remove it for the sauna. Data from the accelerometers were downloaded and converted into 60 s epochs in ActiLife software, V.6.13 (ActiGraph, Pensacola, Florida, USA). Vector magnitude (VM) counts per minute (CPM) were calculated as the square root of the sum of squared activity counts of the three axes. The participants were given participants' logs in which they recorded information about each measurement day, including waking and sleeping times, workdays and days off, work times, as well as whether or not they had worked remotely on that particular day.

We included wear time between the first and last recorded time in the participant log, and excluded non-wear time using the algorithm developed by Choi and sleep time by the algorithm available in the ActiLife software. A valid measurement day was defined as a minimum of 10 hours of wake accelerometer wear time. A minute-by-minute data were produced for all valid measurement days. A minute was defined as active when the VM of the wrist-worn accelerometer equalled or exceeded 1853 CPM; a sedentary minute was defined as less than 1853 CPM, as validated against thigh-worn accelerometers. The mean sums of active and sedentary minutes were calculated for all days, and separately for workdays and days off, and for workday occupational and non-occupational time. Occupational time was defined as accelerometer wear time during reported working hours. Respectively, non-occupational time was defined as accelerometer wear time outside the reported working hours, for example, time spent in transportation, leisure and household activities. The mean activity minutes for each hour of the workday were calculated to illustrate the daily physical activity profiles during typical waking hours (from 06:00 to 23:00) for each work mode group.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage survivorship outcomes and measurement — Depression can occur in about one-third of aSAH survivors; anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder can be seen in ≈15% to 20%; and cognitive impairment can occur in 40% to 70%, and these impairments may persist in the long term even in aSAH survivors who make a good functional recovery. Mortality and functional outcomes such as Glasgow Outcome Scale and mRS scores are commonly used as primary outcome measures in SAH RCTs, but there is variability in the timing of measuring functional outcomes, and the postacute recovery phase, defined as the first 6 months of survivorship, should capture the cumulative burden of early brain injury, DCI, and hospital-acquired complications. The SAH Outcome Tool, which includes 56 items, is the only disease-specific patient-reported outcome measure but has not been implemented clinically because of a complex Rasch-based interval analysis.

### Key research priorities in methodological approaches for measuring the exposome and studying its role in the development of dementia [^5447a3aa]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

10 REVERSE CAUSATION

When the temporal ordering of the exposure and outcome is unclear, observed associations between a hypothesized exposure and outcome can be due to reverse causation or the effect of the outcome on the exposure, rather than vice versa. In many cases, causation may occur in both directions (i.e. reciprocal causation), biasing effect estimates specific to either direction. Reverse causation is particularly important to consider in exposome research, considering a lifetime of exposures across different ages or time periods. For example, when comparing across effects by exposure timing, it is important to consider whether observed heterogeneity may be attributable to differences in the impact of reverse causation on findings (i.e. effects of exposure later in life and therefore closer in time to outcome ascertainment may be more susceptible to reverse causation), rather than true differences in effects by exposure timing. Lack of clarity on the potential for reverse causation may also affect decisions around the best way to quantify cumulative exposures and whether to exclude exposure measurements more proximal to outcome ascertainment. Disentangling the impact of reverse causation can be even more challenging in scenarios where insufficient follow‐up is available, leading to uncertainty in establishing temporality between the exposure and outcome.

Challenges related to reverse causation can be particularly salient in dementia research, given the long preclinical period of the disease. For example, observed associations between dementia and lower body mass index (BMI) at older ages are believed to reflect increasing frailty as a result of the disease process, as opposed to low BMI increasing the risk of dementia. Since these effects would not appear among younger people, this can create the appearance of heterogeneity in the effects of BMI by age when none exists. Therefore, when evaluating the effects of risk factors across the life course in exposome research, it is important to consider whether heterogeneity across age may be due to true effect heterogeneity or reverse causation. Although analytic methods cannot definitively identify reverse or reciprocal causation, a range of different study design choices or sensitivity analyses can help researchers alleviate the risk of bias resulting from reverse causation or evaluate the potential for reverse causation to influence results. For example, excluding participants with preclinical disease at baseline has the potential to limit risk for reverse causation, though doing so changes the study sample and limits the potential to observe effects on early disease, especially in studies with shorter follow‐up. Dissemination of resources on best practices for evaluating reverse causation in research on the dementia exposome may serve to increase awareness and evaluation of how reverse causation can impact observational research findings.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^10052999]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) screening and classification — expert-opinion guidance and age-specific recommendations: Recommendations regarding BP are graded as expert opinion (Grade D) and focus on a developmental approach to prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), drawing on The Fourth Report's algorithm and flow diagram and stratified age-appropriate approaches reflected in Table 8–1 and revised algorithms (Figures 8–1 and 8–2), with BP norms for age, gender, and height shown in Tables 8–3 and 8–4 and taken directly from The Fourth Report. For children from birth to age 2 years, routine measurement of BP is not recommended; BP should be measured when there is suspicion of renal disease, coarctation of the aorta, or other condition associated with BP elevation, and auscultation should be undertaken though an oscillometric device with an appropriate size cuff is acceptable, with the infant/young child's state important; treatment of high BP is often directed at the underlying cause since primary hypertension is uncommon. For children, ages 3–11 years, routine measurement of BP during health care visits is recommended for health maintenance and illness visits; auscultation should be the method of choice for confirmation of elevated BP measured with an oscillometric device, BP percentiles from The Fourth Report based on age, gender, and height percentiles should be used to categorize BP as prehypertension or Stage 1 or Stage 2 Hypertension, and BP elevation must be persistent to be considered hypertension.

### Longitudinal studies of ageing: from insights to impacts: commentary to accompany themed collection on longitudinal studies [^47c630cf]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

'Time is the best diagnostician': who has not thought this? In clinical practice, presentations are often subtle and decisions made in the face of a 'snapshot'. Crystal balls do not exist; yet, insights from longitudinal studies can help to recognise emerging pictures and anticipate typical trajectories. In the multifactorial, biopsychosocial world of geriatrics, the determinants of those trajectories, and hence opportunities to modify them, can be better understood through careful longitudinal disentangling of the wider determinants of health, and this can be done at multiple levels of analysis, from molecules to society. With this collection and commentary, we highlight the approaches, scope and impacts of a selection of longitudinal studies of ageing published in Age and Ageing within the past 10 years. Longitudinal studies can illuminate disease mechanisms, how declines in multiple domains of intrinsic capacity interact, how losses in one domain may influence the path of another, and in turn, how these changes translate to functional disability, or not. Observing trajectories of geriatric syndromes can suggest opportunities for optimisation and prevention in clinical practice and policy. With global opportunities for harmonising data, longitudinal studies are already offering the opportunity for cross-national comparisons and for developing hypotheses about the relative contributions of time, place and society in the trajectories of frailty, disability and quality of life. We also include studies which show how research-based longitudinal data can be synthesised or be linked to administrative datasets. We hope you find this collection as interesting and encouraging as we have.

### Vitamin D supplementation and prevention of type 2 diabetes [^2f3dcb14]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Observational studies support an association between a low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, whether vitamin D supplementation lowers the risk of diabetes is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned adults who met at least two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose level, 100 to 125 mg per deciliter; plasma glucose level 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, 140 to 199 mg per deciliter; and glycated hemoglobin level, 5.7 to 6.4%) and no diagnostic criteria for diabetes to receive 4000 IU per day of vitamin D 3 or placebo, regardless of the baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. The primary outcome in this time-to-event analysis was new-onset diabetes, and the trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508.

Results

A total of 2423 participants underwent randomization (1211 to the vitamin D group and 1212 to the placebo group). By month 24, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the vitamin D group was 54.3 ng per milliliter (from 27.7 ng per milliliter at baseline), as compared with 28.8 ng per milliliter in the placebo group (from 28.2 ng per milliliter at baseline). After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the primary outcome of diabetes occurred in 293 participants in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.39 and 10.66 events per 100 person-years, respectively). The hazard ratio for vitamin D as compared with placebo was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.04; P = 0.12). The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

Among persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D 3 supplementation at a dose of 4000 IU per day did not result in a significantly lower risk of diabetes than placebo.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^4738e611]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

FENO measurement in children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing — prediction of future asthma: In children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing, the Expert Panel recommends against FENO measurement to predict the future development of asthma (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). The Clinician's Summary states that in children aged 4 years and younger with recurrent wheezing, FENO measurement does not reliably predict the future development of asthma, and test results should be interpreted with caution until more data are available; the Expert Panel recommends against using FENO testing to predict future development of asthma in this age group until additional research and clinical practice determinations are available. Evidence synthesis identified ten studies in children younger than 5 years to predict subsequent asthma in those aged 5 years and older; none were RCTs, seven were nonrandomized longitudinal studies and three were cross-sectional; in only a single study, a FENO level indicating increased risk yielded a positive predictive value of 58.0% for a composite of wheezing, diagnosis of asthma, or use of an ICS at age 7 years, with a negative predictive value of 78.2%. Additional context notes that FENO can be measured in young children with normal resting breathing and reference values exist for ages 1 to 5 years; in some preschool children with recurrent coughing and wheezing, an elevated FENO level more than 4 weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection may help predict physician-diagnosed asthma at school age, but the studies reviewed had conflicting results and provided low to moderate certainty; the acceptability of FENO measurement for predictive purposes is low and use of this testing is unlikely to change current treatment standards and could actually misdirect care.

### Longitudinal phenotypic aging metrics in the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging [^f1241f67]. Nature Aging (2022). High credibility.

There are several strengths in this work that outweigh its limitations. Indeed, the longitudinal trajectories of aging phenotypes have been examined one by one in detail in our previous work, which helped us refine and validate the conceptual framework for this study. The longitudinal data enabled us to focus on the aging effect and control for the time-invariant unmeasured confounding (for example, early life exposures) using mixed-effect models. In regard to the calculation of global longitudinal phenotypic score, we adopted a flexible strategy to include everyone with longitudinal information on at least one phenotype in each of four domains. This operationalization makes the creation of such a score feasible in other cohorts in the future. One important aspect of this approach is that it can discriminate between cohort effects that are already present from birth and aging effects (true differences in trajectories that occur over the lifespan). The framework illustrated here can be easily adopted in other cohorts if longitudinal data in phenotypes covering four phenotypic domains are collected. Linking this global longitudinal phenotypic score with cellular and molecular measurements will improve the potential to identify the underlying biological mechanisms of aging.

In conclusion, this work demonstrates the usefulness of our hierarchical and temporal conceptual framework regarding three metrics of aging. Our work proposes a powerful method to summarize the longitudinal trajectory of aging phenotypes. These results can build the foundation for both research focused on understanding the biology of aging and the implementation of phenotypic aging measurement in trials targeting the rate of aging and its consequences.

### Fully-automated deep learning-based flow quantification of 2D CINE phase contrast MRI [^6a262778]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Human flow analysis

Analysis was performed using commercial software (cvi42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc.) by a CV-radiologist with 3 years of experience (M.P.). Three different readings were performed, manual analysis (MA), uncorrected semi-automated analysis (uncorSAA) and corrected semi-automated analysis (corSAA) (Fig. 1). We considered MA the reference because it was unbiased regarding vessel contouring compared to the semi-automated approach.

Fig. 1

Demonstration of human (manual analysis (MA) and corrected semi-automated analysis (corSAA)) and deep learning (DL) measurements in one case for five time points with respective volume-over-time and velocity-over-time curves, each showing the time points measured. A, B Measurements at STJ. (A1-5) Magnitude (top) and phase contrast images for STJ measurements with respective DSC between MA (green) and DL contours (red) for each time point. B Flow volume and flow velocity curves at STJ. C, D Measurement in PA.

D Flow volume and flow velocity curves at PA. corSAA, corrected semi-automatic analysis; DL, deep learning; DSC, Dice score; MA, manual analysis; PA, pulmonary artery; PC, phase contrast; STJ, Sinotubular junction

For MA, the vessel contour was delineated for the first time point on the magnitude images. Then, the contour was copied and manually adjusted on the next time point; this process was repeated for all time points and the time required was recorded. For uncorSAA, the vessel was contoured on the first time point of the magnitude images, this contour was forwarded and adjusted by the software. Of note, this was not a DL technique. The corSAA was based on the uncorSAA contours, but the radiologist checked the contour at each time point and adjusted it if necessary. The total time for checking and adjusting was recorded. Subsequent flow quantification for each approach included the calculation of net, forward, and backward flow. In addition, peak velocity was automatically calculated based on the voxel with the highest velocity during systole, defined as the first third of all time points available.

### Labour Q1 pain-poorly analysed and reported: a systematic review [^338e2e2e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Secondly, an assumption that is implicit for rANOVA is the sphericity assumption, which implies that variance is assumed to be equal at all times (constant variance) and that the covariance (correlation) between any two time-points is equal. These assumptions are usually not met when labour pain is analysed since consecutive pain measurements on the same woman tend to be more correlated than measurements taken further away in time. For example, the correlation between a woman's pain assessments at the two first measurements (which are often measured with a short time interval between them) are often higher than the correlation between the first and last pain measurement. When rANOVA is used despite not fulfilling the assumptions, there is a risk for type I errors when the interaction between treatment and time is tested, which in turn might lead to incorrect conclusions about the question of whether there is a difference in labour pain at different time-points.

### D-dimer testing to determine the duration of anticoagulation therapy [^3004a611]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral anticoagulation in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism is uncertain. Testing of D-dimer levels may play a role in the assessment of the need for prolonged anticoagulation.

Methods

We performed D-dimer testing 1 month after the discontinuation of anticoagulation in patients with a first unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who had received a vitamin K antagonist for at least 3 months. Patients with a normal D-dimer level did not resume anticoagulation, whereas those with an abnormal D-dimer level were randomly assigned either to resume or to discontinue treatment. The study outcome was the composite of recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding during an average follow-up of 1.4 years.

Results

The D-dimer assay was abnormal in 223 of 608 patients (36.7%). A total of 18 events occurred among the 120 patients who stopped anticoagulation (15.0%), as compared with 3 events among the 103 patients who resumed anticoagulation (2.9%), for an adjusted hazard ratio of 4.26 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23 to 14.6; P = 0.02). Thromboembolism recurred in 24 of 385 patients with a normal D-dimer level (6.2%). Among patients who stopped anticoagulation, the adjusted hazard ratio for recurrent thromboembolism among those with an abnormal D-dimer level, as compared with those with a normal D-dimer level, was 2.27 (95% CI, 1.15 to 4.46; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Patients with an abnormal D-dimer level 1 month after the discontinuation of anticoagulation have a significant incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism, which is reduced by the resumption of anticoagulation. The optimal course of anticoagulation in patients with a normal D-dimer level has not been clearly established. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00264277 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).

### Age differences in self-continuity: converging evidence and directions for future research [^8617c4f3]. The Gerontologist (2017). Low credibility.

Life-span development is inherently linked to the perception of time and associated temporal construals. Such concepts are multi-faceted in nature and have important practical implications in areas such as time management, financial planning, or medical choices. A large body of research has documented age-related limitations in global time horizons, but age differences in other aspects of temporal construal are comparatively poorly understood. The present article draws attention to developmental trajectories of self-continuity, defined as perceived associations of one's present self with past and future selves. After considering historical roots and contemporary views on self-continuity, we turn to the life-span developmental literature and review several convergent streams of research that provide indirect evidence for age-related increases in self-continuity. We then consider a small body of recent studies which have directly assessed age differences in self-continuity and summarize our current understanding of this phenomenon including associations between explicit and implicit measures, symmetry between past and future self-continuity, and differentiation from other aspects of time perception. We conclude by highlighting open theoretical questions and considering the practical implications of an increased sense of self-continuity with advancing age.

### 25 (OH) D2 half-life is shorter than 25 (OH) D3 half-life and is influenced by DBP concentration and genotype [^6540cf02]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

There is uncertainty over the equivalence of vitamins D2 and D3 to maintain plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D).

Objective

The objective of the study was to compare the plasma half-lives of 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 in two distinct populations with different dietary calcium intake and 25(OH)D status.

Participants

Healthy men (aged 24 and 39 y), resident in The Gambia (n = 18) or the United Kingdom (n = 18) participated in the study.

Interventions

The intervention included an oral tracer dose of deuterated-25(OH)D2 and deuterated-25(OH)D3 (both 40 nmol). Blood samples were collected over 33 days.

Main Outcome Measures

25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 plasma half-lives, concentrations of 25(OH)D, and vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and DBP genotypes were measured.

Results

25(OH)D2 half-life [mean (SD)] [13.9 (2.6) d] was shorter than 25(OH)D3 half-life [15.1 (3.1) d; P = 0.001] for countries combined, and in Gambians [12.8 (2.3) d vs 14.7 (3.5) d; P < .001], but not in the United Kingdom [15.1 (2.4) d vs 15.6 (2.5) d; P = 0.3]. 25(OH)D concentration was 69 (13) and 29 (11) nmol/L (P < .0001), and the DBP concentration was 259 (33) and 269 (23) mg/L (P = 0.4) in The Gambia and United Kingdom, respectively. Half-lives were positively associated with plasma DBP concentration for countries combined [25(OH)D2 half-life: regression coefficient (SE) 0.03 (0.01) d per 1 mg/L DBP, P = 0.03; 25(OH)D3 half-life: 0.04 (0.02) d, P = 0.02] and in Gambians [25(OH)D2 half-life: 0.04 (0.01) d; P = 0.02; 25(OH)D3 half-life: 0.06 (0.02) d, P = 0.01] but not in UK participants. The DBP concentration × country interactions were not significant. DBP Gc1f/1f homozygotes had shorter 25(OH)D2 half-lives compared with other combined genotypes (P = 0.007) after correction for country.

Conclusions

25(OH)D2 half-life was shorter than 25(OH)D3 half-life, and half-lives were affected by DBP concentration and genotype. The stable isotope 25(OH)D half-life measurements provide a novel tool to investigate vitamin D metabolism and vitamin D expenditure and aid in the assessment of vitamin D requirements.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^27c48aab]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Longitudinal evidence linking childhood risk factors to adult subclinical atherosclerosis — Four longitudinal studies have shown relationships between risk factors measured in childhood and young adulthood and later subclinical atherosclerosis; in many of these studies, childhood and adolescent risk factors were better predictors of adult atherosclerosis than were risk factors measured at the time of the subclinical atherosclerosis study, and in two cohorts worsening risk status between the earliest and latest measurements was associated with increased evidence of the presence of atherosclerosis.

### Quantifying the time-varying association between objectively measured physical activity and mortality in US older adults over a 12-year follow-up period: the NHANES 2003–2006 study [^55ca2087]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Objectively measuring physical activity (PA) has consistently shown an association with reduced all-cause mortality risk in cross-sectional studies. However, the strength of this association may change over time. We quantify the time-varying, covariate-adjusted association between the total volume of PA and all-cause mortality over a 12-year follow-up period using Cox regression with a time varying effect of population-referenced quantile total activity count adjusted for traditional risk factors. Analyses focus on participants 50–84 years old with adequate accelerometer wear time and without missing covariates. The findings suggest that (1) the use of baseline PA in Cox models with long follow-up periods may be inappropriate without time-varying effects and (2) the use of accelerometry derived volume of PA in risk score calculations may be most appropriate for short-term to medium-term risk scores.

### A systematic review of frailty trajectories: their shape and influencing factors [^17320680]. The Gerontologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Frailty describes an increased vulnerability to adverse events such as disease or injury. Combating this state remains a major challenge for geriatric research. By exploring how and why frailty changes throughout later life we will be better positioned to improve ways of identifying and treating those at high risk.

Research Design and Methods

We systematically reviewed publications that captured rate of frailty progression over time and established any associated risk or protective factors that affected this progression. We included longitudinal observational studies which quantified frailty trajectories in adults aged 50+ using any validated continuous frailty measurement tool.

Results

After screening 8,318 publications, 25 met our criteria. Findings show that despite a great degree of heterogeneity in the literature, progression of frailty is unquestionably affected by numerous risk and protective factors, with particular influence exhibited by social demographics, brain pathology, and physical comorbidities.

Discussion and Implications

Findings that the gradient of frailty progression is affected by various influencing factors are valuable to clinicians and policymakers as they will help identify those at highest frailty risk and inform prevention strategies. However, the heterogeneous methodological approaches of the publications included in this review highlight the need for consensus within the field to promote more coordinated research. Improved consistency of methods will enable further data synthesis and facilitate a greater understanding of the shape of frailty over time and the influencing factors contributing to change, the results of which could have crucial implications for frailty risk reduction.

### The time-efficiency principle: time as the key diagnostic strategy in primary care [^2968fdcb]. Family Practice (2013). Low credibility.

The test and retest opportunity afforded by reviewing a patient over time substantially increases the total gain in certainty when making a diagnosis in low-prevalence settings (the time-efficiency principle). This approach safely and efficiently reduces the number of patients who need to be formally tested in order to make a correct diagnosis for a person. Time, in terms of observed disease trajectory, provides a vital mechanism for achieving this task. It remains the best strategy for delivering near-optimal diagnoses in low-prevalence settings and should be used to its full advantage.

### Maximizing insights from longitudinal epigenetic age data: simulations, applications, and practical guidance [^ffd580f1]. Clinical Epigenetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Modeling longitudinal epigenetic age

Numerous approaches exist to model effects that exposures have on longitudinal outcomes like EA. Approaches differ in (1) the choice of model, (2) outcome, and (3) time variables, as well as (4) the number of repeated measures included in those methods.

The three most frequently applied models are linear mixed effect models (LME), generalized estimating equations (GEE), and Δ aging. LME models and GEE both analyze repeated measures, like tracking changes in EA over time in an individual's life, and model differences in mean trends between groups, such as those exposed to a factor compared to those who were not. In both methods, the fixed effect, which stays consistent throughout all measures, as well as the interaction effect, which accumulates over time, are typically modeled as:whereis either EA or epigenetic age acceleration (EAA, the residual resulting from regressing EA on chronological age) measured in individual i, at timepoint j. To accommodate longitudinal changes, both models account for time. Time variables commonly used, summarized in Fig. 1, range from chronological age at the time of measurement to age-independent variables, including the duration in days or years between measurements, numerical ranks (e.g. 1, 2, 3) or factorized values (e.g. F07, F09, F15).

Fig. 1
Overview of common time variables included in longitudinal epigenetic age studies and their application in ARIES cohort data. Age variables in our example should be interpreted as a single study participant's age at measurement, since chronological age differs between individuals

Another method to analyze variations in temporal changes is a two-step approach involving "Δ aging" ("delta aging"). The Δ aging method is limited to studies with two repeated measures, as it quantifies the difference between measurements, often referred to as the "Δ aging" score, and then compares these scores between groups, for example using linear regression. Firstly, Δ aging is typically calculated as the difference between a follow-up and a baseline measure of either EA or EAA, with or without adjustment for the duration of time between measurements:whereandrepresent EAA or EA and age at the initial measure, whileandcorrespond to the follow-up measure. Secondly, models such as linear regression can be used to compare trends in Δ aging between the different groups:whereis the above-described difference score between two measures for individual i.

### Time-of-flight resolved light field fluctuations reveal deep human tissue physiology [^f23e35d5]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In vivo bulk motion correction

Non-contact assessment of optical field fluctuations in humans requires management of motion artifacts. A uniform axial sample velocity imparts a linear phase shift to the sample field, and thus, the estimated field autocorrelation. Consequently, if the sample velocity changes randomly during the time window for autocorrelation estimation, sample dynamics are overestimated (see Supplementary Note 1).

To solve this, we employ short SD separations to provide a large backscattered/few-scattered static reference from which phase drift can be estimated and subsequently corrected. To maintain sufficient dynamic range to detect long TOF diffuse light at short SD separations, we apply digital spectral shaping (Supplementary Fig. 1). To assess motion, we consider the iNIRS field autocorrelation, at null SD separation in the human forearm, estimated over a short 2 ms window, at τ s, peak, the TOF of the temporal point spread function (TPSF) maximum (Fig. 2a, b). The behavior of, where the real and imaginary parts are sinusoidal and in quadrature (Fig. 2c), corresponds to rotation in the complex plane, which implies a Doppler frequency shift, ∆f = ∆θ_bps/[2π∆τ_d], where ∆θ_bps and ∆τ_d are bulk Doppler phase shift and lag time resolution, respectively. Therefore, we assume a uniform Doppler velocity over this short window. The Doppler phase/frequency shift can be approximated from the peak of the Fourier transform of(power spectrum, Fig. 2d). The Doppler frequency shift time course over a 2.5 s acquisition is then obtained by sliding the short window across the time course (Fig. 2e). We assume that the peak TOF for null SD consists largely of backscattered light from extravascular tissue. This assumption is reasonable as backscattered light in a single mode is typically orders of magnitude larger than multiply scattered light in that mode, and the fractional blood volume of most tissues is typically on the order of 5% or less. As the sole intrinsic dynamics of static tissue are slow intracellular motility, we propose that this Doppler shift is caused by bulk axial motion of the sample. The bulk Doppler phase shift is summed cumulatively over time and unwrapped to yield the cumulative unwrapped phase, θ bps. Conversion from cumulative unwrapped phase to axial shift Z based on Z(t_d) = θ_bps(t_d)λ₀/[4π] suggests micrometer-scale bulk motion (solid black line in Fig. 2f, right axis). As bulk motion should be identical for all TOFs, it can also be determined by integratingover TOF prior to phase estimation (green in Fig. 2f). Upon correction (Supplementary Fig. 2), the cumulative bulk phase θ bps at the peak TOF is nearly constant, as expected for static tissue (red in Fig. 2f).

### Joint consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and sleep research society on the recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: methodology and discussion [^de5745d5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult — future directions specify "five specific areas for future research consideration", including: 1) "Improved sleep duration measures and study designs", where studies "should include objective measures of sleep when possible, well-validated self-report measures, and ecologically valid study designs", and epidemiology "would benefit from using home polysomnography, actigraphy, or other novel objective methods"; laboratory work is "needed that systematically vary sleep opportunity in discrete steps between doses of 6 hours and 8 hours", and "should examine relevant time periods (e.g., 30 days)" and "more systematically mimic the more typical lifestyle of cycling through doses of shorter (restricted) and longer (extended) sleep opportunities". 2) "Investigate downstream mechanisms linking habitual sleep duration to health and functioning", with "Intervention studies [that] could also help to clarify whether modifying sleep improves health outcomes". 3) "Better delineate the upstream physiologic, behavioral, social, and environmental factors that may play a role in sleep duration and health outcomes". 4) "Develop intervention studies", since we "do not yet know whether habitual sleep duration can be modified in the real world", so "a systematic approach, moving from treatment development studies, to efficacy studies, to large-scale pragmatic trials, is warranted".

### Associations between accelerometry measured physical activity and sedentary time and the metabolic syndrome: a meta-analysis of more than 6000 children and adolescents [^9f929667]. Pediatric Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in children and adolescents is low, it rises with age. 1, 2 Furthermore MetS is more prevalent in youth with overweight and obesity 3 which is especially threatening with regard to the continuous rise of obesity levels in this population. 4 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors already begin to cluster during childhood and adolescence 5 and track into adulthood. 6 Evidence from longitudinal studies suggests that pediatric MetS may transfer into an increased risk for CVD, type 2 diabetes mellitus and premature death. 7, 8, 9 To develop effective public health strategies and prevent an early onset of MetS, knowledge about preventive lifestyle factors such as physical activity and time spent sedentary is required.

Existing evidence in children and adolescents indicates a beneficial association between objectively measured physical activity and several cardio‐metabolic biomarkers as well as adiposity. 10 The association between sedentary time and cardio‐metabolic health remains inconsistent. A recent systematic review suggested strong evidence for a prospective relationship between TV‐viewing time and obesity and for an inverse relationship between different sedentary time measures and HDL‐cholesterol but no or insufficient evidence for associations between sedentary time and other biomarkers and metabolic risk scores. 11 When total sedentary time measured by accelerometry is considered, some found cross‐sectional associations between sedentary time and a metabolic risk score 12, 13 or single risk factors 14 while others did not. 15, 16 Further, associations between sedentary time and metabolic risk scores appear attenuated when additionally adjusted for physical activity. 17, 18, 19 Prospectively, no association between sedentary time and a metabolic risk score or single risk factors have been observed. 20, 21

However, most studies with objective measurements of physical activity and sedentary time have used metabolic risk scores or single biomarkers as outcomes and only three studies have assessed the associations between objectively measured physical activity and MetS 1, 22, 23 and only one of these examined the associations between objectively measured sedentary time and MetS as a dichotomous outcome in children and adolescents. 23 The advantage of using MetS as a dichotomous variable rather than a continuous score is that MetS prevalence and effect estimates (e.g. OR, RR) can be compared across studies and countries.

The objectives of this study were therefore to estimate the prevalence of MetS and examine the associations between objectively measured physical activity, sedentary time and MetS in a large and diverse multicentre sample of 6009 children and adolescents using a meta‐analytical approach.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of severe frostbite [^4128798a]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

American Burn Association clinical practice guideline — reporting standards and registry dataset for severe frostbite emphasize outcome reporting and standardized variables. We would recommend a minimum report including per person amputation and an overall salvage rate, and severity of injury should be obtained by imaging or bedside perfusion test after rewarming, with reporting of the timing of rewarming, time to post-rewarming testing, and post-rewarming treatment; additionally, delayed imaging may be used as an alternative outcome measure. To address research priorities, implementation of a standard frostbite dataset for registries could significantly improve research and outcomes and could be best achieved through the ABA, and these variables should include: measure of severity of frostbite injury after rewarming and documentation of method of measurement; documentation of use or non-use of rapid rewarming in a water bath; description of any use of thrombolytics and method of delivery; recorded time from admission to thrombolysis; documentation of use of any continued anticoagulation and the length of time it was used; and time to surgical management on primary admission or subsequent admissions.

Strengths and weaknesses of the literature — this body of work includes data on millions of participants across continents and decades, with human performance studies providing strong experimental and objective evidence and population-based outcomes; however, epidemiologic studies are often cross-sectional, frequently rely on retrospective self-report with measurement error, vary in question wording and capture of napping, and use inconsistent sleep-duration definitions where short sleep may be categorized as < 5, 5, 6, or < 8 hours and reference groups as 7, 8, 7–8, 7–9, or 6–8 hours.

### Perspectives on the measurement of self-perceived cognitive function in older adults [^11212b9b]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Survey content

The survey consisted of four parts (Supporting Information) and involved a combination of multiple‐choice questions, open‐ended questions, allocation of percentages, and two‐item selections.
Part I (Background and practices): Information was gathered about respondents' gender, educational level, professional setting (e.g. hospital, university, rehabilitation center), discipline (e.g. psychology, medicine, including subdomains), profession (e.g. clinician, researcher, instructor), and years of experience. Respondents were also asked to indicate whether they routinely used instruments to assess self‐perceived cognitive functioning in older adults and to what degree they perceived a need for a harmonized instrument. These latter two items were multiple choice with an option to elaborate in a text box.
Part II (Item content): Perspectives on the relevance of item content were explored. Respondents were shown two separate lists of item stems (one list of 20 memory item stems and one list of 30 non‐memory item stems) taken from items that showed relatively high information values, as found by Rabin et al. (2023). The memory versus non‐memory distinction was made because memory items alone made up over 50% of the original item bank (15). Respondents were asked to select up to eight items from each list that they viewed as most relevant for the measurement of self‐perceived cognitive functioning in older adults. We compared the item ranking (from most chosen to least chosen) to the previously reported item information values. Subsequently, respondents were shown a list of various cognitive domains: memory, attention/working memory/processing speed, language, executive function, basic calculation and arithmetic tasks, orientation (to person, time, place, or situation), and visuospatial skills (for details on domains, see Rabin et al.). Respondents were asked to allocate a percentage to each domain based on how they would ideally cover each domain on a questionnaire. They were able to write in a maximum of two additional domains that they deemed relevant but that were not included in the list. The total allocated percentage had to add up to 100%.
Part III (Item format): Perspectives on item features were assessed, including the most relevant timeframe to measure, measuring ability and/or change, and optimal response formats.
Part IV (Questionnaire features): Respondents selected up to three preferences for practical features and approaches to validation. Practical features included, for example, brevity and cost. Validation approaches included, for example, the relationship with biomarkers and predictive value. Both lists were composed of 10 options. For both questions, respondents could write in additional preferences and elaborate on choices in a comment box.

### Choosing the duration of continuous glucose monitoring for reliable assessment of time in range: a new analytical approach to overcome the limitations of correlation-based methods [^779e93ce]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Reliable estimation of the time spent in different glycaemic ranges (time-in-ranges) requires sufficiently long continuous glucose monitoring. In a 2019 paper (Battelino et al. Clinical targets for continuous glucose monitoring data interpretation: recommendations from the international consensus on time in range. Diabetes Care. 2019;42:1593–1603), an international panel of experts suggested using a correlation-based approach to obtain the minimum number of days for reliable time-in-ranges estimates. More recently (in Camerlingo et al. Design of clinical trials to assess diabetes treatment: minimum duration of continuous glucose monitoring data to estimate time-in-ranges with the desired precision. Diabetes Obes Metab. 2021;23:2446–2454) we presented a mathematical equation linking the number of monitoring days to the uncertainty around time-in-ranges estimates. In this work, we compare these two approaches, mainly focusing on time spent in (70–180) mg/dL range (TIR).

Methods

The first 100 and 150 days of data were extracted from study A (148 subjects, ~180 days), and the first 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 days of data from study B (45 subjects, ~365 days). For each of these data windows, the minimum monitoring duration was computed using correlation-based and equation-based approaches. The suggestions were compared for the windows of different durations extracted from the same study, and for the windows of equal duration extracted from different studies.

Results

When changing the dataset duration, the correlation-based approach produces inconsistent results, ranging from 23 to 64 days, for TIR. The equation-based approach was found to be robust versus this issue, as it is affected only by the characteristics of the population being monitored. Indeed, to grant a confidence interval of 5% around TIR, it suggests 18 days for windows from study A, and 17 days for windows from study B. Similar considerations hold for other time-in-ranges.

Conclusions

The equation-based approach offers advantages for the design of clinical trials having time-in-ranges as final end points, with focus on trial duration.

### American Academy of Sleep Medicine position paper for the use of a home sleep apnea test for the diagnosis of OSA in children [^26d3b3a8]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric HSAT measurement limitations — Current devices typically lack total sleep time output and require alternative methods to derive an accurate denominator for respiratory indices; less invasive arousal-detection methods need validation. The page specifies, "Most clinically used HSAT devices do not provide data regarding total sleep time", and that "Future studies need to investigate the reliability of actigraphy or other testing so that there is an accurate denominator to calculate respiratory indices". It further notes that although "arousals are currently measured by EEG, cardiac algorithms or peripheral arterial tonometry may potentially be a less invasive option to detect arousals, but this must be demonstrated".

### Future time perspective: dimensions of opportunities, life, and time are differentially associated with physical health, cognitive functioning, and well-being in old age [^60bd38ea]. Aging & Mental Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: The present study investigated the multidimensional nature of the future time perspective scale and dimension-specific associations with measures of physical health, cognitive functioning, and well-being. Method: Using data from the Berlin Aging Study II (N = 1,038, M age = 71years, range = 61-88years, 52% women), different models of future time perspective were compared using confirmatory factor analyses, and the best-fitting model was then used to explore dimension-specific associations with physical health, cognitive functioning, and well-being measures. Results: A model of future time perspective composed of a focus on opportunities, a focus on life, and a focus on time was found to have the best fit. An extended focus on opportunities was associated with stronger grip strength, more accurate memory, as well as higher life satisfaction and positive affect. An extended focus on time was associated with less accurate memory, lower negative affect, and greater life satisfaction. A focus on life was unrelated to study measures. Discussion: Findings suggest that future time perspective is multidimensional and that these dimensions are differentially associated with physical health, cognitive functioning, and well-being in old age.

Left ventricular diastolic function — special situations note that mitral deceleration time (DT) should be used for assessment of LV diastolic function in patients with recent cardioversion to sinus rhythm whose markedly reduced mitral A velocity at the time of echocardiography can lead to an E/A ratio ≥ 2 despite the absence of elevated LV filling pressures; in young individuals (< 40 years of age) E/A ratios ≥ 2 may be a normal finding so other signs of diastolic dysfunction should be sought, and in healthy young people (< 40 years of age) the pulmonary venous S/D ratio can be < 1 while normal annular e' velocity and LA maximum volume index help verify normal function.

### Cross-sectionally calculated metabolic aging does not relate to longitudinal metabolic changes-support for stratified aging models [^fdd68e19]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Multiple population-based cohorts were leveraged to investigate how aging manifests in systemic metabolism and whether modeling the metabolic age based on cross-sectional surveys provides information on an individual's metabolic trajectory (Fig. 1A). We found no evidence that cross-sectional modeling of aging provides information on how fast metabolic profiles change over time for an individual (Fig. 2D).

Experimental studies indicate that molecular processes related to aging are under genetic and epigenetic regulation, but it may be possible to slow down the molecular clock by caloric restriction and other interventions. Demonstrating this phenomenon in humans is challenging, but the concept of metabolic age has been introduced as a proxy indicator of how far the clock has ticked. Under the clock model, one could expect that a cross-sectional snapshot in the middle of the trajectory would reflect the divergent slopes that fan out from the starting point and that the snapshot could thus be used as a measure of accelerated aging (Fig. 3A). We could not detect the expected consequence of the molecular clock model of aging in young and middle-aged adults, as we could not establish a correlation between the metabolic age residuals and the observed change in metabolic age. As an alternative explanation, we speculate that the results arose from stratified aging where the rates of adult metabolic aging per se are not predictable by the current metabolic health status (Fig. 3B). In addition to statistical fluctuations, the metabolic age residuals are likely to reflect the genetic and environmental determinants of circulating metabolism and the interplay between the current degree of adiposity and energy metabolism.

Hypothetical scenarios that generate different relationships between cross-sectional metabolic age residuals and longitudinally measured change in metabolic age. (A) Extrapolation of longitudinal trajectories from cross-sectional data under the molecular clock hypothesis where individuals start at the same level of health but decline at different rates. (B) A stratified model of aging where the fundamental rate of aging is constant but starting points are different. This model fits to our findings better than the metabolic clock model.

These findings are consequential for the current aging research in metabolomics, as molecular aging signatures are regularly derived from cross-sectional data and interpreted as representations of individuals' biological ages. This approach appears to be mostly, if not entirely, misplaced.

### Losing the wait: improving patient cycle time in primary care [^82c6dab4]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Inefficient clinic systems leading to prolonged wait times at primary care clinics are a source of frustration for patients, physicians, staff and administration. Measuring and shortening cycle time has the potential to improve patient experience, staff satisfaction and patient access by moving more patients through in a shorter cycle time. Limited studies have demonstrated that improvements can be made to cycle time and may result in improved patient satisfaction. Most of these studies have focused their efforts on improving efficiency at the front end of the cycle. Our aim was to improve cycle time for the whole visit to less than 60min within 1year by engaging our team in brainstorming solutions, presenting regular measurements to our team for review and holding regular meetings to plan rapid improvement cycles. Over the course of 1year (2017), we were able to reduce cycle time by 12% from 71to 65min and to improve patient satisfaction with care. Despite the reduction in cycle time, we maintained high satisfaction scores from patients who felt that the doctor spent enough time with them. We learnt the value of engaging our team, frequent measurement for reporting, adequate staffing at the beginning of clinic, and the value of MA staff acting in a flow coordinator role. We have not only maintained this improvement but also made further small gains over the subsequent 2years, and by April 2019, our cycle time is at 60min, despite a marked increase in patient volume. Additional work on the time after the patient is roomed and waiting for a doctor, and further analysis of the physician workflow would be important next steps to drive further improvement.

### Longitudinal changes in brain asymmetry track lifestyle and disease [^67bfeaca]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The known differences between results from cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses have repercussions beyond the realm of brain asymmetry, and suggest that existing and on-going cross-sectional investigations aimed at understanding brain change over time (for example, brain-age studies or normative modelling) would benefit from parallel longitudinal investigations in order to benchmark predicted trajectories obtained from between-individual measurements (cross-sectional) against those obtained from within-individual (longitudinal) measurements.

A limitation of this and other longitudinal MRI-based studies is the potential confounds of behaviours outside those under investigation. For example, short-term activity (finger tapping) can result in differences in grey matter volume estimates. In-scanner visual conditions can result in apparent morphological changes in areas linked to the visual cortex. Finally, diurnal fluctuations may be reflected in different brain activity throughout the day. Though traditionally investigated in the context of brain function, there is emerging evidence that time of day may also influence apparent grey matter volume estimates. Therefore, longitudinal studies would benefit from taking steps to ensure that individual patients are scanned at roughly the same time of day across visits, and that in cross-sectional studies, all individuals be scanned at the same time of day. Overall, integrative research combining cross-sectional with longitudinal studies will not only validate existing knowledge but also pave the way for more precise and functional insights into brain asymmetry and its role in behaviour, health and disease.

Evolutionarily uniquely evolved brain asymmetries appear to be strongly shaped by many non-genetic mechanisms –; neither are they static. In-depth explorations into within-subject changes in asymmetries in brain morphology over the span of years, we revealed that structural asymmetry is a dynamic rather than inert property of the brain. Our results further reveal the interdependences of external experiences with internal brain adaptations. We find that changes in hemispheric balance between brain regions are closely tied into health and disease: behaviour, cognitive performance, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle as well as mental and physical medical conditions. These connections in some cases exceed the relationship between structural asymmetry change and ubiquitously studied demographic factors, such as age and sex. In light of these multifaceted dynamics, our population neuroscience study emphasizes the relevance of asymmetry changes in understanding behaviour and highlights the necessity of longitudinal research in comprehending the brain's adaptation to diverse life events.
