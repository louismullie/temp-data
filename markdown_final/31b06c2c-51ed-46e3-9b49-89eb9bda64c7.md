## Question

70 year female with dementia and 2 hospitalizations and mom and sister with breast cancer had a normal mammogram 3 years ago. What is most predictive factor to help decide to screen for breast cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which factor is most predictive for deciding whether to continue breast cancer screening in a 70-year-old woman with dementia, and how to weigh competing predictors like age, family history (mother and sister affected), recent hospitalizations, and prior screening results (a normal mammogram three years ago). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that screening decisions in older adults hinge on life expectancy and health status rather than age alone. Then, I should verify how dementia and recent hospitalizations influence prognosis and the likelihood of benefit. Next, I will examine whether family history meaningfully changes the balance of benefits and harms in this specific context. After that, I should review guideline positions and quantify potential benefits versus harms. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline a practical, values-based approach to shared decision-making, including tools and documentation needs [^116FTBAX].

> Let me first confirm the core principle: for women aged 75 and older, and increasingly for those approaching 75 with significant comorbidity, the dominant predictor of whether screening confers net benefit is life expectancy and overall health status, not chronological age or family history alone. I need to ensure I anchor this to high-quality guidance, and indeed the American Cancer Society advises continuing screening only if health is good and life expectancy is at least 10 years, while the USPSTF issues an I statement for women 75 and older due to insufficient evidence, emphasizing individualized judgment based on health and longevity [^111FYQwv] [^1128s8yR] [^116V11Pj].

> Wait, let me verify how dementia and recent hospitalizations alter prognosis. Dementia is associated with reduced life expectancy and increased frailty, and geriatric oncology frameworks consistently recommend incorporating geriatric assessment and life expectancy estimation into cancer screening decisions for older adults. I should double-check that even in healthier cohorts, a substantial fraction of women 80 and older have less than a 10-year life expectancy, reinforcing that cognitive impairment and functional decline are strong negative predictors of screening benefit. The American Geriatrics Society highlights that many older adults with limited life expectancy continue to be screened despite minimal chance of benefit, underscoring the need to align testing with prognosis and goals of care [^112uvJ3Q] [^116ZTVC4] [^113qNgM7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about family history. I initially thought a first-degree family history might tip the scales toward screening, but I should confirm whether that applies here. Family history increases baseline risk, yet in women with limited life expectancy the time horizon to realize mortality benefit from screening is too short, and the absolute benefit remains negligible even with modestly elevated risk. Observational and modeling work in older women shows that benefits of continued screening accrue only when life expectancy exceeds roughly a decade, whereas harms from false positives, biopsies, and overdiagnosis occur immediately. So, in a 70-year-old with dementia, family history is a secondary modifier at best and does not overcome the lack of a sufficient time horizon for benefit [^116FTBAX] [^111FYQwv] [^115CDdsy].

> Next, I should review guideline convergence to ensure I'm not over-weighting any single source. The ACS explicitly ties screening continuation to good health and at least a 10-year life expectancy, ACOG supports screening to at least age 75 with decisions beyond that based on health and longevity, and the USPSTF gives an I statement for ages 75 and older, advising clinician judgment. ESMO emphasizes individualized assessment in older adults, and radiology societies often support continuation absent severe comorbidity, but even they acknowledge that severe comorbidity and limited life expectancy shift the balance toward harms. This cross-guideline pattern reinforces that prognosis is the decisive factor in this scenario [^111FYQwv] [^114L13HJ] [^1128s8yR] [^1163q51C] [^111BpqKv].

> I will now examine the quantitative benefit–harm trade-off to make this concrete. Modeling and observational data suggest that in women with adequate life expectancy, continued biennial screening in the 70s may avert about 2 breast cancer deaths per 1000 over 10 years, but at the cost of roughly 200 false positives and about 13 overdiagnosed cancers per 1000 screened. However, when life expectancy is under 10 years, the mortality benefit is essentially not realized, while the short-term harms persist. Given dementia and recent hospitalizations, this patient's mortality from competing causes is high, so the expected absolute benefit is near zero while the risks of callbacks, biopsies, and overtreatment remain nontrivial [^116FTBAX] [^115CDdsy].

> But wait, what if we consider patient preferences and prior screening habits. I need to check how these factors influence decisions. Many older adults report habit, reassurance, and physician recommendation as key drivers to screen, and some express a desire to continue screening irrespective of risk or prognosis. Decision aids can reduce screening intentions by improving understanding of benefits and harms, supporting more value-concordant choices. Shared decision-making should explicitly address these preferences while clarifying that screening is unlikely to extend life in the context of limited life expectancy, and that stopping screening does not mean abandoning care [^111u8evZ] [^114ELwwa] [^1139fHjb].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing a counterargument. The most predictive factor for whether to screen this 70-year-old woman with dementia is her estimated life expectancy and overall health status, not age or family history. Given dementia and recent hospitalizations, her life expectancy is likely under 10 years, so screening is unlikely to confer survival benefit and is more likely to cause harm through false positives, invasive procedures, and overdiagnosis. Therefore, the recommendation should be to stop routine screening mammography and pivot toward comfort-focused care, symptom surveillance, and caregiver support, documenting the rationale and the conversation with the patient or surrogate [^111FYQwv] [^1128s8yR] [^113qNgM7].

> Finally, I should outline practical steps and verify tools. I need to ensure we estimate life expectancy using validated instruments such as ePrognosis or similar geriatric indices, document comorbidities and functional status, and engage in shared decision-making that includes the patient or health care proxy. If pursued, a decision aid can facilitate understanding, though in this case it will likely reinforce that screening should stop. I should confirm that stopping screening does not preclude evaluation of new breast symptoms, which should always be promptly assessed, and that the care plan reflects goals of care in the context of dementia and limited prognosis [^116FTBAX] [^114ELwwa] [^1139fHjb].

---

The most predictive factor for breast cancer screening in a 70-year-old woman with dementia is **life expectancy** [^116FTBAX], not age or family history. Screening is appropriate only if she has a **≥ 10-year life expectancy** and good overall health [^111FYQwv]; otherwise, the harms of screening likely outweigh the benefits [^112VfMPy]. Family history increases risk but does not override the primacy of life expectancy in this context [^113b1pkX]. Use clinical judgment and shared decision-making to align screening with her prognosis and preferences [^1139fHjb].

---

## Evidence-based guidelines and recommendations

Several authoritative organizations provide **guidelines** for breast cancer screening in older women:

- **USPSTF (2024)**: Recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40–74 years [^112uZgBu]. For women aged ≥ 75 years, evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening; decisions should be individualized based on health status, comorbidities, and life expectancy [^1128s8yR].

- **ACS (2015)**: Recommends continuing screening mammography as long as the woman is in good health and has a life expectancy of ≥ 10 years [^111FYQwv].

- **ACOG (2017)**: Recommends continuing screening mammography until at least age 75 years, with decisions beyond age 75 based on shared decision-making considering health status and longevity [^1164hhhG].

---

## Life expectancy as the primary predictive factor

Life expectancy is the **most critical factor** in determining whether to continue screening in older women [^116FTBAX]. The rationale is that screening benefits typically manifest over a 10-year horizon; thus, women with limited life expectancy are unlikely to benefit from screening [^112VfMPy]. Evidence indicates that women aged 80 years in the top quartile of health have a median life expectancy of 13 years, whereas those in the bottom quartile have only 4.6 years [^115R8jDn]. This heterogeneity underscores the need to individualize decisions based on health status and prognosis [^113qNgM7].

---

## Impact of dementia on screening decisions

Dementia significantly affects life expectancy and **screening decisions**:

- **Life expectancy**: Dementia is associated with reduced life expectancy, with median survival ranging from 7–10 years depending on age and severity.

- **Benefit-harm balance**: Women with dementia may face increased harms from screening, including anxiety, false positives, and overtreatment, with limited benefit due to shortened life expectancy [^notfound].

- **Guideline recommendations**: Guidelines emphasize considering cognitive status and functional impairment when making screening decisions, often recommending cessation of routine screening in advanced dementia [^notfound].

---

## Role of family history in screening decisions

Family history of breast cancer, particularly first-degree relatives, increases breast cancer risk but **does not independently justify continued screening** in older women with limited life expectancy [^113b1pkX] [^111FYQwv]. Risk models (e.g. Gail, Tyrer-Cuzick) incorporate family history but also emphasize age and health status in determining screening appropriateness [^116qZLoe] [^111VgZPM].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Factor** | **Impact on screening decision** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Life expectancy | Primary determinant; continue screening if ≥ 10 years | High |
| Dementia | Reduces life expectancy; increases harms from screening | High |
| Family history | Increases risk but does not override life expectancy considerations | Moderate |

---

## Clinical recommendation

Given the patient's age, dementia, and recent hospitalizations, it is likely that her life expectancy is **limited**. Therefore, the most predictive factor for screening is her **life expectancy**, and routine screening mammography is not recommended if her life expectancy is **< 10 years** [^111FYQwv]. The decision should be individualized through shared decision-making, considering her health status, preferences, and the potential harms and benefits of screening [^1139fHjb].

---

## Conclusion

The most predictive factor for breast cancer screening in a 70-year-old woman with dementia is her **life expectancy** [^116FTBAX]. Screening should be continued only if she has a **≥ 10-year life expectancy** and good overall health [^111FYQwv]. Dementia and recent hospitalizations likely limit her life expectancy, making routine screening less beneficial and potentially harmful [^113qNgM7]. Family history increases risk but does not independently justify screening in this context [^113b1pkX].

Screening

The US Preventative Services Task Force guidelines do not recommend screening beyond the age of 74 years because of the scarcity of evidence from randomised controlled trials on the benefits of screening mammography in this older population. With the exception of the Swedish Two-County trial that invited women to screen every 33 months up to the age of 74 years, randomised controlled trials to date have not included women older than 70 years. However, there are compelling data on screening in older women from the American College of Radiology's National Mammography Database that show reductions in false positives and increases in both cancer detection rates and the positive predictive value of biopsies done at increased ages, even beyond the age of 90 years. Mammographically detected cancers in women aged 75 years or older were much more likely to be diagnosed at a lower stage in several studies: only 12% of those assessed were node-positive at diagnosis compared with 38% of those clinically detected in the series of Malmgren and colleagues, and 11% of older women with screen-detected cancers had axillary metastases, as reported by Destounis and colleagues.

There is an approximately 10-year delay in observing any benefit in breast cancer mortality from screening mammography. Instead of using 74 years of age as a screening termination target, national guidelines suggest stopping screening when the patient is no longer in good health (Society of Breast Imaging, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American Society of Breast Surgeons) or has a life expectancy of less than 10 years (American Cancer Society). Even the healthiest quartile of women older than 85 years has less than 10 years of life expectancy. An analysis of outcomes in women older than 65 years found that, even after correcting for prognostic index and potential confounders, breast cancer screening was associated with reduced all-cause mortality. This screening benefit was attenuated but persisted in women with reduced cognition. The authors of this analysis suggest that current algorithms might misclassify individuals as having a low life expectancy, resulting in cessation of screening that is inappropriately premature. Similar to these national guidelines, EUSOMA–SIOG recommend stopping screening after 75 years of age.

Taken together, a detailed geriatric and life expectancy assessment in conjunction with patient preferences should guide decision making for continued screening. Clinicians should make every effort to rely on validated measures to estimate remaining life expectancy (eg, ePrognosis) and the potential benefits of continued screening. Screening after the age of 74 years can be effectively stopped, as per multiple society guidelines including the recent EUSOMA–SIOG recommendations.

Numerous clinical studies have confirmed that screening women age 40 years and older reduces breast cancer mortality by 30% to 50%. Several factors including faster breast cancer growth rates and lower breast cancer incidence among younger women, as well as shorter life expectancy and more comorbid conditions among older women, should also be considered in screening guidelines. Annual screening beginning at age 40 years and continuing with no upper age limit, as long as a woman has a life expectancy of at least 5 years and no significant comorbid conditions, is currently recommended.

Recommendation 2 — screening continuation in older women states that women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). Breast cancer incidence continues to increase until ages 75 to 79 years, and 26% of breast cancer deaths each year are attributable to a diagnosis after age 74 years; none of the RCTs included women 75 years and older, although observational studies have observed a reduction in breast cancer mortality associated with mammographic detection among women aged 75 years and older. The guideline notes that the reduced life expectancy associated with being older decreases the likelihood of screening benefit in some women.

### Breast cancer screening: common questions and answers [^113AKxYP]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in women and accounts for 30% of all new cancers in the United States. The highest incidence of breast cancer is in women 70 to 74 years of age. Numerous risk factors are associated with the development of breast cancer. A risk assessment tool can be used to determine individual risk and help guide screening decisions. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend against teaching average-risk women to perform breast self-examinations. The USPSTF and AAFP recommend biennial screening mammography for average-risk women 50 to 74 years of age. However, there is no strong evidence supporting a net benefit of mammography screening in average-risk women 40 to 49 years of age; therefore, the USPSTF and AAFP recommend individualized decision-making in these women. For average-risk women 75 years and older, the USPSTF and AAFP conclude that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Cancer Society state that screening may continue depending on the woman's health status and life expectancy. Women at high risk of breast cancer may benefit from mammography starting at 30 years of age or earlier, with supplemental screening such as magnetic resonance imaging. Supplemental ultrasonography in women with dense breasts increases cancer detection but also false-positive results.

### Screening mammography in older women: a review [^116FTBAX]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend individualizing screening mammography decisions for women aged 75 years and older. However, little pragmatic guidance is available to help counsel patients.

Objective

To provide an evidence-based approach for individualizing decision-making about screening mammography in older women.

Evidence Acquisition

We searched PubMed for English-language studies in peer-reviewed journals published from January 1, 1990, to February 1, 2014, to identify risk factors for late-life breast cancer in women aged 65 years and older and to quantify the benefits and harms of screening mammography for women aged 75 years and older.

Findings

Age is the major risk factor for developing and dying from breast cancer. Breast cancer risk factors that reflect hormonal exposures in the distant past, such as age at first birth or age at menarche, are less predictive of late-life breast cancer than factors indicating recent hormonal exposures such as high bone mass or obesity. Randomized trials of the benefits of screening mammography did not include women older than 74 years. Thus it is not known if screening mammography benefits older women. Observational studies favor extending screening mammography to older women who have a life expectancy of more than 10 years. Modeling studies estimate 2 fewer breast cancer deaths/1000 women who in their 70s continue biennial screening for 10 years instead of stopping screening at age 69. Potential harms of continued screening over 10 years include false-positive mammograms in approximately 200/1000 women screened and overdiagnosis (ie, finding breast cancer that would not have clinically surfaced otherwise) in approximately 13/1000 women screened. Providing information about life expectancy along with potential benefits and harms of screening may help older women's decision-making about screening mammography.

Conclusions and Relevance

For women with less than a 10-year life expectancy, recommendations to stop screening mammography should emphasize increased potential harms from screening and highlight health promotion measures likely to be beneficial over the short term. For women with a life expectancy of more than 10 years, deciding whether potential benefits of screening outweigh harms becomes a value judgment for patients, requiring a realistic understanding of screening outcomes.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^116ZTVC4]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) average-risk screening — older age, health, and life expectancy: Health and life expectancy, not simply age, must be considered in screening decisions, and a significant proportion of women 75 years and older are in good health and can be expected to live considerably longer than 10 or more years. Based on 2010 US Life Tables, approximately 50% of 80-year-old women and 25% of 85-year-old women will live at least 10 years, and an older woman's life expectancy exceeding 10 years is generally defined as having greater than a 50% probability of surviving 10 years. For women who are healthy and have at least a 10-year life expectancy, individualized decisions about screening mammography should be considered, and the GDG recommends that women should continue screening as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer.

### Decision-making regarding mammography screening for older women [^115CDdsy]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

The population is aging, and breast cancer incidence increases with age, peaking between the ages of 75 and 79. However, it is not known whether mammography screening helps women aged 75 and older live longer because they have not been included in randomized controlled trials evaluating mammography screening. Guidelines recommend that older women with less than a 10-year life expectancy not be screened because it takes approximately 10 years before a screen-detected breast cancer may affect an older woman's survival. Guidelines recommend that clinicians discuss the benefits and risks of screening with women aged 75 and older with a life expectancy of 10 years or longer to help them elicit their values and preferences. It is estimated that two of 1,000 women who continue to be screened every other year from age 70 to 79 may avoid breast cancer death, but 12% to 27% of these women will experience a false-positive test, and 10% to 20% of women who experience a false-positive test will undergo a breast biopsy. In addition, approximately 30% of screen-detected cancers would not otherwise have shown up in an older woman's lifetime, yet nearly all older women undergo treatment for these breast cancers, and the risks of treatment increase with age. To inform decision-making, tools are available to estimate life expectancy and to educate older women about the benefits and harms of mammography screening. Guides are also available to help clinicians discuss stopping screening with older women with less than a 10-year life expectancy. Ideally, screening decisions would consider an older woman's life expectancy, breast cancer risk, and her values and preferences.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1139oJYS]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Age to start or stop screening — The USPSTF did not identify any randomized clinical trials designed to test the comparative effectiveness of different ages to start or stop screening that reported morbidity, mortality, or quality-of-life outcomes. An emulation study reported that continued screening between the ages of 70 and 79 years was associated with a 22% decrease in the risk of breast cancer mortality compared with cessation at age 70 years, although the trial emulation study found no difference in the hazard ratio or absolute rates of breast cancer mortality with continued screening vs discontinued screening from ages 70 to 79 years across 80 to 84 years.

### Reducing barriers and strategies to improve appropriate screening mammogram attendance in women 75 years and older [^112AcRjQ]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Although breast cancer death rates have persistently declined over the last 3 decades, older women have not experienced the same degree in mortality reduction as younger women despite having more favorable breast cancer phenotypes. This occurrence can be partially attributed to less robust mammographic screening in older women, the propensity to undertreat with advancing age, and the presence of underlying comorbidities. With recent revisions to breast cancer screening guidelines, there has been a constructive shift toward more agreement in the need for routine mammographic screening to commence at age 40. Unfortunately, this shift in agreement has not occurred for cutoff guidelines, wherein the recommendations are blurred and open to interpretation. With increasing life expectancy and an aging population who is healthier now than any other time in history, it is important to revisit mammographic screening with advanced age and understand why older women who should undergo screening are not being screened as well as offer suggestions on how to improve screening mammogram attendance in this population.

### Screening for breast cancer in women age 75 years and older [^112agMe5]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Older women undergoing regular mammography experience significant reductions in breast cancer mortality, except in women with severe comorbidities or limited life expectancy. Optimizing screening strategies requires informed discussions of benefits and risks given each woman's health status.

Conclusion

This article will review the benefits and risks of screening mammography in women older than 75 years within the context of life expectancy and comorbidities and summarize the current recommendations from professional organizations for screening mammography in older women.

### Factors influencing elderly women's mammography screening decisions: implications for counseling [^115R8jDn]. BMC Geriatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There is great heterogeneity in health among older women leading to substantial differences in life expectancy. For instance, women aged 80–84 in the top quartile of health have 13 years of life expectancy while women aged 80–84 in the lowest quartile of health have only 4.6 years of life expectancy. Meanwhile, experts generally agree that a woman needs 5 to even 10 years of life expectancy to potentially benefit from mammography screening. Benefits of mammography screening among older women include possibly prolonging life or preventing morbidity associated with advanced breast cancer. However, potential risks include complications and anxiety related to finding and treating breast cancers that would never have become clinically significant in an older woman's lifespan. Therefore, guidelines recommend that clinicians consider older women's life expectancy and comorbidities before recommending mammography screening. Increasingly more women aged 80 and older are undergoing mammography screening and evidence suggests it is not being targeted to the oldest women in the best health and most likely to benefit.

To better understand elderly women's mammography screening decisions, we interviewed women aged 80 and older and physicians who cared for these women using qualitative methods. In that study, we developed a conceptual framework of the factors that influence mammography screening decisions of women aged 80 and older, including: 1) Patient factors (e.g. risk perception, habit, history of breast disease, etc.); 2) System factors (e.g. access, mailed reminders); 3) Social Influences (e.g. daughter's encouragement, family/friends' experience with breast cancer); and 4) Physician influences. We also found that physicians feel uncomfortable discussing stopping screening with women aged 80 and older. Since qualitative data cannot be used to determine the prevalence of attitudes or beliefs in a population and since qualitative methods do not allow for statistical comparisons between groups, we designed a telelphone survey to determine which factors identified in our qualitative study were most important to older women's mammography screening decisions. We were most interested in factors that influence elderly women to choose screening since these factors may need to be addressed before elderly women can feel comfortable stopping screening. We compared responses for women aged 80 and older with women aged 65–79 to see if certain factors need to be specifically addressed among the oldest women. In addition, we examined whether older women preferred that their physician make the decision whether or not they should get sreened or whether they preferred to make the decision on their own or share the decision with their physician.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117ENUM6]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Response to public comment — The USPSTF notes that no trials of breast cancer screening enrolled women 75 years or older and an emulated trial showed no benefit to screening women aged 75 to 79 or 80 to 84. The USPSTF found no evidence on the benefits or harms of individualized breast cancer screening based on risk factors. Regarding screening interval, it did not identify any randomized trials directly comparing annual vs biennial screening, and two trials conducted in the 1980s to 1990s reported no difference in breast cancer mortality or features when comparing annual vs triennial screening; modeling found that biennial screening results in greater life-years gained and mortality reduction per mammogram and has a more favorable balance of benefits to harms compared with annual screening. For dense breasts, the USPSTF clarified that the I statement is not a recommendation for or against supplemental screening in women with dense breasts and that it fundamentally means there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms, or to recommend for or against supplemental screening. The USPSTF clarified that this recommendation applies to women with a family history of breast cancer but not those who have a genetic marker or syndrome or chest radiation exposure at a young age associated with a high risk of breast cancer, and stated that current evidence shows that screening for breast cancer starting at age 40 years will be of significant benefit to Black women.

### Is It the era for personalized screening? [^114FMb7q]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer screening is a recognized tool for early detection of the disease in asymptomatic women, improving treatment efficacy and reducing the mortality rate. There is raised awareness that a "one-size-fits-all" approach cannot be applied for breast cancer screening. Currently, despite specific guidelines for a minority of women who are at very high risk of breast cancer, all other women are still treated alike. This article reviews the current recommendations for breast cancer risk assessment and breast cancer screening in average-risk and higher-than-average-risk women. Also discussed are new developments and future perspectives for personalized breast cancer screening.

Data Collection

Our survey first asked women whether or not they had received a screening mammogram in the past two years. We then asked women who had undergone mammography screening in the past two years how important each of the following factors (identified in our qualitative study) were in their screening decision, including: history of breast disease (if applicable), family history of breast cancer (if applicable), a doctor's recommendation, habit (meaning that the woman always got a mammogram every year or so), reassurance (meaning that a normal mammogram would reassure a woman about her health), a mailed reminder card, a family member's recommendation, a friend's recommendation, a friend's experience with breast cancer, age, health, and the media. We asked women who had not undergone mammography screening in the past two years how important their previous experience with mammography, doctor's counseling, habit, health, and the media were in their decision not to get a mammogram. Women rated the influence of each factor on their mammography screening decision on a 4-point scale (essential, very important, somewhat important or not at all important to their decision). After evaluating each measure individually, we then asked women to rank from 1 to 3, in order of importance, the factors that most influenced their decision to get a mammogram or not to get a mammogram. We also asked women who did not undergo mammography screening recently how strongly they agreed with the statement "I am not concerned about breast cancer" on a 5-point Likert scale. Women could rank lack of concern about breast cancer as one of their reasons for choosing not to be screened.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1164hhhG]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of other organizations for breast cancer screening — The American Cancer Society "recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years" and "suggests that women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually", that those "55 years or older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually", may "begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years", and should continue "as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer". The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists "recommends that women at average risk of breast cancer should be offered screening mammography starting at age 40 years", and if not initiated in their 40s, "by no later than age 50 years", with screening "every 1 or 2 years" and continued "until at least age 75 years", with decisions "Beyond age 75 years" based on shared decision-making. The American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging "recommend annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 years for women at average risk", advise continuing "past age 74 years, without an upper age limit, unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy", and the American College of Radiology "also recommends breast cancer risk assessment by age 25 years for all individuals". The American Academy of Family Physicians "supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for breast cancer".

### Mammographic screening in older women: when is It time to stop? [^116bMxHF]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Mammographic screening guidelines in women aged 75 and older are inconsistent due to a lack of data from prospective randomized controlled trials, such as those that exist for women between 40–74 years of age. In addition, older women are perceived as less likely to benefit from early detection due to increased comorbidities and a greater proportion of biologically favorable cancers. With increasing life expectancy and quality of life in the elderly, the question of when to stop mammographic screening merits renewed discussion. Observational data support a survival benefit from regular screening in older women with no severe comorbidities. In addition, screening mammography in this age group has been shown to perform better than in younger age groups, tipping the balance toward greater benefits than harms. Early studies of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in older women suggest that performance metrics are further improved with DBT screening. While a biennial schedule in older women preserves some of the benefit of screening, annual mammography achieves the greatest reductions in breast cancer mortality and morbidity. As the medical community strives to offer personalized care for all age groups, health care providers are well positioned to offer shared decision-making based on existing data and tailored to each woman's individual risk profile, comorbid conditions, and personal values.

### Breast cancer screening in older women: the importance of shared decision making [^1139fHjb]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Incidence of breast cancer increases with age up until age 80. Screening mammography has demonstrated efficacy in decreasing mortality from breast cancer among women between 50 and 74 years of age. However, most major organizations do not include women over 74 in their recommendations due to the lack of evidence in this age-group. This article will review current recommendations for breast cancer screening in women over the age of 74. It will also present clear guidelines for primary care clinicians to follow that incorporate shared decision-making techniques, tools for estimating the risks and benefits of screening mammography, and strategies for integrating a patient's life expectancy and comorbidities into the decision-making process. We also emphasize the importance of using thoughtful communication strategies to fully engage older women in the breast cancer screening discussion.

### Development and evaluation of a decision aid on mammography screening for women 75 years and older [^112Ye94t]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend that women 75 years and older should be informed of the benefits and risks of mammography before being screened. However, few are adequately informed.

Objectives

To develop and evaluate a mammography screening decision aid (DA) for women 75 years and older.

Design

We designed the DA using international standards. Between July 14, 2010, and April 10, 2012, participants completed a pretest survey and read the DA before an appointment with their primary care physician. They completed a posttest survey after their appointment. Medical records were reviewed for follow-up information.

Setting and Participants

Boston, Massachusetts, academic primary care practice. Eligible women were aged 75 to 89 years, English speaking, had not had a mammogram in 9 months but had been screened within the past 3 years, and did not have a history of dementia or invasive or noninvasive breast cancer. Of 84 women approached, 27 declined to participate, 12 were unable to complete the study for logistical reasons, and 45 participated.

Interventions

The DA includes information on breast cancer risk, life expectancy, competing mortality risks, possible outcomes of screening, and a values clarification exercise.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Knowledge of the benefits and risks of screening, decisional conflict, and screening intentions; documentation in the medical record of a discussion of the risks and benefits of mammography with a primary care physician within 6 months; and the receipt of screening within 15 months. We used the Wilcoxon signed rank test and McNemar test to compare pretest-posttest information.

Results

The median age of participants was 79 years, 69% (31 of 45) were of non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, and 60% (27 of 45) had attended at least some college. Comparison of posttest results with pretest results demonstrated 2 findings. First, knowledge of the benefits and risks of screening improved (P < .001). Second, fewer participants intended to be screened (56% [25 of 45] afterward compared with 82% [37 of 45] before, P = 0.03). Decisional conflict declined but not significantly (P = 0.10). In the following 6 months, 53% (24 of 45) of participants had a primary care physician note that documented the discussion of the risks and benefits of screening compared with 11% (5 of 45) in the previous 5 years (P < .001). While 84% (36 of 43) had been screened within 2 years of participating, 60% (26 of 43) were screened within 15 months after participating (≥ 2 years since their last mammogram) (P = 0.01). Overall, 93% (42 of 45) found the DA helpful.

Conclusions and Relevance

A DA may improve older women's decision making about mammography screening.

### The treatment of early breast cancer in women over the age of 70 [^111cod8Z]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The data discussed in this review and the information emerging from ongoing clinical trials provide a framework for the management of breast cancer in older women. In essence, older patients should be treated according to tumour biology as for younger patients, except where co-morbidities or frailty are likely to mitigate the benefits of treatment or mean that treatment will not be tolerated. However, there are some fundamental questions regarding everyday management, which remain unanswered (Table 2). Perhaps, the biggest challenge is to apply the available evidence in the clinic to the individual older patient. Patients over the age of 70 represent a highly heterogeneous population in terms of co-morbidities, fitness, life expectancy, social situation, cognitive function and desire for treatment. Assessment of these factors taking into account the risks of death from competing causes of mortality and the likely tolerance of any proposed treatment is a vital component to making appropriate informed decisions regarding adjuvant treatment. Assessment tools to do this have been developed, but most require validation in patients with cancer. It is imperative that we do this in order that we can best serve the ageing population of women with breast cancer.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^112SjnVL]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society breast cancer screening guideline (2015) for average-risk women — Women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years (Strong Recommendation). Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (Qualified Recommendation), and women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (Qualified Recommendation), and should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). The target population is women at average risk — women without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age.

### Should women under 50 be screened for breast cancer? [^1175eRpz]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Despite some controversy in recent years, the majority of experts agree on the evidence for effectiveness of breast screening by mammography for women aged 50 years and above, but for those under 50 years, the picture is much less clear. However, the issue remains of importance both to policy makers and to individual women; although the incidence of breast cancer is lower at younger ages, the life years lost due to cancers diagnosed below 50 years amount to a third of all those lost due to the disease.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^113GNvjf]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2015 breast cancer screening — women at average risk: The ACS endorses beginning annual screening mammography at age 45 years and transitioning to biennial screening at age 55 years, while retaining the option to continue annual screening. The guideline development committee (GDC) recommends that women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually, that women aged 40 to 44 years who choose to be screened should do so annually, and that women aged 55 and older should transition to biennial screening but also have the opportunity to continue screening annually. The GDC concluded that women aged 40 to 44 years should have the choice to begin screening mammography at age 40 years or before age 45 years, based on their preferences and their consideration of the trade-offs.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^114wf3dd]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2015 breast cancer screening for women at average risk — key age bands and modalities are: Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (Qualified Recommendation). Women should undergo regular screening mammography beginning at age 45 years (Strong Recommendation), and women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). Clinical breast examination is not recommended for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). All women should become familiar with the potential benefits, limitations, and harms associated with breast cancer screening. Average-risk women were defined as those without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age. In contrast, ACS, 2003 guidance stated: Begin annual mammography screening at age 40 years; For women in their 20s and 30s, it is recommended that clinical breast examination be part of a periodic health examination, preferably at least every 3 years; Asymptomatic women aged 40 years and older should continue to receive a clinical breast examination as part of a periodic health examination, preferably annually.

### Benefits and harms of screening mammography by comorbidity and age: a qualitative synthesis of observational studies and decision analyses [^1137BvoC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

We conducted a systematic review to assess the quality and limitations of published studies examining benefits and harms of screening mammography in relation to comorbidity and age.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from January 1980 through June 2013 for studies that examined benefits or harms of screening mammography in women aged 65 years or older in relation to comorbidity. For each study, we extracted data regarding setting, design, quality, screening schedule, measure of comorbidity, and estimates of benefits and/or harms. We reviewed 1760 titles, identifying 7 articles that met the inclusion criteria: prospective cohort (two studies), retrospective cohort (two studies), and decision analyses (three studies). No randomized controlled trials were identified.

Results

At least one measure of life expectancy or reduction in the risk of breast cancer death as a marker of benefit was examined in four studies, whereas three studies addressed the harms of screening mammography, including false-positive results. Both cohort studies and decision analyses showed that screening benefits decreased with increasing age and comorbidity burden.

Conclusions

The limited evidence currently available suggests that, apart from older women with severe comorbidity, women 65 and older may experience improvements in life expectancy from screening. Given the potential for harm, it is unclear whether the magnitude of the benefit is sufficient to warrant regular screening. Women, clinicians and policymakers should consider these factors in deciding whether continue screening.

Cancer screening in the oldest old — use shared decision-making and prognostic tools given low likelihood of benefit and observed utilization. In a cohort of "2,011 women aged 80 and older", "51% underwent mammography" yet "fewer than 2%" potentially benefited; "12.5% experienced a harm", and "nearly 10% of those screened died within 2 years". Guidance states, "These data should be used to help women aged 80 and older understand the risks and benefits of screening mammography so that they can make informed, preference-based decisions", and for frail women "with life expectancies of less than 5 years" screening is "unlikely to result in a survival benefit". Additional utilization data show that "45% of men with limited life expectancy (aged ≥ 85 with Charlson comorbidity scores ≥ 1 or aged ≥ 70 with Charlson scores ≥ 4) received PSA screening".

### Breast cancer screening update [^113JmAx3]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in North American women. Mammography is the only screening test shown to reduce breast cancer-related mortality. There is general agreement that screening should be offered at least biennially to women 50 to 74 years of age. For women 40 to 49 years of age, the risks and benefits of screening should be discussed, and the decision to perform screening should take into consideration the individual patient risk, values, and comfort level of the patient and physician. Information is lacking about the effectiveness of screening in women 75 years and older. The decision to screen women in this age group should be individualized, keeping the patient's life expectancy, functional status, and goals of care in mind. For women with an estimated lifetime breast cancer risk of more than 20 percent or who have a BRCA mutation, screening should begin at 25 years of age or at the age that is five to 10 years younger than the earliest age that breast cancer was diagnosed in the family. Screening with magnetic resonance imaging may be considered in high-risk women, but its impact on breast cancer mortality is uncertain. Clinical breast examination plus mammography seems to be no more effective than mammography alone at reducing breast cancer mortality. Teaching breast self-examination does not improve mortality and is not recommended; however, women should be aware of any changes in their breasts and report them promptly.

### Randomized trial of information for older women about cessation of breast cancer screening invitations [^1112Vxxb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

There is uncertain benefit of screening mammography for older women, as women aged ≥ 74 years have not been included in randomized controlled trials. At a population level, potential harms become more likely with increasing age, including false positives and anxiety due to additional tests following detection of an abnormality, as well as overdiagnosis (diagnosis of a cancer that would never have caused problems) and overtreatment. In one Australian modeling study, if screening were extended to 1000 women aged 70–74 years (compared to inviting women up to 69 years), one additional breast cancer death would be averted, eight breast cancers would be overdiagnosed, and 102 additional tests would include 78 additional false positives. However, a US modeling study indicated that continued screening to 78 or 80 years for women with no comorbidity could have similar benefit-harm ratios as screening women aged 50–74 years at average risk.

United States (US) guidelines recommend individualized breast screening decisions beyond 74 years based on overall health, life expectancy, and personal preference. – Screening is not recommended for individual women with limited life expectancy (< 10 years) due to the 10-year lag-time to benefitand greater chance of harm. However, over 50% of women aged ≥ 74 years report recent screening in US national survey data, and around 38% of women with limited life expectancy continue breast screening. In Australia, the nationally funded screening program (BreastScreen) invites women to participate in mammography screening for breast cancer up to 74 years of age through local health districts. Women aged ≥ 74 years can continue free screening and are encouraged to speak with their primary care clinician (general practitioner [GP]) if they wish. Screening rates by life expectancy are unknown in Australia. However, since BreastScreen extended invitations to women aged 70–74 years in 2013, annual participation rates in this age group increased from 25.9 to 55.8%, and data suggests 7.6–10% of women continue to be screened beyond 74 years. One reason for this may be the high trust people living in Australia have in the healthcare system.

### Health benefits and harms of mammography screening in older women (75 + years)-a systematic review [^114KBKov]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Globally, there is no consensus or uniform policy on whether mammography screening should be ceased or even discouraged in older women (and if so what upper age limit should be set). Importantly, there is little evidence on the balance between potential benefits and harms in older women (specifically 75+) in whom competing causes of death and co-morbidities could render routine screening relatively harmful, and a shorter life expectancy could reduce the likelihood of experiencing benefit from screening. To support population-level, as well as individual, decisions about the age or age-range to stop (or recommend against) screening, we conducted a systematic review of the evidence on the outcomes of mammography screening in older women.

The aim of this study was to systematically review and synthesise the evidence on the outcomes of mammography screening in women aged 75 years and older, to guide screening recommendations.

### Patient-reported factors associated with older adults' cancer screening decision-making: a systematic review [^111u8evZ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Decisions for older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) and their clinicians about whether to continue to screen for cancer are not easy. Many older adults who are frail or have limited life expectancy or comorbidities continue to be screened for cancer despite guidelines suggesting they should not; furthermore, many older adults have limited knowledge of the potential harms of continuing to be screened.

Objective

To summarize the patient-reported factors associated with older adults' decisions regarding screening for breast, prostate, colorectal, and cervical cancer.

Evidence Review

Studies were identified by searching databases from January 2000 to June 2020 and were independently assessed for inclusion by 2 authors. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were independently conducted by 2 authors, and then all decisions were cross-checked and discussed where necessary. Data analysis was performed from September to December 2020.

Findings

The search yielded 2475 records, of which 21 unique studies were included. Nine studies were quantitative, 8 were qualitative, and 4 used mixed method designs. Of the 21 studies, 17 were conducted in the US, and 10 of 21 assessed breast cancer screening decisions only. Factors associated with decision-making were synthesized into 5 categories: demographic, health and clinical, psychological, physician, and social and system. Commonly identified factors associated with the decision to undergo screening included personal or family history of cancer, positive screening attitudes, routine or habit, to gain knowledge, friends, and a physician's recommendation. Factors associated with the decision to forgo screening included being older, negative screening attitudes, and desire not to know about cancer. Some factors had varying associations, including insurance coverage, living in a nursing home, prior screening experience, health problems, limited life expectancy, perceived cancer risk, risks of screening, family, and a physician's recommendation to stop.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although guidelines suggest incorporating life expectancy and health status to inform older adults' cancer screening decisions, older adults' ingrained beliefs about screening may run counter to these concepts. Communication strategies are needed that support older adults to make informed cancer screening decisions by addressing underlying screening beliefs in context with their perceived and actual risk of developing cancer.

### Patient-reported factors associated with older adults' cancer screening decision-making: a systematic review [^115Y6ax6]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Health and Clinical Factors

The association of overall health status with screening decisions varied across studies. Qualitative studies, suggested that older adults may consider their overall health status or health problems in their cancer screening decision-making. However, quantitative evidence, suggested that this was not the majority view, and 3 other studies, found that health status was not associated with cervical or breast screening decisions. More specific problems considered as reason to forgo screening included memory problems, "dying from something else", or not being functionally able to undergo screening. Qualitative studies, suggested screening was instead seen as a way to evaluate or validate health status or avoid major surgery or longer hospitalization as a result of early detection. Individual studies found that no physical disability (compared with severe disability), not having depression or anxiety, and greater quality of life increased the likelihood of choosing screening.

The association of life expectancy with screening decisions was also inconsistent across studies. In a discrete choice experiment, participants were more likely to choose screening for a hypothetical patient with 5 or 10 years life expectancy than a patient with 1 year life expectancy (but 57.2% still chose screening for the latter), and a qualitative studyfound that some individuals may consider limited life expectancy as a reason to stop screening. However, 6 qualitative studies, highlighted older adults' resistance to using life expectancy to dictate or communicate about screening decisions. Instead, some thought that screening was a means of increasing life expectancy.

Personal or family history of cancer consistently was associated with the decision to undergo screening in 5 studies. However, another studyfound that the majority of women thought they should continue breast screening even if they did not have any risk factors. Prior screening experience was associated with continued screening, but this was also reason to forgo breast screening. Screening to target treatment appropriately was expressed in 1 qualitative study (with moderate to high risk of bias), and women were also hesitant to stop breast screening even if they did not plan to undergo treatment. Women who had not had a hysterectomy were more likely to undergo cervical screening, and the number of visits to clinicians and exercise were not associated with breast cancer screening decisions.

### Informed decision making: age of 50 is arbitrary and has no demonstrated influence on breast cancer screening in women [^116Ne5ay]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The article discusses the fact that for more than 20 years, there has been controversy concerning whether there is a benefit from mammographic screening for women ages 40–49. Based on a decision made many years ago to try to determine how menopause might influence the value of screening, the age of 50 was chosen as a surrogate for menopause. Despite the fact that there are no data to support this age as having any biologic relevance, it continues to be used as if the parameters and benefits of screening change abruptly at the age of 50. CONCLUSION. The data clearly show that the age of 50 is nothing more than an arbitrary age, and it is far from clear whether menopause has any important effect on screening. The "harms" of screening have been cited as reasons for not recommending screening before the age of 50, but since the ratio of harm to benefit changes steadily with increasing age, there is no legitimate rationale for this determination. Women and their physicians should be informed that the age of 50 is an arbitrary threshold in terms of mammography screening so that they can make informed decisions about their own health care.

### Breast cancer screening recommendations inclusive of all women at average risk: update from the ACR and society of breast imaging [^111BpqKv]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer remains the most common nonskin cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths, and the leading cause of premature death in US women. Mammography screening has been proven effective in reducing breast cancer deaths in women age 40 years and older. A mortality reduction of 40% is possible with regular screening. Treatment advances cannot overcome the disadvantage of being diagnosed with an advanced-stage tumor. The ACR and Society of Breast Imaging recommend annual mammography screening beginning at age 40, which provides the greatest mortality reduction, diagnosis at earlier stage, better surgical options, and more effective chemotherapy. Annual screening results in more screening-detected tumors, tumors of smaller sizes, and fewer interval cancers than longer screening intervals. Screened women in their 40s are more likely to have early-stage disease, negative lymph nodes, and smaller tumors than unscreened women. Delaying screening until age 45 or 50 will result in an unnecessary loss of life to breast cancer and adversely affects minority women in particular. Screening should continue past age 74 years, without an upper age limit unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy. Benefits of screening should be considered along with the possibilities of recall for additional imaging and benign biopsy and the less tangible risks of anxiety and overdiagnosis. Although recall and biopsy recommendations are higher with more frequent screening, so are life-years gained and breast cancer deaths averted. Women who wish to maximize benefit will choose annual screening starting at age 40 years and will not stop screening prematurely.

### Effect of a mammography screening decision aid for women 75 years and older: a cluster randomized clinical trial [^114ELwwa]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend that women 75 years and older be informed of the benefits and harms of mammography before screening.

Objective

To test the effects of receipt of a paper-based mammography screening decision aid (DA) for women 75 years and older on their screening decisions.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A cluster randomized clinical trial with clinician as the unit of randomization. All analyses were completed on an intent-to-treat basis. The setting was 11 primary care practices in Massachusetts or North Carolina. Of 1247 eligible women reached, 546 aged 75 to 89 years without breast cancer or dementia who had a mammogram within 24 months but not within 6 months and saw 1 of 137 clinicians (herein referred to as PCPs) from November 3, 2014, to January 26, 2017, participated. A research assistant (RA) administered a previsit questionnaire on each participant's health, breast cancer risk factors, sociodemographic characteristics, and screening intentions. After the visit, the RA administered a postvisit questionnaire on screening intentions and knowledge.

Interventions

Receipt of the DA (DA arm) or a home safety (HS) pamphlet (control arm) before a PCP visit.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Participants were followed up for 18 months for receipt of mammography screening (primary outcome). To examine the effects of the DA, marginal logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations to allow for clustering by PCP. Adjusted probabilities and risk differences were estimated to account for clustering by PCP.

Results

Of 546 women in the study, 283 (51.8%) received the DA. Patients in each arm were well matched; their mean (SD) age was 79.8 (3.7) years, 428 (78.4%) were non-Hispanic white, 321 (of 543 [59.1%]) had completed college, and 192 (35.2%) had less than a 10-year life expectancy. After 18 months, 9.1% (95% CI, 1.2%-16.9%) fewer women in the DA arm than in the control arm had undergone mammography screening (51.3% vs 60.4%; adjusted risk ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.95; p = 0.006). Women in the DA arm were more likely than those in the control arm to rate their screening intentions lower from previsit to postvisit (69 of 283 [adjusted %, 24.5%] vs 47 of 263 [adjusted %, 15.3%]), to be more knowledgeable about the benefits and harms of screening (86 [adjusted %, 25.5%] vs 32 [adjusted %, 11.7%]), and to have a documented discussion about mammography with their PCP (146 [adjusted %, 47.4%] vs 111 [adjusted %, 38.9%]). Almost all women in the DA arm (94.9%) would recommend the DA.

Conclusions and Relevance

Providing women 75 years and older with a mammography screening DA before a PCP visit helps them make more informed screening decisions and leads to fewer women choosing to be screened, suggesting that the DA may help reduce overscreening.

Mammography

The most common method of screening women for breast cancer is mammography, either offered by an organized program or in the form of opportunistic screening. In most European countries, mammographic screening programs include all women, with age being the only determinant: screening is offered starting at the age of 40–50 years until the age of 64–74 years or even illimitable if women are in good health (e.g. in Austria) at intervals of 1–2 years (3 years in the UK). Population-based effectiveness of mammography screening programs depend on high participation levels, and the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis recommend that at least 70–75% of a population participates in regular mammography screening. Despite the overall survival advantages achieved with the use of mammographic screening, this "one-size-fits-all" approach is associated with several drawbacks, not least that mammography alone is not sufficient to achieve early diagnosis in the high-risk population. It has been reported that program sensitivities of 86–89% in women with largely fatty breasts drop to 62–68% in the case of women with dense breasts (Fig. 1–3). Considering that about 40–50% of women have dense breasts (heterogeneously and extremely dense breast), this represents a non-negligible issue. Breast density category after performing mammography screening should always be reported since this has important implications for the performance of supplemental and/or alternative imaging methods.

Breast density categories according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) from the American College of Radiology. Depending on the breast composition, four different categories are identified: a entirely fatty; b scattered areas of fibroglandular density; c heterogeneously dense, which may obscure masses; and (d) extremely dense

Ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed, and the lesion histologically corresponded to a NST moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma

### Should older adults be screened for dementia? [^116PReHf]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2006). Low credibility.

The question of whether to screen for dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been discussed in many forums throughout the world. Generally, medical advisory groups and policy-making groups have recognized the importance of early diagnosis but have uniformly avoided making recommendations to screen at-risk populations. This presentation reflects the support for reconsidering the importance of screening individuals at risk or above a certain age. In this statement, the majority of the authors support the consideration of dementia risk factors in individuals at age 50, with routine yearly screening after 75. Other authors remain concerned that the benefits of treatments of early disease do not yet support a general screening recommendation. These statements are made to encourage progress toward the development of a consensus regarding the widespread institution of screening policy. Accordingly, members of the worldwide scientific community are invited to add their perspective by contributing short commentaries (1500 words) on this subject.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^1112qd1c]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) evidence synthesis for average-risk women reports that screening mammography in women aged 40 to 69 years is associated with a reduction in breast cancer deaths across a range of study designs. Estimates of the cumulative lifetime risk of false-positive examination results are greater if screening begins at younger ages because of the greater number of mammograms, as well as the higher recall rate in younger women. The quality of the evidence for overdiagnosis is not sufficient to estimate a lifetime risk with confidence. Analysis examining the screening interval demonstrates more favorable tumor characteristics when premenopausal women are screened annually vs biennially. Evidence does not support routine clinical breast examination as a screening method for women at average risk.

### Novel drug candidates targeting Alzheimer's disease: ethical challenges with identifying the relevant patient population [^116sLSWc]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

Different kinds of screening: ethical aspects

Population screening for AD

If an effective drug that targets the preclinical phase receives market approval, the question of population screening may be actualised. One way to identify the relevant population is to screen for AD in the same way as screening is available for, as in several OECD countries (the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), breast cancer (mammography): that everyone at a certain age is contacted with an offer of testing and possible follow-up.

To implement such a population screening programme for AD, several decisions need to be made. First, the age for screening must be determined (of course, screening can be performed repeatedly, with more ages having to be determined). Second, the method of risk stratification (the test method) for AD must be determined. Third, follow-up for those who are deemed relevant for further investigation and treatment must be determined. Fourth, an organisation and infrastructure to implement and follow-up on all this must be formed. All these steps are of course connected: what, for example, is a suitable age relates to when the condition in question can be reliably identified and when the treatment gives the best effect.

Starting with the age decision, there is a built-in conflict here between, on the one hand, initiating treatment as early as possible (so that the presumed benefits of early treatment are as large as possible) and, on the other hand, avoiding false results with the problems it entails (the earlier the risk stratification, the more uncertainty).

For example, consider the difference between population screening for AD at age 65 and age 85. At age 65, only a minority of those ultimately diagnosed with AD have been diagnosed. This is an advantage to the extent that early detection is an advantage for treatment. However, this advantage is not greater than the extra benefit that early screening-induced diagnosis entails. The relevant comparison is therefore not between treating AD and not treating AD, but between treatment of AD as a result of the screening and the treatment that would still have been carried out without the screening.

### Factors influencing elderly women's mammography screening decisions: implications for counseling [^112wVzAq]. BMC Geriatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although guidelines recommend that clinicians consider life expectancy before screening older women for breast cancer, many older women with limited life expectancies are screened. We aimed to identify factors important to mammography screening decisions among women aged 80 and older compared to women aged 65–79.

Methods

Telephone surveys of 107 women aged 80+ and 93 women aged 65–79 randomly selected from one academic primary care practice who were able to communicate in English (60% response rate). The survey addressed the following factors in regards to older women's mammography screening decisions: perceived importance of a history of breast disease, family history of breast cancer, doctor's recommendations, habit, reassurance, previous experience, mailed reminder cards, family/friend's recommendations or experience with breast cancer, age, health, and media. The survey also assessed older women's preferred role in decision making around mammography screening.

Results

Of the 200 women, 65.5% were non-Hispanic white and 82.8% were in good to excellent health. Most (81.3%) had undergone mammography in the past 2 years. Regardless of age, older women ranked doctor's recommendations as the most important factor influencing their decision to get screened. Habit and reassurance were the next two highly ranked factors influencing older women to get screened. Among women who did not get screened, women aged 80 and older ranked age and doctor's counseling as the most influential factors and women aged 65–79 ranked a previous negative experience with mammography as the most important factor. There were no significant differences in preferred role in decision-making around mammography screening by age, however, most women in both age groups preferred to make the final decision on their own (46.6% of women aged 80+ and 50.5% of women aged 65–79).

Conclusion

While a doctor's recommendation is the most important factor influencing elderly women's mammography screening decisions, habit and reassurance also strongly influence decision-making. Interventions aimed at improving clinician counseling about mammography, which include discussions around habit and reassurance, may result in better decision-making.

### Discovery of breast cancers within 1 year of a normal screening mammogram: how are they found? [^116DEM7d]. Annals of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We sought to determine how breast cancers that occur within 1 year after a normal mammogram are discovered.

Methods

Using population-based mammography registry data from 2000–2002, we identified 143 women with interval breast cancers and 481 women with screen-detected breast cancers. We surveyed women's primary care clinicians to assess how the interval breast cancers were found and factors associated with their discovery.

Results

Women with interval cancers were twice as likely to have a personal history of breast cancer (30.1%) as women with screen-detected cancers (13.6%). Among women with interval cancers, one half of the invasive tumors (49.5%) were discovered when women initiated a health care visit because of a breast concern, and 16.8% were discovered when a clinician found an area of concern while conducting a routine clinical breast examination. Having a lump and both a personal and a family history of breast cancer was the most common reason why women initiated a health care visit (44%) (P < .01).

Conclusions

Women with interval cancers are most likely to initiate a visit to a primary care clinician when they have 2 or more breast concerns. These concerns are most likely to include having a lump and a personal and/or family history of breast cancer. Women at highest risk for breast cancer may need closer surveillance by their primary care clinicians and may benefit from a strong educational message to come for a visit as soon as they find a lump.

### Start mammograms at 40, not 50, USPSTF suggests [^114xeP6c]. Cancer Discovery (2023). Medium credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has proposed changing the recommended age for women to begin getting routine breast cancer screenings from 50 to 40.

### Synthetic conjugated estrogens, a (cenestin) [^114RjVaC]. FDA (2004). Low credibility.

The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

3. Dementia

In the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), 4,532 generally healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older were studied, of whom 35% were 70 to 74 years of age and 18% were 75 or older. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women being treated with CE/MPA (1.8%, n = 2,229) and 21 women in the placebo group (0.9%, n = 2,303) received diagnoses of probable dementia. The relative risk for CE/MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95% confidence interval 1.21–3.48), and was similar for women with and without histories of menopausal hormone use before WHIMS. The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE/MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years, and the absolute excess risk for CE/MPA was 23 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use .)

4. Gallbladder disease

A 2 to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.

5. Hypercalcemia

Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.

6. Visual abnormalities

Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or renal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112XMF5M]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF breast cancer screening — implementation details — Screen women aged 40 to 74 years with a mammogram every 2 years. Both digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (or "3D mammography") are effective mammographic screening modalities. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for breast cancer in women 75 years or older, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against supplemental screening breast ultrasonography or MRI in women who have dense breasts. Clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether to screen for breast cancer in women 75 years or older and whether to use supplemental screening in women who have dense breasts and an otherwise normal mammogram.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to describe screening updates for women with average and high risk for breast cancer, compare different screening strategies, and describe new approaches in risk prediction, including radiomics. CONCLUSION. All women are at substantial risk for breast cancer. For women with average risk, annual mammography beginning at 40 years old maximizes the life-extending benefits and provides improved treatment options. Women at higher risk need earlier and more intense screening. Delaying initiation or decreasing frequency of mammographic screening adversely affects breast cancer detection.

### Screening mammography for average-risk women: the controversy and NCCN's position [^111FpaD3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2018). Low credibility.

Breast cancer remains the most common nonskin cancer among women and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Early detection through screening and advances in treatment have contributed to a 39% mortality reduction in the United States since 1990. The NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis recommend annual mammographic screening for average-risk women beginning at age 40 years. Mammographic screening and subsequent treatment reduces breast cancer mortality based on a wide range of studies. This article highlights NCCN's position on screening mammography and the screening controversy.

### Reason for late-stage breast cancer: absence of screening or detection, or breakdown in follow-up? [^112UZGxt]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Mammography screening increases the detection of early-stage breast cancers. Therefore, implementing screening should reduce the percentage of women who are diagnosed with late-stage disease. However, despite high national mammography screening rates, late-stage breast cancers still occur, possibly because of failures in screening implementation.

Methods

Using data from seven health care plans that included 1.5 million women aged 50 years or older, we conducted retrospective reviews of chart and automated data for 3 years before 1995–1999 diagnoses of late-stage (metastatic and/or tumor size ≥ 3 cm; case subjects, n = 1347) and early-stage breast cancers (control subjects, n = 1347). We categorized the earliest screening mammogram during the period 13–36 months before diagnosis as none (absence of screening), negative (absence of detection), or positive (potential breakdown in follow-up). We compared the proportion of case and control subjects in each category of screening implementation and estimated the likelihood (odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of late-stage breast cancer. We also evaluated demographic characteristics associated with absence of screening in women with late-stage disease. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

Absence of screening, absence of detection, and potential breakdown in follow-up were distributed differently among case (52.1%, 39.5%, and 8.4%, respectively) and control subjects (34.4%, 56.9%, and 8.8%, respectively) (P = 0.03). Among all women, the odds of having late-stage cancer were higher among women with an absence of screening (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.84 to 2.56; P < .001). Among case patients, women were more likely to be in the absence-of-screening group if they were aged 75 years or older (OR = 2.77, 95% CI = 2.10 to 3.65), unmarried (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.41 to 2.24), or without a family history of breast cancer (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.45 to 2.34). A higher proportion of women from census blocks with less education (58.5% versus 49.4%; p = 0.003) or lower median annual income (54.4% versus 42.9%; p = 0.004) were in the absence-of-screening category compared with the proportion for the other two categories combined.

Conclusions

To reduce late-stage breast cancer occurrence, reaching unscreened women, including elderly, unmarried, low-income, and less educated women, should be made a top priority for screening implementation.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^111n8qAY]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) average-risk screening — clinical breast examination (CBE): The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination (CBE) for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). The evidence review found a lack of evidence showing any benefit of a CBE alone or in conjunction with screening mammography, and there is moderate-quality evidence that adding CBE to mammography screening increased the false-positive rate; although the addition of CBE will detect a small number of additional breast cancers (ie, 2%-6%) compared with mammography alone, CBE is not recommended for breast cancer screening among average-risk, asymptomatic women at any age. Recognizing time constraints in a typical clinical visit, clinicians should use this time instead for ascertaining family history and counseling women regarding being alert to breast changes and the potential benefits, limitations, and harms of screening mammography.

Consider obtaining biennial screening mammography, particularly after age 55 years, to reduce the frequency of harms, as long as patient counseling includes a discussion that with decreased screening comes some reduction in benefits.

### The views of older women towards mammographic screening: a qualitative and quantitative study [^115N7rF3]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

'It's like being penalised if you're ill… it's like saying… you'll probably pop your clogs or something will happen so we'll not bother calling you'. (ID 36, age 78 years)

The interviews give greater insight into these areas and emphasised the importance women gave to their right to chose for themselves. They indicated that although they would be willing to discuss the risks and benefits of breast screening with their general practitioner, they would not want them to make decisions on their behalf. They wanted increased information to allow them to make an informed decision themselves.

The women interviewed were asked about their views (Figure 2) and preferences (Table 4) of several models of screening service for women over 70 years. Again, this confirms their strong preference for unrestricted screening with 42.9% (178 out of 415), indicating their preference for automatic recall extended indefinitely regardless of age or health status. There was no association between functional status or long-term health problems and the desire to continue to attend breast screening over 70 years if invited. No association was found between individual preferences and functional status, long-term health problems and number of medications taken. Preference for recall options by age are shown in Table 4. There was a trend (P = 0.044) for women with a history of breast cancer to have a stronger preference for indefinite automatic 3 yearly recall regardless of health status and for GPs to discuss screening and advice, than women without a history of breast cancer.

As indicated in the Introduction, automatic recall for breast screening will extend to age 73 years during 2010 in the United Kingdom. Almost all the women interviewed (25 out of 26) and questionnaire surveyed (90.4%, 377 out of 417) were unaware of this. Although women were generally positive about this extension, overwhelmingly they questioned what the rationale was for only extending the current system by 3 years and why screening was not routinely offered to all women regardless of age.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114RsHpK]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF breast cancer screening rationale — The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that biennial screening mammography in women aged 40 to 74 years has a moderate net benefit, supported by adequate evidence that biennial screening reduces breast cancer mortality and that harms in women aged 40 to 74 years are small. Evidence is inadequate on the benefits of screening mammography in women 75 years or older and on supplemental screening with breast ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after a negative screening mammogram, regardless of breast density, and inadequate on the harms of such supplemental screening. The USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older and of supplemental screening with ultrasonography or MRI in women with a negative screening mammogram result, regardless of breast density.

### Screening for colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer in the elderly: a review of the evidence [^112PnEnm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

There is general consensus that screening can reduce mortality from colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer among persons in their 50s and 60s. However, few screening trials have included persons over age 70 years. Therefore, indirect evidence must be used to determine when results in younger persons should be extrapolated to older persons. In this review, we focus on cancer screening tests that are well accepted in younger persons (mammography, Papanicolaou smears, and colorectal cancer screening) and discuss the strength of inference concerning benefits and harms of screening older persons. Some aspects of aging favor screening (eg, increased absolute risk of dying of cancer) whereas other aspects do not (eg, decreased life expectancy). Age also affects the behavior of some cancers (eg, increases the proportion of slow-growing breast cancers) and affects the accuracy of some screening tests (eg, increases the accuracy of mammography; decreases the accuracy of sigmoidoscopy). These effects make the application of evidence in younger populations to older populations complex. However, given the heterogeneity of the elderly population, there is no evidence of one age at which potential benefits of screening suddenly cease or potential harms suddenly become substantial for everyone. Therefore, characteristics of individual patients that go beyond age should be the driving factors in screening decisions. For example, persons who have a life expectancy less than 5 years or persons who would decline treatment should generally not be screened. Decisions to either continue or discontinue screening in the elderly should be based on health status, the benefits and harms of the test, and preferences of the patient, rather than solely on the age of the patient.

### Risk factors for breast cancer for women aged 40 to 49 years: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113b1pkX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Identifying risk factors for breast cancer specific to women in their 40s could inform screening decisions.

Purpose

To determine what factors increase risk for breast cancer in women aged 40 to 49 years and the magnitude of risk for each factor.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (January 1996 to the second week of November 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (fourth quarter of 2011), Scopus, reference lists of published studies, and the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium.

Study Selection

English-language studies and systematic reviews of risk factors for breast cancer in women aged 40 to 49 years. Additional inclusion criteria were applied for each risk factor.

Data Extraction

Data on participants, study design, analysis, follow-up, and outcomes were abstracted. Study quality was rated by using established criteria, and only studies rated as good or fair were included. Results were summarized by using meta-analysis when sufficient studies were available or from the best evidence based on study quality, size, and applicability when meta-analysis was not possible. Data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium were analyzed with proportional hazards models by using partly conditional Cox regression. Reference groups for comparisons were set at U.S. population means.

Data Synthesis

Sixty-six studies provided data for estimates. Extremely dense breasts on mammography or first-degree relatives with breast cancer were associated with at least a 2-fold increase in risk for breast cancer. Prior breast biopsy, second-degree relatives with breast cancer, or heterogeneously dense breasts were associated with a 1.5- to 2.0-fold increased risk; current use of oral contraceptives, nulliparity, and age 30 years or older at first birth were associated with a 1.0- to 1.5-fold increased risk.

Limitations

Studies varied by measures, reference groups, and adjustment for confounders, which could bias combined estimates. Effects of multiple risk factors were not considered.

Conclusion

Extremely dense breasts and first-degree relatives with breast cancer were each associated with at least a 2-fold increase in risk for breast cancer in women aged 40 to 49 years. Identification of these risk factors may be useful for personalized mammography screening.

### Breast cancer in the elderly [^1121hoGF]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

With increasing life expectancy and growth of the elderly US population, it becomes paramount that breast cancer research focuses more on the prevention, screening, and treatment of these patients. Age is no longer a cutoff for managing breast cancer in the elderly. Studies have shown the current undertreatment of cancer undermines survival, but the tide is turning to provide evidence-based medicine for the elderly. More often, clinicians and surgeons look not only at tumor-specific characteristics of breast cancer but also the functionality, tolerance, comorbidities, and life expectancy of patients to determine the best treatment.

Cancer screening in older adults — Don't Recommend Screening for Breast or Colorectal Cancer, nor Prostate Cancer (with the Prostate-Specific Antigen Test) without Considering Life Expectancy and the Risks of Testing, Overdiagnosis, and Overtreatment; older adults are more likely to have multiple chronic conditions and functional impairments, which increases their risk of immediate complications and limits their life expectancy, and for individuals with a life expectancy of less than 10 years, there is good evidence that screening for prostate, breast, and colon cancers exposes them to immediate harms with little chance of benefit.

### Toward optimal screening strategies for older women. costs, benefits, and harms of breast cancer screening by age, biology, and health status [^117K1zbb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Optimal ages of breast cancer screening cessation remain uncertain.

Objective

To evaluate screening policies based on age and quartiles of life expectancy (LE).

Design and Population

We used a stochastic model with proxies of age-dependent biology to evaluate the incremental U.S. societal costs and benefits of biennial screening from age 50 until age 70, 79, or lifetime.

Main Outcome Measures

Discounted incremental costs per life years saved (LYS).

Results

Lifetime screening is expensive (151,434 dollars per LYS) if women have treatment and survival comparable to clinical trials (idealized); stopping at age 79 costs 82,063 dollars per LYS. This latter result corresponds to costs associated with an LE of 9.5 years at age 79, a value expected for 75% of 79-year-olds, about 50% of 80-year-olds, and 25% of 85-year-olds. Using actual treatment and survival patterns, screening benefits are greater, and lifetime screening of all women might be considered (114,905 dollars per LYS), especially for women in the top 25% of LE for their age (50,643 dollars per LYS, life expectancy of approximately 7 years at age 90).

Conclusions

If all women receive idealized treatment, the benefits of mammography beyond age 79 are too low relative to their costs to justify continued screening. However, if treatment is not ideal, extending screening beyond age 79 could be considered, especially for women in the top 25% of life expectancy for their age.

### Cancer screening in older patients [^111yopcR]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Although cancer is the second leading cause of death among persons 65 years and older, there is a paucity of clinical trial data about the effectiveness and harms of cancer screening in this population. Given the heterogeneous nature of the older population, cancer screening in these patients should not be based on age alone. Studies suggest that a life expectancy of at least 10 years is necessary to derive a survival benefit from screening for breast and colorectal cancers; therefore, screening for these cancers is not recommended in those with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. Prostate cancer screening, if performed at all, should not be performed after 69 years of age. Cervical cancer screening may be stopped after 65 years of age if the patient has an adequate history of negative screening results. An individualized approach to cancer screening decisions involves estimating life expectancy, determining the potential benefits and harms of screenings, and weighing those benefits and harms in relation to the patient's values and preferences.

Cumulative Percentage of Detected Cancers by Cumulative Percentage of Mammograms According to Cancer Detection Rate From 29 Subgroups Selected by the Classification and Regression Tree Models, Sorted From High to Low

Black dots indicate cumulative percentage of detected cancers by cumulative percentage of mammograms.

Table 3 summarizes the risk groups, ordered from highest to lowest cancer detection rate; expanded descriptions of the subgroups selected by the CART models are in the eTable in the Supplement. The CART models identified clinical indication, age, and time since diagnosis for individuals with breast cancer history as the characteristics most strongly associated with cancer detection rate, with time since last mammogram important for the low and very low risk groups. BI-RADS density and family history were selected for some models, but differences by these 2 risk factors were not clinically meaningful, and subgroups were combined into the same risk groups. The cancer detection rate was considered very high or high for clinical indications of additional evaluation of a recent mammogram or diagnostic work-up of a breast lump in all individuals, diagnostic work-up of symptoms other than lump in individuals with a breast cancer history, and short-interval follow-up or diagnostic work-up of symptoms other than lump in individuals aged 60 years or older without a breast cancer history (Table 3). The cancer detection rate was considered moderate for surveillance mammograms in individuals diagnosed with breast cancer 10 or more years prior, short-interval follow-up examinations in individuals aged 70 years or older with a breast cancer history, screening examinations in individuals with a history of a high-risk breast lesion, short-interval follow-up or diagnostic work-up of symptoms other than lump in individuals younger than 60 years, and surveillance examinations in individuals less than 10 years since diagnosis. The cancer detection rate was considered low for surveillance mammograms in individuals with a breast cancer history diagnosed less than 10 years prior, first screening mammograms and screens performed more than 1 year since last mammogram in individuals aged 50 years or younger, short-interval follow-up examinations in individuals younger than 70 years with a personal history of breast cancer, and annual screens in individuals 70 years or older. The cancer detection rate was considered very low for annual screens in individuals aged 50 to 69 years (3.8 [95% CI, 3.5–4.1] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) and all screens in individuals younger than 50 years (2.8 [95% CI, 2.6–3.1] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) (Table 3).

### A systematic assessment of benefits and risks to guide breast cancer screening decisions [^1169MUdZ]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among US women. Mammography screening may be associated with reduced breast cancer mortality but can also cause harm. Guidelines recommend individualizing screening decisions, particularly for younger women.

Objectives

We reviewed the evidence on the mortality benefit and chief harms of mammography screening and what is known about how to individualize mammography screening decisions, including communicating risks and benefits to patients.

Evidence Acquisition

We searched MEDLINE from 1960–2014 to describe (1) benefits of mammography, (2) harms of mammography, and (3) individualizing screening decisions and promoting informed decision making. We also manually searched reference lists of key articles retrieved, selected reviews, meta-analyses, and practice recommendations. We rated the level of evidence using the American Heart Association guidelines.

Results

Mammography screening is associated with a 19% overall reduction of breast cancer mortality (approximately 15% for women in their 40s and 32% for women in their 60s). For a 40- or 50-year-old woman undergoing 10 years of annual mammograms, the cumulative risk of a false-positive result is about 61%. About 19% of the cancers diagnosed during that 10-year period would not have become clinically apparent without screening (overdiagnosis), although there is uncertainty about this estimate. The net benefit of screening depends greatly on baseline breast cancer risk, which should be incorporated into screening decisions. Decision aids have the potential to help patients integrate information about risks and benefits with their own values and priorities, although they are not yet widely available for use in clinical practice.

Conclusions and Relevance

To maximize the benefit of mammography screening, decisions should be individualized based on patients' risk profiles and preferences. Risk models and decision aids are useful tools, but more research is needed to optimize these and to further quantify overdiagnosis. Research should also explore other breast cancer screening strategies.

### Benefits and harms of annual, biennial, or triennial breast cancer mammography screening for women at average risk of breast cancer: a systematic review for the European commission initiative on breast cancer (ECIBC) [^1127WmwG]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer (BC) is the second most prevalent cancer in the world and the most frequent among women. In the European Union, 404,920 women were diagnosed with BC and 98,755 women died during 2018. Despite these high rates, the mortality risk of BC has decreased over the last decades due to improvements in treatment, services quality, and to early diagnosis linked to the implementation of population-based screening programmes. However, there is still ongoing research and debate on how to best implement BC screening programmes, including which is the optimal mammography screening interval.

Published recommendations on mammography screening frequencies vary among organisations. The National Health Service Breast Screening Program (NHSBSP) of the United Kingdom, recommends screening every 3 years to women aged 50–70 (47–73 in England). The United States Prevention Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends biennial mammography for women aged 50–74 and making a case by case decision for women in their 40s. The American Cancer Society recommends annual screening between the ages of 45 and 54 (with the option of starting annual screening between 40 and 44), and screening every two years from age 55 or continue annually if the woman is in good health and expected to live ten more years.

Previous studies have suggested that the balance between benefits and harms for different screening intervals might vary depending on the age subgroup. A modelling study found that for every 1000 women aged 50–74, biennial screening avoided seven BC deaths, while annual screening had similar benefits but caused more harms. Observational data from the US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) registries, observed that premenopausal women undergoing biennial screening had more BC lesions with less favourable prognostic characteristics compared to those having annual screening.

In 2015, the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer (ECIBC) was launched to develop the European Guidelines on Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis. This article describes the systematic review that informed the recommendations about mammography screening intervals for women of average breast cancer risk in three separate age subgroups. During the guideline development process, the Guidelines Development Group (GDG) made detailed considerations about the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, values and preferences, equity, acceptability and feasibility; these considerations are described in the published methodology and summary of recommendations.

### Different types of patient health information associated with physician decision-making regarding cancer screening cessation for older adults [^1156Xodj]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Although cancer screening has been shown to reduce cancer-related mortality and morbidity, there is increasing recognition that it can also be harmful and burdensome, especially for older adults. – The benefits of cancer screening typically lag by 10 or more years for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer screenings, whereas the harms and burdens of these screenings — which include complications from screening and follow-up tests, overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically unimportant cancers, psychological stress from false-positive results, diverted attention away from other health conditions — occur in the short term. – Guidelines recommend against routine cancer screening for older adults for whom the harms outweigh the benefits, using age or life expectancy criteria.– However, national studies show that many older adults who meet guideline criteria for cancer screening cessation continue to be screened for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers, raising concerns for overscreening. – Physician recommendation has been shown to be an important factor associated with overscreening among older adults, and interventions targeting clinicians to reduce overscreening are needed. –

### Assessment of a risk-based approach for triaging mammography examinations during periods of reduced capacity [^1179y3Gh]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Mammography Outcomes

Breast cancer diagnoses were obtained by linking with pathology databases and state or regional cancer registries. The final BI-RADS assessment was considered positive if it had an assessment of 4 or 5 and negative if the assessment was 1, 2, or 3. The cancer detection rate was calculated as number of mammograms with positive final assessment and invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed within 90 days divided by total number of mammograms.

Statistical Analysis

We summarized characteristics of the study population by breast cancer history. We estimated cancer detection rate by individual and mammographic characteristics, separately by breast cancer history, and estimated 95% CIs using generalized estimating equations with a working independence correlation structure to account for correlation among mammograms within the same facility.

Classification and regression trees (CART)were used to identify factors most strongly associated with cancer detection rate. We fit 4 models: screening mammograms in individuals without a breast cancer history, surveillance mammograms in individuals with a breast cancer history, and diagnostic mammograms separately by breast cancer history. All models included age group (< 40, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, ≥ 70 years), time since last mammogram (first mammogram, 1 year, 2 years, ≥ 3 years), first-degree family history of breast cancer, and breast density as potential predictors. Models for diagnostic mammograms also included clinical indication as additional evaluation of a recent mammogram, short-interval follow-up, or clinical signs or symptoms subdivided by lump, other symptoms, and unknown symptoms. Models for individuals without a breast cancer history also included history of a high-risk lesion. Models for individuals with a breast cancer history also included years since diagnosis (< 5, 5 to < 10, ≥ 10, unknown).

### Evidence of benefit from mammography screening of average-risk women ages 40–49 years: science, metrics, and value judgments [^115VRx8V]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

The majority of randomized control trials and service-based screening studies of women ages 40–49 years demonstrate reductions in mortality of 29%-48% when long-term outcome is assessed. Annual screening is preferable in these younger women due to faster tumor-doubling times. Advances in mammography technique and breast ultrasound may allow even better results in the future.

### Factors influencing primary care practitioners' cancer screening recommendations for older adults: a systematic review [^115MMroG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient Health Characteristics

Life Expectancy

Fifteen studies (four of good quality) found that PCPs considered life expectancy an important factor in screening recommendations, including being less likely to recommend screening for individuals with limited life expectancy as presented in vignettes (< 5 years, or < 2 years). In qualitative studies, PCPs determined clearly limited life expectancy by considering comorbidities, frailty, and cognitive decline, but also reported difficulty or uncertainty about these estimationsor disagreed with using life expectancy to guide decision-making. When life expectancy was 5–10 years in vignettes, PCPs were more likely to defer to the patient's preference for colorectal screening.

Health Status, Comorbidities and Functional Status

Five quantitative studies, including three of good quality, found that PCPs were less likely to offer screening (or more likely to recommend against) to those in poor health compared to good health, or to those with more severe comorbidity. PCPs also described comorbidity as an important factor in decision-making in six studies (two of good quality), and one study of poor quality found 68% felt that breast screening should be offered to healthy women regardless of their age. Five qualitative studies, including two of good quality, highlighted how PCPs assessed health status globally or based on "gut feeling" (e.g. considering comorbidities, functional status, life expectancy) when making screening recommendations. One quantitative study of lower quality and one qualitative study of good quality also found functional status and ability to tolerate further tests/treatment were influential.

Cancer Risk

One quantitative study of low qualityand two qualitative studies of moderate quality, reported that risk due to family or personal history of cancer influenced PCP recommendations for breast and prostate screening.

Screening History

Screening history influenced PCPs in two studies whereby history of normal cervical screening reduced likelihood of offering screening to older women (good quality)and longer time since last colonoscopy (> 5 years vs < 5 years) increased likelihood of recommending colonoscopy.

Patient Psycho-social Factors

Patient Personal Preference

Eight quantitative studies (2 of good quality) and nine qualitative studies (4 of good quality) found that PCPs considered patient preference (also conceptualized across studies as patient's request, expectation, autonomy, satisfaction, experiences, or anxiety), as influential in screening recommendations.

### ESR essentials: screening for breast cancer-general recommendations by EUSOBI [^113h9Q8y]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women accounting for about 30% of all new cancer cases and the incidence is constantly increasing. Implementation of mammographic screening has contributed to a reduction in breast cancer mortality of at least 20% over the last 30 years. Screening programs usually include all women irrespective of their risk of developing breast cancer and with age being the only determining factor. This approach has some recognized limitations, including underdiagnosis, false positive cases, and overdiagnosis. Indeed, breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths in women undergoing cancer screening. Supplemental imaging modalities, including digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, breast MRI, and, more recently, contrast-enhanced mammography, are available and have already shown potential to further increase the diagnostic performances. Use of breast MRI is recommended in high-risk women and women with extremely dense breasts. Artificial intelligence has also shown promising results to support risk categorization and interval cancer reduction. The implementation of a risk-stratified approach instead of a "one-size-fits-all" approach may help to improve the benefit-to-harm ratio as well as the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening. KEY POINTS: Regular mammography should still be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women and women with extremely dense breast tissue should use MRI for supplemental screening or US if MRI is not available. Women need to participate actively in the decision to undergo personalized screening. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Mammography is an effective imaging tool to diagnose breast cancer in an early stage and to reduce breast cancer mortality (evidence level I). Until more evidence is available to move to a personalized approach, regular mammography should be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women should start screening earlier; first with yearly breast MRI which can be supplemented by yearly or biennial mammography starting at 35–40 years old (evidence level I). Breast MRI screening should be also offered to women with extremely dense breasts (evidence level I). If MRI is not available, ultrasound can be performed as an alternative, although the added value of supplemental ultrasound regarding cancer detection remains limited. Individual screening recommendations should be made through a shared decision-making process between women and physicians.

### Breast cancer risk feedback to women in the UK NHS breast screening population [^116qZLoe]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

UK deaths from breast cancer have declined by 40% in women < 70 years. Some of this fall is attributed to mammographic screening, but widespread use of adjuvant systemic therapies and general improvements in care have also contributed. Unlike many national breast screening programmes, which typically use one or two yearly intervals, the interval between mammograms in the UK National Health Service Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP) is 3 years. There is evidence that women at high risk of breast cancer (30%+ lifetime risk or 8% 10-year risk – NICE guidelines;) are more likely to develop interval cancers and reducing the screening interval in this poor prognosis group may be indicated. The Swedish two-county study showed women with a positive family history of breast cancer were more likely to develop breast cancer between their two-yearly screens than women with negative family histories. High mammographic density also increases the chances of developing breast cancers as well as interval cancers due possibly to masking effects, suggesting density should be incorporated into risk models. Stratification of screening frequency by risk is likely to be cost effective.

Breast cancer risk is generally assessed using models that include breast cancer family history, reproductive and hormonal history (age at first pregnancy, menarche, menopause, HRT use), height and weight. Models generally perform well for predicting risk in a population (e.g. 1 in 3 lifetime risk) but not for precise individual risk.

In the United States, the Gail model is widely used. It is based on age, first-degree relatives with breast cancer, number of surgical breast biopsies and reproductive factors as above. In a comparison of models using UK data, we demonstrated that for women with a family history of breast cancer the Tyrer-Cuzick model performed better than the Gail model; similar results were reported with US data. The Tyrer-Cuzick model has a more extensive familial component and includes HRT, height and weight. Nevertheless, many breast cancers arise in women with no commonly assessed risk factors.

Breast cancer screening overdiagnosis and program aims: The panel characterizes overdiagnosis as contested but affirms its existence while acknowledging uncertainty in magnitude, stating that "The issue of overdiagnosis is controversial", and that "The evidence review judged the evidence for the existence of overdiagnosis as high, but evidence for estimating the magnitude of overdiagnosis as low". Programmatically, "The main goal of mammography screening programs is to reduce breast cancer mortality by reducing the incidence rate of advanced breast cancer", recognizing that "A screening test that is successful in detecting small invasive cancers also will detect some precursors", and that "this likely does result in some overdiagnosis, but in other instances, it advances the time of diagnosis of a progressive lesion".

### Management of male breast cancer: ASCO guideline [^111LBwjp]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Male breast cancer — surveillance for men with genetic predisposition mutations: Contralateral annual mammogram may be offered to men with a history of breast cancer and a genetic predisposition mutation (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Breast magnetic resonance imaging is not recommended routinely in men with a history of breast cancer (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Among men carrying BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, the cumulative risk of breast cancer by age 70 years was 1.2% and 6.8%, respectively, and consequently, the Expert Panel recommended that contralateral mammography may be offered; the recommendation against routine breast magnetic resonance imaging was based in part on (1) the relatively small amount of breast tissue present in most men, (2) the lack of data demonstrating an improvement in survival for this screening test among women, and (3) the potential for false positives.

### Geriatric assessment in older patients with breast cancer [^112uvJ3Q]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2009). Low credibility.

Most cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in older adults. Older women have an increased risk for breast cancer-specific mortality and are at higher risk for treatment-associated morbidity than younger women. However, they are also less likely to be offered preventive care or adjuvant therapy for this disease. Major gaps in evidence exist regarding the optimal evaluation and treatment of older women with breast cancer because of significant underrepresentation in clinical trials. Chronologic age alone is an inadequate predictor of treatment tolerance and benefit in this heterogeneous population. Multiple issues uniquely associated with aging impact cancer care, including functional impairment, comorbidity, social support, cognitive function, psychological state, and financial stress. Applying geriatric principles and assessment to this older adult population would inform decision making by providing estimates of life expectancy and identifying individuals most vulnerable to morbidity. Ongoing research is seeking to identify which assessment tools can best predict outcomes in this population, and thus guide experts in tailoring treatments to maximize benefits in older adults with breast cancer.
