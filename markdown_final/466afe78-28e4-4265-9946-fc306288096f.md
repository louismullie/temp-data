## Question

What is the appropriate vitamin E dosage to cure measles?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the appropriate vitamin E dosage is to cure measles. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the natural history and standard management of measles. Then, I should verify whether any evidence supports vitamin E as a therapeutic agent for measles and whether any dosing has been studied. Next, I will review known risks of vitamin E at various doses. Finally, I will clarify evidence-based therapy for measles, including vitamin A recommendations, and provide a clear bottom line with safety caveats [^113HQxxw].

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals: measles is a highly contagious RNA virus illness managed primarily with supportive care; there is no antiviral "cure", and standard management focuses on hydration, fever control, treatment of complications, infection control, and micronutrient support with vitamin A, especially in children and the severely ill [^113HQxxw] [^1112UnBu].

> Wait, let me verify whether vitamin E has any established therapeutic role in measles. I need to check the supplied literature for trials, guidelines, or case series using vitamin E to treat measles. I do not find any measles treatment studies or guidelines recommending vitamin E; instead, vitamin E appears in unrelated contexts: a meta-analysis links high-dose vitamin E supplementation to increased all-cause mortality, FDA labeling warns that excess vitamin E can increase bleeding risk, very-high-dose vitamin E is used for abetalipoproteinemia, and preterm-infant literature discusses narrow therapeutic ranges and toxicity concerns for tocopherol levels, none of which pertain to treating measles itself [^1128mA5B] [^116pYd6u] [^1133qAn6] [^115yimHP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; absence of evidence is not always evidence of absence. But here, I should confirm whether any authoritative measles reviews or management documents mention vitamin E at all. The comprehensive clinical reviews and emergency care summaries emphasize supportive care and vitamin A, without listing vitamin E as a therapy, which reinforces that vitamin E is not part of standard measles treatment and no dosage exists for this indication; broader preventive recommendations also do not endorse vitamin E supplementation for disease prevention, underscoring limited clinical utility in this context [^113HQxxw] [^1112UnBu] [^1125rGJ4].

> Next, I should review what is actually recommended for measles. Vitamin A is the only micronutrient with demonstrated benefit in measles, reducing morbidity and mortality; typical practice is to give age-based high-dose vitamin A at diagnosis, commonly 200,000 IU for children older than 12 months and 100,000 IU for infants 6–12 months, often repeated the next day, particularly in hospitalized or severe cases; this is consistent with global practice patterns and pediatric infectious disease literature, even though efficacy signals may vary by setting [^114hP7Aw] [^113HQxxw] [^1112UnBu] [^116jW8gP].

> I need to ensure safety considerations for vitamin E are explicit. High-dose vitamin E, typically defined as 400 IU/day or more, has been associated with an increase in all-cause mortality in meta-analysis, and excess intake can inhibit platelet aggregation and antagonize vitamin K–dependent clotting, raising bleeding risk; neonatal and preterm data also warn that elevated serum tocopherol levels can be harmful, highlighting that the therapeutic window is narrow and indication-specific, none of which supports vitamin E use in measles care [^1128mA5B] [^116pYd6u] [^111mXcxB] [^115yimHP].

> Let me consider prevention and systems issues because they directly affect outcomes. Measles is best prevented by vaccination with MMR or MMRV following routine schedules, with post-exposure prophylaxis strategies applied when appropriate; reinforcing vaccination coverage and infection control remains central to reducing measles morbidity and mortality and obviates questions about unproven supplements like vitamin E for treatment [^116c9aWi] [^117CXYb7] [^112JEnXm].

> I should double-check that my bottom line is clear and clinically actionable. There is no appropriate vitamin E dosage to cure measles, because vitamin E is not an evidence-based therapy for measles and carries potential harm at higher doses; management is supportive, and vitamin A is the only micronutrient with proven benefit in measles, commonly administered as 200,000 IU for children older than 12 months and 100,000 IU for infants 6–12 months at diagnosis, with a repeat dose the next day in severe cases or hospitalization, while avoiding unnecessary vitamin E supplementation that could increase bleeding risk or mortality signals at high doses [^113HQxxw] [^114hP7Aw] [^116pYd6u] [^1128mA5B].

---

Vitamin E is **not recommended** for treating measles [^113HQxxw]. There is **no evidence** that vitamin E cures measles or reduces its complications [^1112UnBu]. The standard of care is **supportive care plus vitamin A supplementation** [^113HQxxw], which reduces measles morbidity and mortality [^114hP7Aw]. High-dose vitamin E may increase bleeding risk and all-cause mortality and therefore should not be used for measles [^116pYd6u] [^1128mA5B].

---

## Current clinical guidelines for measles management

Measles management is primarily supportive, including hydration, antipyretics, and monitoring for complications [^1112UnBu]. Vitamin A supplementation is **recommended**, especially in children [^113HQxxw], to reduce morbidity and mortality [^1177PU96]. Current guidelines do not recommend vitamin E supplementation for measles [^113HQxxw].

---

## Evidence regarding vitamin E supplementation in measles

No clinical trials have evaluated vitamin E supplementation specifically for measles treatment. The available evidence **does not support** its therapeutic use for measles.

---

## Recommended vitamin E dosing guidelines

Vitamin E supplementation is **primarily recommended for individuals with documented vitamin E deficiency**, such as those with fat malabsorption syndromes or specific genetic disorders [^1133qAn6]. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin E is:

- **Infants 0–6 months**: 4 mg/day (6 IU/day)
- **Infants 7–12 months**: 5 mg/day (7.5 IU/day)
- **Children 1–3 years**: 6 mg/day (9 IU/day)
- **Children 4–8 years**: 7 mg/day (10.4 IU/day)
- **Children 9–13 years**: 11 mg/day (16.4 IU/day)
- **Adolescents and adults**: 15 mg/day (22.4 IU/day)
- **Pregnant women**: 15 mg/day (22.4 IU/day)
- **Lactating women**: 19 mg/day (28.4 IU/day)

High-dose vitamin E supplementation (≥ 400 IU/day) is associated with **increased all-cause mortality** [^1128mA5B] and **bleeding risk** [^116pYd6u], especially in those with underlying health conditions or taking anticoagulant medications [^111mXcxB].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of vitamin E supplementation

Vitamin E supplementation, particularly at high doses, carries potential risks and side effects, including:

- **Increased bleeding risk**: Vitamin E can inhibit platelet aggregation and antagonize vitamin K-dependent clotting factors [^116pYd6u], increasing the risk of bleeding, especially in individuals taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications [^111mXcxB].
- **Increased all-cause mortality**: High-dose vitamin E supplementation (≥ 400 IU/day) has been associated with increased all-cause mortality in clinical trials [^1128mA5B].
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps may occur with high-dose supplementation.
- **Potential drug interactions**: Vitamin E supplementation may interact with medications such as warfarin, increasing the risk of bleeding complications [^116pYd6u].

---

## Comparison of vitamin E supplementation with other treatments

Vitamin E supplementation **has not been shown to be effective** for treating measles or reducing its complications [^1112UnBu]. In contrast, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends vitamin A supplementation for measles — particularly in children [^113HQxxw] — given its proven benefits in reducing morbidity and mortality [^1177PU96].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no scientific evidence** supporting the use of vitamin E supplementation for treating measles or reducing its complications, and current clinical guidelines do not recommend it for measles management [^113HQxxw]. Instead, **supportive care and vitamin A supplementation remain the standard of care** [^1177PU96]. High-dose vitamin E supplementation carries potential risks, including increased bleeding [^116pYd6u] and mortality [^1128mA5B], and should not be used to treat measles.

### Low use of vitamin A in children hospitalized for measles in the United States [^114hP7Aw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Vitamin A reduces measles morbidity and mortality and is recommended for management. We studied 142 patients hospitalized at US children's hospitals for measles between January 1, 2004, and March 31, 2019, and found only 47 (33%) received vitamin A. Patients with complex chronic conditions were less likely to be treated. This study highlights a concerning gap between recommendations and practice for hospital management of measles.

### Meta-analysis: High-dosage vitamin E supplementation may increase all-cause mortality [^1128mA5B]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Experimental models and observational studies suggest that vitamin E supplementation may prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, several trials of high-dosage vitamin E supplementation showed non-statistically significant increases in total mortality.

- **Purpose**: To perform a meta-analysis of the dose-response relationship between vitamin E supplementation and total mortality by using data from randomized, controlled trials.

- **Patients**: 135,967 participants in 19 clinical trials. Of these trials, 9 tested vitamin E alone and 10 tested vitamin E combined with other vitamins or minerals. The dosages of vitamin E ranged from 16.5 to 2000 IU/d (median, 400 IU/d).

- **Data sources**: A PubMed search from 1966 through August 2004, complemented by a search of the Cochrane Clinical Trials Database and review of citations of published reviews and meta-analyses. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Data extraction**: Three investigators independently abstracted study reports. The investigators of the original publications were contacted if required information was not available.

- **Data synthesis**: 9 of 11 trials testing high-dosage vitamin E (≥ 400 IU/d) showed increased risk (risk difference > 0) for all-cause mortality in comparisons of vitamin E versus control. The pooled all-cause mortality risk difference in high-dosage vitamin E trials was 39 per 10,000 persons (95% CI, 3 to 74 per 10,000 persons; P = 0.035). For low-dosage vitamin E trials, the risk difference was -16 per 10,000 persons (CI, -41 to 10 per 10,000 persons; P > 0.2). A dose-response analysis showed a

### Measles [^113HQxxw]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that results from infection with the measles virus and is still responsible for more than 100,000 deaths every year, down from more than 2 million deaths annually before the introduction and widespread use of the measles vaccine. Measles virus is transmitted by the respiratory route, and illness begins with fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by a characteristic rash. Complications of measles affect most organ systems, with pneumonia accounting for most measles-associated morbidity and mortality. The management of patients with measles includes the provision of vitamin A. Measles is best prevented through vaccination, and the major reductions in measles incidence and mortality have renewed interest in regional elimination and global eradication.

However, urgent efforts are needed to increase stagnating global coverage with two doses of measles vaccine through advocacy, education, and the strengthening of routine immunization systems. The use of combined measles-rubella vaccines provides an opportunity to eliminate rubella and congenital rubella syndrome. Ongoing research efforts, including the development of point-of-care diagnostics and microneedle patches, will facilitate progress towards measles elimination and eradication.

### Koselugo [^116pYd6u]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Increased levels of vitamin E and risk of bleeding**: Koselugo capsules contain vitamin E, with 10 mg capsules containing 32 mg of vitamin E as the excipient, D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), and 25 mg capsules containing 36 mg of vitamin E as TPGS. Vitamin E can inhibit platelet aggregation and antagonize vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Daily vitamin E intake that exceeds the recommended or safe limits may increase the risk of bleeding. Supplemental vitamin E is not recommended if the daily intake (including the amount in Koselugo and supplements) will exceed these limits.

	- An increased risk of bleeding may occur in patients co-administered vitamin-K antagonists or anti-platelet antagonists with Koselugo. Monitoring for bleeding in such patients is advised. Increase international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring, as appropriate, in patients taking a vitamin-K antagonist. Perform anticoagulant assessments, including INR or prothrombin time, more frequently. Adjust doses of vitamin K antagonists or anti-platelet agents as appropriate [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Koselugo can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of selumetinib to mice during organogenesis caused reduced fetal weight, adverse structural defects, and effects on embryo-fetal survival at approximate exposures greater than five times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 25 mg/m² twice daily.

### Nascobal [^116PAaeS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Prior to initiating treatment with Nascobal, obtain hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate, and iron levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Consider the potential for concomitant drugs to interfere with vitamin B12 and folate diagnostic blood assays [see Drug interactions (7)]. In patients with suspected cobalamin hypersensitivity, consider administering an intradermal test dose of parenteral vitamin B12 prior to using Nascobal [see Warnings and precautions (5.2)].

- **Recommended dosage**: The recommended initial dose of Nascobal is one spray (500 mcg) administered in one nostril once weekly. Administer Nascobal at least one hour before or one hour after ingesting hot foods or liquids, as hot foods may cause nasal secretions and a resulting loss of medication. Defer use of Nascobal in patients with nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, or upper respiratory infections until after symptoms have subsided.

- **Monitoring, dosage modifications, and treatment duration**:

	- **Monitoring for response and safety**: Monitor serum B12 levels periodically during therapy to establish the adequacy of therapy. Obtain a serum B12 level and peripheral blood count one month after treatment initiation, then subsequently at intervals of 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and precautions (5.3)].

	- **Dosage modifications**: If serum levels of B12 decline after one month of treatment with Nascobal, consider increasing the dose. Assess serum B12 level one month after each dose adjustment. If serum B12 levels are persistently low, consider alternative therapy.

### Koselugo [^111mXcxB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Increased vitamin E levels and risk of bleeding**: Advise patients and caregivers to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking a supplement containing vitamin E, a vitamin-K antagonist, or an anti-platelet agent [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Koselugo and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Koselugo and for at least 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

- **Lactation**: Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Koselugo and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

- **Drug interactions**: Advise patients and caregivers to inform their healthcare provider of all concomitant medications, including prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and herbal products. Inform patients to avoid St. John's wort, grapefruit, or grapefruit juice while taking Koselugo [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Dosing and administration**: Inform patients and caregivers on how to take Koselugo and what to do for missed or vomited doses.

### Aquasol A [^116i1n9V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The intravenous administration of Aquasol A is contraindicated in cases of hypervitaminosis A or sensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.

The safety of consuming amounts exceeding 6,000 Units of vitamin A daily during pregnancy has not been established. The use of vitamin A in excess of the recommended dietary allowance may cause fetal harm if administered to a pregnant woman. Animal reproduction studies have shown fetal abnormalities associated with overdosage in several species, with malformations of the central nervous system, eye, palate, and urogenital tract recorded. Consequently, vitamin A in excess of the recommended dietary allowance is contraindicated for women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. If vitamin A is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking vitamin A, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus.

### Diet management in congenital diarrheas and enteropathies - general concepts and disease-specific approach, a narrative review [^1133qAn6]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Low credibility.

Dietary management is critical for patients with abetalipoproteinemia (ABL). A minimal-fat diet is recommended, constituting 30% of the lower limits of normal. Early initiation of vitamin E therapy, particularly before 16 months of age, may prevent neurologic and retinal consequences. However, improvement in neurologic dysfunction is observed even in those diagnosed as young adults.

Orally administered high-dose vitamins are thought to bypass the intestinal chylomicron assembly pathway via the medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) pathway through the portal circulation. High doses of oral vitamin E are typically administered as α-tocopherol supplementation at 50–200 mg/kg per day. Note that plasma vitamin E concentrations might not accurately reflect the whole-body content of vitamin E, necessitating careful vitamin replacement.

### Refocusing vitamin A supplementation programmes to reach the most vulnerable [^116s9yKJ]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

The criteria to assess the need for national preventive vitamin A supplementation (VAS) programmes are crucial. The under-five mortality rate (U5MR) serves both as an indication of the potential impact of VAS, given its effect on mortality reduction, and as a proxy for vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in countries lacking data.

Higher U5MRs correspond with increased deaths from infectious causes; thus, in populations with a higher U5MR, the impact of VAS on reducing mortality is likely greater, assuming other factors are equal. Conversely, in populations with a U5MR of less than 25 per 1000 births, the potential impact of VAS on mortality is diminished. Hence, it is valuable to identify a threshold to reassess the necessity of a VAS programme in such settings. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on healthy lives includes a target to reduce preventable deaths to a U5MR of less than 25, partly because this is anticipated when infectious causes of death are substantially reduced.

Over time, analyses of U5MR have shown that infectious causes have decreased not only in absolute numbers but also proportionally across all countries. From 2006 to 2016, the largest reductions in deaths were attributed to various infectious causes, with measles showing the most significant decrease as a cause of death in both the postneonatal period and in children aged 1 to 4 years. We also reviewed the Global Burden of Disease data by region, focusing on postneonatal and child deaths in the 1 to 4-year age bracket from 1990 to 2017, and noted the reduction in the proportion of deaths due to infectious causes.

### Vitamin E supplementation for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants [^111JrfZS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Treating very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with pharmacologic doses of vitamin E as an antioxidant agent has been proposed for preventing or limiting retinopathy of prematurity, intracranial hemorrhage, hemolytic anemia, and chronic lung disease. However, excessive doses of vitamin E may result in side effects.

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of vitamin E supplementation on morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. We searched MEDLINE (October 2002), EMBASE (March 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) from the Cochrane Library, 2003, Issue 1, and personal files for clinical trials assessing vitamin E in preterm infants.

We selected trials analyzing primary outcomes (mortality or combined long-term morbidity) or secondary outcomes (other morbidity) in infants with gestational age less than 37 weeks or birth weight less than 2500 grams. The intervention was allocation to routine supplementation with vitamin E in the treatment group versus placebo, no treatment, or another type, dose, or route of administration of vitamin E. We used standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.

Twenty-six randomized clinical trials fulfilled entry criteria. No study assessed combined long-term morbidity. Routine vitamin E supplementation significantly increased hemoglobin concentration by a small amount. Vitamin E significantly reduced the risk of germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage.

### Pediapred [^115kKTdV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Infections (viral): Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or adults on corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated (see the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information). If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents should be considered.

- **Ophthalmic**: Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex.

- **Special pathogens**: Latent disease may be activated, or there may be an exacerbation of infections due to pathogens, including those caused by Candida, Mycobacterium, Ameba, Toxoplasma, Pneumocystis, Cryptococcus, and Nocardia, etc.

### Vitamin E in the treatment of uveitis-associated macular edema [^112SYKFi]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether high-dose alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) could reduce vision loss and retinal thickening associated with uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema. The study was designed as a double-masked, randomized trial.

Uveitis patients with macular edema seen at the NIH were randomized and received either 1600 IU/day of vitamin E or a placebo for 4 months. Visual acuity and retinal thickening were monitored to assess the efficacy and safety of the high dose of vitamin E.

Results indicated changes in visual acuity and retinal thickening; however, four-month oral supplementation with 1600 IU/d of vitamin E had no apparent effect on uveitis-associated macular edema or visual acuity in this small study.

### Causes of severe visual impairment and blindness in students in schools for the blind in northwest Ethiopia [^112by9ZC]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

Corneal blindness, mainly resulting from measles and vitamin A deficiency, remains a significant public health problem in Northwest Ethiopia. Unlike other low-income countries where progress has been noted, the situation in Ethiopia has not improved. More than three-quarters of the causes of severe visual impairment and blindness (SVI/BL) are potentially avoidable, with the leading causes being measles, vitamin A deficiency, and cataracts.

- **Concerted and integrated efforts**: The Ministry of Health, along with other authorities, primary healthcare workers, eye care professionals, and educators, must work together to implement measures that prevent corneal blindness from vitamin A deficiency and measles. Efforts should also be increased towards the detection, referral, and management of cataracts and refractive errors.

- **Initiatives to improve coverage**: Enhanced measles immunization and vitamin A supplementation are urgently needed to reduce under-five mortality rates as well as to prevent vision loss and blindness in children.

The World Health Organization recommends one tertiary-level child eye health facility per 10 million population; however, Ethiopia currently only has three facilities for a population exceeding 90 million. Strengthening existing facilities and establishing new centers, aiming for at least one in each region, is highly recommended to address the treatable causes of childhood blindness.

### Issues in establishing vitamin D recommendations for infants and children [^1172NbZk]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

In 1963, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition recommended 400 IU of vitamin D per day for all infants and children. After the late 1970s, this became an inconsistent recommendation, particularly for breastfeeding infants. In 2003, however, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended 200 IU/d vitamin D for all infants and children in response to the vitamin D adequate intake recommendations made by the Institute of Medicine in 1997, the increasing number of reports of nutritional rickets in certain populations of American infants, and the Healthy People 2010 goal of having 75% of infants breastfed for the first six months of life.

In making these recommendations, many issues were taken into consideration, including:

- **Vitamin D deficiency**: More than rickets, which is the final stage of the deficient state among growing children.
- **Sunlight exposure**: Adequate sunlight exposure cannot be determined exactly for every subject.
- **Ultraviolet-B light exposure**: There is new awareness of the hazards in childhood and the subsequent development of skin cancer in adulthood.
- **Intake of vitamin D-fortified foods**: There is a decreasing intake among older children and adolescents.

More research is needed in the pediatric population to determine the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin D. A new definition of vitamin D deficiency that would make use of normal serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in a given population is needed. The recommended intake of 200 IU/d may not be enough. More data are needed to support the adequacy.

### Micronutrient supplementation in adults with HIV infection [^1116tcH8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

- **Comparison 7: Vitamin E plus vitamin C versus placebo**: One small Canadian trial compared high daily doses of vitamins E (800 IU) and C (1000 mg) to placebo in adults on combination ART for three months. Participants were followed up for six months due to a possible carry-over effect of the intervention. Allocation concealment was not well described, making the risk of selection bias unclear, but the trial was adequately blinded.

- **Mortality**: Not reported.

- **Morbidity and clinical disease progression**: The study reported that high daily doses of vitamins E and C for three months had no effect on the risk of new AIDS-defining infections after six months (RR 3.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 29.43; 1 trial, 49 participants).

- **Immunological and virological outcomes**: No effect on viral load (log 10 copies/mL) was observed after three months of supplementation with high daily doses of vitamins E and C (MD 0.95 log 10 copies/mL, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.04; 1 trial, 49 participants).

- **Nutritional status and blood micronutrient concentrations**: The trial reported that high daily doses of vitamins E and C for three months increased blood concentrations of vitamin E (µmol/L) (MD 28.70, 95% CI 20.01 to 37.39; one trial, 49 participants) and vitamin C (µmol/L) (MD 27.30, 95% CI 12.88 to 41.72; 1 trial, 49 participants) in adults on ART.

- **Adverse events associated with supplementation**: Two participants in the intervention group reported epigastric discomfort.

### Amvuttra [^116Q3JKP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients should be informed that Amvuttra treatment results in a decrease in serum vitamin A levels. It is crucial to instruct them to maintain the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A and advise them to contact their healthcare provider if they experience ocular symptoms that may suggest a vitamin A deficiency, such as night blindness. Referral to an ophthalmologist is advisable if these symptoms develop [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In the case of pregnancy, patients should be instructed to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant while taking Amvuttra. It is important to communicate the potential risks to the fetus, including the fact that Amvuttra treatment leads to decreased serum vitamin A levels [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Block randomisation 2:1 to receive early or no early MV, with 24 envelopes per bag, was performed separately for males and females. Envelopes were prepared by the supervisor. Same-sex twins drew one envelope and received the same treatment to avoid confusion about which twin received what. The enrolment team and mothers were not blinded regarding treatment. Mothers in the 2-dose group were informed that their child would receive early MV now and be invited back for MV at age 9 months. Mothers in the 1-dose group were told that their child did not receive MV now but would be invited to receive MV at age 9 months. A control vaccine could not be used since we intended to measure the NSEs of MV. Had we used placebo, some mothers might erroneously have believed that their child had received MV. If they moved, they might not have sought MV. We did not record the 4-month MV on the vaccination card. Thus, field assistants and staff at health centres and paediatric wards were blinded as per procedures.

- **Procedures**: We used standard Edmonston-Zagreb MV from the Serum Institute of India. According to quality tests, the mean virus concentration for trial batches ranged from log10 3.67 (95%CI: 3.38 to 3.95) to 3.93 (3.79 to 4.08) CCID50/0.5 ml. As per standard, a 0.5 mL vaccine injection was administered subcutaneously in the scapular region.

Children were followed at scheduled health centre visits at 9, 36, and 60 months of age. If children were travelling at 9 months, we kept visiting them until they were 18 months old. The children were also visited at home every 6 months.

### Vitamin a supplementation among 9–59 month old children in India: geospatial perspectives and implications for targeted coverage [^113jMZ1C]. BMJ Global Health (2022). Low credibility.

Vitamin A refers to a group of fat-soluble vitamins belonging to the retinoid family and their derivatives (e.g. retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, retinyl esters). It mediates important cellular processes in the human body (e.g. phototransduction, cell proliferation, differentiation, signaling) that are critical for vision, growth and development, wound healing, reproduction, and immunity, among other biological functions. Due to the absence of de novo synthesis in humans, vitamin A is an essential micronutrient whose physiological requirement is met by its dietary intake directly or that of its precursor (β-carotene).

Thus, poor nutrition and inadequate reserves may lead to vitamin A deficiency (VAD), a condition often exacerbated by infective episodes (e.g. measles, diarrhea) and common in children under five from developing countries. Globally, an estimated 190 million (or one in three) children below the age of five years are afflicted by VAD. Though frequently subclinical, VAD often leads to clinically significant manifestations in children (such as xerophthalmia, keratomalacia, blindness, impaired growth and development, vulnerability to infections, poor wound healing), with far-reaching consequences in terms of both morbidity and mortality.

In view of the above, the WHO endorses the practice of periodically providing prophylactic vitamin A supplementation (VAS) in high doses to children under five in settings where VAD is a public health problem. Childhood VAD has long been recognized as an important but controllable public health problem in India. In fact, recent evidence suggests…

### Short-term, moderate dosage vitamin E supplementation may have no effect on platelet aggregation, coagulation profile, and bleeding time in healthy individuals [^117EZwn6]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2006). Low credibility.

The objective was to investigate the in vivo effect of short-term, moderate dosage synthetic dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate supplementation on platelet aggregation, coagulation profile, and simulated bleeding time in healthy individuals. Alpha-tocopherol is the most biologically active isomer of vitamin E, traditionally promoted as an antioxidant and therapeutic agent in cardiovascular disease. In vitro studies have suggested that alpha-tocopherol plays a role in the inhibition of platelet aggregation; however, further investigations into the effect of alpha-tocopherol on bleeding in vivo have not duplicated these findings.

Materials and methods: A total of 42 healthy volunteers complied with a 2-week abstinence period from the use of anti-platelet agents followed by the determination of baseline platelet aggregation properties and coagulation studies using citrated whole blood. Moderate dosage vitamin E (800 IU of dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate) was then self-administered for 14 days with reevaluation of platelet aggregation and coagulation profile, and simulated bleeding time after 14 days of vitamin E supplementation.

Results: Forty subjects completed the 4-week study period. All 40 subjects demonstrated normal baseline coagulation studies, and all had collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation assessment performed in triplicate. After vitamin E supplementation, no significant difference was demonstrated in any study parameter.

Conclusions: Dietary supplementation with moderate dosage synthetic dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate did not significantly prolong bleeding or platelet aggregation in healthy individuals.

### Non-specific effects of standard measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 months of age on childhood mortality: Randomised controlled trial [^114Vv9Xg]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

The study covered six contiguous districts in Bissau, and participants were enrolled by the same team at the three health centres covering these districts. The beneficial effect of early measles vaccination tended to be largest in Cuntum, which had not taken part in the first trial of vitamin A supplementation at birth. We adjusted the main results for district by stratification; web table D shows unadjusted estimates. Little difference existed between adjusted and unadjusted estimates.

### Estimating national-level measles case-fatality ratios in low-income and middle-income countries: an updated systematic review and modelling study [^116YeLJS]. The Lancet Global Health (2023). High credibility.

We extracted the following data from each study: number of measles cases, number of measles deaths, study year, age, geographical location, and setting (hospital vs. community; outbreak vs. non-outbreak). If reported in the study, we also extracted laboratory confirmation of cases and the length of time required after the onset of rash for a death to be considered attributable to measles. Data were extracted in a Microsoft Excel 2016 workbook. For each study, we computed annual age-specific case-fatality ratios (CFRs); we included all suspected measles cases and considered all deaths within 30 days of rash onset unless cases or acute deaths were defined otherwise in individual studies.

On Nov 29, 2022, to determine the evidence available to assess CFRs during the COVID-19 pandemic, we ran our search again for publications from Jan 1, 2020, to Nov 28, 2022, using the same search string and inclusion and exclusion criteria for screening articles.

- **Data analysis**: An overview of our entire covariate selection and modelling process can be found in the appendix (p. 37). Previous work identified measles incidence and age to be crucial covariates when assessing measles CFR. We also selected additional covariates to analyse on the basis of a literature review and expert consultation that identified five possible underlying mechanisms contributing to systematic increases or decreases in measles CFR (i.e. health-system access and care-seeking behaviors, health-system quality, nutritional status, measles control and epidemiology, and risk of secondary infection) and related population-level indicators.

### Measles vaccination in the presence or absence of maternal measles antibody: Impact on child survival [^1123yqPT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

Trial diagrams for trial I and trial II are shown in the study.

- **Trial I: Early 2-dose MV and vitamin A trial, 1993–1995**: Twenty-seven of 150 (18%) children who received MV at 6 months had detectable measles antibody (Table 1). Between 6 months and 5 years of age, 16 children died. All had undetectable measles antibody levels at 6 months of age; 13 died after the second dose of MV at 9 months of age and before 5 years of age. Among early MV recipients, vaccination in the presence of measles antibody versus vaccination in the absence of measles antibody was associated with significant survival benefits (MRR, 0 [95% CI, 0–.52]; p = 0.048, log-rank test; Table 2). No child died of measles infection. The effect was similar for children receiving VAS or placebo with MV (data not shown). In contrast, among IPV recipients, vaccination in presence of measles antibody was not associated with benefits (MRR, 1.74 [95% CI, .57–5.34]).

	- **Table 1**: Mortality until 60 months of age in relation to the presence of maternal measles antibody at the time of measles vaccination.

	- **Table 2**: Mortality between 6 months and 5 years of age according to presence of maternal measles antibodies at time of randomization to measles vaccine or inactivated polio vaccine at 6 months of age (Trial I a).

- **Trial II: Early 2-dose trial, 2003–2007**: Among 450 children given MV at 4.5 months of age, 249 (55%) had measles antibody (Table 1). Controlled for age, children with measles antibody at measles vaccination had significantly lower mortality until 5 years of age than children without measurable measles antibody.

### Protective efficacy of standard Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccination in infants aged 4.5 months: interim analysis of a randomised clinical trial [^116uXJ3F]. BMJ (2008). Low credibility.

The major outbreak of measles occurred in an area that has had intense vaccination activities for many years. Mobility is high in this urban area, and even though we have maintained over 90% coverage, many children move away and other unvaccinated older children may have moved in. We did try to prevent an outbreak by recommending more general vaccination in connection with a vitamin A and missing vaccination campaign carried out by local health authorities in November 2003. The international organizations emphasized that international policy for measles vaccination was vaccination before 12 months of age and that infants only less than 12 months of age were to receive the measles vaccine.

The epidemiology of measles may have changed fundamentally in recent years. To our knowledge, no study has documented an incidence of 18.6% before 9 months of age in an area with high vaccination coverage. Measles is still a severe disease. The case fatality was high despite intensive surveillance, home visits, follow-up by doctors, and free treatment at the hospital. Many low-income countries have had high coverage for measles vaccination for the past 20 years, since the universal childhood immunization activities in the mid-1980s, which reached even the remotest parts of Africa. Increasing numbers of mothers have been immunized in childhood, and re-exposure to the virus may have been limited. Therefore, newborn infants will have lower antibody levels and are likely to become susceptible to measles infection and responsive to measles vaccination.

### The impact of different doses of vitamin A supplementation on male and female mortality. A randomised trial from Guinea-Bissau [^117Fct3r]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) given to children above six months of age may reduce overall mortality in low-income countries by 23–30%. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends high-dose VAS at immunization contacts after six months of age. Children between six and twelve months are advised a dose of 100,000 IU, and children older than twelve months, a dose of 200,000 IU, every four to six months.

The reduction in mortality is assumed to be due to the treatment and prevention of vitamin A deficiency (VAD). However, this may not be the only explanation. Routine vaccines during childhood have been shown to have non-specific effects on overall mortality. While the live BCG and measles vaccine seem to confer protection against diseases other than the targeted diseases, the inactivated diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine has been associated with increased overall mortality in girls. Our group hypothesized that the effect of VAS on mortality may depend on an amplification of the non-specific effects of the vaccines. If this is true, a high dose of vitamin A would not necessarily be better than a low dose, especially for girls who were also receiving DTP.

Previous trials have indicated that a lower dose of vitamin A might be more beneficial than a higher dose in reducing mortality and morbidity. One of the first randomized vitamin A trials used small weekly doses of vitamin A instead of a high-dose supplement, and that study found the strongest beneficial effect of vitamin A supplementation. In a trial comparing children who received 25,000 IU or 1.

### What is the appropriate intravenous dose of vitamin E for very-low-birth-weight infants [^115yimHP]. Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

The Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has endorsed 1 to 2 mg/dl as the normal range of serum tocopherol level. Our Cochrane review has shown that vitamin E supplementation resulting in levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl can produce adverse effects if maintained for more than a week. A fixed daily intravenous dose of vitamin E results in an inverse relationship between serum level and birth weight, posing a risk for both low and high serum tocopherol levels. Thus, a dose adjusted for weight appears more judicious than a fixed dose per day. Based on currently available data, the AAP and the American Society for Clinical Nutrition currently recommend a routine intake of 2 ml/kg/day of MVI Pediatric (2.8 IU/kg/day) in very-low-birth-weight infants, with a maximum of 5 ml/day or 7 IU/day.

Warn patients who are on corticosteroids to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and to alert their healthcare provider immediately if they are exposed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Alterations in cardiovascular/renal function**: Inform patients and/or caregivers that Emflaza can cause an increase in blood pressure and water retention. If this occurs, dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Behavioral and mood disturbances**: Advise patients and/or caregivers about the potential for severe behavioral and mood changes with Emflaza and encourage them to seek medical attention if psychiatric symptoms develop [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Decreases in bone mineral density**: Advise patients and/or caregivers about the risk of osteoporosis with prolonged use of Emflaza, which can predispose the patient to vertebral and long bone fractures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Ophthalmic effects**: Inform patients and/or caregivers that Emflaza may cause cataracts or glaucoma and advise monitoring if corticosteroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Vaccination**: Advise patients and/or caregivers to bring immunizations up-to-date according to immunization guidelines prior to starting therapy with Emflaza. Live-attenuated or live vaccines should be administered at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting Emflaza. Inform patients and/or caregivers that they may receive concurrent vaccinations with use of Emflaza, except for live-attenuated or live vaccines.

### Wainua [^111cqoBz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Supplement with the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. Refer to an ophthalmologist if ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency occur.

Wainua treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Supplementation at the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A is advised for patients taking Wainua. Higher doses than the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A should not be given to try to achieve normal serum vitamin A levels during treatment with Wainua, as serum vitamin A levels do not reflect the total vitamin A in the body. Patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist if they develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency, such as night blindness or dry eyes.

### Effect of early two-dose measles vaccination on childhood mortality and modification by maternal measles antibody in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa: A single-centre open-label randomised controlled trial [^117UoehT]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

The randomized controlled trial (RCT) was initiated in August 2011 at the Bandim Health Project (BHP), Guinea-Bissau, a Health and Demographic Surveillance System site covering six districts with 100,000 inhabitants. Residents have a unique identification number in the databases, and socio-economic and demographic information can be retrieved from these databases. Houses are visited monthly to register new pregnancies and deliveries. Among women of fertile age, 7% are HIV-1 or HIV-2 positive. Information on birth weight is not available for all, but at the national hospital, approximately 16–17% of BHP children have a birth weight under 2500 g (unpublished data).

Children aged 0–2 years are visited at home every 3–4 months to collect information on vaccinations, breastfeeding, infections, hospitalizations, and survival. Three health centers provide routine vaccinations in the BHP area. In 2011, the vaccination program included bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) plus oral polio vaccine (OPV) at birth, three doses of DTP-containing pentavalent vaccine (Penta) plus OPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks, and measles vaccine (MV) and yellow fever vaccine at 9 months of age. Children from the BHP area aged 4–7.5 months were eligible four weeks after Penta3.

We previously observed no effect of early MV after neonatal vitamin A supplementation (NVAS). NVAS is not routine in Guinea-Bissau, but we asked for and excluded children who had received NVAS (n = 0). Children with severe malformations, those needing hospitalization, or those who were severely malnourished (mid-upper-arm circumference < 115 mm) were not enrolled but referred for treatment.

### The role of vitamin E in thermal burn injuries, infection, and sepsis: A review [^1131fmv3]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2022). Low credibility.

Benefits of vitamin E for regulating infection have also been demonstrated in clinical human studies, including pneumonia. Shen et al. studied 183 patients with stroke-associated pneumonia who were untreated or treated with low-dose (50 mg/d) or high-dose (100 mg/d) vitamin E. CD47 and CD55 levels, markers for neutrophil migration and activation, were measured in whole blood on the second day after admission and the day before patient discharge. Although CD55 levels did not differ between groups, CD47 levels increased after administration of vitamin E compared with patients receiving no treatment, with the highest levels seen in patients treated with high-dose vitamin E. The hospitalization time was also shorter for patients treated with vitamin E, leading to better clinical outcomes.

Vitamin E has also been shown to lower pneumonia rates in smoking adults. In a study by Hemila et al, male smokers aged 50 to 69 years old were administered 50 mg of vitamin E per day for 5 to 8 years, and the incidence of hospital-treated, community-acquired pneumonia was measured at the end of the study. Among 2,216 patients who smoked 5 to 19 cigarettes a day, the incidence of pneumonia was reduced by 69% in patients receiving vitamin E and prevented pneumonia in 12.9% of patients receiving vitamin E. Among 5,253 patients who smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day, the incidence of pneumonia in patients taking vitamin E supplements was lowered by 14%, indicating vitamin E may lower infection rates.

In two different studies, smokers known to have an increase in oxidative stress had better infectious outcomes.

### Vitamin A supplementation and risk of atopy: Long-term follow-up of a randomized trial of vitamin A supplementation at six and nine months of age [^115f9KUK]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization recommends high-dose vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for children above six months of age in low-income countries. VAS has been associated with the up-regulation of the Th2 response. We aimed to determine if VAS is associated with atopy in childhood.

- **Methods**: Infants in Guinea-Bissau were randomly allocated VAS or placebo, either at six and nine months of age or only at nine months of age. At six months of age, children were furthermore randomized to receive either the measles vaccine or the inactivated polio vaccine. At nine months of age, all children received the measles vaccine. Children were revisited seven years later, and skin prick testing was performed. Atopy was defined as a skin prick reaction ≥ 3 mm.

- **Results**: 40 of 263 children (15%) were atopic. Overall, VAS had no significant effect on the risk of atopy (Prevalence Ratio 1.23; 95% CI 0.69–2.18). The Prevalence Ratio was 1.60 (0.66–3.90) for males and 1.00 (0.46–2.15) for females.

- **Conclusions**: There was no significant effect of VAS in infancy on atopy later in childhood. The role of infant VAS in the development of atopy is still unclear.

### The clinical significance of measles: a review [^1177PU96]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Forty years after effective vaccines were licensed, measles continues to cause death and severe disease in children worldwide. Complications from measles can occur in almost every organ system. Pneumonia, croup, and encephalitis are common causes of death; encephalitis is the most common cause of long-term sequelae. Measles remains a common cause of blindness in developing countries. Complication rates are higher in those over 20 years old, although croup and otitis media are more common in those under 2 years old, while encephalitis occurs more frequently in older children and adults. Complication rates are increased by immune deficiency disorders, malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, intense exposures to measles, and lack of previous measles vaccination. Case-fatality rates have decreased with improvements in socioeconomic status in many countries but remain high in developing countries.

### Severe measles, vitamin A deficiency, and the Roma community in Europe [^112XiDZy]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

To the Editor: The Roma community in Europe is a subgroup of the Romani people, whose origins are in northern India and who have been known in English-speaking countries as "gypsies". Measles outbreaks, including severe cases, were reported in the European Roma community during 2008–2010. We describe the potential roles of malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency as risk factors for severe measles in adults from this community.

In Europe, more than 25,000 cases of measles, more than half of which occurred in France, were reported during a 2011 outbreak. The exact proportion of measles cases occurring among the Roma community in France during the outbreak is not available. Measles epidemiology has changed; the disease now mainly affects children under one year old and young adults, the latter of whom are mostly unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. Roma people in Europe experience some of the worst health conditions in the industrialized world: they live in overcrowded conditions and have limited access to prevention programs and healthcare services. In such populations, deficiencies of vitamins, such as A, C, and E, have been reported. Vitamin A deficiency has been associated with severe cases of measles in children in developing countries. At the time of writing, we did not find published data associating vitamin A deficiency with severe measles among adults. We describe six adults from the Roma community in Marseille, France, who had measles and low levels of vitamin A; two of these persons had severe measles.

Case-patients 1 and 2 were men who were 21 and 25 years of age, respectively.

### Vitamin a supplementation and BCG vaccination at birth in low birthweight neonates: two by two factorial randomized controlled trial [^116WJDqw]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

We conducted stratified analyses by season, vaccination status, age at enrollment, and weight group. Owing to the special policy on BCG vaccination for low birthweight neonates — that is, children should receive a BCG vaccination at a local health center when the child has gained weight or when the child is due to receive the DTP vaccine and the oral polio vaccine at 6 weeks of age — there was large variation in the timing and sequence of vaccinations. The children in our study had 20 different vaccination statuses during the 12-month follow-up.

Although many children received the vaccines in the recommended sequence — that is, BCG before the DTP vaccine — many received vaccines out of sequence, such as BCG with the DTP vaccine or DTP vaccine before BCG. Deviations from the recommended schedule were more frequent in children outside the Bandim Health Project study area where health centers are not covered by the Bandim Health Project staff. All analyses of vaccine status were, therefore, adjusted for the Bandim Health Project study area.

At 4 weeks of age, only 11% of the children in the control group had received the BCG vaccination. Therefore, we undertook an analysis of the effect of vitamin A supplementation by randomization to "early BCG" or "no early BCG" at birth in children between 0 and 4 weeks of age. The effect of vitamin A supplementation after DTP vaccination was studied by following up the children from the date of the first registered DTP vaccination until death, migration, measles vaccination, or 12 months.

### Variability in the dose of intravenous vitamin E given to very low birth weight infants [^115WWn2U]. Journal of Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Vitamin E is required by very low birth weight (VLBW) infants to prevent vitamin E deficiency. However, prolonged intravenous intakes of vitamin E greater than 4 international units (IU)/kg/day often result in potentially toxic serum tocopherol levels. This study was designed to assess the frequency of potentially inadequate or excessive doses of intravenous vitamin E in parenteral nutrition for VLBW infants in the U.S.

- **Study design**: A questionnaire was sent to the 100 neonatal-perinatal training program centers listed in the 2003 directory of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Using the information provided for each neonatal unit, we calculated the doses of vitamin E (IU/kg/day) that would have been given to infants with body weights of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 kg in that unit. The doses were then recorded as inadequate if they were less than the recommended 2.8 IU/kg/day (maximum of 7 IU/day) by the American Society for Clinical Nutrition and the AAP, and excessive if more than 4 IU/kg/day. Frequencies were compared using chi-squared analysis.

- **Results**: The 65 centers that responded were predominantly among those offering the highest level of subspecialty neonatal intensive care (level IIID). The predicted dose of vitamin E had a median value of 2.8 IU/kg/day for all three weights and was not significantly different among the three weights. VLBW infants with weights of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 kg were predicted to receive doses greater than 4 IU/kg/day in 40%, 31%, and 10% of the NICUs, respectively.

### Non-specific effects of standard measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 months of age on childhood mortality: Randomised controlled trial [^116zrXZm]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

This is one of the first trials of childhood vaccination with individual randomisation to measure the effect of a vaccine on all-cause mortality. We had hypothesised a 25% reduction in mortality between 4.5 and 36 months of age but observed only a 22% (95% confidence interval −5% to 41%) reduction, which was not statistically significant in the intention-to-treat analysis. The per-protocol analysis suggested a 30% (6% to 48%) reduction in mortality. Among the secondary outcomes, the reduction in mortality between 4.5 and 36 months of age was statistically significant for girls in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. We did not find this effect for boys, but the difference in effect between girls and boys was not statistically significant. The study was not powered to test significant differential effects between subgroups in the secondary analyses. The analysis of possible interactions with other trials and campaigns suggested that vitamin A supplementation at birth may have a negative influence on the effect of early measles vaccination.

- **Strengths and weaknesses**: This is the first trial designed to test a non-specific beneficial effect of the measles vaccine that may provide some support for such effects, at least for girls. We have conducted one previous trial of the two-dose measles vaccine with the same objective, but it did not yield similar results; this lack of effect was probably because we had not controlled for the effect of subsequent DTP vaccinations. To prevent this problem in this trial, we stipulated that the children should have received the…

### Effect of vitamin A supplementation on measles-specific antibody levels in Guinea-Bissau [^116GSGEz]. Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

We have previously reported that vitamin A supplementation with the measles vaccine at age 9 months increases measles-specific antibody concentrations in children at age 18 months compared with placebo. We examined these children when they reached age 6–8 years. Fewer vitamin A-supplemented children had non-protective antibody concentrations (p = 0.0095); among children with protective antibody levels, vitamin A-supplemented children tended to have higher geometric mean antibody titres (p = 0.09). Thus, the simultaneous administration of vitamin A and the measles vaccine at age 9 months had a long-term effect on measles-specific antibody levels and may contribute to improved measles control in less-developed countries.

### Severe measles, vitamin A deficiency, and the Roma community in Europe [^112jM3EF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Serum vitamin A concentrations do not always reflect total vitamin A stores. In severe protein–calorie malnutrition, and during inter-infection, serum retinol levels could be artificially low due to a decrease in retinol-binding protein levels. However, the diagnosis of vitamin A deficiency is typically supported by low serum vitamin A levels and normal levels of retinol-binding protein, as observed in at least one of the case-patients reported here.

Vitamin A deficiency affects the severity of illness and increases the mortality rate related to measles. It is known to induce severe measles-related complications in children, delaying recovery and promoting conditions such as xerophthalmia, corneal ulcer, and blindness. Acute measles precipitates vitamin A deficiency by depleting stores and increasing utilization, leading to more severe ocular injuries. Vitamin A supplementation in children with measles has been associated with improved outcomes. Although it is premature to establish a definitive link between vitamin A deficiency and severe measles in adults, such an association is possible. Adults with low levels of vitamin A, although not initially infected with measles, could be at higher risk for more severe disease if they contract the virus.

In conclusion, all adults with measles should be evaluated for vitamin A levels and retinol-binding protein.

### Serum retinol and beta-carotene levels in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis [^112WY7xW]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Reduced serum levels of vitamin A affect morbidity and mortality in measles. The authors' newly diagnosed subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (n = 21) and age-matched control groups (n = 20) had mean serum beta-carotene levels of 1.12 ± 0.56 and 1.50 ± 0.52 microg/mL, respectively. Serum retinol < 20 microg/dL was observed in 6 of 21 subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and 0 of 20 control cases (P < .05). Vitamin A deficiency can accompany subacute sclerosing panencephalitis; its contribution to the pathogenesis or course of the disease warrants further investigation.

### An update and review of measles for emergency physicians [^1112UnBu]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

It is vital for frontline emergency physicians to immediately recognize the signs and symptoms of measles to initiate appropriate therapy and prevent spread to the health care team and other patients.

- **Objective**: This review serves as a clinically practical updated reference for when the differential diagnosis includes measles.

- **Discussion**: Measles is a highly contagious illness that classically presents with a rash, fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis. Cases in the United States since 2000 have been attributed mainly to travelers who are infected abroad and then spread the illness to small, susceptible populations within the United States. Complications from measles are relatively common and can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Clinical suspicion should be confirmed with laboratory testing, which is most commonly a serum immunoglobulin M. The management of measles is mainly supportive. Patients that require more aggressive management include those who are pregnant, immunocompromised, or unvaccinated. Treatment may consist of the measles vaccine, intravenous immunoglobulin, vitamin A, and even ribavirin. Additionally, special precautions are required by hospital workers to help prevent the spread of the virus, which include N-95 masks and patient isolation in an airborne infection isolation room.

- **Conclusion**: Emergency physicians must be readily able to identify, contain patients with suspected measles, and determine who will need further medical management for this potentially life-threatening illness.

### Vitamin E supplementation for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants [^113pQKfy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Treating very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with pharmacologic doses of vitamin E as an antioxidant agent has been proposed for preventing or limiting retinopathy of prematurity, intracranial hemorrhage, hemolytic anemia, and chronic lung disease. However, excessive doses of vitamin E may result in side effects.

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of vitamin E supplementation on morbidity and mortality in preterm infants.

We searched MEDLINE (October 2002), EMBASE (March 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) from the Cochrane Library, 2003, Issue 1, and personal files for clinical trials assessing vitamin E in preterm infants. Trials were selected if they analyzed primary outcomes (mortality or combined long-term morbidity) or secondary outcomes (other morbidity) in infants with gestational age less than 37 weeks or birth weight less than 2500 grams. The intervention involved allocation to routine supplementation with vitamin E in the treatment group versus placebo, no treatment, or another type, dose, or route of administration of vitamin E.

We used standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Twenty-six randomized clinical trials fulfilled entry criteria. No study assessed combined long-term morbidity. Routine vitamin E supplementation significantly reduced the risk of germinal/intraventricular hemorrhage (typical relative risk [RR] 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73, 0.99), increased the.

### Effects of evolocumab on vitamin E and steroid hormone levels: Results from the 52-week, phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled DESCARTES study [^115RT5qN]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin E transport and steroidogenesis are closely associated with low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) metabolism, and evolocumab can lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to low levels.

- **Objective**: To determine the effects of evolocumab on vitamin E and steroid hormone levels.

- **Methods and results**: After titration of background lipid-lowering therapy per cardiovascular risk, 901 patients with an LDL-C ≥ 2.0 mmol/L were randomized to 52 weeks of monthly, subcutaneous evolocumab, or placebo. Vitamin E, cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and gonadal hormones were analyzed at baseline and week 52. In a substudy (n = 100), vitamin E levels were also measured in serum, LDL, high-density lipoprotein, and red blood cell membranes at baseline and week 52. Absolute vitamin E decreased in evolocumab-treated patients from baseline to week 52 by 16% but increased by 19% when normalized for cholesterol. In the substudy, vitamin E level changes from baseline to week 52 mirrored the changes in the lipid fraction, and red blood cell membrane vitamin E levels did not change. Cortisol in evolocumab-treated patients increased slightly from baseline to week 52, but adrenocorticotropic hormone and the cortisol:adrenocorticotropic hormone ratio did not change. No patient had a cortisol:adrenocorticotropic hormone ratio < 3.0 (nmol/pmol). Among evolocumab-treated patients, gonadal hormones did not change from baseline to week 52. Vitamin E and steroid changes were consistent across subgroups by minimum postbaseline LDL-C < 0.4 and < 0.6 mmol/L.

- **Conclusions**: As expected, vitamin E levels changed significantly in response to treatment.

### Non-specific effects of standard measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 months of age on childhood mortality: Randomised controlled trial [^116YCZa6]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

From the perspective of a randomised trial, this study had several limitations, the most important of which was the lack of blinding of the vaccination status. Mothers bring children's vaccination cards to consultations within the study area to facilitate identification and because it entitles their children to free consultations and essential drugs. However, the health workers, doctors, and nurses in the paediatric ward and at the health centres do not inspect the vaccination cards of sick children to guide the treatment, and they were not aware of the purpose of the study. Their clinical decisions are thus unlikely to have affected survival in a systematic way to the benefit of children who had received the measles vaccine early. If vaccination status had affected treatment practice, it should also have affected the survival of children who had received the measles vaccine at 4.5 months of age and vitamin A supplementation at birth, as the randomisation to vitamin A supplementation or placebo was blind. As this was not the case, we have no reason to think that biased clinical decisions affected the outcome of the trial.

### Interventions for improving coverage of childhood immunisation in low- and middle-income countries [^115XUWWC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

We created 11 summary of findings (SoF) tables comparing various interventions to routine care or placebo for key outcomes. These outcomes included the proportion of children who received DTP3/Penta3 by one year of age, all recommended vaccines by two years of age, as well as specific vaccines under study such as BCG, OPV3, HBV3, and the measles vaccine. Additionally, we examined the proportion of children who received a combination of vaccines (BCG + DTP3 + OPV), those who had received at least one vaccine, and children under five years of age fully immunised with all scheduled vaccines. Furthermore, we assessed the occurrence of vaccine-preventable diseases, the cost of the intervention as reported in two studies, and any adverse events.

The findings are presented across several tables: Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, and Table 11.

Two review authors assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Data for key interventions were entered into the GRADEpro GDT software, and the certainty of evidence for each outcome was evaluated against five criteria: risk of bias, consistency, precision, publication bias, and directness. The certainty for RCT-reported outcomes was judged as 'high' or was downgraded to 'moderate' or 'low'.

### Vitamin A in children hospitalized for measles in a high-income country [^116jW8gP]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Worldwide, medical authorities recommend vitamin A supplementation for severe measles requiring hospitalization; however, evidence supporting its use in high-income countries is lacking. A nationwide vitamin A shortage reported during a recent measles outbreak in Italy provided an opportunity to test the effectiveness of vitamin A in a high-income setting, approximating an unbiased allocation.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective controlled cohort study involving children admitted for measles to a tertiary-care hospital in Southern Italy. The primary outcome was the duration of fever. Secondary outcomes included the length of hospitalization, rate of complications, need for antibiotic treatment, and body temperature.

- **Results**: A total of 108 inpatient children (36% female, median age 16.3 months) were enrolled; 36 received two doses of oil-based vitamin A according to age, and 72 matched controls received standard care. There were no significant differences between the study groups in the duration of fever (7.03 ± 2.67 vs. 6.82 ± 3.27, P = 0.72), length of hospitalization (median, 5.0 vs. 5.0 days, P = 0.50), maximum body temperature (median, 39°C in both groups, P = 0.23), rate of organ (69.4% vs. 63.9%, P = 0.72) and hematologic complications (41.7% vs. 59.7%, P = 0.12), or need for antibiotic treatment (66.7% vs. 61.1%, P = 0.72). Overall, vitamin A supplementation did not reduce the risk of any complications (relative risk, 1.33; 95% confidence intervals: 0.59–2.96).

- **Conclusion**: Vitamin A does not change the clinical course of measles infection.

### Severe measles, vitamin A deficiency, and the Roma community in Europe [^115FPF9Q]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Case-patients 1 and 2 had vitamin A deficiency with values of 0.31 mg/L and 0.2 mg/L, respectively (reference range 0.5–0.8 mg/L). We measured vitamin A levels in blood samples from the next four consecutive hospitalized patients with measles, all of whom were from the Roma community. They did not have complications of measles but were hospitalized for infection-control reasons. All four patients had low levels of vitamin A (0.16–0.34 mg/L). In case-patient 4, the blood level of retinol-binding protein was 0.026 g/L (normal range 0.02–0.05 g/L), confirming vitamin A deficiency.

Vitamin A supplementation was administered intramuscularly as recommended by the World Health Organization (200,000 IU followed by a second dose the next day) to each patient. The six patients progressed to recovery. Low levels of vitamin A (0.36–0.46 mg/L) were also found in two other patients from the Roma community who did not have measles.

### Vitamin a supplementation and risk of atopy: long-term follow-up of a randomized trial of vitamin A supplementation at six and nine months of age [^114ELifL]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization recommends high-dose vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for children above six months of age in low-income countries. VAS has been associated with up-regulation of the Th2 response. We aimed to determine if VAS is associated with atopy in childhood.

- **Methods**: Infants in Guinea-Bissau were randomly allocated VAS or placebo, either at six and nine months of age or only at nine months of age. At six months of age, children were furthermore randomized to receive the measles vaccine or the inactivated polio vaccine. At nine months of age, all children received the measles vaccine. Children were revisited seven years later, and skin prick testing was performed. Atopy was defined as a skin prick reaction ≥ 3 mm.

- **Results**: Forty of 263 children (15%) were atopic. Overall, VAS had no significant effect on the risk of atopy (Prevalence Ratio 1.23; 95% CI 0.69–2.18). The Prevalence Ratio was 1.60 (0.66–3.90) for males and 1.00 (0.46–2.15) for females.

- **Conclusions**: There was no significant effect of VAS in infancy on atopy later in childhood. The role of infant VAS in the development of atopy is still unclear.

### Amvuttra [^1138ev9k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Reduced serum vitamin A levels and recommended supplementation: Supplement with the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. Refer to an ophthalmologist if ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

- **Reduced serum vitamin A levels and recommended supplementation**: AMVUTTRA treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels. Supplementation at the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A is advised for patients taking AMVUTTRA. Higher doses than the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A should not be given to try to achieve normal serum vitamin A levels during treatment with AMVUTTRA, as serum vitamin A levels do not reflect the total vitamin A in the body. Patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist if they develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency (e.g. night blindness).

### Asmanex [^111iXc9c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Immunosuppression and risk of infections**: Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or who are not properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.

Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract; untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.

### Mega doses of retinol: A possible immunomodulation in Covid-19 illness in resource-limited settings [^116wRZ9B]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

Of all the nutrients, vitamin A has been the most extensively evaluated for its impact on immunity. There are three main forms of vitamin A: retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid (RA), with the latter being the most biologically active and all-trans-RA (ATRA) its main derivative. Vitamin A is a key regulator of the functions of various innate and adaptive immune cells and promotes immune homeostasis. Importantly, it augments the interferon-based innate immune response to RNA viruses, decreasing RNA virus replication. Several clinical trials report decreased mortality in measles and Ebola with vitamin A supplementation.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, interventions such as convalescent plasma, antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, and immunomodulator drugs have been tried, but most of them are difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. The review explores the possibility of mega dose vitamin A as an affordable adjunct therapy for Covid-19 illness with minimal reversible side effects. Insight is provided into the effect of vitamin A on ACE-2 expression in the respiratory tract and its association with the prognosis of Covid-19 patients. Vitamin A supplementation may aid the generation of protective immune responses to Covid-19 vaccines. An overview of the dosage and safety profile of vitamin A is presented along with recommended doses for prophylactic/therapeutic use in randomized controlled trials in Covid-19 patients.

### Serum tocopherol levels in very preterm infants following a single dose of vitamin E at birth [^114PPrAV]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Our aim was to examine the impact of a single enteral dose of vitamin E on serum tocopherol levels. The study was undertaken to see whether a single dose of vitamin E soon after birth can rapidly increase the low α-tocopherol levels seen in very preterm infants. If so, this intervention could be tested as a means of reducing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.

- **Methods**: Ninety-three infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestation were included in a randomized controlled trial. They received one dose of either 50 IU or 100 IU of liquid vitamin E. Serum tocopherol concentrations were then measured at baseline (4–6 hours) and 24 hours after administration.

- **Results**: A significant increase in serum α-tocopherol levels was observed at 24 hours in both groups compared to baseline. However, 45% of infants did not achieve serum α-tocopherol levels > 0.5 mg/dL. A higher dose or several doses of vitamin E may be needed.

### Aquasol A [^1127drto]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **General precautions**: Protect from light. Prolonged daily dose administration over 25,000 units of vitamin A should be under close supervision. Blood level assays are not a direct measure of liver storage, and liver storage should be adequate before discontinuing therapy. Single vitamin A deficiency is rare, and multiple vitamin deficiencies are expected in any dietary deficiency.

- **Drug interactions**: Women on oral contraceptives have shown a significant increase in plasma vitamin A levels.

- **Carcinogenesis**: There are no studies that show that administration of vitamin A will cause or prevent cancer.

- **Pregnancy**: See contraindications section.

- **Nursing mothers**: The U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of vitamin A (5,000 units) is recommended for nursing mothers.

### Effect of an early dose of measles vaccine on morbidity between 18 weeks and 9 months of age: A randomized, controlled trial in Guinea-Bissau [^113Nu9fN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Vaccines are designed to induce immunity to specific diseases, but research has shown that vaccines may yield so-called nonspecific effects (NSEs) involving altered susceptibility to a variety of infectious diseases other than those targeted by the vaccine. Live vaccines, such as the measles vaccine (MV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV), may have beneficial NSEs and reduce overall mortality beyond what is expected from protection against their target diseases. In contrast, inactivated vaccines, such as the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, despite providing protection against the target diseases, have been associated with increased overall mortality.

The beneficial NSEs of MV have been tested in a randomized trial in Guinea-Bissau. In low-income countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends receiving MV at 9 months of age. This guideline is a compromise between avoiding interference with maternal antibodies, which reduce the antibody response to MV, and minimizing the risk of acquiring early measles virus infection. The Bandim Health Project (BHP) in Guinea-Bissau conducted a randomized trial (during 2003–2007) to test the NSEs of early MV receipt. Children aged 4.5 months were enrolled and followed until 36 months of age. The intervention group received 2 doses of MV (an early dose at 4.5 months of age and the recommended dose at 9 months of age). The control group received only the recommended dose at 9 months of age. The study showed a 22% reduction (95% confidence interval, −5%–41%) in mortality before 36 months of age.
