## Question

What evidence do we have for or against decolonizing the bladder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether we should "decolonize the bladder" and how to interpret the evidence and guidelines related to that decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "decolonizing the bladder" actually means in practice. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts where this question arises, such as asymptomatic bacteriuria, catheter-associated states, and peri-procedural urology. Next, I will review the direct evidence for or against decolonization strategies, followed by guideline positions. After that, I need to consider mechanistic and microbiome data that might argue for or against decolonization. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned approach and highlight knowledge gaps and exceptions where decolonization might be reasonable despite the general stance against it.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate concepts. "Decolonizing the bladder" is not a standard, well-defined intervention. In practice, it has meant attempting to eradicate bladder bacteria using antibiotics or antiseptics in settings like asymptomatic bacteriuria, catheter-associated bacteriuria, or before urologic procedures, and occasionally via catheter-directed antiseptic irrigation, but these are not equivalent strategies and carry different risk–benefit profiles [^112pqo7o] [^113urGRg] [^113G2cVE].

> Next, I should review the clinical contexts where this question typically arises. Hold on, let me verify the main buckets: asymptomatic bacteriuria in non-catheterized or catheterized patients, catheter-associated bacteriuria and CAUTI, peri-procedural urologic care, and recurrent UTI phenotypes; importantly, guidance differs by context, so I need to keep these separate as I appraise the evidence [^112pqo7o] [^112N2oob] [^1124Jurd] [^114PPdZE].

> I will now examine direct evidence for "decolonization" as antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Wait, let me verify the highest-quality guidance: multiple IDSA updates consistently recommend against screening for or treating ASB in most populations because benefits are unproven and harms, including resistance and C. difficile, are real. Exceptions are pregnancy and urologic procedures violating mucosa, where targeted pre-procedural therapy is advised, not routine decolonization of the bladder per se [^112pqo7o] [^114qsbPV] [^1124Jurd]. I should double-check the rationale: treatment of ASB does not reduce subsequent symptomatic UTI in most groups and increases resistance, which aligns with antimicrobial stewardship principles [^11183VFt] [^115K3ua3].

> Now, catheter-associated settings. Let me consider short-term indwelling catheters first. IDSA recommends against screening for or treating ASB with short-term catheters because biofilm dynamics make eradication transient at best; bacteriuria accrues at roughly 3–7% per catheter-day, so antibiotics may delay but do not prevent acquisition, and treatment selects for resistance without improving meaningful outcomes [^115cj212] [^112pqo7o]. For long-term catheters, patients are chronically bacteriuric with polymicrobial flora; decolonization is not feasible and is discouraged, reinforcing a focus on minimizing duration and using aseptic technique rather than attempting eradication [^116FLZgR] [^112N2oob].

> But wait, what about at catheter removal — does a short antibiotic course help? I should confirm the meta-analytic signal. A 2013 BMJ meta-analysis suggested that prophylaxis at removal reduced subsequent symptomatic UTI with an NNT around 17, yet the evidence was heterogeneous, not specific to those with documented ASB, and did not account for resistance or costs; IDSA frames this as a knowledge gap and does not endorse routine decolonization at removal, though some clinicians individualize in higher-risk surgical patients [^111qGc6S] [^116Doznh] [^112pqo7o]. Hold on, I should verify guideline nuance: IDSA notes potential benefit in some surgical cohorts but stops short of recommending universal prophylaxis at removal, reflecting uncertainty and stewardship concerns [^112pqo7o].

> Next, I should review peri-procedural urology, where "decolonization" is most defensible. For endoscopic urologic procedures with mucosal trauma, IDSA recommends screening for ASB and giving targeted, short-course prophylaxis 30–60 minutes pre-op; this is not routine bladder decolonization but risk-mitigation in a contaminated surgical field, and it is the clearest scenario where preemptive therapy is appropriate [^1124Jurd] [^1137PKjR]. Let me reconsider broader decolonization claims: ESCMID/EUCIC notes insufficient evidence for universal screening to guide decolonization before urologic surgery, though they support targeted perioperative prophylaxis in specific contexts like transrectal prostate biopsy when colonized with resistant organisms, again emphasizing narrow, procedure-specific use rather than blanket bladder decolonization [^115bXGVk] [^112C94ib].

> I need to check whether mechanical or antiseptic catheter irrigation counts as "decolonization". In vitro and practice-like models suggest antiseptic solutions such as polyhexanide may reduce biofilm burden on catheters, but clinical outcome data are lacking; major guidelines do not recommend routine antiseptic bladder irrigation to prevent CAUTI, reinforcing that this remains investigational rather than standard care [^113urGRg] [^113G2cVE]. Hmm, wait a minute, could local antiseptics help in select cases? Perhaps, but without robust clinical trials, this should not be adopted broadly outside research settings [^113G2cVE].

> Let me consider mechanistic and microbiome data that bear on the wisdom of decolonization. The bladder is not sterile, and disrupting urinary microbiota with antibiotics can impair colonization resistance and innate barriers, plausibly worsening susceptibility to pathogenic overgrowth; this argues against routine attempts to "decolonize" the bladder in chronic or recurrent UTI phenotypes unless there is a compelling, time-limited indication [^112AdFzm] [^114PPdZE]. I should confirm that current urology guidance also cautions against routine urinary microbiome testing in lower urinary tract symptom workups, underscoring that our knowledge of what to "decolonize" and how is still immature [^115fACRd] [^1152cCKk].

> Next, I should review what to do instead of decolonization. The strongest, most consistent levers to reduce catheter-associated harm are to avoid unnecessary catheters, use aseptic insertion, maintain closed systems, and remove catheters promptly. Reminder systems and nurse-driven removal protocols reduce CAUTI rates without increasing harm, and these are prioritized over antimicrobial decolonization strategies [^112N2oob] [^116pwLhh]. For long-term catheterized patients, modeling and observational data suggest optimizing urine flow and minimizing residual urine may influence bacteriuria dynamics more than attempting eradication, which again steers practice toward device management rather than decolonization [^111SkG17] [^1173uqr7].

> I should double-check special populations where decolonization might tempt us. In spinal cord injury and neurogenic bladder, guidelines recommend against screening or treating ASB, and they discourage routine prophylaxis. When recurrent UTIs persist despite optimizing technique and addressing urologic contributors, individualized prophylaxis may be considered, but this is not equivalent to bladder decolonization and should be framed as prevention, not eradication of colonization [^114fWK1J] [^112q6F2R]. In older adults, particularly in long-term care, overtreatment of ASB is common and harmful. Stewardship interventions that curb unnecessary cultures and antibiotics reduce low-value care without increasing adverse events, reinforcing that decolonization is usually inappropriate here [^111s8y5Z] [^112ACxBu].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overgeneralizing. The weight of evidence and guidelines indicates that routine "decolonization of the bladder" is not recommended in most clinical contexts because benefits are unproven, harms including resistance and adverse events are real, and alternative strategies centered on device stewardship, aseptic technique, and targeted peri-procedural prophylaxis are more effective and safer. Exceptions are narrow and procedure-specific, such as short-course, culture-directed prophylaxis before urologic procedures violating mucosa, and even there the intent is risk mitigation, not routine bladder decolonization [^112pqo7o] [^1124Jurd] [^1137PKjR].

> Finally, I should confirm practical guidance for clinicians facing requests to "clear the bladder". Educate patients that asymptomatic bacteriuria is common and usually benign, avoid screening urine in low-risk scenarios, do not treat ASB except in pregnancy or before high-risk urologic procedures, minimize catheter use and duration, and reserve any peri-removal antibiotic prophylaxis for carefully selected surgical patients after shared decision-making that acknowledges uncertain benefit and potential resistance costs. Document the rationale if deviating from guidelines in exceptional cases [^112pqo7o] [^112N2oob] [^116Doznh] [^111XFGV5].

There is **no evidence** to support routine bladder decolonization in non-catheterized patients, and **guidelines advise against** screening or treating asymptomatic bacteriuria except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures with mucosal trauma [^114qsbPV] [^1124Jurd]. In catheterized patients, decolonization is not recommended because biofilm-mediated bacteriuria is universal with indwelling devices and recurs quickly after antibiotics; instead, prioritize catheter removal or exchange and antimicrobial stewardship [^116FLZgR] [^113G2cVE]. For recurrent UTI, evidence is limited and mixed; non-antibiotic strategies (e.g. probiotics, cranberry) may help some, but **high-quality data are lacking** [^114PPdZE] [^113YqaxQ]. Overall, bladder decolonization is not supported outside specific procedural contexts due to lack of benefit, risk of resistance, and potential harm to the urinary microbiome [^111gDBjm] [^1124Jurd] [^114PPdZE].

## Evidence for bladder decolonization in non-catheterized patients

- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB)**: ASB is common and usually benign; screening and treatment are not recommended in non-pregnant, non-catheterized adults because they do not reduce symptomatic UTI and increase resistance and adverse events [^114qsbPV] [^11183VFt].

- **Recurrent UTI**: Evidence for decolonization to prevent recurrence is limited and mixed; non-antibiotic options (e.g. probiotics, cranberry) may help some, but high-quality data are lacking [^1122dnZP] [^113YqaxQ].

- **Guidelines**: IDSA recommends against routine screening or treatment of ASB in non-catheterized adults, except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures with mucosal trauma [^114qsbPV] [^1124Jurd].

---

## Evidence for bladder decolonization in catheterized patients

- **Biofilm formation**: Indwelling catheters develop biofilm rapidly, making bacteriuria universal with long-term use; antibiotics may delay but do not prevent recurrence after decolonization [^116FLZgR] [^115cj212].

- **Clinical outcomes**: Decolonization does not reduce symptomatic CAUTI or other clinically meaningful endpoints; guidelines recommend against screening or treating ASB in catheterized patients [^112pqo7o] [^113G2cVE].

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Decolonization promotes resistance; stewardship programs that reduce unnecessary treatment of ASB decrease resistance without increasing symptomatic infections [^111gDBjm] [^115wpVNC].

## Evidence for bladder decolonization in specific clinical scenarios

| **Clinical scenario** | **Evidence for decolonization** | **Guideline recommendations** |
|-|-|-|
| Pregnancy | Strong evidence supports screening and treating ASB to prevent pyelonephritis and preterm birth [^notfound]. | Strong recommendation for screening and treatment [^113nqUSu]. |
| Urologic procedures with mucosal trauma | Treating ASB before procedures reduces postoperative infections [^notfound]. | Strong recommendation to screen and treat before procedures [^1124Jurd] |
| Transrectal prostate biopsy | Rectal decolonization reduces infection risk [^notfound]. | Consider targeted decolonization [^notfound] |
| Long-term catheterization | No evidence supports decolonization; biofilm makes eradication unlikely [^115cj212]. | Do not screen or treat ASB [^112pqo7o] |
| Recurrent UTI | Limited, mixed evidence; non-antibiotic strategies may help some [^113YqaxQ]. | No strong recommendation; individualized care [^1166XZJb] |

---

## Potential risks and harms of bladder decolonization

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Decolonization drives resistance, including multidrug-resistant organisms [^111gDBjm].

- **Microbiome disruption**: Decolonization can disrupt the urinary microbiome, potentially increasing susceptibility to infection [^114PPdZE].

- **Adverse effects**: Antibiotics carry risks (e.g. C. difficile, allergic reactions) that may outweigh uncertain benefits [^115K3ua3].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

IDSA guidelines recommend against routine screening or treatment of **ASB** except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures with mucosal trauma [^111gDBjm] [^113nqUSu] [^1124Jurd]. ESCMID/EUCIC guidelines likewise find insufficient evidence to recommend routine decolonization in urologic surgery, except in selected contexts such as **transrectal prostate biopsy** [^115bXGVk] [^112C94ib]. Expert consensus emphasizes **antimicrobial stewardship** and avoiding unnecessary treatment of ASB to limit resistance and harm [^111gDBjm] [^112hWfHk].

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no evidence** to support routine bladder decolonization in non-catheterized patients, and **guidelines advise against** screening or treating ASB except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures with mucosal trauma [^114qsbPV] [^1124Jurd]. In catheterized patients, decolonization is not recommended because biofilm-mediated bacteriuria is universal with indwelling devices and recurs quickly after antibiotics; instead, prioritize catheter removal or exchange and antimicrobial stewardship [^116FLZgR] [^113G2cVE]. For recurrent UTI, evidence is limited and mixed; non-antibiotic strategies (e.g. probiotics, cranberry) may help some, but **high-quality data are lacking** [^1122dnZP] [^113YqaxQ]. Overall, bladder decolonization is not supported outside specific procedural contexts due to lack of benefit, risk of resistance, and potential harm to the urinary microbiome [^111gDBjm] [^1137PKjR] [^114PPdZE].

### Prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies [^111J6J4C]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There is a risk that people who have invasive urodynamic studies (cystometry) will develop urinary tract infections or bacteria in the urine or blood. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotics before or immediately after invasive cystometry or urodynamic studies is not without risks of adverse effects and emergence of resistant microbes.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering prophylactic antibiotics in reducing the risk of urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies. The hypothesis was that administering prophylactic antibiotics reduces urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trial Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2009), CINAHL (January 1982 to January 2009), EMBASE (January 1966 to January 2009), PubMed (1 January 1980 to January 2009), LILACS (up to January 2009), TRIP database (up to January 2009), and the UK NHS Evidence Health Information Resources (searched 10 December 2009). We searched the reference lists of relevant articles, the primary trials and the proceedings of the International Urogynaecological Association International Continence Society and the American Urological Association for the years 1999 to 2009 to identify articles not captured by electronic searches. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials comparing the use of prophylactic antibiotics versus a placebo or no treatment in patients having urodynamic studies were selected. Two authors (PL and RF) independently performed the selection of trials for inclusion and any disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Data Collection and Analysis

All assessments of the quality of trials and data extraction were performed independently by two authors of the review (PL and RF) using forms designed according to Cochrane guidelines. We attempted to contact authors of the included trials for any missing data. Data were extracted on characteristics of the study participants including details of previously administered treatments, interventions used, the methods used to measure infection and adverse events. Statistical analyses were performed according to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Data from intention-to-treat analyses were used where available. For the dichotomous data, results for each study were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and combined for meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel method. The primary outcome was urinary tract infection. Heterogeneity was assessed by the P value and I² statistic.

Main Results

Nine randomized controlled trials involving the prophylactic use of antibiotics in patients having urodynamic studies were identified and these included 973 patients in total; one study was an abstract. Two further trials were excluded from the review. The methods of the included trials were poorly described. The primary outcome in all trials was the rate of developing significant bacteriuria, defined as the presence of more than 100,000 bacteria per millilitre of a mid-stream urine sample on culture and sensitivity testing. The other outcomes included pyrexia, haematuria, dysuria and adverse reactions to antibiotics. The administration of prophylactic antibiotics when compared to a placebo reduced the risk of significant bacteriuria (4% with antibiotics versus 12% without, risk ratio (RR) 0.35, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.56) in both men and women. The administration of prophylactic antibiotics also reduced the risk of haematuria (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.91). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome, risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (40/201, 20% versus 59/214, 28%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.03); or in the risk of fever (RR 5.16, 95% CI 0.94 to 28.16) or dysuria (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.36). Only two of 135 people had an adverse reaction to the antibiotics. The number of patients needed to treat with antibiotics to prevent bacteriuria was 12.3. Amongst women, the number needed to treat to prevent bacteriuria was 13.4; while amongst men it was 9.1 (number needed to treat = 1/ absolute risk reduction).

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylactic antibiotics did reduce the risk of bacteriuria after urodynamic studies but there was not enough evidence to suggest that this effect reduced symptomatic urinary tract infections. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of fever, dysuria or adverse reactions. Potential benefits have to be weighed against clinical and financial implications, and the risk of adverse effects.

### Reducing treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria: what works? [^112hWfHk]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, but usually benign. Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria contributes to negative antimicrobial outcomes. Optimizing antimicrobial use for bacteriuria is a component of antimicrobial stewardship programs and includes key practices of dissemination and implementation of guidelines, laboratory practices which support stewardship, and programs to monitor and implement optimal antimicrobial treatment for urinary infection. These activities vary in their effectiveness, costs, and complexity to institute. Stewardship strategies targeting unique populations with a high prevalence of bacteriuria and for whom symptom assessment is not straightforward need to be further developed and evaluated to support optimal stewardship.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter [^111SkG17]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Urinary catheters are notoriously prone to colonisation by bacteria, with high societal and economic costs, yet the pathways by which colonisation occurs remain unclear and interventions to mitigate infection have shown mixed results. In this work, we present a quantitative mathematical model for the dynamics of urinary catheter colonisation that integrates bacterial population dynamics on the catheter surfaces and in the bladder with urine flow. Our model suggests explanations for the longstanding observations that some patients experience frequent infections while others do not, some infections develop more rapidly than others, sex and duration of catheterisation are key risk factors for CAUTI, and antimicrobial coatings show mixed efficacy.

Our model allows us to investigate which factors relating to the patient, bacterial strain, and catheter design influence clinically relevant outcomes for long-term and short-term catheterisation scenarios. These factors are embodied as model parameters. The most important finding of our study is that clinical outcomes for long-term and short-term catheterisation are controlled by different factors (as summarised in Table 2). Therefore, qualitatively different types of intervention may be needed to prevent infection for long-term vs short-term catheterised patients.

Long-term catheterisation is mimicked by simulating our model over several months, by which time the catheter is fully colonised and the model's behaviour no longer changes (it reaches a steady state). Here, we observe two distinct outcomes corresponding to abundant and non-abundant bacteria in the urine, which we term bacteriuria and no bacteriuria. The urine production rate emerges as a key factor that controls a transition between bacteriuria and no bacteriuria. Other parameters associated with the bladder — residual urine volume and bacterial growth rate in urine — are also relevant for this transition. Comparing the measured distribution of human urine production rates with our predicted threshold value for the bacteriuria — no bacteriuria transition suggests that ~70% of the population is susceptible to catheter-associated bacteriuria, potentially explaining observed differences in susceptibility to CAUTI among individual patients. The model also suggests that individuals might reduce their susceptibility by increasing fluid intake, hence increasing the rate of removal of bacteria from the bladder above the bacteriuria threshold. In fact, drinking more water is known to be protective against urinary tract infections. In non-catherised female patients with recurrent UTI, increasing water intake by 1.5 L per day was found to almost halve the mean number of cystitis incidents over 12 months.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for short-term catheter bladder drainage in adults [^112ovSna]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections account for about 40% of hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections, and about 80% of urinary tract infections acquired in hospital are associated with urinary catheters.

Objectives

To determine if certain antibiotic prophylaxes are better than others in terms of prevention of urinary tract infections, complications, quality of life and cost-effectiveness in short-term catheterisation in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in Process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 31st October 2012). Additionally, we examined all reference lists of identified trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing antibiotic prophylaxis for short-term (up to and including 14 days) catheterisation in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by all review authors and compared. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systemtic Reviews of Interventions. Where data had not been fully reported, clarification was sought directly from the authors of the trial.

Main Results

Six parallel-group randomised controlled trials with 789 participants met the inclusion criteria. All six trials compared antibiotic prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis. Studies presented a low to unclear risk of bias with similar interventions and measured outcomes. The primary outcome of bacteriuria was less common in the prophylaxis group amongst surgical patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria (I² = 0; risk ratio (RR) 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.31). Two non-surgical studies could not be combined in a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity and only one showed significantly fewer cases of bacteriuria (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.37). Two trials of surgical patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria only (255 participants) compared one type of antibiotic prophylaxis with another and neither study showed a significant difference in cases of bacteriuria. One study (78 participants) compared antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at catheterisation only versus antibiotic prophylaxis throughout catheterisation period with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Antibiotics at catheterisation only, resulted in significantly fewer cases of bacteriuria than giving prophylaxis throughout the catheterisation period (RR 0.29 95% CI 0.09 to 0.91). Secondary data of pyuria were provided by two surgical studies (255 participants). When studies were pooled, pyuria occurred in significantly fewer cases in the prophylactic antibiotic group (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.42). The number of gram-negative isolates in patients' urine just before catheter removal in one study (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.79) and six weeks after hospital discharge (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.56) were significantly lower. There were no events in the treatment group before catheter removal. When pooled data from two studies showed significantly reduced febrile morbidity in those receiving antibiotic prophylaxis (RR 0.53 95% CI 0.31 to 0.89). Although all studies assessed micro-organisms isolated from the urine specimens the data were too heterogenous to pool in a meta-analysis and have been provided in a narrative form. Further secondary data such as economic analysis, length of stay and quality of life were not covered in detail.

Authors' Conclusions

The limited evidence indicated that receiving prophylactic antibiotics reduced the rate of bacteriuria and other signs of infection, such as pyuria, febrile morbidity and gram-negative isolates in patients' urine, in surgical patients who undergo bladder drainage for at least 24 hours postoperatively. There was also limited evidence that prophylactic antibiotics reduced bacteriuria in non-surgical patients.

### Intracellular bacterial communities: a potential etiology for chronic lower urinary tract symptoms [^111hfoFD]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with persistent lower urinary tract symptoms and negative urine cultures are often difficult to treat. Infection may go undetected in these patients because the concentrations of bacteria in their urine are beneath the threshold of standard urine culture techniques. Empiric treatment may result in temporary relief, followed by recurrent symptoms. Occult and recurrent urinary tract infection may be due to both invasion of the bladder wall by uropathogenic Escherichia coli and the formation of biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities. This review examines emerging evidence for a role of intracellular bacterial communities in human infection.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter [^114WviFL]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter: schematic.

Bacteria grow and spread as a wave on the outside surface of the catheter. They then grow in the residual urine within the bladder, before being transported downwards by the flow within the catheter. Some bacteria attach to the inside of the catheter, where they grow and spread, eventually forming a biofilm.

Over long times (long-term catheterisation), our model shows two distinct alternative outcomes with high versus low bacterial abundance in the urine, which we associate with bacteriuria versus no bacteriuria. Which of these clinical outcomes is obtained depends on the rate of urine production by the kidneys, as well as the volume of residual urine and the bacterial growth rate in urine. Varying the urine production rate in a range close to the typical human value can cause a transition between bacteriuria and no bacteriuria. This suggests a possible explanation for why some individuals are much more susceptible to catheter colonisation than others and points to increasing fluid intake as a potentially effective strategy to avoid bacteriuria in long-term catheterised patients. In contrast, for short-time simulations, mimicking short-duration catheterisation, the clinical outcome depends on whether the catheter is removed before bacteria have time to colonise the bladder. Therefore, the model prediction for the time before bacteriuria occurs is clinically relevant. Our model shows that this time is controlled by a different set of factors — the catheter length and the growth and mobility of bacteria on the catheter surface. This may help to explain why sex is a strong risk factor for CAUTI. This result also suggests that antimicrobial coatings, which alter bacterial growth dynamics on the catheter surface, may be effective for some, but not all, short-term catheterised patients, potentially helping to explain apparently contradictory results of clinical trials for antimicrobial coatings. Our model also hints that the spatial pattern of bacterial biofilm growth on the catheter might provide clues about the source of CAUTI infections.

Innovative approaches to reduce the incidence of CAUTI are much needed, since there have been few effective improvements in urinary catheter design since the invention of the Foley catheter in the 1930s. Our study indicates how mathematical models could help guide innovation. Specifically, our results suggest a need for targeted intervention strategies for different patient categories. For short-term catheterisation, bacteria on the catheter surface should be targeted, e.g. via antimicrobial surface coatings. For long-term catheterisation, however, interventions should instead focus on increasing urine production rate or reducing residual urine volume.

### Screening for bladder cancer: rationale, limitations, whom to target, and perspectives [^112Ko8pr]. European Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Bladder cancer (BCa) is the fourth most common cancer in men. Survival from the disease has not improved in the last 25 yr. Population-based screening theoretically provides the best opportunity to improve the outcomes of aggressive BCa.

Objective

To review the current literature regarding the usefulness and feasibility of screening for bladder cancer.

Evidence Acquisition

We conducted a nonsystematic review restricted to English using the keywords urinary bladder neoplasms, mass screening, mandatory testing, and early detection of cancer. We retrieved 184 articles and selected 22.

Evidence Synthesis

There was no level 1 evidence (obtained from a randomised controlled trial [RCT]) addressing the impact of screening on BCa survival or tumour downstaging. No study assessed the diagnostic performance of urinary markers in the context of screening. Two case-control series suggested a benefit of screening on survival, and a third found a nonsignificant beneficial trend in favour of screening. Two studies suggested downstaging of BCa at diagnosis. Other reports concluded that most cancers detected with screening were of low grade and that current urinary testing cannot detect all tumours. Screening is likely to be of benefit in high-risk populations using cost-efficient high-performing urinary biomarkers. There was insufficient evidence to define an efficient screening protocol.

Conclusions

Although BCa screening is theoretically feasible in a high-risk population, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend it. This is due to insufficient data to define an efficient screening protocol with selection of an appropriate population and the lack of accurate and cost-effective urinary markers able to discriminate low-risk from high-risk cancers. Major improvements are needed in the evaluation of urinary biomarkers before evaluation in a RCT can be achieved.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113p1GKE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112Qjg1m]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) after nonrenal solid organ transplant — do not screen or treat. In patients who have received a solid organ transplant other than a renal transplant, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). This recommendation places a high value on avoidance of antimicrobial use so as to limit the acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant organisms or Clostridioides difficile infection in SOT patients, who are at increased risk for these adverse outcomes. In nonrenal SOT recipients, symptomatic UTI is uncommon and adverse consequences of symptomatic UTI are extremely rare; the risk of complications from ASB is, therefore, probably negligible.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter [^1116vv3h]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Urinary catheters are used extensively in hospitals and long-term care and they are highly prone to infection. Understanding the pathways by which bacteria colonise a urinary catheter could guide strategies to mitigate infection, but quantitative models for this colonisation process are lacking. Here we present a mathematical model for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter that integrates population dynamics and fluid dynamics. The model describes bacteria migrating up the outside surface of the catheter, spreading into the bladder and being swept through the catheter lumen. Computer simulations of the model reveal that clinical outcomes for long-term versus short-term catheterisation are controlled by different factors: the rate of urine production by the kidneys as opposed to urethral length, catheter surface properties and bacterial motility. Our work may help explain variable susceptibility to catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) among individuals and the mixed success of antimicrobial surface coatings. Our model suggests that for long-term catheterised patients, increasing fluid intake or reducing residual urine volume in the bladder may help prevent infection, while antimicrobial surface coatings are predicted to be effective only for short-term catheterised patients. Therefore, different catheter management strategies could be rationally targeted to long-term vs short-term catheterised patients.

### Reducing unnecessary urinary catheter use and other strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection: an integrative review [^116pwLhh]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are costly, common and often preventable by reducing unnecessary urinary catheter (UC) use.

Methods

To summarise interventions to reduce UC use and CAUTIs, we updated a prior systematic review (through October 2012), and a meta-analysis regarding interventions prompting UC removal by reminders or stop orders. A narrative review summarises other CAUTI prevention strategies including aseptic insertion, catheter maintenance, antimicrobial UCs, and bladder bundle implementation.

Results

30 studies were identified and summarised with interventions to prompt removal of UCs, with potential for inclusion in the meta-analyses. By meta-analysis (11 studies), the rate of CAUTI (episodes per 1000 catheter-days) was reduced by 53% (rate ratio 0.47; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.64, p < 0.001) using a reminder or stop order, with five studies also including interventions to decrease initial UC placement. The pooled (nine studies) standardised mean difference (SMD) in catheterisation duration (days) was -1.06 overall (p = 0.065) including a statistically significant decrease in stop-order studies (SMD -0.37; p < 0.001) but not in reminder studies (SMD, -1.54; p = 0.071). No significant harm from catheter removal strategies is supported. Limited research is available regarding the impact of UC insertion and maintenance technique. A recent randomised controlled trial indicates antimicrobial catheters provide no significant benefit in preventing symptomatic CAUTIs.

Conclusions

UC reminders and stop orders appear to reduce CAUTI rates and should be used to improve patient safety. Several evidence-based guidelines have evaluated CAUTI preventive strategies as well as emerging evidence regarding intervention bundles. Implementation strategies are important because reducing UC use involves changing well-established habits.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^1155AHnb]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with complicated febrile UTI were older and had multiple comorbidities. Especially in this population with the highest disease burden, in whom the longest antibiotic therapy is recommended by current guidelines, our algorithm proved to be effective.

The safety subgroups were small, but no trend for difference in rates of persistent infection was shown at 7 days after end of therapy or at 30 days after enrollment. The slightly higher, but non-significant, rate of bacteriuria and asymptomatic infection in the PCT-pyuria group should not be viewed as an unsuccessful treatment. There is vast evidence that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated. In fact, asymptomatic bacteriuria might be protective against future development of pyelonephritis, as elegantly shown in a prospective Italian study of young women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, who benefited from symptomatic treatment versus antibiotics. There is evidence that in older patients with isolated non-specific signs or non-infectious symptoms, such as delirium, urine testing and subsequent antibiotic therapy should not be ordered.

Furthermore, the follow-up mid-stream urine cultures in the PCT-pyuria group yielded in the majority of cases Enterococcus faecalis (Table 2), which has recently been shown to have a low positive predictive value for uropathogen growth in the bladder.

The antibiotics chosen in our algorithm, derived from international guidelines, should not deter from the necessity to adapt antibiotic choices to local epidemiology and resistance data. In Switzerland, 18.5% of Escherichia coli were resistant to fluoroquinolones in 2013, compared to 22.3% in the European Union in 2012.

A major strength was the innovative study design with antibiotic guidance based on the combination of the systemic and local response against a control group receiving antibiotic therapy according to the low end of currently recommended guidelines.

Potential limitations

Our study has the following limitations. First, the small sample size due to slow recruitment and the heterogeneity of patients within the predefined subgroups limit the power of the analysis, especially regarding safety outcomes. Second, the follow-up mode by telephone interview and by urine samples which were returned by mail harbors potential recall bias and underreporting, which we tried to counteract by contacting the primary care physician and by obtaining discharge letters of subsequent hospitalizations. Third, the analysis of the recurrence rate in the subgroup of patients with bacteremia was limited due to the small numbers. Further studies will have to clarify whether this algorithm needs to be adapted for patients with bacteremia.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114fWK1J]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) with impaired voiding — asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) management: Recommendation — In patients with SCI, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Evidence summary highlights that subjects with SCI have a high prevalence of bacteriuria and a high incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI), and treatment of ASB is usually followed by early recurrence of bacteriuria with reinfecting strains more likely to be antimicrobial resistant. Trials in intermittently catheterized patients observed no differences in rates of symptomatic UTI between antimicrobial treatment/prophylaxis and placebo or no treatment. Multiple reviews and guidelines concluded that ASB should not be screened for or treated in SCI patients, and European Association of Urology guidance states screening for and treatment of ASB are not recommended. Some evidence suggests ASB might be protective and that treatment of ASB may be associated with an increased risk of symptomatic UTI; bacterial interference using nonpathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli 83972/HU2117) has been evaluated, with two RCTs in neurogenic bladders reporting protection against symptomatic UTI in small cohorts (20 and 27 patients, respectively). Clinical signs and symptoms of UTI in SCI may differ from the classic genitourinary symptoms experienced by patients with normal sensation.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter [^1173uqr7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 3
Transition between bacteriuria and no bacteriuria, driven by urine production rate.

a As the rate at which the bladder contents are diluted by urine flow increases beyond the bacterial growth rate, there is a transition from a state with high bacterial abundance in the urine to a washed-out state with low bacterial abundance in the urine. Each point represents the long-time outcome of a computer simulation with a different value of the urine production rate. Lower inset shows the same data on a linear scale. Upper inset shows the time taken to attain the steady state, with a sharp peak at the transition. Also plotted(pink dashed) is the typical urine production rate for a patient, 1 mL/min. b Violin plots showing the distribution of mean urine production rates in the US population. The box and whiskers show the quartiles, with the median in white. Female: a weighted sample (n = 100,000) from a sample population of 11,011 adult females from ref. Male: a weighted sample (n = 100,000) from a sample population of 10,202 adult males from ref. The grey dashed line represents the model estimation of the critical urine production rate for susceptibility to bacteriuria (i.e. the location of the transition in (a)), 1.16 mL/min. Patients with mean urine flow rates above this threshold are not predicted to develop bacteriuria, even if catheterised. Patients with mean flow rates below the threshold are predicted to be at greater risk of bacteriuria if catheterised.

### Screening for bladder cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111oUmQA]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

USPSTF bladder cancer screening — clinical summary for asymptomatic adults states the population is Asymptomatic Adults with the recommendation No recommendation and Grade: I (Insufficient Evidence). Risk factors for bladder cancer include smoking, occupational exposure to carcinogens, male sex, older age, white race, infections caused by certain bladder parasites, and family or personal history of bladder cancer. Screening tests for bladder cancer include microscopic urinalysis for hematuria, urine cytology, and urine biomarkers. The principal treatment for superficial disease is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, and radical cystectomy, often with adjuvant chemotherapy, is used for surgically resectable invasive bladder cancer. There is inadequate evidence that treatment of screen-detected bladder cancer leads to improved morbidity or overall mortality, and there is inadequate evidence on harms of screening for bladder cancer.

European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: When long‐term indwelling urinary bladder drainage is unavoidable, individuals with neurological diseases should be advised that suprapubic catheter drainage is preferred over urethral catheterization. (Consensus‐based recommendation; Consensus: 100%).

Clinical Question 16. Should prophylactic antibiotic therapy versus no advice be offered for individuals with neurological disease and urinary symptoms using a catheter?

Recurrent urinary tract infections should prompt an assessment for an underlying urological cause (e.g. bladder stones) or suboptimal catheterization technique if performing IC. Antibiotic prophylaxis should not be routinely used; however, if no modifiable causes are identified, low‐dose antibiotic prophylaxis may need to be considered on an individual basis.

Recommendation: Antibiotic prophylaxis should not be routinely used in individuals with neurological diseases who catheterize. The benefits and potential risks/burdens should be discussed. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 100%).

Clinical Question 17. Should advice for antibiotic therapy versus no advice be offered for individuals with neurological disease and urinary symptoms having asymptomatic bacteriuria?

Asymptomatic bacteriuria should be treated with antibiotics only in exceptional circumstances. The choice of antibiotics should take into account urine culture and sensitivity results, previous antibiotic use, and recommendations in local antibiotic formularies as part of antimicrobial stewardship.

Recommendation: Antibiotics should not be routinely recommended to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in individuals with neurological diseases having urinary problems*. The benefits and potential risks/burdens should be discussed. *Exceptions where antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria may be considered are pregnancy, planned urological procedures, or immunomodulatory treatments. (Evidence‐based recommendation; Strength: strong; LoE: I; Consensus: 100% for recommendation wording and 97% for recommendation strength).

### The microbiome of the urinary tract – a role beyond infection [^112AdFzm]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Urologists rarely need to consider bacteria beyond their role in infectious disease. However, emerging evidence shows that the microorganisms inhabiting many sites of the body, including the urinary tract — which has long been assumed sterile in healthy individuals — might have a role in maintaining urinary health. Studies of the urinary microbiota have identified remarkable differences between healthy populations and those with urologic diseases. Microorganisms at sites distal to the kidney, bladder and urethra are likely to have a profound effect on urologic health, both positive and negative, owing to their metabolic output and other contributions. Connections between the gut microbiota and renal stone formation have already been discovered. In addition, bacteria are also used in the prevention of bladder cancer recurrence. In the future, urologists will need to consider possible influences of the microbiome in diagnosis and treatment of certain urological conditions. New insights might provide an opportunity to predict the risk of developing certain urological diseases and could enable the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.

### Antimicrobial agents for preventing urinary tract infections in adults undergoing cystoscopy [^111gvSzC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cystoscopy is commonly performed for diagnostic purposes to inspect the interior lining of the bladder. One disadvantage of cystoscopy is the risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) due to pre-existing colonization or by introduction of bacteria at the time of the procedure. However, the incidence of symptomatic UTI following cystoscopy is low. Currently, there is no consensus on whether antimicrobial agents should be used to prevent symptomatic UTI for cystoscopy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antimicrobial agents compared with placebo or no treatment for prevention of UTI in adults undergoing cystoscopy.

Search Methods

We comprehensively searched electronic databases of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL. We searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We used no language or date restrictions in the electronic searches. We searched the reference lists of identified articles and contacted authors for related information. The last search of the electronic databases was 4 February 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared any prophylactic antibiotic versus placebo, no treatment, or other non-antibiotic prophylaxis in adults undergoing cystoscopy. There was no restriction on the dose, frequency, formulation, duration, or mode of administration of the antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were systemic UTI, symptomatic UTI (composite of systemic and/or localized UTI), and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were minor adverse events, localized UTI, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and bacterial resistance. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs and two quasi-RCTs with 7711 participants, all of which compared antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no treatment control. We found no studies comparing antibiotic prophylaxis with non-antibiotic prophylaxis. Primary outcomesSystemic UTI: antibiotic prophylaxis may have little or no effect on the risk of systemic UTI compared with placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 3.32; 5 RCTs; 504 participants; low-quality evidence); this corresponds to two more people (95% CI 12 fewer to 46 more) per 1000 people developing a systemic UTI. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Symptomatic UTI: antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.86; 11 RCTs; 5441 participants; low-quality evidence); this corresponds to 30 fewer people (95% CI 42 fewer to 8 fewer) per 1000 people developing a symptomatic UTI when provided with antibiotic prophylaxis. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and potential publication bias. Serious adverse events: the studies reported no serious adverse events in either the intervention group or control group and no effect size could be calculated. Antibiotic prophylaxis may have little or no effect on serious adverse events (4 RCTs, 630 participants; very low-quality evidence), but we are very uncertain of this finding. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and very serious imprecision. Secondary outcomesMinor adverse events: prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on minor adverse events when compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 2.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 14.80; 4 RCTs; 630 participants; low-quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Localized UTI: prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on the risk of localized UTI (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.77; 1 RCT; 200 participants; very low-quality evidence), but we were very uncertain of this finding. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and very serious imprecision. Bacterial resistance: prophylactic antibiotics may increase bacterial resistance (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.87; 38 participants; 2 RCTs; very low-quality evidence), but we were uncertain of this finding. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations, indirectness, and imprecision. We were able to perform few secondary analyses; these did not suggest any subgroup effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI but not systemic UTIs. Serious and minor adverse events may not be increased with the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. The findings are informed by low- and very low-quality evidence ratings for all outcomes.

### Urinary catheter policies for short-term bladder drainage in adults [^114Vsmxt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Indwelling urinary catheters are often used for bladder drainage during hospital care. Urinary tract infection is a common complication. Other issues that should be considered when choosing an approach to catheterisation are patients' comfort, other complications/adverse effects, and costs.

Objectives

To determine the advantages and disadvantages of alternative approaches to catheterisation for short-term bladder drainage in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 20 December 2004). Additionally, we examined all reference lists of identified trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing catheter route of insertion for adults catheterised for up to 14 days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by both reviewers independently and compared. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Handbook. If the data in trials had not been fully reported, clarification was sought directly from the authors.

Main Results

Seventeen parallel-group randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen trials compared indwelling urethral catheterisation with suprapubic catheterisation. Groups managed with an indwelling catheter had more cases of bacteriuria (RR 2.60; 95%CI 2.12 to 3.18), more frequent recatheterisation (RR 4.12; 95%CI 2.94 to 7.56), and more people with discomfort (RR 2.98; 95%CI 2.31 to 3.85). There were no reports of complications during insertion, although not all trials stated this explicitly. Three trials compared indwelling urethral catheterisation with intermittent catheterisation. In the two trials with data, there were fewer cases of bacteriuria in the intermittent catheterisation group (RR 2.90; 95%CI 1.44 to 5.84). Costs analyses reported in two trials favoured the indwelling group.

Authors' Conclusions

There was evidence that suprapubic catheters have advantages over indwelling catheters in respect of bacteriuria, recatheterisation and discomfort. The clinical significance of bacteriuria was uncertain, however, and there was no information about possible complications or adverse effects during catheter insertion. There was more limited evidence that the use of intermittent catheterisation was also associated with a lower risk of bacteriuria than indwelling urethral catheterisation, but might be more costly. Using intermittent catheterisation postoperatively limits catheterisation to those people who definitely need it.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113nqUSu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnant women — screening and treatment are advised, with culture timing and therapy duration specified. In pregnant women, we recommend screening for and treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence), and we suggest a urine culture collected at 1 of the initial visits early in pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence to inform a recommendation for or against repeat screening during the pregnancy after an initial negative culture or after treatment of an initial episode. In pregnant women with ASB, we suggest 4–7 days of antimicrobial treatment rather than a shorter duration (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Diagnosis, management, and prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections [^112DCEkT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is common, costly, and causes significant patient morbidity. CAUTIs are associated with hospital pathogens with a high propensity toward antimicrobial resistance. Treatment of asymptomatic patients with CAUTI accounts for excess antimicrobial use in hospitals and should be avoided. Duration of urinary catheterization is the predominant risk for CAUTI; preventive measures directed at limiting placement and early removal of urinary catheters have an impact on decreasing CAUTI rates. The use of bladder bundles and collaboratives, coupled with the support and active engagement from both hospital leaders and followers, seem to help prevent this common problem.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter [^114KmPN3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

For short-term catheterisation, the early-time colonisation dynamics of the model are relevant, i.e. how fast bacteria migrate up the catheter and colonise the bladder. A short-term catheterised patient will only develop bacteriuria (and potentially CAUTI) if the onset time for bacteriuria is shorter than the duration of catheterisation. Hence, delaying the onset of bacteriuria can be a useful strategy for short-term catheterised patients. Our model shows that the time taken by bacteria to migrate up the catheter depends linearly on urethral length, consistent with the fact that sex is a strong risk factor. Other parameters associated with the bacteria-surface interaction — bacterial growth rate and motility on the surface — are also relevant for the onset time. Thus, our model suggests that interventions that alter bacteria-surface interactions, such as antimicrobial coatings, might be effective for short-term catheterised patients only.

Reports on the efficacy of antimicrobial coatings have been mixed. A systematic review in 2008 found that both silver-alloy coated and antibiotic-impregnated catheters were effective in reducing the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infection for short-term catheterised patients (in that study, defined as < 1 week) but were not effective for long-term catheterised patients. However, a subsequent randomised control trial in 2012 that focused on short-term catheterisation (here defined as < 2 weeks) found that silver-alloy coated catheters were not effective, while antibiotic-impregnated catheters had only limited efficacy. The observed loss of efficacy for long-term catheterised patients is consistent with our model findings. Moreover, our model might also be able to explain the discrepancy between the two reports. A key finding of our model is that timescales are critical for clinical outcomes, so the different outcomes of the two reports might be explained by the different definitions of 'short-term': 1 weekvs 2 weeks. Furthermore, our model predicts that antimicrobial coatings are likely to have significantly higher efficacy in males than females, since urethral length is a controlling parameter for short-term outcomes. Neither study, distinguished efficacy in males vs females, but we note that the 2008 review(which found positive short-term efficacy) included more males than females, while 62% of the participants of the 2012 trial(which found no efficacy) were female. We suggest that it is important for future studies of intervention efficacy to differentiate between males and females, as well as to standardise definitions of short-term versus long-term catheterisation duration.

### How can we improve investigation, prevention and treatment for recurrent urinary tract infections-ICI-RS 2018 [^114nR76z]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) is a chronic condition and has a significant impact on health-related quality of life. The commonly used definition for rUTI is greater than three episodes in a year or more than two in 6 months. Current diagnostic methods have been used worldwide for over five decades, despite well evidenced criticism. Enhanced culture techniques demonstrate that the microbiome of the bladder is far more complex than previously thought and begs a reappraisal of our current testing. Treatment of rUTI is based on a small number of antibiotic trials with some evidence showing a reduction in the number of positive cultures, but one must be cautious in interpreting the results and weigh against the risk of generation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Aim

The International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society think tank reviewed the literature with a view to improving investigation, prevention and treatment of rUTI.

Methods

A multidisciplinary team of experts were invited to present evidence regarding the current diagnostic methods, recent advances related to bladder biome mapping and current treatment strategies, including antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. Current guidelines regarding antibiotic stewardship and concerns regarding AMR were discussed.

Discussion

Outcome of the think tank discussions are summarised with a set of recommendations to inform future research. Particular consideration is given to bacterial survival in the bladder after treatment as well as defects in urothelial barrier function which may play a significant part in the failure to eradicate UTI.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111gDBjm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship considerations in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) emphasize limiting unnecessary cultures and therapy; a positive urine culture often encourages antimicrobial use, and obtaining urine cultures when not clinically indicated promotes inappropriate antimicrobial use. Given the potential negative societal consequence of antimicrobial resistance, screening for bacteriuria and treatment of ASB should be discouraged unless there is evidence to support a benefit of treatment for a given population. Randomized studies across multiple groups found no benefit of antimicrobial treatment, while antimicrobials increased risks including antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and in some cases increased urinary tract infection shortly after therapy.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in patients living with urological devices — guidance and rationale: No evidence identified through the systematic literature search addressed the treatment of ASB in patients living with previously implanted urological devices, and the consensus of the panel was that ASB should not be screened for or treated in patients living with urological devices. The panel noted that any additional benefit from screening and treating ASB would be negligible, bacterial species isolated from device infections are usually distinct from organisms isolated from ASB, and no evidence was identified that ASB in patients with a urological device in situ is a risk factor for urological device infection.

### Screening for bladder cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113MPNHp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) levels of certainty regarding net benefit are defined as: High — The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations; these studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes; this conclusion is therefore unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies. Moderate — The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors as the number, size, or quality of individual studies; inconsistency of findings across individual studies; limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice; and lack of coherence in the chain of evidence; as more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusions. Low — The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes because of factors such as the limited number or size of studies, important flaws in study design or methods, inconsistency of findings across individual studies, gaps in the chain of evidence, findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice, and a lack of information on important health outcomes; more information may allow an estimation of effects on health outcomes.

Summary of other strategies to prevent CAUTI

Several recent evidence-based guidelineshave focused on preventing CAUTI, and have assessed the evidence and provided recommendations for implementing prevention strategies. Key recommendations in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline, in addition to appropriate catheter use (box 1), include (1) aseptic insertion of urinary catheters by properly trained personnel, using aseptic technique and sterile equipment (with an exception being that clean technique is appropriate for chronic intermittent catheterisation) and (2) proper urinary catheter maintenance with a sterile, closed drainage system permitting unobstructed urine flow. Aseptic insertion is primarily recommended as a standard of care for which limited evidence exists. Stronger evidence (epidemiological and clinical) supports the importance of a sterile, closed, unobstructed urinary drainage system.

A more controversial topic has been the use of antimicrobial catheters. Based on evidence available before 2010, the most recent CDC guideline recommendedthat antimicrobial catheters should not be used routinely to prevent CAUTI. It suggested that further research was needed both on the effect of silver-alloy-coated catheters in reducing the risk of clinically significant CAUTI outcomes, and on the benefit of silver-alloy-coated catheters in selected patients at high risk of infection. In November 2012, a long-awaited multicentre RCT demonstrated a lack of effectiveness of antimicrobial catheters (including silver-alloy and nitrofurazone-releasing catheters) to provide significant and clinically important reductions in symptomatic CAUTIs.

Bundles of interventions are also an important strategy, as part of a multimodal approach that focuses efforts on high-yield interventions. For example, one strategy that includes several of the components from the bladder bundle implemented by the Michigan Health and Hospital Association (MHA) Keystone Center for Patient Safety & Quality is the 'ABCDE' approach:
A dherence to general infection control principles is important (eg, hand hygiene, surveillance and feedback, aseptic insertion, proper maintenance, education).
B ladder ultrasound may avoid indwelling catheterisation.
C ondom catheters or other alternatives to an indwelling catheter such as intermittent catheterisation should be considered in appropriate patients.
D o not use the indwelling catheter unless you must!
E arly removal of the catheter using a reminder or nurse-initiated removal protocol appears warranted.

### The association between the urinary microbiome and bladder cancer [^112ycC1x]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Many studies are currently investigating the association between the urinary microbiome and bladder cancer, focusing on differences between stages and with risk of recurrence and progression. However, many of these studies are limited by the small number of patients, presence of confounders and issues with sampling, DNA extraction, and analyses. Recently there has been a shift toward examining the microbiome of bladder tissues rather than urine samples; however, these studies remain a minority. Identification of the differences in microbiome composition between different stages of bladder cancer can provide biomarkers to identify the patients who are more likely to respond to intravesical treatment. Further, these differences in microbiome composition could provide novel therapeutic targets, whereby the modulation of specific bacterial taxa could selectively promote or inhibit response to intravesical therapy.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^1122dnZP]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

Discussion and Recommendations

After a day of topical presentations and discussions, the entire group discussed the most important research recommendations emerging from the Roundtable. A summary of the discussion specific to each area follows. The specific recommendations are listed in Table 3.

3

As a whole, the experts agreed that given the demonstrated effectiveness of incontinence treatment, research is needed on methods of increasing healthcare-seeking behavior for women with incontinence as well as implementation of successful prevention and treatment strategies that extend the reach of and optimize individual adherence to effective continence promotion programs. However, while many effective treatments are available, there exists a fundamental lack of understanding of pathophysiology underlying LUT dysfunction, resulting in nontargeted therapies. Physicians are only able to treat symptoms, but cannot correct pathophysiological causes. This shortcoming is combined with the generalized grouping of patients according to symptoms rather than disease mechanisms and results in relatively poor management and ineffective treatment.

Discussions concluded that it is important to understand normal function along with dysfunction to identify the root cause of a problem with the ultimate goal of preventing disease. Knowledge gaps in research have resulted from inadequate phenotype definitions of urinary dysfunction, insufficient data to determine what is normal and abnormal, and animal models that do not appropriately reflect human disease. Specific research recommendations address these limitations, including the need for clinicians to better define disease states so that animal models that more accurately reflect these human conditions and their etiology can be developed.

There is a need for better understanding of molecular, cellular, microbiome, and physiological mechanisms of normal and abnormal function and improved understanding of the role of biological sex in urological function. Additional work is needed to develop animal models that discriminate between different disease etiologies (in incontinence, for example) to properly assess the efficacy and safety of newly developed treatments. Last, a precise understanding of etiologic mechanisms can inform how to develop preventative treatment strategies in the future.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter [^114kSjFo]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary catheters — thin tubes which are inserted into the urethra to drain the bladder — are commonly used in hospitals, especially intensive care units, and in community care for patients with urological issues. Approximately 30 million urinary catheters are used annually in the USA. The duration of catheterisation varies from a few days ('short-term', e.g. in hospital, post-surgery) to up to 3 months, followed by replacement('long-term', e.g. in community care settings). Urinary catheters are highly prone to colonisation by bacteria. This leads initially to catheter-associated bacteriuria(bacteria in the urine), which may be asymptomatic, not requiring treatment. However, bacteriuria can progress to symptomatic catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), with potential complications including localised issues such as catheter blockage, bladder inflammation and the systemic and potentially fatal complication of sepsis. Bacteriuria has incidence rates of 3–7% per catheter day, and is almost universal in long-term catheterised patients; the estimated incidence rate of CAUTI is about ten times lower, at 0.3–0.7% per catheter day. In hospital settings, the likelihood of progression of bacteriuria to CAUTI has been estimated at 24% (uncertainty in this figure is high due to limited data). CAUTI are associated with a very significant societal and economic burden,: for example, they account for up to 40% of hospital-acquired infections. Despite this, our understanding of the role of different factors in CAUTI development is limited. In particular, it is not known why some patients are plagued by recurrent CAUTI while others are hardly troubled, why some infections develop far more rapidly than others, which of several possible infection sources is relevant for any given patient. and why efforts to prevent CAUTI using antimicrobial catheter coatings have shown mixed results in clinical trials. To address these questions and to guide the rational design of more effective strategies to prevent or mitigate CAUTI, better understanding of the pathways by which bacteria colonise a urinary catheter is required.

### Decolonization potential of 0.02% polyhexanide irrigation solution in urethral catheters under practice-like in vitro conditions [^113urGRg]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The long-term use of indwelling urethral and suprapubic catheters to manage intractable urinary incontinence and retention is commonplace in both hospital and especially community healthcare settings. Surveys of nursing homes across Europe and the US have shown that between 8 to 10% of residents have indwelling urinary catheters. The long-term catheterization patient population is a heterogeneous group, many of which are elderly people who have chronic disabilities. Long-term catheterization can lead to significant patient morbidity and mortality caused by associated complications. The most common complications that occur are urinary tract infection (UTI) and catheter blockage, which can affect up to 70% of catheterized patients. Enteric pathogens (e.g. Escherichia coli) are most commonly responsible; however, Pseudomonas species, Enterococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterobacter species and yeasts are also known to cause infection. Bacteria gain access to the urinary tract either extra- or intraluminally and form biofilm colonies, which may adhere to the catheter surface and drainage bag. As well as providing a source of infection, biofilm formation is also implicated in encrustation and blockage of catheters.

Bacteria within biofilms are morphologically and physiologically different from planktonic bacterial cells and are often resistant to systemic antibiotic treatment, making them difficult to eradicate. However, there is evidence suggesting that physical removal, i.e. mechanical rinsing, is the best method of biofilm elimination, and regular cleansing is required to prevent regrowth of the bacteria. Nevertheless, current guidance does not recommend an active approach for catheter management. The standard clinical approach is not to intervene and therefore removal of the catheter may be the only option.

Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents such as polyhexanide that kill microorganisms have shown to be appropriate agents to use for mechanical rinsing and removal of biofilm across a range of applications. The aim of this study was to investigate whether taking an active approach with a mechanical irrigation with normal saline solution and a combined approach with a polyhexanide solution is efficient for decolonizing urethral catheters. The bactericidal activity of the polyhexanide solution was tested in vitro using a suspension assay. In addition, the bacterial decolonization potential was tested using a practice-like in vitro assay with standard catheters, which were artificially contaminated. The polyhexanide solution and irrigation with a normal saline solution were compared to no intervention (standard approach).

### Screening for bladder cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115S44iD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

USPSTF bladder cancer screening — clinical considerations specify that this recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults, including adults with mild lower urinary tract symptoms (such as urinary frequency, hesitancy, urgency, dysuria, or nocturia) in the population under consideration for screening, while adults with gross hematuria or acute changes in lower urinary tract symptoms are not included. Screening may yield false-positive results that can lead to anxiety, labeling, pain, and complications from diagnostic cystoscopy and biopsy or imaging. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening and also inadequate evidence on harms associated with early treatment. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic adults.

### Third-line therapy for overactive bladder in the elderly: nuances and considerations [^116Juez2]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Medium credibility.

3.3 Considerations

In light of the above evidence, clinicians should consider the following when contemplating BTX‐A for refractory OAB in the elderly:
Self‐catheterization: In addition to willingness, does the patient have the mobility and dexterity required to perform self‐catheterization? If not, are caregivers available, able, and willing to perform if needed? If not, would the patient and/or caregiver accept a temporary indwelling catheter and associated follow‐up visits for trials of the void?
UTI treatment burden: Treatment of acute cystitis carries greater risk in older patients. Multiple antibiotics are included in the American Geriatric Society Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults, including nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole‐trimethoprim, and macrolides. Furthermore, the risk of Clostridium difficile colitis is significantly higher with advanced age and antibiotic exposure. Asymptomatic bacteriuria increases with age, with incidence up to 21% in patients ≥ 65 compared to 1%–5% in younger cohorts. Thus, it is important also to treat only clinically symptomatic UTIs.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^11183VFt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria — general risk–benefit rationale outside pregnancy: Although women with ASB may also be at increased risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), ASB, even when persistent, appears not to be associated with other adverse outcomes, and there is no evidence to suggest that episodes of symptomatic UTI are attributable to the ASB. Moreover, treatment of ASB may not decrease the frequency of symptomatic UTI, including pyelonephritis, and antibiotics may increase rather than decrease the risk of subsequent UTI. There is high-quality evidence that antibiotics have an increased risk of adverse effects, that screening and treating ASB is extremely costly, and that the use of antibiotics promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

Urinary tract infections are common clinical entities occurring in a variety of patient groups, most frequently caused by uropathogenic E. coli. Novel methods of preventing UTI currently under development are focused on three key approaches: (1) use of cranberry products, (2) restoration of the normal flora using Lactobacillus-based probiotic preparations, and (3) vaccine development. Although promising studies in each of these areas have been published or are ongoing, additional properly designed and powered clinical studies based on solid scientific evidence are needed.

Indwelling urethral catheters — screening or treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB): In patients with a short-term indwelling urethral catheter (< 30 days), we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Remarks state that considerations are likely to be similar for patients with indwelling suprapubic catheters, and it is reasonable to manage these patients similar to patients with indwelling urethral catheters, for both short-term and long-term suprapubic catheterization. In patients with indwelling catheters, we make no recommendation for or against screening for and treating ASB at the time of catheter removal (knowledge gap); remarks note antimicrobial prophylaxis given at the time of catheter removal may confer a benefit for prevention of symptomatic UTI for some patients, that evidence largely comes from studies enrolling surgical patients who receive prophylactic antimicrobials at the time of short-term catheter removal generally without screening to determine if ASB is present, and that it is unclear whether or not the benefit is greater in patients with ASB. In patients with long-term indwelling catheters, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### The urinary microbiome: implications in bladder cancer pathogenesis and therapeutics [^111dgGEb]. Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent investigation has proven that the bladder is not sterile. However, the implications of this finding in the pathophysiology and management of urothelial cell carcinoma have not been fully described. In this review, we summarize the literature relating to the urinary and gastrointestinal microbiomes in the context of urothelial cell carcinoma. The bladder microbiome may relate to urothelial cell carcinoma pathogenesis/progression, act as a noninvasive and modifiable urinary biomarker and have implications in treatment using immunotherapy agents such as intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Investigators should continue to optimize techniques to characterize this intriguing new area of human health.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### Different factors control long-term versus short-term outcomes for bacterial colonisation of a urinary catheter [^112W6bsJ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

If bacterial colonisation originates on the outside at the catheter base (i.e. from the skin), a wave of bacteria spreads up the outside surface. At early times, therefore, the model predicts high bacteria coverage on the lower part of the outside surface only, while the upper part of the outside surface and the luminal surface are still uncolonised (Fig. 5 a). If the origin is instead at the base of the luminal surface (e.g. from the drainage bag), the bacterial wave spreads up the inner surface, so that at early times bacterial coverage is high only on the lower part of the luminal surface (Fig. 5 b). If the colonisation originates in the bladder, the entire luminal surface rapidly becomes colonised and a bacterial wave also propagates down the outside surface from the top (Fig. 5 c). Finally, if the catheter were to become contaminated on insertion such that bacteria become spread over the entire outside surface, the model predicts rapid bacterial growth across the entire surface (Fig. 5 d). This would imply a breach of the sterile conditions under which clinical catheter insertion should be performed.

Inspection of bacterial abundance on the outside and luminal surfaces of catheters removed at an early stage is, in principle, possible, and would provide a useful test for hypotheses and models of catheter colonisation. Such measurements are not routinely performed, but strikingly similar patterns to those predicted by our model have been observed for bacterial colonisation of an in vitro model of a catheterised bladder. Fitting our model to this data allows us to extract parameters for bacterial growth rate and motility on the catheter surface (see Supplementary Information, IV.E). In addition, this approach could be helpful for optimising catheter management protocols. For example, if a catheter has been removed due to infection, it could be inspected for bacterial colonisation of the lower and upper outside vs luminal surfaces, potentially informing about the most likely source of infection and informing targeted infection prevention measures for further catheterisation.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) diagnostic definitions and specimen requirements — In patients without indwelling catheters, ASB is defined as ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in a voided urine specimen without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). For women, 2 consecutive specimens obtained preferably within 2 weeks are used to confirm persistence, and between 10% and 60% of women do not have persistent bacteriuria on repeat screening after an initial positive specimen. For men, a single urine specimen meeting these quantitative criteria is sufficient for diagnosis. In patients with indwelling devices, ≥ 10³ CFU/mL remains the most appropriate diagnostic criteria for bladder bacteriuria, while lower quantitative counts (≥ 10² to < 10⁵ CFU/mL) from "in and out" catheterization or after insertion of a new indwelling catheter suggest true bacteriuria, although the clinical significance of these lower counts in asymptomatic people has not been evaluated.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^111qGc6S]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary catheterization is common in patients in hospital, particularly for surgical patients in the perioperative period when physiological mechanisms of bladder emptying are suspended. Catheterization of the urinary tract, however, is associated with an increased risk of bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infection, the risk being associated with the duration of catheterization. National guidelines recommend removal of urinary catheters once they are no longer needed, and surgical experts advocate discontinuation of catheterization as early as 24–48 hours postoperatively. Bacteriuria in a patient with a catheter, however, can persist after the catheter is removed and can develop into a symptomatic urinary tract infection. Manipulation of the catheter itself during removal might also predispose to infection. Current definitions' from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) for catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) reflect this by identifying infections up to 48 hours after catheter removal as catheter associated.

Whether administration of prophylactic antibiotics when the catheter is removed will prevent subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection is unclear. Randomized trials have yielded conflicting results, and there has been no meta-analysis. Also, there is considerable heterogeneity in the management of antimicrobial prophylaxis around removal of a urinary catheter. The 2009 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of catheter associated urinary tract infection determined that there was insufficient evidence to recommend widespread antibiotic prophylaxis after catheterization. In contrast, in their 2008 best practice policy statement the American Urological Association (AUA) concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered for patients with bacteriuria at time of catheter removal, particularly for those with certain risk factors (such as advanced age, immunodeficiency, or anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract).

We performed a meta-analysis of controlled trials to clarify whether antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of urinary catheter removal confers a benefit in terms of preventing subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infections.

Purpose Of Review

Catheter-related urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most important nosocomial infections. This review summarizes the latest advances in the field of catheter care and the management of catheter-associated UTIs.

Recent Findings

The most efficient methods to prevent catheter-associated UTIs are to avoid unnecessary catheterizations and to remove catheters as soon as possible. The use of different reminder systems and implementation of infection control programs can effectively decrease catheter-associated UTIs, although their introduction can be challenging. There is still no evidence to support the routine use of antimicrobial-impregnated catheters, but the use of hydrophilic-coated catheters for clean intermittent catheterization can effectively reduce infections. Preliminary results with chlorhexidine-coated catheters are promising. In cases of serious catheter-associated UTI in patients with a history of previous antibiotic therapy or healthcare-associated bacteraemia, empirical antibiotic treatment should be initiated with activity against multiresistant uropathogens. Suprapubic catheterization is not superior to urethral catheters in terms of reducing the rate of catheter-related bacteriuria.

Summary

A technology to prevent catheter-associated UTIs is still not available; however, there are promising results with new approaches such as the use of reminder systems and infection control programs, which can effectively decrease the rate of catheter-associated UTIs. There is evidence supporting the use of hydrophilic coated catheters for clean intermittent catheterization, but an optimal catheter material or coating still has to be developed. Evidence-based catheter management is crucial for every patient in need of a catheter.

3 Shared Decision‐Making (SDM) in Continence Health

SDM is an approach where clinicians and patients make decisions together using the best available evidence. Patients are encouraged to think about the available screening, treatment, or management options and the likely benefits and harms of each so that they can communicate their preferences and help select the best course of action for them. To judge whether the benefits and risks of treatment are balanced from a patient's perspective, and to avoid procedures patients would rather not have if they were well informed (and which thus may harm them), clinicians must determine their patients' preferences. A review of the models of SDM, showed that many had key components in common. A selection of the key components are presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Examples of key components of shared decision‐making.

An American Urological Association (AUA) White Paper on the implementation of SDM in urological practice concludes that SDM represents the state of the art; that patients who have engaged in SDM have greater knowledge, satisfaction, engagement with care, and SDM is an important component of high‐quality healthcare delivery. The benefits of SDM also extend beyond the single therapeutic engagement, as people are more likely to engage in SDM with other clinicians. Therefore, in most circumstances, urologists should adopt SDM into routine clinical practice.

### Materials-based incidence of urinary catheter associated urinary tract infections and the causative micro-organisms: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117TzGkP]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

UTIs are estimated to represent up to 40% of all nosocomial infections. UTIs arising in hospital environments include catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI). Approximately 20% of hospital-acquired bacteraemia arise from the CAUTI with an incidence of 3–8% per day and a prevalence of about 8.5%. Beside patient discomfort and economic impact on the health provider, mortality associated to UTI-associated bacteraemia is approximately 10%. Despite these numbers, catheters are still needed by patients with acute urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction. In a cohort of 931,945 adults receiving primary care with ages ≥ 65 years at least one UTI was diagnosed in 21% of the cohort, demonstrating a considerable UTI incidence. Both long (≥ 30 days) and short-term (≤ 30 days) catheterisation can result in UTI; however, this more likely for long-term catheter usage. Despite the duration of short-term catheterisation, it was found to have a 5% increase in the daily infection rate. Use of indwelling catheters requires passing through the urinary tract via urethra to reach the bladder, where the catheter is held place by balloon inflation. This invasive nature of indwelling catheterisation through the urinary canal for long durations possesses a greater risk of CAUTI than intermittent catheterisation, where the catheter is frequently cleaned or exchanged for a new catheter. As such, use of urinary catheters is avoided if possible with intermittent catheterisation preferred. However, the increase of risk using indwelling catheters over intermittent ones is debated. Commercially available catheter devices can exist in a variety of different types and materials, all of which exhibit smooth outer surfaces for patient comfort and ease of passage through the urinary tract.

### Bladder and other urothelial cancers screening (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^113JFvcN]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Age-adjusted mortality from bladder cancer decreased in all races and sexes between 1975 and 2022. From 2013 to 2022, bladder cancer mortality decreased by about 1% per year. These changes may reflect earlier diagnosis, better therapy, less exposure to carcinogens, or some combination of these factors. Exposure to Arsenic Ingestion of large quantities of arsenic in well water has also been associated with numerous malignancies, including transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Similar endemic pockets of bladder cancer are found in other regions with high arsenic concentrations in drinking water. In South Taiwan, arsenic blackfoot disease is endemic. Exposure to inorganic arsenic compounds, such as gallium arsenide, is also associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. 3] However, only 47 of the 982 patients with microhematuria were found to have bladder cancer.

Only 1 of the 21 patients in the first study and none of the 26 detected in the second study had stage T2 or greater malignancy. As a limitation of repetitive hematuria screening in a general population of men aged 50 years and older, more than 90% of individuals with positive tests upon initial workup were found not to have bladder cancer. In the Wisconsin hematuria screening studies, all patients who were hematuria positive with negative workups or who were found to have no serious disease were followed for at least 24 months, with no findings of developing bladder cancer. Similarly, at least 18 months after their last testing, no screening participant had died of bladder cancer.

Other Possible Screening Modalities The accuracy of voided urine cytology in detecting bladder cancer has been evaluated primarily in patients with histories of bladder cancer who are undergoing cystoscopic surveillance or as a routine test performed in all patients attending a large urology office in a multispecialty clinic. In the studies of patients with histories of bladder cancer, voided urinary cytology was effective in diagnosing 20% to 40% of grade 1 TCCs, 20% to 50% of grade 2 malignancies, and 60% to 80% of grade 3/Tis cancers. Although such studies were not performed in patients wi.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) values and preferences — The panel states that most patients would wish to receive antimicrobial therapy for ASB if benefits outweigh harms, but where treatment is unlikely to confer a benefit, risks including adverse drug effects, CDI, and antimicrobial resistance suggest most would not wish to receive antimicrobial treatment. From the societal perspective, avoidance of antimicrobial use where there is no benefit is preferred, and when the quality of evidence is low with no suggestion of potential harm, the panel "generally recommend against the treatment of ASB because of the high-quality evidence that antimicrobial therapy contributes to antimicrobial resistance". They also note costs are not offset by demonstrable benefits and that high-quality evidence shows no reduction in symptomatic UTI or other outcomes where there is no evidence of benefit with treatment of ASB.

In patients with ASB who will undergo a urologic procedure, we suggest a short course (1 or 2 doses) rather than more prolonged antimicrobial therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and antimicrobial therapy should be initiated 30–60 minutes before the procedure.

### Strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^113G2cVE]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Approaches that should not be considered a routine part of CAUTI prevention

Routine use of antimicrobial- or antiseptic-impregnated catheters. (Quality of evidence: HIGH)
Breaking a closed system. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in catheterized patients, except in the few patient populations for which this is anticipated to have more benefit than harm, as detailed in the 2019 IDSA Guideline for Management of Asymptomatic Bacteriuriaand the 2019 US Preventative Services Task Force Recommendation on Asymptomatic Bacteriuria in Adults(eg, pregnant women, patients undergoing endoscopic urologic procedures associated with mucosal trauma). (Quality of evidence: HIGH) Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not an effective strategy to prevent CAUTI in other patient groups, as it increases the risk of antibiotic-associated complications more than any potential benefit for the prevention of symptomatic CAUTI. The conditions that predispose the patient to bladder colonization (anatomic, immunologic) are not resolved by antibiotics, so bacteriuria recurs.
Catheter irrigation as a strategy to prevent infection. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Do not perform continuous irrigation of the bladder with antimicrobials as a routine infection prevention measure. If continuous irrigation is being used to prevent obstruction, maintain a closed system.
Routine use of systemic antimicrobials as prophylaxis. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Routine changing of catheters to avoid infection. (Quality of evidence: LOW) In the case of a patient with a long-term catheter in place (ie, > 7 days), catheter replacement can be considered at the time of specimen collection for urine testing to obtain a fresh sample.
Alcohol-based products on the genital mucosa. (Quality of evidence: LOW)

Unresolved issues and future areas of study

Use of antiseptic solution versus sterile saline for meatal and perineal cleaning prior to catheter insertion. –,
Use of urinary antiseptics (eg, methenamine) to prevent UTI.
Spatial separation of patients with urinary catheters in place to prevent transmission of pathogens that could colonize urinary drainage systems.
Standard of care for routine replacement of urinary catheters in place > 30 days for infection prevention.
Best practices for optimizing and tailoring implementation of CAUTI prevention and urine-culture stewardship from the adult acute-care setting to the pediatric acute-care setting.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^116Doznh]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Limitations inherent to this meta-analysis include the potential for publication bias, although we also included unpublished abstracts in our search. Their quality grading was based on the subjective assessment of two authors. Furthermore, the included studies were distinctly different in design — with diverse populations of patients, choices of antibiotics, durations of prophylaxis, and a heterogeneous observation period after removal of the catheter — so that standardized recommendations are difficult to make. The largest included study was not randomized but instead compared patients of surgeon A (who gave prophylactic antibiotics) with patients of surgeon B (who did not give prophylactic antibiotics); these surgeons' practices and techniques could have differed in many other ways. Also, some of the studies did not use a placebo in the control arm, and patients' assessment and reporting of urinary symptoms could have been affected by their knowledge of treatment status. Lastly, only two of the included studies recorded information on adverse events associated with the antibiotics, such as drug toxicities, allergic reactions, or infections with Clostridium difficile. None of the studies looked at the costs of antibiotic prophylaxis or at emerging antimicrobial resistance. Clinicians must assimilate these uncertainties when weighing advantages and disadvantages of implementing antibiotic prophylaxis after urethral catheterization.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis of available data indicates an overall benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of removal of a urinary catheter to prevent subsequent urinary tract infections. The number needed to treat indicates that 17 patients would need to receive prophylaxis to prevent one symptomatic urinary tract infection. We know little, however, about the potential negative consequences of implementing antibiotic prophylaxis in this setting in a wider frame or indeed which types of patients would be most likely to benefit. Increasing antimicrobial resistance, healthcare costs for antibiotics, and the potential for side effects of antibiotic administration are disadvantages that merit careful review. From a public health standpoint, we should be careful not to encourage antibiotic use when it might not be necessary. The healthcare provider of a catheterized patient, however, might consider antibiotic prophylaxis before catheter removal, after taking individual risk factors into account. Future studies should better characterize who is at risk of developing symptomatic urinary tract infection after catheter removal (whether bacteriuric or not) and then examine antibiotic prophylaxis in those at greatest risk.

### Effect of body surface decolonisation on bacteriuria and candiduria in intensive care units: an analysis of a cluster-randomised trial [^111AJzag]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common health-care-associated infections. Bacteriuria commonly precedes UTI and is often treated with antibiotics, particularly in hospital intensive care units (ICUs). In 2013, a cluster-randomised trial (REDUCE MRSA Trial [Randomized Evaluation of Decolonization vs Universal Clearance to Eradicate MRSA]) showed that body surface decolonisation reduced all-pathogen bloodstream infections. We aim to further assess the effect of decolonisation on bacteriuria and candiduria in patients admitted to ICUs.

Methods

We did a secondary analysis of a three-group, cluster-randomised trial of 43 hospitals (clusters) with patients in 74 adult ICUs. The three groups included were either meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening and isolation, targeted decolonisation (screening, isolation, and decolonisation of MRSA carriers) with chlorhexidine and mupirocin, and universal decolonisation (no screening, all patients decolonised) with chlorhexidine and mupirocin. Protocol included chlorhexidine cleansing of the perineum and proximal 6 inches (15·24 cm) of urinary catheters. ICUs within the same hospital were assigned the same strategy. Outcomes included high-level bacteriuria (≥ 50000 colony forming units [CFU]/mL) with any uropathogen, high-level candiduria (≥ 50 000 CFU/mL), and any bacteriuria with uropathogens. Sex-specific analyses were specified a priori. Proportional hazards models assessed differences in outcome reductions across groups, comparing an 18-month intervention period to a 12-month baseline period.

Findings

122 646 patients (48 390 baseline, 74 256 intervention) were enrolled. Intervention versus baseline hazard ratios (HRs) for high-level bacteriuria were 1·02 (95% CI 0·88–1·18) for screening or isolation, 0·88 (0·76–1·02) for targeted decolonisation, and 0·87 (0·77–1·00) for universal decolonisation (no difference between groups, p = 0·26), with no sex-specific reductions (HRs for men: 1·09 [95% CI 0·85–1·40] for screening or isolation, 1·01 [0·79–1·29] for targeted decolonisation, and 0·78 [0·63–0·98] for universal decolonisation, p = 0·12; HRs for women: 0·97 [0·80–1·17] for screening and isolation, 0·83 [0·70–1·00] for targeted decolonisation, and 0·93 [0·79–1·09] for universal decolonisation, p = 0·49). HRs for high-level candiduria were 1·14 (0·95–1·37) for screening and isolation, 0·99 (0·83–1·18) for targeted decolonisation, and 0·83 (0·70–0·99) for universal decolonisation (p = 0·05). Differences between sexes were due to reductions in men in the universal decolonisation group (HRs: 1·21 [95% CI 0·88–1·68] for screening or isolation, 1·01 [0·73–1·39] for targeted decolonisation, and 0·63 [0·45–0·89] for universal decolonisation, p = 0·02). Bacteriuria with any CFU/mL was also reduced in men in the universal decolonisation group (HRs 1·01 [0·81–1·25] for screening or isolation, 1·04 [0·83–1·30] for targeted decolonisation, and 0·74 [0·61–0·90] for universal decolonisation, p = 0·04).

Interpretation

Universal decolonisation of patients in the ICU with once a day chlorhexidine baths and short-course nasal mupirocin could be a potential preventive strategy in male patients because it significantly decreases candiduria and any bacteriuria, but not for women.

### Overcoming challenges in the economic evaluation of interventions to optimise antibiotic use [^117WGy1B]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Outlook

Without adequate consideration of the future benefits from reduced resistance, there is a risk that policymakers could use economic evaluation of antibiotic optimisation interventions as justification for disinvestment rather than investment. Consider a situation where data on costs and benefits are limited, especially with regard to costs of future resistance avoided by an intervention. A traditional economic evaluation might omit these future resistance-related benefits completely, with the probable consequence of finding optimisation interventions not cost-effective. Our approach discourages ignoring these future benefits by demanding a consideration, in such circumstances, of the minimum future resistance-related benefit (i.e. the threshold) that would be needed from the intervention to make the conclusion of the analysis switch to being cost-effective, rather than not cost-effective.

In this way, economic evaluations of antibiotic optimisation interventions could be obliged to include a reasonable attempt to estimate the probabilities of exceeding this extra cost threshold, or the probability of a positive NPV. Initially, these estimates will probably need to rely largely on information elicited from experts. Over time, as evidence from randomised trials, observational analyses, transmission models and our understanding of resistance emergence and growth improves, our estimates of probabilities of exceeding cost thresholds will improve and we can employ more definitive evidence. For example, there should soon be evidence on the effects of antibiotic use on susceptibility to colonisation with resistant bacteria, and on the subsequent risk of infection and associated health-economic outcomes. Incorporating these outcomes in randomised trials evaluating the impact of interventions to improve antibiotic use could greatly improve our understanding of the link between changes in prescribing, antibiotic resistant infections, and subsequent health-economic outcomes.

However, we need to do more with the existing evidence. The available evidence on the current economic burden of antibiotic resistant infections could already be incorporated into models predicting the health economic impact of interventions to prevent such infections. Importantly, various randomised trials have received funding to address some key gaps in the current health-economic evidence in this area, such as pREVention and management tools for rEducing antibiotic Resistance in high prevalence Settings (REVERSE), and DURATION OF ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT IN URINARY TRACT INFECTION (DuRATIon-UTI). There is much to be learned that can help us refine economic evaluations of antibiotic optimisation interventions, building on the extra cost threshold type of evaluation that we propose. However, we believe enough is already known to start using them now and the urgent need to improve the way that we use antibiotics highlights the need to do so without delay.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) microbiome and non-antibiotic approaches — emerging data highlight the role of host microbial communities and the need for alternatives to antibiotics: "Emerging data regarding the bacterial communities of the human bladder, bowel, and vagina suggests that depletion or alteration of the normal host microbiome may disrupt host innate barriers to infection and alter innate immune system function, contributing to the development of rUTI", and "Such disruptions in these communities may be the direct consequence of antibiotic treatments". "A better understanding of the relationship between the urinary microbiome and bladder health may fundamentally transform our earlier belief that urine is "sterile". Against "a worldwide crisis… due to rapid expansion of MDR bacteria", "current concepts of antibiotic stewardship have provoked a further initiative to develop agents outside the traditional pipeline of antibiotics", with "renewed vigor in pursuing non-antibiotic approaches to UTI treatment and prevention".

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115cj212]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Catheter-associated bacteriuria — evidence with short-term indwelling catheters: Biofilm formation along the indwelling catheter means all patients ultimately develop bacteriuria if the catheter remains in situ, with acquisition of bacteriuria 3%–5% per catheter day; antimicrobial therapy may delay but not prevent onset. Many individuals with short-term catheters (in place for < 30 days) do not develop bacteriuria because the catheter is removed prior to acquisition. In newly catheterized patients, 235 of 1497 (14.9%) developed bacteriuria (defined as ≥ 10² CFU/mL) at a mean of 6.4 ± 6.1 days; only 194 (7.7%) reported subjective symptoms and only 1 episode of bacteremia was considered probably attributable to bacteriuria. In a prospective randomized trial comparing silver coated with uncoated silicone catheters, 3036 patients with catheters in situ for ≥ 48 hours were enrolled; there were 334 (11%) UTIs, 16 with bacteremia (0.5% of catheters; 4.8% of bacteriuric patients). In a retrospective cohort of 444 episodes in 308 patients, 128 (41.6%) had catheter-associated UTI and 180 (58.4%) had ASB; only 3 episodes of bacteremia (0.7% of bacteriuric subjects) were directly attributable to bacteriuria, and > 90% of patients received antimicrobials within 30 days of the urine culture.

### Intermittent catheter techniques, strategies and designs for managing long-term bladder conditions [^1137kCg2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Intermittent catheterisation (IC) is a commonly recommended procedure for people with incomplete bladder emptying. Frequent complications are urinary tract infection (UTI), urethral trauma and discomfort during catheter use. Despite the many designs of intermittent catheter, including different lengths, materials and coatings, it is unclear which catheter techniques, strategies or designs affect the incidence of UTI and other complications, measures of satisfaction/quality of life and cost-effectiveness. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different catheterisation techniques, strategies and catheter designs, and their impact, on UTI and other complications, and measures of satisfaction/quality of life among adults and children whose long-term bladder condition is managed by intermittent catheterisation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 12 April 2021), the reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings, and we attempted to contact other investigators for unpublished data or for clarification.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or randomised cross-over trials comparing at least two different catheterisation techniques, strategies or catheter designs.

Data Collection and Analysis

As per standard Cochrane methodological procedures, two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Outcomes included the number of people with symptomatic urinary tract infections, complications such as urethral trauma/bleeding, comfort and ease of use of catheters, participant satisfaction and preference, quality of life measures and economic outcomes.

Main Results

We included 23 trials (1339 randomised participants), including twelve RCTs and eleven cross-over trials. Most were small (fewer than 60 participants completed), although three trials had more than 100 participants. Length of follow-up ranged from one month to 12 months and there was considerable variation in definitions of UTI. Most of the data from cross-over trials were not presented in a useable form for this review. Risk of bias was unclear in many domains due to insufficient information in the trial reports and several trials were judged to have a high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding and a high risk of attrition bias. The certainty of evidence was downgraded for risk of bias, and imprecision due to low numbers of participants. Aseptic versus clean technique We are uncertain if there is any difference between aseptic and clean techniques in the risk of symptomatic UTI because the evidence is low-certainty and the 95% confidence interval (CI) is consistent with possible benefit and possible harm (RR 1.20 95% CI 0.54 to 2.66; one study; 36 participants). We identified no data relating to the risk of adverse events comparing aseptic and clean techniques or participant satisfaction or preference. Single-use (sterile) catheter versus multiple-use (clean) We are uncertain if there is any difference between single-use and multiple-use catheters in terms of the risk of symptomatic UTI because the certainty of evidence is low and the 95% CI is consistent with possible benefit and possible harm (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.55, 1.74; two studies; 97 participants). One study comparing single-use catheters to multiple-use catheters reported zero adverse events in either group; no other adverse event data were reported for this comparison. We identified no data for participant satisfaction or preference. Hydrophilic-coated catheters versus uncoated catheters We are uncertain if there is any difference between hydrophilic and uncoated catheters in terms of the number of people with symptomatic UTI because the certainty of evidence is low and the 95% CI is consistent with possible benefit and possible harm (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.14; two studies; 98 participants). Uncoated catheters probably slightly reduce the risk of urethral trauma and bleeding compared to hydrophilic-coated catheters (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.87; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain if hydrophilic-coated catheters compared with uncoated catheters has any effect on participant satisfaction measured on a 0–10 scale (MD 0.7 higher, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.21; very low-certainty evidence; one study; 114 participants). Due to the paucity of data, we could not assess the certainty of evidence relating to participant preference (one cross-over trial of 29 participants reported greater preference for a hydrophilic-coated catheter (19/29) compared to an uncoated catheter (10/29)). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite a total of 23 trials, the paucity of useable data and uncertainty of the evidence means that it remains unclear whether the incidence of UTI or other complications is affected by use of aseptic or clean technique, single (sterile) or multiple-use (clean) catheters, coated or uncoated catheters or different catheter lengths. The current research evidence is uncertain and design and reporting issues are significant. More well-designed trials are needed. Such trials should include analysis of cost-effectiveness because there are likely to be substantial differences associated with the use of different catheterisation techniques and strategies, and catheter designs.

### Strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^116ocZaA]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Additional approaches for preventing CAUTI

These additional approaches are recommended for use in locations and/or populations within the hospital with unacceptably high CAUTI rates or standardized infection ratios (SIRs) despite implementation of the essential CAUTI prevention strategies listed previously.

Develop a protocol for standardizing diagnosis and management of postoperative urinary retention, including nurse-directed use of intermittent catheterization and use of bladder scanners, when appropriate as alternatives to indwelling urethral catheterization. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) If bladder scanners are used, clearly state indications, train nursing staff in their use, and disinfect between patients according to manufacturer's instructions.
Establish a system for analyzing and reporting data on catheter use and adverse events from catheter use. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Use cumulative attributable difference to identify high-risk units or hospitals (as described in Section 5). Measure process and outcomes measures (eg, standardized utilization ratio and standardized infection ratio) as described in Section 5. Define and monitor catheter harm (see Fig. 2) in addition to CAUTI, including catheter obstruction, unintended removal, catheter trauma, or reinsertion within 24 hours of removal. National focus has been on CAUTI prevention, but current metrics do not adequately capture overall catheter harm. Catheter harm includes infectious complications in addition to CAUTI (eg, secondary bacteremia, asymptomatic bacteriuria consequences) and noninfectious catheter complications (Fig. 2). Patients with an indwelling urethral catheter are 5 times more likely to experience noninfectious complications (eg, urethral injury, pain, or inadvertent catheter removal) than infectious complications. Current metrics used to monitor progress in the prevention of CAUTIs may underestimate both infectious and noninfectious catheter harm.
Establish a system for defining, analyzing, and reporting data on non–catheter-associated UTIs, particularly UTIs associated with devices used as alternatives to indwelling urethral catheters. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Non–catheter-associated UTIs are defined as UTIs that occur in hospitalized patients without an indwelling urethral catheter. These include but are not limited to patients who have had no urinary device at all, as well as those with external urinary catheters (EUCs), urinary stents, or urostomies, or who undergo intermittent catheterization, and thus are not captured by the NHSN CAUTI definition. As the incidence of CAUTI continues to decline, the proportion of non–catheter-associated UTIs is increasing in some hospitals. However, the national incidence of non–catheter-associated UTIs is not known because surveillance and reporting of these UTIs are not required by US Federal agencies. Non–catheter-associated UTIs are a common indication for antibiotics in hospitalized patients, and this metric could provide important information as healthcare facilities consider the risks and benefits of newer alternatives to urinary catheters with currently limited published data on adverse events (eg, EUCs for women) to help inform when the benefit outweighs the potential risk for specific patient populations.

Urine Volume

When collecting urine for microbiome analysis, a crucial factor is the volume of urine required for adequate bacterial DNA quantification. The microbial burden in voided versus catheterized urine plays a significant role in this. In the case of voided urine, which typically has a higher level of microbial contamination, studies have shown that extracting bacterial DNA from as little as 1–2 mL of urine can be 85% effective. On the other hand, urine collected via catheter generally contains a lower microbial biomass. To effectively extract and amplify bacterial DNA from such samples, larger volumes are recommended. Although the precise volume needed to yield a substantial amount of bacterial DNA is not definitively known, volumes of 30–50 mL are advised for catheter-collected urine, based on the success of similar approaches in previous research involving bladder urinary and genitourinary microbiota studies.

### Standardization of microbiome studies for urolithiasis: an international consensus agreement [^111wbace]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2021). High credibility.

The panel agreed that the hierarchy of urine quality for studies for scientific rigour would be ideally UUT urine, followed by catheterized or aspirated urine, then mid-stream voided urine. To understand the mechanistic microbiology of the urinary tract, sampling from UUT or catheterized urine must be performed if possible. If a researcher only has access to voided urine specimens — such as studies involving control patients in whom UUT or catheterized urine is not feasible to obtain — the researchers must be aware of the limitations associated with interpreting the mechanistic basis of these data. Mid-stream urine specimens are often not 'clean' and these specimens primarily sample the distal urethra with periurethral and other contaminants in urine specimens from men and distal urethral, periurethral and vulval contaminants in urine specimens from women –. The consortium recognizes that samples derived from different urinary anatomical niches between patients (for example, UUT in one patient with voided urine in another) would not provide an accurate comparison from a microbiota analytical perspective.

For nomenclature purposes, the consortium agreed that microbiome data from samples of voided urine should be referred to as 'genitourinary microbiome', data from catheterized urine samples should be known as 'bladder urine microbiome' and data from the UUT as 'kidney urinary microbiome'.

### Management of asymptomatic bacteriuria in Non-catheterized adults [^113fEjAS]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is important given the prevalence of the condition, associated risks in certain patient populations, and the risks associated with inappropriate antibiotic administration. Generally, screening and treatment is only recommended in pregnant women and in those undergoing urologic procedures that will violate the urothelium. Knowing the appropriate time to screen and treat ASB is critical for managing high-risk patients and preventing the growth of antibiotic resistance. Recent research into the protective nature of avirulent strains of Escherichia coli might offer a new approach to management of ASB.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) bladder cancer screening — scope of review, screening tests, and evidence gaps notes that to update its 2004 recommendation on screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic persons, the USPSTF reviewed the current state of the evidence and identified new evidence that addresses previously identified gaps. Primary care–feasible screening tests for bladder cancer include urinalysis for hematuria, urine cytology, and tests for other urine biomarkers, but no evidence was found regarding the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests in asymptomatic persons. The USPSTF found no direct evidence that bladder cancer screening is associated with improved health outcomes compared with no screening, and the USPSTF could not evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for screen-detected bladder cancer because of a lack of studies that compare clinical outcomes associated with treatment versus no treatment.

Discussion

Urinary catheters are placed in 60% of critically ill patients and 5–22% of residents in long-term care facilities –. While catheterization often represents a necessary medical intervention, placement of the catheter alters the bladder environment and provides a nidus for bacterial colonization. Bacteriuria incidence increases 3–7% each day the catheter is in place, resulting in colonization for nearly all patients with long-term catheters. Further, 25% of all sepsis isolates can be traced back to urinary pathogens. Accordingly, long-term catheters are a major source for morbidity and mortality for the patients in which they reside, with some long-term care facilities reporting over 50% of bacteraemic episodes attributed to pathogens associated with CAUTI. It is critical that we improve our understanding of these infections to reduce the burden of this persistent and pervasive disease.

Essential practices for preventing CAUTI: Recommended for all acute-care hospitals

Perform a CAUTI risk assessment and implement an organization-wide program to identify and remove catheters that are no longer necessary using 1 or more methods documented to be effective. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Develop and implement institutional policy requiring periodic, usually daily, review of the necessity of continued catheterization. Consider utilizing electronic or other types of reminders (see Supplementary Content, Appendices 2 and 3 online) of the presence of a catheter and required criteria for continued use. Examples include the following: Automatic stop orders requiring review of current indications and renewal of order for continuation of the indwelling catheter. Standardized reminders of persistent catheters together with current catheter indications (see Supplementary Content, Appendices 2 and 3 online) targeting either physicians or nurses. Nursing and physician staff conduct daily reviews during rounds of all patients with urinary catheters to ascertain necessity of continuing catheter use.
Provide appropriate infrastructure for preventing CAUTI.(Quality of evidence: LOW) Ensure that the supplies for following best practices for managing urinary issues are readily available to staff in each unit, including bladder scanners, non–catheter-incontinence management supplies (urinals, garments, bed pads, skin products), male and female external urinary catheters, straight urinary catheters, and indwelling catheters including the option of catheters with coude tips. Ensure that non-catheter urinary management supplies are as easy to obtain for bedside use as indwelling urinary catheters. Ensure the physical capability for urinary catheters with tubes attached to patients (eg, indwelling urinary catheters and some external urinary catheters [EUCs]) to be positioned on beds, wheelchairs, at an appropriate height and without kinking for patients in their rooms and during transport.
Provide and implement evidence-based protocols to address multiple steps of the urinary catheter life cycle (Fig. 1): catheter appropriateness (step 0), insertion technique (step 1), maintenance care (step 2), and prompt removal (step 3) when no longer appropriate. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Adapt and implement evidence-based criteria for acceptable indications for indwelling urethral catheter use, which may be embedded as standardized clinical-decision support tools within electronic medical record (EMR) ordering systems. Expert-consensus–derived indications for indwelling catheter use have been developed, although research that assesses the appropriateness of these uses is limited. The limited examples of appropriate indications for indwelling urethral catheter include the following: Perioperative use for selected surgical procedures, such as urologic surgery or surgery on contiguous structures of the genitourinary tract, prolonged surgery, large-volume infusions or diuretics during surgery, or intraoperative monitoring of urine output is needed. Notably, if a catheter is placed intraoperatively simply due to the duration of surgery (eg, > 3 hours) or for decompression to address a specific surgical approach, then such catheters should be removed at the end of the surgical case. Hourly assessment of urine output in ICU patients when used clinically to modify therapies frequently such as volume resuscitation, diuresis, and vasopressors. ICU care alone is not an appropriate justification for indwelling catheter placement; a specific clinical indication is still needed. Management of acute urinary retention, (eg, new retention of urine with postvoid residual bladder volume > 500 cm³ by bladder scanner if no symptoms, or > 300 cm³ if having symptoms such as bladder pain or fullness, persistent urge to void, new incontinence or leaking, or only able to have frequent small voids) Assistance in healing of open pressure ulcers or skin grafts for selected patients with urinary incontinence when alternative supplies for protective wound or managing incontinence (eg, external urinary catheters, wound dressings) are not feasible. Facilities may allow exceptions as part of a palliative and/or comfort care regimen, if use of the catheter addresses a specific goal of the patient, such as reducing the need for frequent bed or garment changes or preventing pain that cannot be well managed.
Ensure that only trained HCP insert urinary catheters and that competency is assessed regularly.(Quality of evidence: LOW) Require supervision by experienced HCP when trainees insert and remove catheters to reduce the risk of infectious and traumatic complications related to urinary catheter placement. – Given much higher rates of CAUTI when catheters are placed by trainees such as medical students, educational programs may need to reassess at which point in medical training and which trainees specifically are most appropriate for being involved in urinary catheter insertion in patients compared to simulation models only.
Ensure that supplies necessary for aseptic technique for catheter insertion are available and conveniently located. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Implement a system for documenting the following in the patient record: physician order for catheter placement, indications for catheter insertion, date and time of catheter insertion, name of individual who inserted catheter, nursing documentation of placement, daily presence of a catheter and maintenance care tasks, and date and time of catheter removal. Record criteria for removal and justification for continued use. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Record in a standard format for data collection and quality improvement purposes and keep accessible documentation of catheter placement (including indication) and removal. If available, utilize electronic documentation that is searchable. Consider nurse-driven urinary catheter removal protocols for first trial of void without an indwelling catheter when the indication for placement has resolved (see Essential Practices, 3). These protocols can be implemented as part of the routine urinary catheter placement order or as an expected reminder (or "standing order") from the nurse to the physician in rounds. These protocols should list some exceptions or "opt outs", such as for postoperative urology surgery patients or patients for whom a catheter required urology consult for placement that should not be removed without physician order.
Ensure that sufficiently trained HCP and technology resources are available to support surveillance for catheter use and outcomes.(Quality of evidence: LOW)
Perform surveillance for CAUTI if indicated based on facility risk assessment or regulatory requirements as described in Section 5.(Quality of evidence: LOW)
Standardize urine culturing by adapting an institutional protocol for appropriate indications for urine cultures in patients with and without an indwelling catheter.– Consider incorporating these indications into the EMR, and review indications for ordering urine cultures in CAUTI risk assessment.(Quality of evidence: LOW)
