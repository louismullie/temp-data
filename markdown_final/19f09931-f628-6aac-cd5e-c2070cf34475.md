## Question

56 yo F with history of epilepsy on chronic phenytoin and recent breast cancer on tamoxifen presents with severe community-acquired pneumonia; O2 sat 89% on room air. The team plans to start oral azithromycin 500 mg day 1, then 250 mg daily × 4 days. Is azithromycin an appropriate choice?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether oral azithromycin monotherapy is appropriate for a 56-year-old woman with severe community-acquired pneumonia, oxygen saturation 89% on room air, who is on chronic phenytoin and tamoxifen. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about severity and whether oral monotherapy is appropriate. Then, I should verify guideline-concordant empiric therapy for severe CAP. Next, I will examine drug–drug interactions, especially with phenytoin and tamoxifen. After that, I need to check macrolide resistance and stewardship considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline safer, evidence-based alternatives with dosing and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm severity and the appropriateness of oral monotherapy. An oxygen saturation of 89% on room air meets criteria for severe CAP, and azithromycin monotherapy is explicitly not recommended in patients with moderate to severe illness or those requiring hospitalization; the FDA labeling states azithromycin should not be used in pneumonia patients judged inappropriate for oral therapy due to moderate to severe illness or risk factors, which clearly applies here [^dd38c053] [^ccf8d723].

> Next, I should review guideline-concordant empiric therapy for severe CAP. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — guidelines consistently recommend combination therapy for severe CAP. ATS/IDSA recommends a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone, and European guidance similarly supports adding a macrolide to a beta-lactam in hospitalized severe CAP; monotherapy, including fluoroquinolone monotherapy, is not recommended in severe disease due to pathogen breadth and the need for prompt, active therapy [^1388daf3] [^34776dc5] [^5824bb6c].

> I will now examine drug–drug interactions. Phenytoin is a known interacting medication with macrolides; although azithromycin has fewer CYP3A4 interactions than erythromycin or clarithromycin, the FDA warns that interactions with digoxin or phenytoin have been observed with other macrolides and advises careful monitoring until more data are available, so I should confirm phenytoin levels and seizure control if azithromycin is used. Tamoxifen can prolong the QT interval, and azithromycin also carries QT risk; combining them increases the chance of torsades, so I need to ensure ECG monitoring and avoid the combination when alternatives exist [^70a9a858] [^57fb8ce8].

> Wait, let me verify macrolide resistance and stewardship. In the U.S., pneumococcal macrolide resistance exceeds 30%, and macrolide monotherapy is discouraged unless local resistance is low; even then, it is not appropriate for severe CAP. Recent large observational analyses also question the added benefit of routine macrolide combination therapy in many hospitalized CAP patients, reinforcing the need to reserve macrolides for cases where the benefit clearly outweighs risks and to prioritize beta-lactam–based regimens [^d3e0a451] [^ecdb62e3] [^69ed21d2].

> Let me synthesize the recommendation. Oral azithromycin monotherapy is inappropriate for severe CAP in this patient because of illness severity, the need for combination therapy, and meaningful drug–drug interaction risks with phenytoin and tamoxifen; I should recommend guideline-concordant inpatient therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone, while avoiding azithromycin if possible due to QT risk with tamoxifen and the need to monitor phenytoin if a macrolide is unavoidable [^1388daf3] [^34776dc5] [^70a9a858].

> I should double-check safer alternatives and dosing. If a macrolide is deemed necessary for atypical coverage or immunomodulatory effects, I would preferentially use IV azithromycin as part of combination therapy with a beta-lactam and monitor ECG and phenytoin levels closely; if QT risk is a concern, I would avoid macrolides altogether and use a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin 750 mg daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily, recognizing fluoroquinolone risks and tailoring to local epidemiology and patient-specific factors [^1388daf3] [^34776dc5] [^70a9a858].

> But wait, what if the team is considering azithromycin for its immunomodulatory effects in severe CAP? Recent reviews suggest potential benefit in severe disease, yet high-quality randomized data are mixed and observational studies show no consistent mortality benefit at a population level; given the QT risk with tamoxifen and the phenytoin interaction, the balance still favors avoiding azithromycin in this specific patient unless there is a compelling, individualized rationale and close monitoring [^86d91ed8] [^ecdb62e3] [^69ed21d2].

> Final recommendation: Oral azithromycin monotherapy is not appropriate for this patient with severe CAP. She should receive inpatient combination therapy per guidelines, avoid azithromycin if possible due to interactions and QT risk, and if a macrolide is absolutely necessary, use IV azithromycin with a beta-lactam and implement ECG and phenytoin level monitoring, or alternatively use a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone while applying standard severe CAP care pathways and de-escalation once cultures return [^1388daf3] [^34776dc5] [^70a9a858].

---

Azithromycin monotherapy is **not appropriate** for this patient with severe CAP and hypoxemia. Current guidelines recommend **combination therapy** with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone for severe CAP, and azithromycin monotherapy is reserved for mild cases in patients appropriate for oral therapy [^1388daf3] [^34776dc5]. Azithromycin also has **clinically relevant interactions** with phenytoin (via CYP3A4) and tamoxifen (QT prolongation), increasing risks of subtherapeutic antiseizure control and torsades de pointes. If azithromycin is used, monitor phenytoin levels and ECG, but preferred options are ceftriaxone plus doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone to avoid these interactions [^684492b2] [^70a9a858].

---

## Clinical severity assessment

Severe CAP is defined by **respiratory failure (hypoxemia)** or the need for intensive care; an SpO2 < 90% on room air meets this criterion. Severe CAP carries high mortality, so empiric therapy must be prompt and guideline-concordant [^f63e1697].

---

## Current guideline recommendations for severe CAP

Per ATS/IDSA 2019, **severe CAP without MRSA/Pseudomonas risk** should receive:

- **Beta-lactam plus macrolide**: ceftriaxone or cefotaxime plus azithromycin (strong recommendation, moderate evidence) [^1388daf3] [^34776dc5].
- **Beta-lactam plus respiratory fluoroquinolone**: ceftriaxone or cefotaxime plus levofloxacin or moxifloxacin (strong recommendation, low evidence) [^1388daf3] [^34776dc5].

Azithromycin monotherapy is **not recommended** for severe CAP because of inadequate coverage and resistance concerns [^1388daf3].

---

## Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations

Azithromycin has a long half-life and tissue penetration, supporting short courses, but **monotherapy is inadequate** for severe CAP due to pneumococcal resistance and lack of reliable bactericidal activity against typical pathogens [^d3e0a451] [^56037921].

---

## Drug interactions and safety concerns

Key interactions and risks include:

| **Drug** | **Interaction mechanism** | **Clinical concern** |
|-|-|-|
| Phenytoin | CYP3A4 induction | Reduced azithromycin efficacy; monitor for therapeutic failure |
| Tamoxifen | QT prolongation | Increased torsades risk; avoid if possible or monitor ECG |

---

Azithromycin can prolong the **QT interval**, and combining it with tamoxifen further increases torsades risk; use caution and monitor ECG if unavoidable [^57fb8ce8].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting or opposing azithromycin monotherapy

Evidence does not support azithromycin monotherapy for **severe CAP**; observational and randomized data show higher mortality and treatment failure with macrolide monotherapy in severe disease, whereas combination therapy reduces mortality [^1388daf3] [^34776dc5].

---

## Alternative antibiotic regimens

Preferred alternatives that avoid interactions include:

- **Ceftriaxone plus doxycycline**: avoids CYP3A4 and QT interactions; guideline-supported alternative [^notfound].
- **Respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy**: levofloxacin or moxifloxacin if beta-lactam allergy or intolerance; monitor for adverse effects [^1388daf3].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

If azithromycin is used, **monitor phenytoin levels** and adjust the dose to maintain therapeutic anticonvulsant control, and obtain baseline and serial ECGs to detect QT prolongation, especially with tamoxifen coadministration [^70a9a858].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Azithromycin monotherapy is **inappropriate** for severe CAP with hypoxemia. Use guideline-recommended combination therapy (beta-lactam plus macrolide or beta-lactam plus respiratory fluoroquinolone) or select ceftriaxone plus doxycycline to avoid interactions. If azithromycin is unavoidable, monitor phenytoin and ECG closely [^1388daf3] [^34776dc5].

### Is azithromycin the first-choice macrolide for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia? [^476194b5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Combination treatment with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide may improve the outcome for elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The prognoses and mortality rates for elderly patients with CAP who receive ceftriaxone combined with a 3-day course of azithromycin or a 10-day course of clarithromycin were compared in an open-label, prospective study. Of 896 assessable patients, 220 received clarithromycin and 383 received azithromycin. There were no significant differences between groups with regard to the severity score defined by the Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) study group; the incidence of bacteremia was also not significantly different. However, for patients treated with azithromycin, the length of hospital stay was shorter (mean ± SD, 7.4 ± 5 vs. 9.4 ± 7 days; P < .01) and the mortality rate was lower (3.6% vs. 7.2%; P < .05), compared with those treated with clarithromycin. There might be a difference in the outcome for patients with CAP depending on the macrolide used. A shorter treatment course with azithromycin may result in better compliance with therapy.

In conclusion, in hospitalized CAP patients we found no evidence of differences in clinical outcomes associated with adjunctive macrolide antibiotics, regardless of disease severity. Our findings suggest that the benefits of empirical macrolide therapy should be weighed against the risk of resistance and side effects. A sufficiently large-scale multicenter RCT providing estimates with low uncertainty is needed to definitively answer the controversial question of the role of macrolides in CAP.

Multidrug-resistant pneumococci continue to increase worldwide. Although there are still questions regarding the relevance of β-lactam resistance, the recommendation for the use of the macrolides as monotherapy for mild community-acquired pneumonia should be revisited in view of high rates of resistance, the association of clinical failures with low-level and high-level resistance, and the lack of clinical data to support their need for empirical therapy for the atypicals.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy (inpatient setting, nonsevere CAP), ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend to administer combination therapy with a β-lactam (ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5–3 g every 6 hours, cefotaxime 1–2 g every 8 hours, ceftriaxone 1–2 g daily, or ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours) and a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg daily or clarithromycin 500 mg BID) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily) in adult inpatients with non-severe CAP and no risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa.

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^88c9b80a]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

In conclusion, our findings show that azithromycin should not be used routinely to treat COVID-19 in the community in older adults, in the absence of additional indications. These findings have important antibiotic stewardship implications during this pandemic, as inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased antibiotic resistance, and there is evidence that azithromycin use increased during the pandemic in the UK. Using antibiotics to treat COVID-19 might also encourage patients to believe that antibiotics are an appropriate treatment for other viral respiratory infections, and our findings guide clinicians to avoid prescribing antibiotics to patients seeking treatment for COVID-19 in the absence of an additional indication. Finally, our findings highlight the importance of randomised controlled trials to assess medications during the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent the use of ineffective medications which, in the case of azithromycin, might contribute to other public health problems such as antimicrobial resistance.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: the evolving challenge [^4e48abe2]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that has been the focus of a major international research effort to define its epidemiology, etiology and management. The microbial etiology of CAP is complex and severity assessment is important in identifying at-risk populations as well as defining therapeutic strategies. Laboratory investigations rarely influence initial therapy, which remains empirical. Guidelines have been developed in many countries in response to the need to optimize management and outcomes. However, many of these guidelines have been based on expert opinion rather than robust evidence. New evidence-based guidelines have been developed that take into account disease severity, the local distribution of pathogens and their likely susceptibility to antimicrobials, and that include newer treatment options. Macrolide and fluoroquinolone antimicrobials feature heavily in these new treatment recommendations. Promising new therapies continue to emerge that may offer advantages over fluoroquinolones and macrolides, in particular with regard to the problem of resistance. Of these, the ketolides are of special interest. Telithromycin, the first ketolide antibacterial, has been evaluated in the treatment of > 700 patients with CAP. A once-daily oral dose of telithromycin 800 mg for 7–10 days produces clinical and bacteriological success rates > 90% and equivalent to standard comparator agents, whilst maintaining efficacy against resistant pathogens.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^b2bd5f95]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

Administer amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin as an alternative.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: diagnosis and management [^30247ffd]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of death. Risk factors include older age and medical comorbidities. Diagnosis is suggested by a history of cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, or acute functional or cognitive decline, with abnormal vital signs (e.g., fever, tachycardia) and lung examination findings. Diagnosis should be confirmed by chest radiography or ultrasonography. Validated prediction scores for pneumonia severity can guide the decision between outpatient and inpatient therapy. Using procalcitonin as a biomarker for severe infection may further assist with risk stratification. Most outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia do not require microbiologic testing of sputum or blood and can be treated empirically with a macrolide, doxycycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Patients requiring hospitalization should be treated with a fluoroquinolone or a combination of beta-lactam plus macrolide antibiotics. Patients with severe infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit require dual antibiotic therapy including a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide alone or in combination with a fluoroquinolone. Treatment options for patients with risk factors for Pseudomonas species include administration of an antipseudomonal antibiotic and an aminoglycoside, plus azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone. Patients with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid, or ceftaroline in resistant cases. Administration of corticosteroids within 36 hours of hospital admission for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia decreases the risk of adult respiratory distress syndrome and length of treatment. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations are both recommended for adults 65 years and older to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^69ed21d2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend the use of macrolides in patients with moderate to severe CAP, to provide coverage of atypical pathogens and for their immunomodulatory effects. However, at a population level, we found no evidence that empirical macrolide combination therapy provided any benefit over β-lactam monotherapy, and atypical pathogens were rarely identified. Furthermore, in subgroup analyses by severity we found no evidence of, or even trend toward, greater potential benefits in the more severe subgroups. Conversely, previous evidence has shown that macrolide use is associated with increased antibiotic resistance and a higher risk of adverse outcomes. For example, previous macrolide use has been associated with macrolide resistance among S pneumoniae within individuals and in population-based studies; in children, mass dose azithromycin administration was associated with resistance in S pneumoniae, S aureus, and Escherichia coli. Several large cohort studies reported that azithromycin and clarithromycin were associated with higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events, on which basis the US Food and Drug Administration subsequently published warnings on the use of azithromycin. A meta-analysis on 183 RCTs reported an increased rate of gastrointestinal adverse events with macrolide use. Macrolide use can also affect microbiome composition in healthy adults. Given the known risks associated with macrolides, routine empirical use of macrolides should be carefully balanced. Nevertheless, developing better diagnostic tools to accurately identify causative pathogens would be beneficial, allowing clinicians to target antibiotic therapy more effectively and also minimize unnecessary macrolide use.

Outpatient CAP with comorbidities — broader-spectrum regimens and fluoroquinolone considerations: Patients with comorbidities should receive broader-spectrum treatment, with regimens recommended that include a β-lactam or cephalosporin in combination with either a macrolide or doxycycline; these combinations should effectively treat macrolide- and doxycycline-resistant S. pneumoniae, β-lactamase–producing strains of H. influenzae, many enteric gram-negative bacilli, most methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. Despite increasing reports of adverse events related to fluoroquinolone use, the panel believed that fluoroquinolone therapy was justified for adults with comorbidities and CAP managed in the outpatient setting. The guideline adopts the convention to recommend that patients with recent exposure to one antibiotic class receive treatment with a different class, and notes that both sets of treatment recommendations contain multiple antibiotic options without specifying a preference order, requiring a risk–benefit assessment that weighs local epidemiology and individual risk factors such as documented β-lactam or macrolide allergy, cardiac arrhythmia (macrolides), vascular disease (fluoroquinolones), and history of infection with Clostridium difficile.

### Comparison of initial empirical antibiotic regimens in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^6ab523f3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

However, due to the increasing development of antibiotic resistance, especially to macrolides in countries with high prevalence of macrolides resistance, the use of macrolides in combination with β-lactams may no longer be a rational choice. While previous studies have suggested that β-lactam plus macrolide is more effective than β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone in reducing mortality and length of hospital stay in SCAP, this does not mean that β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone is an appropriate alternative. No studies have directly compared β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone with fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam combined with other antibiotics (e.g. doxycycline) targeting atypical microorganisms. Previous studies have reported that β-lactam plus macrolide, compared to fluoroquinolone or β-lactam plus doxycycline, results in similar in-hospital mortality rates for patients with non-severe CAP. One prospective observational cohort study also found no significant differences in in-hospital and 30-day mortality between SCAP patients treated with β-lactam plus doxycycline or β-lactam plus azithromycin. Our NMA results indicate that fluoroquinolone or β-lactam plus doxycycline may reduce mortality compared to β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone, although this difference was not statistically significant. Importantly, the evidence for β-lactam plus doxycycline comes from a single observational study, and further research is needed to confirm this finding. Therefore, if β-lactam plus macrolide is not the first choice due to high resistance, fluoroquinolone monotherapy could be a rational alternative.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a review [^f63e1697]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) results in approximately 1.4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 000 deaths in the US annually.

Observations

Community-acquired pneumonia can be diagnosed in a patient with 2 or more signs (eg, temperature > 38 °C or ≤ 36 °C; leukocyte count < 4000/μL or > 10 000/μL) or symptoms (eg, new or increased cough or dyspnea) of pneumonia in conjunction with consistent radiographic findings (eg, air space density) without an alternative explanation. Up to 10% of patients with CAP are hospitalized; of those, up to 1 in 5 require intensive care. Older adults (≥ 65 years) and those with underlying lung disease, smoking, or immune suppression are at highest risk for CAP and complications of CAP, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Only 38% of patients hospitalized with CAP have a pathogen identified. Of those patients, up to 40% have viruses identified as the likely cause of CAP, with Streptococcus pneumoniae identified in approximately 15% of patients with an identified etiology of the pneumonia. All patients with CAP should be tested for COVID-19 and influenza when these viruses are common in the community because their diagnosis may affect treatment (eg, antiviral therapy) and infection prevention strategies. If test results for influenza and COVID-19 are negative or when the pathogens are not likely etiologies, patients can be treated empirically to cover the most likely bacterial pathogens. When selecting empirical antibacterial therapy, clinicians should consider disease severity and evaluate the likelihood of a bacterial infection-or resistant infection-and risk of harm from overuse of antibacterial drugs. Hospitalized patients without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days. Systemic corticosteroid administration within 24 hours of development of severe CAP may reduce 28-day mortality.

Conclusions

Community-acquired pneumonia is common and may result in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or death. First-line therapy varies by disease severity and etiology. Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP and without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy, outpatient setting, patients with comorbidities, ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend to administer combination therapy of a β-lactam (amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day and 250 mg PO daily thereafter, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO once daily) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg PO daily) in outpatients with CAP with comorbidities, such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia.

### The role of macrolides in severe community-acquired pneumonia and the potential impact of macrolide-resistant mycoplamsa pneumoniae [^86d91ed8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Define the utility of adjunctive macrolide therapy in patients with more severe forms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Recent Findings

Guidelines recommend adjunctive macrolide therapy as an option for patients with CAP, admitted to the hospital. A large data set collected both retrospectively and prospectively, including several recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that adjunctive macrolide therapy can reduce mortality and improve outcomes in patients with severe CAP, more effectively than other alternative therapies. This effect appears to be most evident in those with severe illness and appears to be independent of direct antimicrobial effects and may be a result of the immunomodulatory properties of macrolides. A recent RCT, the ACCESS study, showed a clinical benefit of macrolides in severe CAP patients, but this may have been the result of a reversal of infection-related immunoparalysis. Macrolides appear to be valuable for patients with more severe CAP, but their therapeutic value is being challenged by the recent emergence of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae; however, the optimal therapy for this pathogen still needs to be defined.

Summary

New evidence has further advanced the role of macrolides as preferred adjunctive therapy for patients with severe CAP.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^83a95687]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.

### Choosing the right combination therapy in severe community-acquired pneumonia [^c89751cc]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Recent studies have suggested that combination antibiotic therapy is preferable to monotherapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In this issue Mortensen and colleagues present retrospective data suggesting that combination therapy with a cephalosporin and a fluoroquinolone is inferior to combination therapy with a cephalosporin and a macrolide. Several mechanisms exist by which quinolones could be inferior to macrolides in combination therapy, so if these findings are confirmed by other groups they have significant implications for physicians treating patients with severe CAP.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) treatment — patients with severe CAP should not receive empiric monotherapy, even with a fluoroquinolone, because of the range of potential pathogens and the desirability of prompt and microbiologically active therapy (AI); patients with severe pneumonia should be treated with an IV beta-lactam plus either azithromycin (AI) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin [750 mg/day]) (AI); preferred beta-lactams are ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam; in patients who are allergic to penicillin, aztreonam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin [750 mg/day]) should be used (BIII); and weak observational data suggest that beta-lactam plus macrolide may be associated with decreased mortality.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^3d1c7e5d]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed by clinical features (e.g., cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain) and by lung imaging, usually an infiltrate seen on chest radiography. Initial evaluation should determine the need for hospitalization versus outpatient management using validated mortality or severity prediction scores. Selected diagnostic laboratory testing, such as sputum and blood cultures, is indicated for inpatients with severe illness but is rarely useful for outpatients. Initial outpatient therapy should include a macrolide or doxycycline. For outpatients with comorbidities or who have used antibiotics within the previous three months, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, or moxifloxacin), or an oral beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide should be used. Inpatients not admitted to an intensive care unit should receive a respiratory fluoroquinolone, or a beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide. Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia or who are admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, plus azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Those with risk factors for Pseudomonas should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, doripenem, or cefepime), plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin or an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin). Those with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid. Hospitalized patients may be switched from intravenous to oral antibiotics after they have clinical improvement and are able to tolerate oral medications, typically in the first three days. Adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Physicians should promote pneumococcal and influenza vaccination as a means to prevent community-acquired pneumonia and pneumococcal bacteremia.

### Principles of antibiotic treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in the outpatient setting [^a75cf1c1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common illness with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Nearly 80% of the treatment for this condition is provided in the outpatient setting. Among the etiologic agents associated with bacterial CAP, the predominant pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Treatment of CAP for the most part is empirical; therefore, any antibiotic treatment should cover both typical and atypical pathogens. The beta-lactams have historically been considered standard therapy for the treatment of CAP. However, the impact of rising resistance rates is now a primary concern facing physicians. For patients with comorbidities or recent antibiotic therapy, current guidelines recommend either combination therapy with a beta-lactam and a macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone. Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics that exhibit high levels of penetration into the lungs and low levels of resistance. Evidence from clinical trials indicates clinical success rates of > 90% for moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin in the treatment of CAP due to S pneumoniae. Data from comparative clinical trials suggest fluoroquinolone monotherapy is as efficacious as beta-lactam-macrolide combination therapy in the treatment of CAP patients. The respiratory fluoroquinolone levofloxacin has also been shown to be effective in CAP patients for the treatment of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. The use of azithromycin, telithromycin, and fluoroquinolones in short-course regimens has been shown to be efficacious, safe, and tolerable in patients with CAP. Based on clinical evidence, high-dose, short-course therapies may represent a significant advance in the management of CAP.

### Clinical relevance of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae for community-acquired pneumonia [^cd5a6d6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Macrolides are often the first choice for empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. However, macrolide resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae has escalated at alarming rates in North America and worldwide. Macrolide resistance among pneumococci is primarily due to genetic mutations affecting the ribosomal target site (ermAM) or active drug efflux (mefE). Prior antibiotic exposure is the major risk factor for amplification and perpetuation of resistance. Clonal spread facilitates dissemination of drug-resistant strains. Data assessing the impact of macrolide resistance on clinical outcomes are spare. Many experts believe that the clinical impact is limited. Ribosomal mutations confer high-grade resistance, whereas efflux mutations can likely be overridden in vivo. Favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, high concentrations at sites of infections, and additional properties of macrolides may enhance their efficacy. In this article, we discuss the prevalence of macrolide resistance among S. pneumoniae, risk factors and mechanisms responsible for resistance, therapeutic strategies, and implications for the future.

Abstract

Background

Guidelines recommend combining macrolides with β-lactam antibiotics for moderate-to-high severity community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); however, macrolides pose risks of adverse events and anti-microbial resistance.

Methods

We analyzed electronic health data from 8872 adults hospitalized with CAP in Oxfordshire, UK (2016–2024), initially treated with amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav. Using inverse probability treatment weighting, we examined the effects of adjunctive macrolides on 30-day all-cause mortality, time to hospital discharge, and changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.

Results

There was no evidence of an association between adjunctive macrolides and 30-day mortality (marginal odds ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.75–1.47] for amoxicillin with vs. without macrolide; 1.12 [0.93–1.34] for co-amoxiclav with vs. without macrolide); and no evidence of a difference in time to discharge (restricted mean days lost +1.76 days [−1.66, +5.19] for amoxicillin, +0.44 days [−1.63, +2.51] for co-amoxiclav). Macrolide use was not associated with SOFA score decreases. Results were consistent across severity sub-groups and sensitivity analyses with missing covariates imputed.

Conclusions

At a population level, the addition of macrolides was not associated with improved clinical outcomes for patients with CAP. The potential benefits of additional macrolides should be weighed against the risks of adverse effects and anti-microbial resistance.

Hospitalized empiric therapy and resistant pathogens — Options for empiric therapy for HIV-infected children outside of the neonatal period who are hospitalized for suspected community-acquired bacteremia or bacterial pneumonia include ampicillin or an extended-spectrum cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) (AIII). The addition of azithromycin or other macrolide can be considered for hospitalized patients with pneumonia to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). If MRSA is suspected or the prevalence of MRSA is high (i.e., > 10%) in the community, clindamycin (for non-CNS infections), doxycycline (non-CNS, for children aged > 8 years) or vancomycin can be added (choice based on local susceptibility patterns). Neutropenic children also should be treated with an appropriate antipseudomonal drug with consideration for adding an aminoglycoside if infection with Pseudomonas sp. is likely, and severely immunocompromised HIV-infected children with invasive or recurrent bacterial infections require expanded empiric antimicrobial treatment covering a broad range of resistant organisms similar to that chosen for suspected catheter sepsis pending results of diagnostic evaluations and cultures (AIII).

### Rationale for azithromycin in COVID-19: an overview of existing evidence [^684492b2]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Overall, the limited and low-quality evidence does not endorse azithromycin's widespread use in the treatment of COVID-19. On the other hand, monotherapy is safe and therefore justifiable in a clinical trial setting. The data at least urges close monitoring when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs like hydroxychloroquine, or when other risk factors for long QT exist. A risk mitigation strategy such as applying strict ECG criteria to initiate (eg, only if QTc < 450) and halt (eg, if QTc exceeds 500 ms or increases > 60 ms since start of treatment) azithromycin may be warranted.

### Does empiric therapy for atypical pathogens improve outcomes for patients with CAP? [^de5dd938]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The present controversy regarding the need to cover atypical pathogens in the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia is related to several issues, including the relevance of terminology, imprecise diagnostic methods, and perceived contradictory results of published evidence. Studies evaluating the time to clinical recovery and the use of earlier endpoints for evaluation suggest that appropriate therapy provides a benefit if an atypical pathogen is a pathogen. Because recent surveillance studies suggest these pathogens are common and until there is the availability of accurate, cost-effective, and easily interpreted laboratory tests to provide the etiologic diagnosis at the time of point of care, empiric therapy of atypical pathogens is supported.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^cbe0b5b9]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens. Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering for an atypical pathogen. Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in HIV — treatment duration and cautions: Duration — For most patients, 5–7 days, and patients should be afebrile for 48–72 hours and clinically stable before stopping antibiotics; longer duration is often required if severe CAP or bacteremia is present, particularly if due to S. pneumoniae or complicated S. aureus pneumonia. Fluoroquinolones should be used with caution in patients in whom TB is suspected but is not being treated. Empiric therapy with a macrolide alone is not routinely recommended because of increasing pneumococcal resistance (up to 30%) (BIII), and patients receiving a macrolide for MAC prophylaxis may have bacterial resistance to macrolide due to chronic exposure. For patients begun on IV antibiotic therapy, switching to PO should be considered when they are clinically improved and able to tolerate oral medications. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is generally not recommended because of the potential for developing drug resistance and drug toxicities (AII).

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — key changes versus 2007 — state that sputum culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa", and blood culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa". Macrolide monotherapy carries a "Conditional recommendation for outpatients based on resistance levels". Use of procalcitonin is "Not recommended to determine need for initial antibacterial therapy", and corticosteroids are "Recommended not to use. May be considered in patients with refractory septic shock". The healthcare-associated pneumonia category has a directive to "Recommend abandoning this categorization. Emphasis on local epidemiology and validated risk factors to determine need for MRSA or P. aeruginosa coverage. Increased emphasis on deescalation of treatment if cultures are negative". For standard empiric therapy for severe CAP, "Both accepted but stronger evidence in favor of β-lactam/macrolide combination", and follow-up chest imaging is "Recommended not to obtain. Patients may be eligible for lung cancer screening, which should be performed as clinically indicated".

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^f3594bdf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^ed501482]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are the main treatment for bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the United Kingdom (UK), guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend amoxicillin for the empirical treatment of low- to moderate-severity pneumonia, and co-amoxiclav for high-severity pneumonia. For moderate- and high-severity pneumonia, these guidelines suggest combining macrolide antibiotics with amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav to provide coverage for atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma. Similarly, European and Latin American guidelines also recommend the addition of macrolides to β-lactams as empirical antibiotic therapy in hospitalized patients with severe CAP, while United States (US) guidelines recommend including atypical cover (which can be with a β-lactam + macrolide or respiratory fluroquinolone monotherapy) for all patients hospitalized with CAP.

Macrolides have also been hypothesized to improve outcomes from pneumococcal pneumonia, even when an active β-lactam is given, by means other than their antimicrobial activity (eg, anti-inflammatory effects). However, macrolide use is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, adverse gastrointestinal events, and resistance against multiple antibiotics at both a population level and within individuals.

Existing population-based studies and clinical trials have yielded contradictory evidence.

Several retrospective and small prospective studies have suggested that dual therapy (β-lactam plus macrolide) is associated with lower mortality in patients with severe CAP. However, these findings have been challenged by other observational studies that reported no significant differences in outcomes, such as mortality and length of hospital stay, between monotherapy and combination therapy. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported that macrolide use was associated with a significant reduction in mortality. In contrast, a noninferiority trial in non–intensive care unit (ICU) CAP patients found that monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy in terms of 90-day mortality. Another noninferiority trial recruiting patients with moderately severe CAP reported delayed clinical stability with monotherapy but found no differences in mortality or length of stay. A recent randomized trial suggested that adding macrolides to β-lactam therapy improved clinical response and reduced the inflammatory burden, although mortality remained similar between groups.

Given these conflicting results, large observational studies may help by comparing treatment options in real-world representative populations. We therefore examined the effect of adjunctive macrolides on clinical outcomes in adults hospitalized for CAP receiving β-lactam therapy, using electronic healthcare records from a large UK teaching hospital group, extending the approach used in our recent analysis of the impact of β-lactam choice in CAP.

Pediatric HIV — bacterial pneumonia (S. pneumoniae; occasionally S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa) treatment includes the following regimens: First choice options are amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/dose orally divided every 8 or 12 hours (max 1 g/dose) for outpatient management; ampicillin 200–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) (use higher dose if S. pneumoniae MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL); or ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day). Alternatives are ceftazidime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours IV or IM (max 12 g/day), or cefepime 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours IV or IM (max 2 g/dose). Alternative treatment should be determined based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns or that of the bacterial isolate, if available. For children who are receiving combination ART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). Add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected (base the choice on local susceptibility patterns). For patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma (e.g. LIP, bronchiectasis) or indwelling venous catheter, consider regimen that includes activity against P. aeruginosa (such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone). Consider PCP in patients with severe pneumonia or more advanced HIV disease. Evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

### The clinical significance of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae: it's all relative [^81326817]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Macrolides are currently recommended as first-line agents for the empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Heavy use of these agents for a variety of indications has resulted in an increasing incidence of macrolide resistance among pneumococcal isolates. Although several case reports and small case series have suggested that in vitro macrolide resistance is associated with treatment failure in cases of pneumococcal pneumonia, other observational data suggest that drug susceptibility testing may not correlate with treatment failure. In this article, we review current information on the mechanisms of macrolide resistance and the pharmacodynamics of macrolide therapy, together with efficacy data from animal models and clinical observations, to begin to gauge the clinical significance of macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Areas for further investigation are highlighted.

7.1 Nelfinavir

Co-administration of nelfinavir at steady-state with a single oral dose of azithromycin resulted in increased azithromycin serum concentrations. Although a dose adjustment of azithromycin is not recommended when administered in combination with nelfinavir, close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

7.2 Warfarin

Spontaneous postmarketing reports suggest that concomitant administration of azithromycin may potentiate the effects of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, although the prothrombin time was not affected in the dedicated drug interaction study with azithromycin and warfarin. Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving azithromycin and oral anticoagulants concomitantly.

Interactions with digoxin or phenytoin have not been reported in clinical trials with azithromycin; however, no specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interactions. However, drug interactions have been observed with other macrolide products. Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when digoxin or phenytoin are used concomitantly with azithromycin careful monitoring of patients is advised.

INDIACTIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below. Recommended dosages and durations of therapy in adult and pediatric patient populations vary in these indications [see Dosage and Administration (2)]

1.1 Adult Patients

Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Acute bacterial sinusitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis. or Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Community-acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy.

Pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy.
