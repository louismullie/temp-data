## Question

Which kinase inhibitor prevents schizophrenia relapse?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which kinase inhibitor prevents schizophrenia relapse. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "kinase inhibitors" are and which ones are actually mentioned in the provided sources. Then, I should verify what the evidence says about pharmacologic strategies that prevent schizophrenia relapse. Next, I will check whether any kinase inhibitor has credible evidence or guideline support for relapse prevention in schizophrenia, and finally, I will reconcile any apparent overlaps or misconceptions and conclude with the clinically supported answer [^1113Tj5s] [^113Qe4hb].

> Let me first confirm the drug class and inventory the agents in scope. Kinase inhibitors in these documents are cancer therapeutics such as dasatinib (SRC/BCR-ABL) with CNS activity in Ph+ leukemia, gilteritinib (FLT3), and everolimus (mTOR), along with investigational or preclinical mentions like milciclib (CDK1/2) and a Ron-selective inhibitor; imatinib is noted as a BCR-ABL inhibitor with poor CNS penetration relative to dasatinib in Ph+ CNS leukemia, which is oncology, not psychiatry [^114hHmVK] [^115BrQZ8] [^115YsCGp] [^116e2WSZ] [^113vGFUK] [^112HsfB9] [^1143ReLF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to verify standard, evidence-based relapse-prevention strategies in schizophrenia. Guidelines and high-quality reviews consistently endorse antipsychotic maintenance — often for years — and highlight benefits of long-acting injectables and clozapine in appropriate patients, reflecting a dopamine-receptor–modulating mechanism rather than kinase inhibition, with supportive RCTs for agents such as lurasidone, aripiprazole, quetiapine XR, and cariprazine showing delayed time-to-relapse or sustained remission effects [^1113Tj5s] [^112aW9Zw] [^113Qe4hb] [^1126LcYj] [^111K3PGm] [^113h1BWX] [^115PUku3] [^114KCpz7].

> Wait, let me verify any possible overlap between "kinase inhibitor" and "schizophrenia relapse". I will now examine whether any trial, label, or guideline positions a kinase inhibitor for psychiatric relapse prevention; I find none, and where "relapse" is discussed with kinase inhibitors, it refers to oncologic disease control, such as preventing CNS leukemia progression with dasatinib, halting micrometastatic outgrowth via Ron inhibition, or post-transplant relapse strategies, all in hematology/oncology rather than schizophrenia [^114hHmVK] [^1143ReLF] [^1152xQBL] [^111c6oQx].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could I be missing a niche translational signal or off-label psychiatric study? I should double-check guideline-aligned comparative effectiveness after first relapse; the Finnish registry analyses reinforce that optimizing antipsychotic strategy — especially switching to clozapine or considering LAIs — is what reduces second-relapse risk, not kinase modulation, and no psychiatric guideline or trial here suggests a kinase inhibitor approach for schizophrenia maintenance [^1177pDPa] [^1113Tj5s] [^113Qe4hb].

> Therefore, I need to be clear and precise in the conclusion: no kinase inhibitor identified in these sources is indicated, recommended, or supported by evidence for preventing schizophrenia relapse; relapse prevention in schizophrenia relies on antipsychotic maintenance strategies and, when indicated, early consideration of clozapine or long-acting injectables within shared decision-making frameworks, supported by guidelines and randomized or regulatory evidence [^1113Tj5s] [^113Qe4hb] [^1126LcYj] [^111K3PGm] [^113h1BWX] [^115PUku3] [^114KCpz7] [^1177pDPa].

No **kinase inhibitor** is approved or recommended for preventing schizophrenia relapse [^1113Tj5s] [^113Qe4hb]. Relapse prevention relies on **antipsychotics**, particularly long-acting injectables [^112aW9Zw] [^113Qe4hb] and clozapine for treatment-resistant cases [^114BxJu6] [^1177pDPa]. Kinase inhibitors such as everolimus [^116e2WSZ] [^113vGFUK], gilteritinib [^115BrQZ8] [^115YsCGp], and dasatinib [^114hHmVK] are oncology agents with no evidence or indication for schizophrenia relapse prevention. Current guidelines likewise do not support kinase inhibitors for this purpose [^113Qe4hb].

---

## Evidence for kinase inhibitors in schizophrenia relapse prevention

- **Everolimus**: An mTOR inhibitor [^116e2WSZ] approved for oncology and tuberous sclerosis [^113vGFUK]; no evidence or indication for schizophrenia relapse prevention.

- **Gilteritinib**: A FLT3 inhibitor approved for relapsed/refractory AML [^115BrQZ8] [^115YsCGp]; no evidence or indication for schizophrenia relapse prevention.

- **Dasatinib**: A BCR-ABL/SRC inhibitor approved for Ph+ leukemias [^114hHmVK]; no evidence or indication for schizophrenia relapse prevention.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **antipsychotic maintenance therapy** [^1113Tj5s], with long-acting injectables for adherence [^112aW9Zw] [^113Qe4hb] and clozapine for treatment resistance [^114BxJu6] [^1177pDPa]. There is no guideline support for kinase inhibitors in schizophrenia relapse prevention.

---

## Conclusion

No **kinase inhibitor** is approved or recommended for preventing schizophrenia relapse [^115BrQZ8] [^116e2WSZ] [^114hHmVK]. Relapse prevention is achieved with antipsychotic maintenance therapy [^1126LcYj], particularly long-acting injectables [^113Qe4hb] and clozapine for treatment-resistant cases [^114BxJu6] [^1177pDPa].

### Dasatinib crosses the blood-brain barrier and is an efficient therapy for central nervous system Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia [^114hHmVK]. Blood (2008). High credibility.

Although imatinib, a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is used to treat acute Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) leukemia, it does not prevent central nervous system (CNS) relapses due to poor drug penetration through the blood-brain barrier. Imatinib and dasatinib (a dual-specific SRC/BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor) were compared in a preclinical mouse model of intracranial Ph(+) leukemia. Clinical dasatinib treatment in patients with CNS Ph(+) leukemia was assessed.

In preclinical studies, dasatinib increased survival, whereas imatinib failed to inhibit intracranial tumor growth. Stabilization and regression of CNS disease were achieved with continued dasatinib administration. The drug also demonstrated substantial activity in 11 adult and pediatric patients with CNS Ph(+) leukemia. Eleven evaluable patients had clinically significant, long-lasting responses, which were complete in 7 patients.

Isolated CNS relapse occurred in 3 additional patients during dasatinib therapy; in 2 of them, it was caused by expansion of a BCR-ABL-mutated dasatinib-resistant clone, implying selection pressure exerted by the compound in the CNS. Dasatinib has promising therapeutic potential in managing intracranial leukemic disease and substantial clinical activity in patients who experience CNS relapse while on imatinib therapy.

### Clozaril [^114BxJu6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clozaril is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for:

- **Treatment-resistant schizophrenia**: Efficacy was established in an active-controlled study [see Sections 1.1 and 14.1].

- **Reducing suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder**: Efficacy was established in an active-controlled study [see Sections 1.2 and 14.2].

- **Treatment-resistant schizophrenia**
Clozaril is indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and seizure associated with its use, Clozaril should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.5)].

The effectiveness of Clozaril in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing Clozaril and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

- **Reduction in the risk of suicidal behavior in schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder**
Clozaril is indicated for reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put themselves at risk for death.

The effectiveness of Clozaril in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year period.

### Xospata [^115BrQZ8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Gilteritinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). It demonstrated the ability to inhibit FLT3 receptor signaling and proliferation in cells exogenously expressing FLT3, including FLT3-ITD, tyrosine kinase domain mutations (TKD) FLT3-D835Y, and FLT3-ITD-D835Y, and it induced apoptosis in leukemic cells expressing FLT3-ITD.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In patients with relapsed or refractory AML administered gilteritinib 120 mg, substantial (> 90%) inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was rapid (within 24 hours after first dose) and sustained, as characterized by an ex vivo plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) assay.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: The effect of XOSPATA 120 mg once a day on the QTc interval has been evaluated in patients, showing an absence of large mean increases (i.e. 20 msec) in the QTc interval. Of 317 patients with a post-baseline QTc measurement on treatment with gilteritinib at 120 mg in clinical trials, 4 patients (1.3%) experienced a QTcF > 500 msec. Additionally, across all doses, 2.3% of patients with relapse/refractory AML had a maximum post-baseline QTcF interval > 500 msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, and more specifically with respect to long-acting injectable antipsychotics, the BAP 2020 guidelines recommend considering the offer of a long-acting injectable antipsychotic when monitoring medication adherence or avoiding non-adherence is a priority. This is particularly advised if previous non-adherence has led to frequent relapses, or if it is preferred by the patient for convenience.

### Afinitor disperz [^116e2WSZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Everolimus is an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, which is downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibits mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduces the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), which are downstream effectors of mTOR involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor, resulting in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. Additionally, everolimus inhibits the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (e.g. HIF-1) and reduces the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in both in vitro and in vivo studies.

Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus. Combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner.

Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2.

### Is the ongoing use of placebo in relapse-prevention clinical trials in schizophrenia justified [^112vgPmY]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

Placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs) continue to be required or recommended by regulatory authorities for the licensing of new drugs for schizophrenia, despite ongoing concerns regarding the risks to trial participants.

- **Methods**: In this article, we consider the scientific and ethical pros and cons associated with the use of placebo in RCTs in schizophrenia, systematically review the published relapse-prevention placebo-controlled RCTs with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) in schizophrenia, and examine the risks associated with these trials.

- **Results**: We identified 12 studies involving 2,842 participants, of which 968 received placebo. Relapse rates were 56% for placebo and 17.4% for active treatment groups. There is a lack of well-designed longitudinal studies investigating the psychosocial and biological consequences of exposure to placebo, treatment discontinuation, and relapse in schizophrenia.

- **Conclusion**: In the absence of such studies, it is risky to assume that patients are not at risk of significant distress and long-term harm, and therefore it is difficult to justify the ongoing use of placebo in relapse-prevention RCTs in schizophrenia.

### Targeted treatment of schizophrenia symptoms as they manifest, or continuous treatment to reduce the risk of psychosis recurrence [^115CRMxx]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Low credibility.

Pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia employs drugs that interfere with dopamine neurotransmission, aiming to suppress acute exacerbation of psychosis and maintain treatment to reduce the risk of psychosis recurrence. According to this treatment scheme, available psychotropic drugs intended to treat negative symptoms, cognitive impairment, or anxiety are administered as add-ons to treatment with antipsychotics. However, an alternative treatment scheme proposes a targeted or intermittent treatment approach, where antipsychotic drugs are administered upon psychosis exacerbation and discontinued upon remission or stabilization, while negative symptoms, cognitive impairment, or anxiety are treated with specific psychotropics as monotherapy. Along these lines, antipsychotics are renewed only in the event of recurrence of psychotic symptoms.

This 50-year-old debate between targeted and continuous treatment schemes arises from disagreements about interpreting scientific evidence and discordant views regarding benefit/risk assessment. Among the debate's questions are:

1. What is the percentage of individuals who can maintain stability without antipsychotic maintenance treatment, and what is the percentage of those who exacerbate despite antipsychotic treatment?

2. How to interpret results of placebo-controlled 9- to 18-month-long maintenance trials in a life-long chronic disorder, and how to interpret results of the targeted trials, some of which are open label or not randomized?

3. How to weigh the decreased risk for psychotic recurrence versus the almost certain…

### Choosing an optimal antipsychotic dose for relapse prevention [^112CAd3E]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Low credibility.

In a companion study, the Tiihonen group applied the same DDD categories for all antipsychotics as a class, providing a more comprehensive dose analysis. This is because patients could be on monotherapy with different antipsychotics at different times or the same time (polypharmacy). The researchers analyzed data starting from the first episode of schizophrenia and followed up for about 5 years. Forty-three percent of patients did not have a relapse, while 57% had one or more relapses. For those who relapsed, the dose prescribed was increased both over time and in those with more relapses.

Compared to nonuse of antipsychotics, virtually all doses prevented relapses. The U-shaped dose–response curve was observed for individuals with 1 or 2 relapses. There was a poor relapse preventative effect with doses of less than 0.6 DDD, but the best preventive effect was seen at doses of 0.9–1.1 DDD. A fair preventive effect was observed with doses from 1.1 to 1.4–1.6 DDD units, but a very poor preventive effect was noted at 2.4 or more DDD units.

For those with 3 or more relapses, the best preventative effects were at 1.4–1.6 DDD units, followed by 0.9–1.1 DDD units. Fair preventive effects were seen up to 2.4 DDD units, but there was a poor effect at doses 2.4 DDD or greater.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: a population-based cohort study [^113WtQzz]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

The best pharmacological treatment practices for relapse prevention in patients with first-episode schizophrenia are unclear. We aimed to assess different treatment strategies used before and after the first relapse and their associations with subsequent relapse risk.

- **Methods**: In this population-based cohort study, we enrolled individuals (aged ≤ 45 years) with first-episode schizophrenia who were hospitalised and subsequently relapsed between 1996 and 2014 from the nationwide Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Individuals who had not been taking antipsychotics within the year preceding initial hospitalisation and who had a relapse within 5 years of discharge were included in the analyses. Treatment strategies were assessed during the 30 days before hospitalisation for the first relapse and 30 days after discharge and were categorised as either long-acting injectable, clozapine, non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapy, non-clozapine oral antipsychotic polypharmacy, and antipsychotic non-use. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of the risk of second relapse based on treatment type were analysed with Cox regression models for 2 years after the first relapse or until death or end of data linkage (Dec 31, 2017). People with lived experience of schizophrenia were not involved in the research and writing process.

- **Findings**: Between Jan 31, 1996, and Dec 31, 2017, 3000 individuals had their first psychosis relapse and were eligible for analysis. Mean age was 30.0 years (SD 7.6), with 1069 (35.6%) of patients being women and 1931 (64.4%) men. No ethnicity data were reported.

### Targeted treatment of schizophrenia symptoms as they manifest, or continuous treatment to reduce the risk of psychosis recurrence [^115qWWyr]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Low credibility.

Evidence supports symptom-specific treatment as it manifests rather than adopting a "one-size-fits-all" approach for chronic schizophrenia treatment. Although attempting to reduce the risk of psychotic recurrence and address primary negative symptoms and/or cognitive impairment by adding a pro-cognitive or anti-negative symptom drug to an antipsychotic may not achieve the desired goal. Numerous pharmaceutical industry-sponsored trials and hundreds of investigator-initiated ones, where psychotropics were added to an antipsychotic to target specific symptoms like negative symptoms or cognitive impairment, have mostly failed or produced inconclusive results. Some reported positive findings were only post hoc. This failure may occur because maintaining patients on antipsychotics might induce secondary negative symptoms in addition to the intrinsic primary schizophrenia-related negative symptoms. As DA neurotransmission mediates brain reward circuits, it is hypothesized that blocking DA receptors may deprive patients of experiencing pleasure and expecting rewards, accounting for avolition, a widespread symptom of schizophrenia. Consequently, a panel of investigators has suggested that trials targeting negative symptoms should involve monotherapy rather than being an add-on to antipsychotic drugs.

In summary, patients exhibiting good recovery from a psychosis episode, those maintaining long periods of symptom stability without maintenance treatment, and those who do not respond to current treatments, represent different challenges to address in managing schizophrenia effectively.

### Relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia — maintenance vs intermittent drug treatment with prodrome-based early intervention: Results of a randomized controlled trial within the German Research Network on Schizophrenia [^117Y4ZxE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). High credibility.

After the acute treatment of the first illness episode in schizophrenia, antipsychotic maintenance treatment is recommended for at least one year. The evidence for the optimal subsequent treatment is still scarce. Targeted intermittent treatment was found to be less effective than continuous treatment at preventing relapse in multiple-episode patients; however, a post hoc analysis of our own data from a previous study suggested comparable efficacy of the two treatment approaches in first-episode patients. The study was therefore designed to prospectively compare the relapse preventive efficacy of further maintenance treatment and targeted intermittent treatment in patients with ICD-10-diagnosed first-episode schizophrenia.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted within the German Research Network on Schizophrenia. Entry screening took place between November 2000 and May 2004. After one year of antipsychotic maintenance treatment, stable first-episode patients were randomly assigned to 12 months of further maintenance treatment or stepwise drug discontinuation and targeted intermittent treatment. In case of prodromal symptoms of an impending relapse, patients in both groups received early drug intervention, guided by a decision algorithm. The primary outcome measure was relapse, defined as an increase in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive score > 10, a Clinical Global Impressions-Change score ≥ 6, and a decrease in Global Assessment of Functioning score > 20 between two visits.

Of 96 first-episode patients, only 44 were eligible for the assigned treatment.

### Targeted treatment of schizophrenia symptoms as they manifest, or continuous treatment to reduce the risk of psychosis recurrence [^11595srz]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Low credibility.

Serendipitous observations and pharmacological inferences established between the 1950s and the 1970s that drugs interfering with dopamine (DA) neurotransmission ameliorate agitation, delusion, hallucination, and thought disorder in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Since agitation is the first and most profoundly impacted symptom, these drugs were initially named "major tranquilizers" to distinguish them from benzodiazepines, known as "minor tranquilizers".

The natural course of schizophrenia is characterized by alternating periods of psychotic (positive) symptom exacerbation, improvement, and recurrence of psychosis. Researchers since the 1970s have investigated the possibility that the same DA-blocking drugs might also reduce the risk of psychotic symptoms re-emergence. The fact that the same drug might ameliorate symptoms during a disease flare-up and reduce the risk of future recurrences is well-documented in medicine. For instance, steroids, by changing the inner functioning of the cell, ameliorate flare-ups of rheumatoid arthritis, allergic conjunctivitis, or asthma and reduce the risk of future flare-ups.

Like antipsychotics in schizophrenia, the benefit/risk of intermittent vs. continuous treatment with steroids is still debated, many decades after steroids have been available in clinical practice.

### Relapse prevention and recovery in the treatment of schizophrenia [^112583Ng]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Nonadherence to medication is a predictor of relapse in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, and preventing relapse is crucial to achieving the goal of recovery. Long-term treatment with antipsychotics can be effective, although long-term patient response to medication may be difficult to predict from trials that measure response, remission, and relapse rates because they are often too short. Longer trials are needed to fully understand the implications of adherence and symptom remission in patient outcome. Recovery, however, is contingent on the stabilization of the symptoms of schizophrenia and the acquisition of the skills necessary to function in society. Psychosocial interventions, such as family psychoeducation, social skills training, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, used in conjunction with pharmacotherapy, are effective in helping to prevent symptom relapse and promote functional recovery in patients with schizophrenia.

### Predictors of lack of relapse after random discontinuation of oral and long-acting injectable antipsychotics in clinically stabilized patients with schizophrenia: A re-analysis of individual participant data [^115ugxji]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to quantify the risk and predictors of relapse among individuals with schizophrenia randomly withdrawn from antipsychotic maintenance treatment.

- **Methods**: We re-analyzed time-to-event and baseline predictors from placebo arms in five placebo-controlled randomized trials of antipsychotics (n = 688 individuals; 173 stabilized on oral antipsychotic [OAP] and 515 on long-acting injectables [LAI]) for relapse prevention available in the Yale Open Data Access repository. Using a survival and Cox-proportional hazards regression analyses, we estimated survival rates of "relapse-free" individuals by the end of follow-up (median = 118 days, IQR = 52.0–208.0), the rate of study-confirmed relapse, and adjusted hazard ratios (aHR, 95% confidence intervals [CI]) associated with baseline predictors. We also estimated these parameters for individuals followed for more than five half-lives of the stabilizing antipsychotic and studied predictors of "rebound psychosis" in OAP-stabilized participants, defined as occurring within 30 days of antipsychotic withdrawal.

- **Results**: 29.9% (95% CI = 23.2–38.5) remained relapse-free by the end of follow-up, 11.1% (95% CI = 5.65–21.9) among those OAP-stabilized, and 36.4% (95% CI = 28.4–46.7) among those LAI-stabilized. The study-confirmed relapse rate was 45.2%, 62.4% among those OAP-stabilized, and 39.4% among those LAI-stabilized. Predictors of relapse included smoking (aHR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.19–2.00), female sex (aHR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.08–1.79), and having been stabilized on OAPs versus LAIs (aHR = 3.56, 95% CI = 2.68–4.72). The greater risk of relapse on OAP persisted.

### Effectiveness of information technology aided relapse prevention programme in schizophrenia excluding the effect of user adherence: A randomized controlled trial [^114Gmx1v]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). High credibility.

A relapse prevention program called the Information Technology Aided Relapse Prevention Programme in Schizophrenia (ITAREPS) has been developed and is reported to be highly effective. However, the effectiveness was influenced by user adherence to the protocol of the program. The exact effectiveness and the role of the ITAREPS have been partially uncertain.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the ITAREPS, excluding the effect of user adherence to the protocol of the program.

- **Method**: We attempted to perform a randomized controlled trial using the devised method with visiting nurse service. Outpatients with schizophrenia were randomized to the ITAREPS (n = 22) or control group (n = 23) and were observed for 12 months.

- **Results**: The risk of rehospitalization was reduced in the ITAREPS group (2 [9.1%]) compared with the control group (8 [34.8%]) (hazard ratio = 0.21, 95% CI 0.04–0.99, p = 0.049; number needed to treat (NNT) = 4, 95% CI 2.1–35.5). The mean number of inpatient days was significantly lower in the ITAREPS group (18.5 days) compared with the control group (88.8 days) (p = 0.036). The ratio of the number of rehospitalizations to that of relapses was significantly lower (p = 0.035), and the mean change in total BPRS scores at relapse from baseline was significantly less in the ITAREPS group (p = 0.019).

- **Conclusions**: The relapse prevention effectiveness of the ITAREPS was high. We confirmed that the ITAREPS, i.e. detecting signs of relapse and increasing medication during the warning state, is an effective intervention during the early stages of relapse.

### Phosphoproteomic profiling of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia reveals targetable kinases and combination treatment strategies [^112HsfB9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The identification of new targeted drugs is urgently needed to prevent relapses, overcome therapy resistance, and avoid excessive toxicities for T-ALL patients. Genomic-guided therapy has thus far not led to the wide implementation of targeted agents in T-ALL, but protein analyses can provide useful insights for the identification of cellular dependencies that translate into targetable leukemia vulnerabilities. In this study, we performed an exploratory, global, unbiased phosphoproteome profiling to identify targetable kinases in T-ALL and to establish a proteome platform that can complement genomic analyses for the investigation of leukemia dependencies.

In our initial analysis of 11 T-ALL cell lines, we identified highly active tyrosine kinases (LCK, SRC, FYN, YES1, LYN, INSR, and IGF-1R) as well as serine/threonine kinases (CDK1/2, AKT, and PAK1/2). Moreover, the comparison of the phosphoproteomes of T-ALL and AML revealed active kinases that reflect differences in their hematopoietic lineages of origin, independently of the presence of known signaling mutations. This highlights the additional value of MS-based phosphoproteome profiling.

Next, we screened several clinical kinase inhibitors in vitro and found that the CDK1/CDK2 inhibitor milciclib has a cytostatic effect in T-ALL cells. Milciclib is under clinical investigation for the treatment of thymoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, clinical studies are investigating other CDK inhibitors (ribociclib and palbociclib) for the treatment of relapsed T-ALL, and milciclib may be an additional treatment.

### Relapse prevention in patients with schizophrenia [^111hqA2j]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Remission is a realistic goal for patients with schizophrenia, and if sustained remission can be achieved, then patients may eventually attain functional recovery. The chance of relapse is decreased if patients are adherent to their pharmacotherapeutic treatment regimen. This case explores how to prevent relapse for a patient with schizophrenia and comorbid substance use disorder who is nonadherent to an oral atypical antipsychotic. To help the patient achieve treatment goals, intervention strategies such as switching medications and implementing psychosocial therapies are considered.

### Chronic treatment with aripiprazole prevents development of dopamine supersensitivity and potentially supersensitivity psychosis [^116rwLVJ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

For decades, the standard schizophrenia treatment protocol has included the administration of D2 dopamine receptor blockers as effective antipsychotics, especially for the amelioration of psychotic symptoms. Long-term, continuous treatment with antipsychotic agents is emphasized as a treatment strategy to encourage remission in people with schizophrenia because the chance of relapse is decreased if pharmacotherapy continues uninterrupted. However, even among stabilized patients maintained on optimal doses of antipsychotic depot therapy, significant rates of relapse have been reported. It is widely recognized that a small reduction in antipsychotic dosage or a short-term interruption in antipsychotic drug therapy can induce an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, and the dose of antipsychotics needed to reduce such symptoms tends to increase with each relapse. There may be multiple causes for this phenomenon, including the development of the disease itself. One of the possible explanations, however, may be the development of supersensitivity psychosis associated with long-term treatment with D2 receptor blockers.

Aripiprazole (ARI), an atypical antipsychotic that is commercially known as a dopamine partial agonist, is clinically used to treat schizophrenia. Treatment with ARI has been associated with the lowest rate of rehospitalization (71% risk reduction) among antipsychotics in clinical use, including both first- and second-generation antipsychotics, which suggests that, compared with other antipsychotics, ARI may more efficiently lower the risk of relapse.

### Abilify [^113h1BWX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg daily doses was established in two studies for each dose. Among these doses, there was no evidence that the higher dose groups offered any advantage over the lowest dose group of these studies. An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age, gender, or race.

A longer-term trial enrolled 310 inpatients or outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia who were, by history, symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from their antipsychotic medications and randomized to Abilify 15 mg/day or placebo for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as a CGI-Improvement score of ≥ 5 (minimally worse), scores ≥ 5 (moderately severe) on the hostility or uncooperativeness items of the PANSS, or a ≥ 20% increase in the PANSS total score. Patients receiving Abilify 15 mg/day experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over the subsequent 26 weeks compared to those receiving placebo.

- **Pediatric patients**: The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia in pediatric patients (13 to 17 years of age) was evaluated in one 6-week, placebo-controlled trial of outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and had a PANSS score ≥ 70 at baseline. In this trial (n = 302) comparing two fixed doses of Abilify (10 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, Abilify was titrated starting from 2 mg/day to the target.

### Mental health gap action programme (mhGAP) guideline for mental, neurological and substance use disorders [Internet] [^113Qe4hb]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, more specifically concerning long-acting injectable antipsychotics, the WHO 2023 guidelines recommend considering offering a long-acting injectable antipsychotic (such as fluphenazine, haloperidol, paliperidone, risperidone, or zuclopenthixol) as an alternative to oral antipsychotics in adult patients with psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, who require long-term treatment. This recommendation emphasizes the careful balancing of effectiveness, side effects, and individual preference.

### Inhibition of Ron kinase blocks conversion of micrometastases to overt metastases by boosting antitumor immunity [^1143ReLF]. Cancer Discovery (2013). Low credibility.

Many "nonmetastatic" cancers have developed undetectable metastases prior to diagnosis. The eventual growth of these microscopic lesions leads to metastatic relapse and death; however, the events dictating when and how micrometastases transition to overt metastases are largely unknown. We report that macrophage-stimulating protein and its receptor, Ron, are key mediators in this conversion process through immune suppression. The genetic deletion of Ron tyrosine kinase activity in the host significantly blocked metastasis. Our data demonstrate that the loss of Ron function promotes an effective antitumor CD8(+) T-cell response, specifically inhibiting the growth of seeded metastatic colonies. Treatment of mice with a Ron-selective kinase inhibitor prevented lung metastasis growth, even when administered after micrometastatic colonies had already been established. Our findings suggest that Ron inhibitors may be effective in specifically preventing the outgrowth of micrometastases in cancer patients in an adjuvant setting.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: A population-based cohort study [^115JFkM4]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Antipsychotic treatment is a key component in the management of schizophrenia, and a large proportion of patients have a good response to medication following their first episode. 81% of treated patients with first-episode schizophrenia have a 20% or greater reduction in total psychopathology, and 52% have a 50% or greater reduction in total psychopathology. Although most people achieve remission after their first psychotic episode, the major problem is related to subsequent relapses and treatment response, which could decrease over the course of illness or as a consequence of subsequent relapses. Despite reduced antipsychotic efficacy in patients with multi-episode versus first-episode schizophrenia, the relative ranking of efficacy appears to be roughly similar across patients with first-episode schizophrenia and other schizophrenia subgroups. Results from our previous nationwide cohort study indicated that the effectiveness of antipsychotics for relapse prevention decreases after the second relapse. This decrease in effectiveness occurred despite antipsychotic doses being increased after each consequent relapse. These results underline that prevention of second relapse is essential.

### Combination of a mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor pacritinib combats cell adhesion-based residual disease and prevents re-expansion of FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukaemia [^111c6oQx]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Low credibility.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) poses a significant challenge due to drug insensitivity and high relapse risk. The intensification of chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation often hinges on MRD status. Relapse rates remain high even with the incorporation of first-generation FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors in pre- and post-transplant regimens and as maintenance therapy in FLT3-mutated AML. Preclinical progress is hampered by the lack of appropriate models for residual disease and post-therapy relapse.

In the present study, we investigated the nature of pro-survival signaling in primary residual tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-treated AML cells adherent to stroma. We further assessed their drug sensitivity to inform future therapy combinations. Utilizing a primary human leukaemia-human stroma model to mimic the cell-cell interactions occurring in patients, we evaluated the ability of several clinically used TKIs to disrupt stroma-driven leukaemic signaling. We identified a synergistic combination with a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor for potential therapeutic application in the MRD setting.

The findings reveal a common mechanism of stroma-mediated resistance, which may be independent of mutational status but can be targeted through rational drug design to eradicate MRD and reduce treatment-related toxicity.

### Strategies for improving compliance in treatment of schizophrenia by using a long-acting formulation of an antipsychotic: Clinical studies [^1122Q47B]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Despite evidence showing the importance of continuous medication in preventing relapse in patients with schizophrenia and the harmful consequences that relapse can have, clinical efforts often focus on hospital-based treatment or treatment of acute exacerbations of schizophrenia rather than on ensuring appropriate and effective relapse prevention. Inadequate compliance with antipsychotic treatment further deters from the goal of long-term management of schizophrenia; however, appropriate use of injectable, long-acting antipsychotic medications — especially atypical antipsychotics — has the potential to increase compliance and thus improve the long-term prognosis of patients with schizophrenia. A long-acting formulation of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone has undergone large-scale clinical testing, during which it showed significant improvement on measures of disease severity while maintaining an acceptable side effect profile.

### Does relapse cause illness progression in first-episode psychosis? A review [^116rT8QR]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). High credibility.

It is widely believed that relapse in first-episode psychosis (FEP) causes illness progression, with previous reviews suggesting that treatment non-response develops in one in six patients who relapse. This belief contributes to the primary treatment goal in FEP being relapse prevention, often in favor of other recovery-oriented goals. However, previous reviews primarily reported on naturalistic studies in chronic schizophrenia and predated multiple major studies with higher-quality designs.

- **Methods**: We conducted a narrative review of studies of any design that examine the impact of relapse on medication response and other symptomatic and functional outcomes in FEP.

- **Results**: We identified eight relevant studies, five of which were published since the last major review on this topic. Observational studies show a clear association between relapses and worse response to medication, but they poorly control for confounding. Three higher-quality studies (two randomized) generally do not find worse symptomatic or functional outcomes among medication reduction/discontinuation arms compared to maintenance controls, despite significantly higher initial rates of relapse.

- **Conclusion**: While the social and psychological consequences of a relapse should not be dismissed, clinicians should demand high-quality evidence about the risks of relapse on long-term outcomes. The conventional notion that relapse leads to treatment non-response or worse long-term outcomes is generally not supported by the highest quality studies. These findings can help clinicians and patients weigh the risks.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: A population-based cohort study [^113roo1h]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

The best pharmacological treatment practices for relapse prevention in patients with first-episode schizophrenia are unclear. We aimed to assess different treatment strategies used before and after the first relapse and their associations with subsequent relapse risk.

- **Methods**: In this population-based cohort study, we enrolled individuals (aged ≤ 45 years) with first-episode schizophrenia who were hospitalized and subsequently relapsed between 1996 and 2014 from the nationwide Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Individuals who had not been taking antipsychotics within the year preceding initial hospitalization and who had a relapse within five years of discharge were included in the analyses. Treatment strategies were assessed during the 30 days before hospitalization for the first relapse and 30 days after discharge. These strategies were categorized as either long-acting injectable, clozapine, non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapy, non-clozapine oral antipsychotic polypharmacy, and antipsychotic non-use. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of the risk of second relapse based on treatment type were analyzed with Cox regression models for two years after the first relapse, or until death or end of data linkage (Dec 31, 2017). People with lived experience of schizophrenia were not involved in the research and writing process.

- **Findings**: Between Jan 31, 1996 and Dec 31, 2017, 3000 individuals had their first psychosis relapse and were eligible for analysis. Mean age was 30.0 years (SD 7.6); 1069 (35.6%) of patients were women and 1931 (64.4%) were men. No ethnicity data were available.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of lurasidone for the maintenance of efficacy in patients with schizophrenia [^111K3PGm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). High credibility.

The efficacy of lurasidone for the maintenance treatment of patients with schizophrenia was demonstrated in this multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study. Forty-two percent of patients who entered the study completed the open-label stabilization phase, demonstrating that maintenance of stability with lurasidone was feasible over a three-month period. In the double-blind phase, treatment with lurasidone (40–80 mg/d) significantly delayed time to relapse and reduced the risk of relapse by 33.7% compared with placebo. The results of this study are consistent with findings of a previous 12-month, double-blind study, which showed that long-term treatment with lurasidone (40–160 mg/d) was associated with a relatively low probability of relapse and demonstrated the non-inferiority of lurasidone relative to quetiapine XR (200–800 mg/d) for relapse prevention in patients with schizophrenia. The results of the study, taken together with the findings of the above-noted study, support the use of lurasidone as maintenance treatment for patients with schizophrenia across the dose range of 40–160 mg/d.

A key strength of the study is that clinical stability, defined using rigorous criteria, was demonstrated for at least 12 weeks during the open-label stabilization phase. This extended stabilization period increased the likelihood that subsequent emergence of symptoms represented recurrence of illness and not merely symptom fluctuation in patients who were not clinically stabilized.

### The long-term effects of antipsychotic medication on clinical course in schizophrenia [^115YP71t]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Concerns have been raised that treatment with antipsychotic medication might adversely affect long-term outcomes for people with schizophrenia. The evidence cited for these concerns includes the association of antipsychotic treatment with brain volume reduction and dopamine receptor sensitization, which might make patients vulnerable to relapse and illness progression. An international group of experts was convened to examine findings from clinical and basic research relevant to these concerns. Little evidence was found to support a negative long-term effect of initial or maintenance antipsychotic treatment on outcomes compared to withholding treatment.

Randomized controlled trials strongly support the efficacy of antipsychotics for the acute treatment of psychosis and prevention of relapse; correlational evidence suggests that early intervention and reduced duration of untreated psychosis might improve longer-term outcomes. Strategies for treatment discontinuation or alternative nonpharmacologic treatment approaches may benefit a subgroup of patients but may be associated with incremental risk of relapse. These strategies require further study, including the development of biomarkers that will enable a precision medicine approach to individualized treatment.

### Seroquel XR [^115PUku3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a longer-term trial (Study 3), clinically stable adult outpatients (n = 171) meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, who remained stable following 16 weeks of open-label treatment with flexible doses of Seroquel XR (400 mg/day-800 mg/day), were randomized to placebo or to continue on their Seroquel XR (400 mg/day-800 mg/day) for observation for possible relapse during the double-blind continuation (maintenance) phase. Stabilization during the open-label phase was defined as receiving a stable dose of Seroquel XR and having a CGI-S ≤ 4 and a PANSS score ≤ 60 from beginning to end of this open-label phase (with no increase of ≥ 10 points in PANSS total score). Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined in terms of a ≥ 30% increase in the PANSS total score, a CGI-Improvement score of ≥ 6, hospitalization due to worsening of schizophrenia, or the need for any other antipsychotic medication. Patients on Seroquel XR experienced a statistically significant longer time to relapse than patients on placebo (Figure 1).

### Has research informed us on the practical drug treatment of schizophrenia [^117FyS9r]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Long-term changes and cost

If a better drug is more efficacious than another in one domain or another, it may take a month, or even years, to translate into a measurable decrease in real-world outcomes such as rehospitalizations, ability to live in a less restricted setting, obtaining a job, quality of life, and changing medical costs. We do not have a valid methodology to address most of these questions. We have methods for determining prevention of relapse using survival methodologies, but this does not assist in assessing functional outcomes.

As each patient relapses, the initially randomized samples no longer remain randomized. Consequently, the groups become progressively different in the variable of interest, confounding the findings of long-term studies. To illustrate with an exaggerated example as a thought experiment: suppose a treatment for a given cancer cures 90% and a 10-year follow-up is conducted on drug and placebo groups. Ten percent of placebo-treated patients experience spontaneous remission, while 90% rapidly die. However, 90% of drug-treated patients recover and 10% die. The 90% on the drug and the 10% remitted on placebo would do equally well for most of the 10 years. The cost of the placebo-treated group would be low because 90% died. Nothing reduces medical costs like death. Outcome assessment would be meaningless because the groups are largely nonrandom for the majority of the trial. This is a systematic error.

### Treatment strategies to prevent relapse and encourage remission [^117KbiRJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Remission is a realistic goal for patients with schizophrenia. If sustained remission without relapse can be achieved, patients may attain functional recovery. With each relapse, recovery can be slowed, and the course of illness worsened. The risk of self-harm and harm to others increases with each psychotic episode. The chance of relapse decreases if pharmacotherapy continues uninterrupted. One strategy to ensure continuous treatment is using long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications. Achieving remission of schizophrenia is clinically meaningful because, besides symptom control, remission allows for improved vocational and social functioning. Functional recovery without relapse enables patients to return to work, sustain interpersonal relationships, and lead more productive lives. Therefore, achieving the goals of remission and recovery is in the best interest not only of patients with schizophrenia but also of society.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: A population-based cohort study [^114DUmqS]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Our findings challenge the treatment guidelines recommending clozapine as a third-line treatment, which results in treatment practices characterized by long delays to clozapine initiation. When a person with first-episode schizophrenia experiences a relapse of psychosis despite the use of non-clozapine oral antipsychotics, continuation with the same antipsychotic or a switch to another non-clozapine oral antipsychotic does not benefit relapse prevention. Instead, clozapine initiation should be considered as part of shared decision-making with the person with schizophrenia and their carers.

There is no established treatment algorithm, meaning a step-by-step guide for choosing an antipsychotic, for patients who have relapsed despite ongoing antipsychotic treatment. Possible options include continuing with the same antipsychotic used before relapse, switching to another oral antipsychotic, switching to a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, or employing antipsychotic polypharmacy.

Clozapine is the most efficacious antipsychotic. However, due to safety concerns, treatment guidelines state that at least two other antipsychotics should be tried before switching to clozapine. In addition, there are prescriber-related and organizational barriers to clozapine use, as it requires regular blood monitoring.

Thus far, only one study has been published on the comparative effectiveness of different antipsychotic switching strategies in first-episode schizophrenia. The results of this 32-week trial showed that switching from a first non-clozapine antipsychotic was beneficial.

### Targeted treatment of schizophrenia symptoms as they manifest, or continuous treatment to reduce the risk of psychosis recurrence [^113zE4dB]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). High credibility.

Based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), most treatment guidelines issued by professional organizations recommend that individuals who meet diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and experience recurrences of several psychotic episodes should continue antipsychotic treatment for many years to indefinitely. However, these guidelines are actively debated, and more recent clinical guidelines tend to include intermittent treatment as an option. They propose a targeted therapy approach by which dopamine-blocking antipsychotic drugs are discontinued upon psychotic symptoms' remission or stabilization, to be renewed only in case of recurrence of psychosis.

The case for continuous maintenance treatment is straightforward, in that for many patients, the risk of symptoms re-emergence persists long after the resolution of the acute symptoms. The debated argument is that the short- and long-term impact of psychosis exacerbations and hospitalizations on the patient's well-being justifies the immediate and cumulative adverse effects of the drugs. Furthermore, as indicated by some, but not others, relapses might negatively impact the long-term outcome as symptoms may not return to the pre-discontinuation baseline. Insomnia, anxiety, and brief and transient psychotic ideations might herald psychotic exacerbation, yet the criteria that distinguish between individuals who can maintain the stability of psychotic symptoms in the absence of antipsychotics and those who would experience rapid exacerbation are not validated predictive tests. Therefore, all individuals affected by chronic schizophrenia face uncertainties in their treatment paths.

### Relapse prevention in schizophrenia with new-generation antipsychotics: A systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials [^112e5rLT]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the potential of new-generation antipsychotic drugs in improving adherence and reducing relapse rates among patients with schizophrenia.

- **Method**: Randomized, controlled trials comparing new-generation antipsychotic drugs with placebo and/or conventional antipsychotics were identified. Data on relapse, general treatment failure, and dropout due to adverse events were extracted and combined for analysis.

- **Results**: Due to the limited number of trials available for each individual drug, the effects of new-generation antipsychotic drugs as a group were examined. The analysis of six placebo comparisons, involving a total of 983 patients, clearly demonstrated the efficacy of new-generation antipsychotic drugs in preventing relapse. Eleven studies with a total of 2,032 patients provided comparative data on relapse or treatment failure rates for new-generation versus conventional antipsychotics. The newer drugs showed modestly but significantly lower rates of relapse and overall treatment failure. However, whether this advantage was partly mediated by better adherence to treatment remains unclear. There was no significant advantage in terms of fewer dropouts due to adverse events for the newer drugs. Several methodological issues were also identified.

- **Conclusions**: Overall, the available data suggest that new-generation antipsychotics have the potential to lower relapse rates. Methodological issues, such as the choice of comparator, should be addressed in future trials.

### Targeted treatment of schizophrenia symptoms as they manifest, or continuous treatment to reduce the risk of psychosis recurrence [^116WA2RJ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Low credibility.

Placebo-controlled trials that support maintenance treatment generally last 6–12 months, which might be too short to be informative for an illness with a lifetime course. Supporting this assertion is a trial showing that psychosis was less likely to worsen in patients allocated to continued maintenance treatment in the short run, but in the long run, social functioning was worsened by maintenance treatment. Finally, discontinuation of antipsychotics might produce withdrawal effects beyond supersensitivity, such as insomnia, which by itself might contribute to psychosis exacerbation. Moreover, patients released from the sedating effects of antipsychotics might appear agitated to the untrained eye and hence, misdiagnosed as exacerbated.

Unlike RCTs, intermittent/targeted treatment studies typically last several years. However, despite efforts to design the most valid studies within the constraints of very long-term follow-up and significant drop-out rates, such studies have inevitable methodologic weaknesses. Because some of the follow-up studies did not use a random assignment design, the possibility that the results are confounded by indication cannot be ruled out. It is possible that less severely ill patients at baseline were included in the intermittent or no treatment group, raising the chicken and egg question or inverse causality concerns. However, even if that has been the case, it still demonstrates that a subgroup of about 30% of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia does not experience psychotic symptoms in the absence of antipsychotic drugs.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: A population-based cohort study [^112wnEyi]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Taken together, since studies have shown that the antipsychotic treatment response deteriorates markedly after the second relapse, which was also observed in this cohort, it seems that the treatment guidelines recommending clozapine as the third-line treatment lead to delayed use of clozapine and could lead to iatrogenic worsening of the person's schizophrenia. In addition, there is evidence that long delays in initiating clozapine after the emergence of treatment-resistant symptoms are associated with a decreased likelihood of optimal response.

Factors associated with treatment other than a drug, such as frequent blood monitoring, might contribute to observed differences. However, closer clinical contact has not explained other benefits of clozapine treatment. The potential halo effects of blood monitoring versus potentially uniquely efficacious receptor binding profiles of clozapine could be interesting from a pharmacological point of view, but for the patients, their families, and those treating the patients, it is indifferent what component of the treatment explains the good outcome. The uncertainty of actual treatment status is higher for non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapies and polypharmacy than for clozapine, long-acting injectables, and non-use. A subgroup of non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapy and polypharmacy users might have abruptly discontinued antipsychotic treatment before the first relapse.

Almost half of the patients in our cohort were not using any antipsychotic before their first relapse.

### Predicting relapse in schizophrenia: Is BDNF a plausible biological marker [^115MoE3p]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Understanding the biological processes that underlie why patients relapse is an issue of fundamental importance to the detection and prevention of relapse in schizophrenia. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a facilitator of brain plasticity, is reduced in patients with schizophrenia. In the present study, we examined whether decreases in plasma BDNF levels could be used as a biological predictor of relapse in schizophrenia.

A total of 221 patients were prospectively evaluated for relapse over 30 months in the Preventing Relapse in Schizophrenia: Oral Antipsychotics Compared to Injectables: Evaluating Efficacy (PROACTIVE) study. Serial blood samples were collected at a maximum of 23 time points during the 30-month trial, and BDNF levels were measured in plasma samples by ELISA.

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that BDNF was not a significant predictor of relapse, hospitalization, or exacerbation. Regardless of treatment group (oral second-generation antipsychotic vs. long-acting injectable risperidone microspheres), baseline BDNF value did not differ significantly between those who experienced any of the adverse outcomes and those who did not. While contrary to the study hypothesis, these robust results offer little support for the use of plasma BDNF alone as a biomarker to predict relapse in schizophrenia.

### Targeted treatment of schizophrenia symptoms as they manifest, or continuous treatment to reduce the risk of psychosis recurrence [^113xfsHQ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Low credibility.

The diagnostic concept of schizophrenia syndrome encompasses individuals who display a wide variety of phenomenology, illness courses, and possibly biological abnormalities. The Krepelinian dogma of a single outcome of lifelong inevitable deterioration has been challenged by accumulating evidence. Schizophrenia's heterogeneity is supported by Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) indications that many genetic variations can produce clinical phenomena meeting diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. Additionally, studies reporting numerous plausible biological abnormalities between cohorts of schizophrenia patients and controls are often based on outliers within the patient cohort, further rejecting a unitary biological basis for this condition.

The quest for a unitary etiology, akin to the spirochete insanity solution for schizophrenia, where a single abnormality or lesion is at the root of the three main component manifestations — psychosis, negative symptoms, and cognitive deficiency — would be convenient from a treatment standpoint, but is not supported by evidence. On the contrary, it can be hypothesized that in some patients, these three symptom clusters might be unrelated etiologically and manifest only by chance in the same individual who meets the criteria for schizophrenia. Psychosis ranges from a single episode to treatment-refractory cases. Cognitive performance scores range from 2 standard deviations below norms to occasionally above average performance scores, and negative symptoms vary widely.

### Impact of relapse in BDNF receptors expression in patients with a first episode of schizophrenia [^114f9Wk3]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Low credibility.

Relapsing following a first episode of schizophrenia (FES) is a main predictor of clinical and functional prognosis. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in neuronal development and plasticity, and its signaling may be altered by successive relapses.

- **Design**: We assessed the impact of first relapse in the expression of the two isoforms of the BDNF tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor (active full-length TrkB-F and inactive truncated TrkB-T) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 53 FES patients in clinical remission followed up for three years.

- **Results**: The group of participants that relapsed (n = 24) during the follow-up presented a significant decrease in the expression of the active TrkB-F receptor compared to baseline (M = 100 ± 28.13 vs. M = 83.42 ± 33.84, t = 2.5, P = 0.02), with no changes in the inactive TrkB-T receptor expression nor in BDNF plasma levels. This decrease also led to a significant decline in the F/T ratio (M = 1.13 ± 0.38 vs. 0.94 ± 0.36, t = 2.17, P = 0.041). No significant differences were found in the receptors' expression nor in plasma levels in the group of cases that remained in remission (n = 29). These results were not associated with baseline differences between the groups in terms of the BDNF signaling pathway biomarkers, clinical, or treatment variables.

- **Conclusions**: These findings highlight the biological impact that a relapse produces over the systemic BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway, potentially undermining crucial neuronal functions. Identifying the actors involved can help design specific interventions.

### Maintenance ECT in schizophrenia: A systematic review [^113w2DYk]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

Relapse after discontinuation of ECT is significant in patients with schizophrenia. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the use of M-ECT in schizophrenia to guide clinical decision-making for relapse prevention. We reviewed studies examining the role of continuation (C-ECT) and maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (M-ECT) in schizophrenia.

Following PRISMA guidelines, we included randomized controlled trials, open-label trials, retrospective chart reviews, case reports, and case series in this review. We evaluated adjunctive pharmacological regimens; ECT treatment parameters, including frequency, duration of continued treatment, and electrode placement; and clinical outcomes, including cognitive side effects and relapse rates from included studies. Our findings suggest M-ECT could provide an effective form of relapse prevention in these patients, and persistent cognitive side effects are minimal.

### Abilify asimtufii [^116GcLQB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The long-term efficacy of Abilify Maintena in maintaining symptomatic control in schizophrenia was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal trial in adult patients (Study 2) who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia and were being treated with at least one antipsychotic medication. Patients had at least a 3-year history of illness and a history of relapse or symptom exacerbation when not receiving antipsychotic treatment.

Clinical ratings during this trial included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S). Specifically:

- **Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale**: Ranges from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) based on the change from baseline in clinical condition.

- **Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Suicide (CGI-SS) scale**: Comprised of 2 parts:
	- **Part 1**: Rates the severity of suicidal thoughts and behavior from 1 (not at all suicidal) to 5 (attempted suicide), based on the most severe level in the last 7 days from all information available to the rater.
	- **Part 2**: Rates the change from baseline in suicidal thoughts and behavior from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).

This trial included:

- **A 4 to 6 week open-label, oral conversion phase** for patients on antipsychotic medications other than aripiprazole. A total of 633 patients entered this phase.

- **An open-label, oral aripiprazole stabilization phase** with a target dose of 10 mg to 30 mg once daily. A total of 710 patients entered this phase. Patient ages ranged from 18 to 60 years (mean 40 years), and 60% were male. The mean PANSS total score was recorded.

### Long-term remission with cariprazine treatment in patients with schizophrenia: A post hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, relapse prevention trial [^114KCpz7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Long-term remission is an important treatment goal in schizophrenia. Cariprazine, a dopamine D₃/D₂ receptor and serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, is approved in the United States and Europe to treat adults with schizophrenia.

- **Methods**: Post hoc analyses of data from a long-term cariprazine relapse prevention study (NCT01412060; September 27, 2011-September 3, 2014) investigated the efficacy of cariprazine for maintaining remission in clinically stable patients with DSM-IV-TR-defined schizophrenia. Patients were stabilized with open-label cariprazine (20 weeks), then randomized 1:1 to cariprazine (3, 6, or 9 mg/d) or placebo for double-blind treatment (up to 72 weeks). Symptomatic remission was defined as scores ≤ 3 on 8 items from the General, Positive, and Negative Symptoms subscales of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Sustained remission included meeting remission criteria at all prior double-blind visits or for ≥ 6 consecutive months.

- **Results**: At randomization, 169/200 patients (84.5%) met symptomatic remission criteria. During double-blind treatment, time to loss of sustained remission was significantly longer (P = 0.0020) for cariprazine versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.51); 60.5% of cariprazine-treated and 34.9% of placebo-treated patients sustained remission through the final visit (odds ratio [OR] = 2.85; p = 0.0012; number needed to treat [NNT] = 4). Almost twice as many cariprazine-treated (39.6%) as placebo-treated (21.2%) patients met symptomatic remission criteria at all visits for ≥ 6 consecutive months.

### Maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia [^1126LcYj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

The symptoms and signs of schizophrenia have been firmly linked to high levels of dopamine in specific areas of the brain, such as the limbic system. Antipsychotic drugs block the transmission of dopamine in the brain and reduce the acute symptoms of the disorder. This review examined whether antipsychotic drugs are also effective for relapse prevention.

- **Objectives**: To review the effects of maintaining antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia compared to withdrawing these agents.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Specialised Register (November 2008), with additional searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and clinicaltrials.gov (June 2011).

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomised trials comparing maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs and placebo for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, using a random-effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) based on a random-effects model.

- **Main results**: The review currently includes 65 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 6,493 participants comparing antipsychotic medication with placebo. The trials were published from 1959 to 2011, and their size ranged between 14 and 420 participants. In many studies, the methods of randomisation, allocation, and blinding were poorly reported.

### Iloperidone [^1127jFJr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A 4-week, placebo-controlled trial (n = 604) involved one fixed dose of iloperidone (24 mg/day) compared to placebo and an active control (ziprasidone). The titration schedule was similar to that of the 6-week study, with titration of iloperidone starting at 1 mg twice daily on Day 1 and increasing to 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, and 12 mg twice daily on Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline on the PANSS total score at the end of treatment (Day 28). The 24 mg/day iloperidone dose was superior to placebo in the PANSS total score. Iloperidone tablets appeared to have similar efficacy to the active control drug, which also required slow titration to the target dose.

In a longer-term trial, clinically stable adult outpatients (n = 303) meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, who had remained stable following 12 weeks of open-label treatment with flexible doses of iloperidone (8 mg/day to 24 mg/day administered as twice daily doses), were randomized to either placebo or continue on their iloperidone dose (8 mg/day to 24 mg/day, administered as twice daily doses) for observation for possible relapse during the double-blind relapse prevention phase. Stabilization during the open-label phase was defined as being on an established dose of iloperidone that was unchanged due to efficacy in the 4 weeks prior to randomization, having a CGI-Severity score of ≤ 4 and PANSS total score ≤ 70, and a score of ≤ 4 on each of the following individual PANSS items: P1-delusions, P2-conceptual disorganization, P3-hallucinatory behavior, and P6-susp.

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^113Lx8Ds]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Low credibility.

Distinguishing withdrawal-associated relapse from the endogenous relapse of a psychotic illness is difficult. Withdrawal-associated relapse has been thought to be characterized by early onset following the elimination of medication and association with other evidence of withdrawal, including motor symptoms.

The strongest evidence for the existence of withdrawal-associated relapse is the preponderance of relapses that occur in the weeks and months following cessation. That is, relapses are not distributed evenly across time but tend to occur predominantly around the point of drug cessation. This is emphasized by comparison of studies of abrupt withdrawal to a study in which patients were tapered off antipsychotics more slowly (over up to 18 months) where relapses are much more evenly distributed across time, without the same degree of clustering that occurs in studies where antipsychotics are stopped quickly. This pattern is understandable because there should conceivably be no systematic correlation between the times at which different patients relapse.

Some have suggested that the reason relapse rates are higher in the first few months following drug cessation, and then gradually reduce, is because there are fewer patients "available" to relapse as time goes on because they have already relapsed. However, the marked increase in relapse rates that occur following drug discontinuation cannot be explained by simple attrition of patients over time. The clustering of relapses around the point of discontinuation…

### The evidence for illness progression after relapse in schizophrenia [^115ZydBc]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

It has long been suspected that relapse in schizophrenia is associated with disease progression as time to response is longer, negative and other symptoms persist, some patients become treatment refractory, and neuroprogression in terms of structural brain changes may occur. This article examines the evidence for illness progression after relapse in patients with schizophrenia. It reports on indirect evidence obtained from retrospective, naturalistic, and brain-imaging studies, as well as a few prospective studies examining pre- and post-relapse treatment response.

Findings suggest that the treatment response after relapse is variable, with many patients responding rapidly, others exhibiting protracted impairment of response, and a subgroup displaying emergent refractoriness. This subgroup comprises about 1 in 6 patients, irrespective of whether it is the first or a subsequent relapse, and even when the delay between the onset of first symptoms of relapse and initiation of treatment is brief. While there is a lack of well-designed studies investigating the post-relapse treatment outcome, available evidence gives sufficient cause for concern that, in addition to the considerable psychosocial risks, an additional risk of biological harm may be associated with relapse.

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^112nFT1s]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Low credibility.

Motor withdrawal effects have been attributed to dopaminergic hypersensitivity arising in nigrostriatal pathways caused by antipsychotic treatment. When antipsychotics are abruptly withdrawn, sensitized dopamine receptors are exposed to physiological levels of dopamine, which can result in increased striatal dopaminergic activity. Withdrawal dyskinesia has been interpreted as evidence of an intermediate form of dopaminergic hypersensitivity, unmasked by the removal of dopaminergic antagonists. This is in contrast to tardive dyskinesia (TD), where hypersensitivity is present to a degree evident even during treatment.

In animal studies, dopaminergic blockade leads to dopaminergic hypersensitivity. One study demonstrated that the administration of antipsychotics for two weeks resulted in dopaminergic hypersensitivity in rats, as evidenced by the diminishing ability of antipsychotics to suppress amphetamine-induced behavioral effects. The number of D2 receptors increased by 20%–40%, alongside a two- to three-fold increase in highly sensitive dopamine receptors. Another study involving rats found that nine months of haloperidol treatment led to a two- to three-fold increase in D2 receptors. Receptor numbers remained elevated (and even increased) during the two months following haloperidol withdrawal, a period suggested to be equivalent to more than a year in humans.

There is also evidence that dopaminergic hypersensitivity occurs in humans. A meta-analysis of molecular imaging studies in schizophrenia found increased D2/D3 receptor availability only in subjects who had been exposed to antipsychotic medication.

### A randomized, controlled trial of omega-3 fatty acids plus an antioxidant for relapse prevention after antipsychotic discontinuation in first-episode schizophrenia [^114y2b7c]. Schizophrenia Research (2014). High credibility.

While antipsychotics are effective in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, they have safety and tolerability risks. We investigated whether a combination of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) and a metabolic antioxidant, alpha-lipoic acid (α-LA), is effective in preventing relapse after antipsychotic discontinuation in subjects who were successfully treated for 2–3 years following a first episode of schizophrenia, schizo-affective, or schizophreniform disorder.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, antipsychotic treatment was tapered and discontinued. Participants received either ω-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic acid 2g/day and docosahexaenoic acid 1g/day) + α-LA 300 mg/day, or placebo. Subjects were followed up for two years or until relapse.

- **Results**: Recruitment was terminated prematurely due to the high relapse rates in both treatment groups as well as the severity of some of the relapse episodes. Of the 33 participants, 19/21 (90%) randomized to ω-3 PUFAs + α-LA relapsed and one (5%) completed two years without relapse (p = 0.6); and 9/12 (75%) randomized to placebo relapsed and none completed two years without relapse. Mean times to relapse were 39.8 ± 25.4 and 38.3 ± 26.6 weeks for the ω-3 PUFAs + α-LA and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.9). There were no significant differences between the groups in relapse symptom severity.

- **Conclusions**: We found no evidence that ω-3 PUFAs + α-LA could be a suitable alternative to maintenance antipsychotic treatment in relapse prevention in this small study.

### Methods to prevent and treat relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immunomodulating drugs, deacetylase inhibitors, and hypomethylating agents [^1152xQBL]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Relapse is a major cause of treatment failure after stem cell transplantation. Novel agents, given as maintenance or preemptive post-transplant therapy, were discussed at the 3rd International Workshop on Biology, Prevention, and Treatment of Relapse after Stem Cell Transplantation in Hamburg, Germany in November 2016 under the auspices of EBMT and ASBMT.

- **Maintenance therapy**: This is started after stem cell transplantation (SCT) without detectable disease. It treats all patients but results in overtreating a significant number. Maintenance therapy requires an agent without significant off-target toxicity.
- **Preemptive therapy**: This approach is triggered by the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). It initiates therapy only upon detection of MRD, sparing further therapy to those who remain in remission. Preemptive strategies rely on sensitive and clinically reliable assays to detect MRD.

The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), immunomodulating drugs (IMiDs), deacetylase inhibitors, and hypomethylating agents were reviewed.

### Torpenz [^113vGFUK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor, which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g. HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake during in vitro and/or in vivo studies.

Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner.

Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: A population-based cohort study [^1177pDPa]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Using the national registry of Finland, we investigated the comparative effectiveness of different treatment strategies in relapse prevention before and after the first relapse in people with first-episode schizophrenia. Compared with continuing the same treatment strategy used before the first relapse, a switch to clozapine was always associated with the lowest risk of a second relapse. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for second relapse for a switch from non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapy to clozapine was 0.66 (95% CI 0.49–0.88); for a switch from non-use to clozapine, it was 0.52 (95% CI 0.41–0.65); and for a switch from non-clozapine oral antipsychotic polypharmacy, it was 0.30 (95% CI 0.16–0.56).

For non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapies, a switch to another non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapy was not associated with decreased relapse risk (aHR 0.99, 95% CI 0.76–1.28). Switching from other antipsychotics to clozapine was associated with a decreased risk of relapse, but switching from clozapine to other oral antipsychotics was associated with an increased risk of relapse (aHR 2.19, 95% CI 1.39–3.45). This indicates that the order of switches was not the pivotal factor for treatment success, but rather clozapine use itself.

Our study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence for the comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic switch strategies among people experiencing their first schizophrenia relapse. Although switching from one oral non-clozapine antipsychotic to another was not associated with a decrease in the relapse risk, a switch to clozapine was associated with a 34% reduction in relapse risk (95% CI 12–51).

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^111vu2Gk]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Low credibility.

Given that reduced antagonism of D2 dopaminergic receptors has been implicated in many of the withdrawal phenomena attributed to antipsychotics, including psychotic symptoms, we suggest that tapering regimes should aim to reduce D2 receptor antagonism in a linear fashion. Adequate time should be provided between dose reductions to allow adaptation to lower doses of the drug. This approach may produce more "evenly spread" perturbations to the system, which could minimize withdrawal-associated effects.

- **Pharmacologically informed tapering regimens**: Linear decrements, for example, a 10 percentage point reduction in D2 receptor occupancy from 90% for haloperidol, require hyperbolic dose reductions. This is illustrated in Table 3b. Decrements of 20 percentage points are shown in Figure 2c, with further medications detailed in Table 4 and supplementary tables S3–S11.

- **Theoretical representation of dose reduction**: Figure 3 illustrates abrupt versus gradual reduction of antipsychotic dose.
	- (A) Untreated schizophrenia is represented by postsynaptic D2 receptors (open circles). Antipsychotics cause blockade of D2 receptors (filled in circles). Chronic treatment is hypothesized to cause the upregulation of D2 receptors.
	- (B) Abrupt cessation of antipsychotic causes a large increase in dopaminergic transmission in sensitized D2 receptors, possibly associated with an increased risk of relapse.
	- (C) (i) Gradual reduction in antipsychotic dose leads to incrementally increased dopaminergic transmission, possibly associated with a smaller increase in the risk of relapse or a temporary increase in symptoms.

### Predicting individual improvement in schizophrenia symptom severity at 1-year follow-up: Comparison of connectomic, structural, and clinical predictors [^1111M7pm]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Low credibility.

While many individuals with schizophrenia can achieve varying degrees of remission, the risk of relapse, recurrence, and worsening of symptoms remains significant, particularly after treatment discontinuation. Relapse may indicate disease progression, and in many cases, is accompanied by brain changes or serious consequences, including extreme despair and increased risk of suicide. Predicting relapse events and illness course is therefore critical to enable early and targeted initiation of appropriate treatments to individuals with a high risk of relapse. Moreover, individuals predicted to follow a favorable illness course may be spared unnecessary treatment and associated side effects.
