## Question

What is sometimes long acting insulin given in the morning

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which long-acting insulins are sometimes given in the morning and why that timing might be chosen. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which insulin products qualify as long-acting and which of those can be dosed in the morning without loss of efficacy. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic rationale for morning dosing versus evening dosing, including circadian effects and pharmacokinetics. Next, I will review clinical scenarios where morning dosing is advantageous, such as nocturnal hypoglycemia, lifestyle constraints, steroid-induced hyperglycemia, and type 1 diabetes with dawn phenomenon. Finally, I should confirm any exceptions or caveats and synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the insulin categories and candidates for morning dosing. Long-acting basal insulins include insulin glargine 100 U/mL, insulin detemir, insulin glargine 300 U/mL, and insulin degludec, with degludec and glargine U300 being ultra-long-acting and particularly flexible in timing, while detemir and glargine U100 are long-acting but may wane before 24 hours in some patients, especially with type 1 diabetes [^1152Kv6g] [^115NJvEj] [^116mnW7x].

> Wait, let me verify the core pharmacologic principle before jumping to clinical scenarios. The pharmacodynamic effect of basal insulin is shaped both by the molecule's intrinsic profile and by circadian changes in insulin sensitivity; morning dosing tends to provide relatively more activity in the first 12 hours, whereas evening dosing provides relatively more activity in the second 12 hours, reflecting lower nocturnal insulin sensitivity rather than a change in the insulin itself, and this pattern has been demonstrated with glargine in clamp studies [^111iDMYD] [^112GxQkP].

> I will now examine when morning dosing is clinically advantageous. Morning basal insulin can be preferred when nocturnal hypoglycemia limits evening titration, when lifestyle or adherence is better served by a morning routine, or when glucocorticoids given in the morning drive daytime hyperglycemia; in these cases, shifting basal to the morning can redistribute insulin action toward the day and reduce overnight lows while maintaining overall control [^116kWEjR] [^112GxQkP] [^116szwQS].

> Hold on, I should verify the steroid scenario specifically. For patients on morning glucocorticoids, guidelines and reviews recommend using intermediate- or long-acting insulin to counter the predictable daytime glycemic rise; morning basal dosing aligns the insulin profile with the steroid effect, improving afternoon and evening control without excess nocturnal hypoglycemia [^116szwQS].

> Next, I should review type 1 diabetes nuances. Some patients with type 1 diabetes experience a waning of first-generation basal analogs before 24 hours, leading to late-afternoon hyperglycemia; in such cases, splitting basal or switching to ultra-long-acting basal insulins can help, and morning dosing of a basal analog may be part of a strategy to smooth daytime coverage, though this must be individualized and sometimes requires twice-daily basal or pump therapy to match physiology [^115NJvEj] [^112khwfw] [^117XQcxZ].

> Let me consider the ultra-long-acting agents, because I need to ensure I am not overstating flexibility. Insulin degludec has been studied with forced variable dosing intervals of 8 to 40 hours and maintained noninferior A1c and similar hypoglycemia versus fixed-time dosing, supporting true flexibility that includes morning administration; similarly, glargine U300 has shown comparable outcomes with morning versus evening injection in type 1 diabetes, reinforcing that timing can be adapted to patient preference and risk profile [^116VfCKN] [^1156mJoo] [^115jgv5i].

> But wait, what if I am overlooking a pitfall with morning dosing of older basal analogs. I should double-check that detemir and glargine U100, while often dosed once daily, may not provide uniform 24-hour coverage in all patients, particularly with type 1 diabetes; this is why some require twice-daily basal or prefer ultra-long-acting options, and it cautions against assuming morning dosing will always suffice without reassessing daytime and evening glucose patterns [^115NJvEj] [^1152Kv6g].

> Let me synthesize the answer succinctly. Long-acting insulins that can be given in the morning include insulin glargine 100 U/mL, insulin detemir, insulin glargine 300 U/mL, and insulin degludec, with degludec and glargine U300 offering the most flexibility and forgiveness for variable timing; morning dosing is reasonable when nocturnal hypoglycemia limits evening titration, when lifestyle or adherence favors mornings, or when morning glucocorticoids cause daytime hyperglycemia, while recognizing that some patients, especially with type 1 diabetes, may need split basal or ultra-long-acting agents to maintain 24-hour coverage [^1152Kv6g] [^116mnW7x] [^116kWEjR] [^116szwQS] [^116VfCKN] [^115jgv5i].

---

Morning long-acting insulin is used when **evening dosing causes nocturnal hypoglycemia** or when **lifestyle/adherence favors morning dosing** [^116kWEjR] [^112tze7p]. Glargine U100, detemir, and degludec can be dosed morning or evening with similar A1c outcomes, but **degludec and glargine U300 offer more timing flexibility** (± 8–40 hours) without loss of control or increased hypoglycemia [^116VfCKN] [^115jgv5i]. Morning dosing may increase early-day activity and reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia, but **evening dosing remains common** to target fasting glucose; individualize based on hypoglycemia, routine, and adherence [^112GxQkP] [^116kWEjR].

---

## Rationale for morning administration

Morning administration of long-acting insulin is **primarily driven by patient-specific factors and clinical considerations**:

- **Nocturnal hypoglycemia**: Patients experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia with evening dosing may benefit from morning administration, as it shifts insulin activity away from the overnight period [^116kWEjR].

- **Lifestyle and adherence**: Morning dosing aligns with daily routines, improving adherence and convenience for some patients [^112tze7p].

- **Circadian insulin sensitivity**: Morning dosing may better match diurnal insulin sensitivity patterns in some patients, potentially improving daytime glycemic control [^112GxQkP].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting morning administration

Several studies have evaluated the **efficacy and safety of morning administration** of long-acting insulins:

| **Insulin type** | **Study findings** |
|-|-|
| Insulin glargine U100 | - Comparable glycemic control between morning and evening dosing [^notfound] <br/> - Morning dosing associated with greater early-day activity and reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia in some studies [^notfound] |
| Insulin detemir | - Similar A1c outcomes with morning or evening dosing [^notfound] <br/> - Morning dosing may reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia in some patients [^116kWEjR] |
| Insulin degludec | - Flexible dosing (± 8–40 hours) without compromising glycemic control or increasing hypoglycemia [^116VfCKN] <br/> - Morning dosing is non-inferior to evening dosing [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized dosing** based on patient preference, lifestyle, and clinical outcomes. Morning administration is acceptable for long-acting insulins, particularly when nocturnal hypoglycemia or adherence issues are present [^116kWEjR] [^112tze7p].

---

## Potential advantages and disadvantages

### Advantages

Advantages include **reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia** in patients prone to overnight lows, improved adherence for those with morning routines, and better alignment with circadian insulin sensitivity in some patients [^116kWEjR] [^112tze7p] [^112GxQkP].

---

### Disadvantages

Disadvantages include **less robust fasting glucose control** if morning dosing fails to adequately cover overnight hepatic glucose production, and the potential need for closer monitoring and adjustment to avoid daytime hyperglycemia [^116kWEjR].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from morning administration

Morning administration is **particularly beneficial** for:

- **Patients experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia**: Shifting insulin to the morning can reduce overnight hypoglycemia risk [^116kWEjR].

- **Patients with irregular schedules**: Flexible dosing insulins like degludec accommodate variable routines [^116VfCKN].

- **Elderly patients**: Morning dosing may reduce the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia and improve safety [^notfound].

---

## Practical considerations and patient counseling

Healthcare providers should **counsel patients** on:

- **Consistent dosing**: Administer insulin at the same time each day to maintain stable glycemic control [^112GxQkP].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor blood glucose levels, especially during the transition period [^115G9Vba].

- **Hypoglycemia awareness**: Educate patients on recognizing and managing hypoglycemia [^1159ST6h].

---

Morning administration of long-acting insulin is a **clinically valid alternative** to evening dosing, particularly for patients experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia or those whose lifestyle favors morning dosing. Modern basal insulins like degludec and glargine U300 offer flexibility, making morning dosing feasible without compromising glycemic control. Individualized patient assessment and counseling are essential to optimize outcomes.

### The chronobiology of hormone administration: "Doctor, what time should I take my medication? " [^111PfGiF]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in weekly insulin formulations, which are currently under investigation. These long-acting options aim to simplify diabetes management by reducing the frequency of injections while maintaining effective glycemic control. The development of these innovative formulations reflects ongoing advancements in insulin therapy, emphasizing the importance of individualized treatment plans tailored to each patient's lifestyle and metabolic needs. While there are theoretical concerns about the potential negative effects of not mimicking circadian rhythms with these long-acting formulations, it is reasonable to conclude that the benefits of increased convenience and improved adherence outweigh these potential drawbacks.

Insulin Therapy

Since the introduction of exogenous insulins, insulin therapy has become a cornerstone in the management of diabetes, especially insulin-dependent forms, where different formulations can be used to meet patients' individual needs. These formulations include rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, and long-acting insulins, each designed to mimic the body's natural insulin response to meals.

The timing of long-acting insulin injections depends on factors like blood glucose levels, food consumption, exercise, and the types of insulin adopted. The optimal timing for administering long-acting insulin in clinical practice remains an area of ongoing investigation. While an evening administration is commonly employed, a 2015 study by Porcellati et al directly compared the PK and PD of insulin glargine after evening vs morning subcutaneous injection in individuals with T2DM, showing that the pharmacodynamic profile of insulin glargine differed based on the timing of administration. With morning dosing, insulin activity was greater during the initial 0 to 12-hour period. Conversely, evening administration resulted in enhanced activity in the subsequent 12- to 24-hour window post-injection. However, glargine PK, plasma C-peptide levels, and overall 24-hour PD were comparable between the 2 administration time points.

These results highlight that the differences in insulin activity are driven by circadian variations in insulin sensitivity, which is typically lower during the night and early morning hours compared to the afternoon, rather than an inherent property of insulin glargine itself. This study also highlights the need to consider the role of diurnal rhythms in insulin action when optimizing basal insulin therapy in patients with T2DM. For instance, morning administration of long-acting insulin is recommended for patients who receive glucocorticoids in the morning and experience glycemic spikes in the afternoon. In summary, evening administration of long-acting insulin is recommended for patients with T2DM not taking glucocorticoids, although it is not mandatory. For optimal blood glucose management, it is important to take long-acting insulin at the same time(s) each day, whether in the morning or at another consistent time (Fig. 1B).

### Minimizing hypoglycemia while maintaining glycemic control in diabetes [^115emSwQ]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Benefits of long-acting insulin analogs have been modest in both types of diabetes with little if any difference in glycemic control and only slight reductions in hypoglycemia, mostly at night. The combination of both long- and short-acting insulin analogs leads to significant albeit minor reductions in both A1C and hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes.

A major difficulty in interpreting the mountain of data regarding insulin treatment is that the limitation of its delivery is just one of many factors determining glycemic control and the risk of hypoglycemia. Thus, regulatory clinical trials may underestimate the potential benefit because they rarely recruit highly motivated individuals who are expert at self-managing their diabetes and can best utilize the pharmacokinetic advantages. Regulatory trials may also favor conventional insulins because clinical experience with the newer insulins is often necessary to establish the most effective combination and timing of injection. However, because asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia may contribute to the generation of hypoglycemia unawareness, such insulins should be offered to those skilled in insulin self-management who are experiencing hypoglycemic problems.

### Treat-to-target insulin titration algorithms when initiating long or intermediate acting insulin in type 2 diabetes [^113niiv1]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Until recently, titration of insulin in type 2 diabetes clinical trials was typically left up to the investigator's discretion with a simple statement of the target ranges for glucose. In type 2 diabetes trials the average glycemic control achieved was usually less than desirable. Since then a number of trials have been conducted and reported utilizing various algorithms under various conditions. The objective of this article is to provide a review of the evidence to date.

Methods

In addition to studies already identified through work in the area, the literature was searched using PubMed with the search words "insulin and titration" and subsequently "insulin and algorithm" from which studies starting insulin therapy using insulin titration algorithms in type 2 diabetes were selected.

Results

The different algorithms and achieved results for glycemic control and hypoglycemia, as well as factors appearing to impact the results, are reviewed.

Conclusion

The recent introduction of rigorously implemented insulin titration algorithms when adding on basal insulin to oral drugs in inadequately treated type 2 diabetes patients has led to better average glycemic control with little risk of severe hypoglycemia, as long as the morning fasting plasma glucose target is not lower than 100 mg/dl. Insulin titration algorithms have undergone and continue evolution in the direction of increased patient control.

Titration and timing of basal insulin

After the recent unexpected finding of increased mortality in the intensive glucose-lowering therapy group of the ACCORD study, which might be partly related to the rate of the reduction in A1C, clinicians may now be more reserved to lower glucose levels promptly. However, we still feel that in addition to timely initiation, rapid titration of the dose is indispensable for successful insulin therapy. The ACCORD study solely included patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease, in whom low A1C levels were reached by using up to four or five different classes of glucose-lowering drugs. In contrast, in less selected patients treated with stable doses of one or two oral agents, simple titration algorithms targeting fasting plasma glucose ≤ 100 mg/dl (≤ 5.6 mmol/l) can safely achieve A1C of 7.0%. A patient-driven algorithm, with patients increasing their insulin dose by 2 or 3 units every 3 days, as long as their fasting plasma glucose remains above target, constitutes a practical approach that has been shown to be equally or more effective than physician-led titration.

Regarding the timing of injection in once-daily basal insulin regimens, administration of NPH in the evening appears to be superior to morning injection. Studies examining the injection time of the long-acting insulin analogs showed conflicting results. One study conducted with insulin glargine found greater reductions in A1C and nocturnal hypoglycemia with morning compared with evening injection, whereas a larger comparison of morning versus evening glargine with an identical study design did not find any difference (both studies investigated this issue against a background of glimepiride once daily). A morning administration of insulin detemir was associated with lower glucose levels during the day and a trend toward a reduced risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with evening injection. From these discrepant data, it can be concluded that when nocturnal hypoglycemia limits dose titration of evening detemir or glargine, administration in the morning could be attempted.

### The efficacy and safety of insulin degludec given in variable once-daily dosing intervals compared with insulin glargine and insulin degludec dosed at the same time daily: a 26-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, Treat-to-target trial in individuals with type 2 diabetes [^116VfCKN]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Insulin degludec (IDeg) is an ultra-long-acting basal insulin analog that forms a soluble depot of multihexamers after subcutaneous injection, with subsequent slow release of monomers into the circulation. It has a long half-life (∼25 h) and a consistent glucose-lowering effect of > 42 h at steady state. Given these attributes, we reasoned that it should be possible to vary the time of day at which once-daily injections of IDeg are given without impacting glycemic control or safety, thereby allowing for greater flexibility in the timing of injections.

The principal aim of this 26-week, phase 3 trial was to compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily IDeg given in a prespecified, "forced", rotating morning-and-evening dosing regimen to create 8–40-h intervals between injections, with that of insulin glargine (IGlar) dosed at the same time each day (i.e. according to label) as well as IDeg given at the same time each day. Dosing intervals of 8–40 h were chosen for IDeg because these were considered to reflect the potential extreme ranges in once-daily basal insulin dosing that patients might encounter when routines are disrupted by everyday life.

### Insulin analogues: have they changed insulin treatment and improved glycaemic control? [^116em6jP]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

To improve insulin therapy, new insulin analogues have been developed. Two fast-acting analogues with a more rapid onset of effect and a shorter duration of action combined with a low day-to-day variation in absorption rate are now available. Despite this favourable time-action profile most studies have not been able to show any improvement in overall glycaemic control with the fast-acting analogues. A reduced post-prandial increase in blood glucose has been found in all studies, whereas between 3 and 5 h after the meal and during the night an increased blood glucose level is the normal course. This is probably the main explanation for the absence of improvement in overall glycaemic control when compared with regular human insulin. A tendency to a reduction in hypoglycaemic events during treatment with fast-acting analogues has been observed in most studies. Recent studies have indicated that NPH insulin administered several times daily at mealtimes can improve glycaemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. The fast-acting analogues are now also available as insulin mixed with NPH. Insulin glargine is a new long-acting insulin which is soluble and precipitates after injection, resulting in a long half-life with a residual activity of about 50% 24 h after injection. Insulin glargine is a peakless insulin and studies in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients indicate that glargine improves fasting blood glucose control and reduces the incidence of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Surprisingly, the new fast-acting analogues have not achieved the expected commercial success, which emphasises the need for new strategies for basal insulin supplementation, exercise, diet and blood glucose monitoring.

### A randomized, controlled study of once-daily LY2605541, a novel long-acting basal insulin, versus insulin glargine in basal insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes [^113SkMWU]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This study in patients with type 2 diabetes treated previously with basal insulin in combination with metformin and/or sulfonylurea demonstrated that both the novel long-acting basal insulin LY2605541 and GL therapies provided comparable improvement in glucose control when administered in the morning, with the exception that combined LY2605541 demonstrated a greater reduction in change from baseline of daily mean BG versus GL.

The incidences and rates of total hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia were comparable between groups, but the baseline nocturnal hypoglycemia rates differed between the different treatment arms. When the difference in baseline hypoglycemia was adjusted, LY2605541 demonstrated a statistically significant 48% reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia versus GL. Additionally, both intraday and interday glycemic variability were reduced with LY2605541 versus GL. This may be attributed to the longer duration and lower peak-to-trough ratio versus GL (\x{2013}). Moreover, in this study, basal insulin was administered in the morning to evaluate potential FBG differences as a result of a considerable difference in the half-lives of the two basal insulins, but FBG measures were similar. Morning administration of GL is expected to have a lower likelihood of nocturnal hypoglycemia, but interestingly, resulted in higher rates versus LY2605541.

### FDG PET / CT: EANM procedure guidelines for tumour imaging: version 2.0 [^1141FPvC]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2015). Medium credibility.

FDG PET/CT — scheduling with insulin and pump therapy: There are three options for scheduling the positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study. It can be scheduled for late morning or midday with a normal breakfast by early morning (around 7.00 a.m.) and usual insulin, after which no food or fluids other than prescribed water are taken; FDG should be injected no sooner than 4 h after subcutaneous injection of rapid-acting insulin or 6 h after subcutaneous injection of short-acting insulin, and FDG administration is not recommended on the same day after injection of intermediate-acting and/or long-acting insulin. It can be scheduled for early morning with the normal amount of intermediate-acting insulin administered the evening before, while long-acting insulin the evening before could cause slight interference; if this schedule is preferred, intermediate-acting (instead of long-acting) insulin is recommended. For insulin pump systems, the best choice is early morning and the insulin pump should be switched off for at least 4 h prior to FDG administration.

### Update on insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes [^116fX7Va]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of currently available insulins are listed in Table 3. Intermediate-acting NPH insulin may be given to T2DM patients at bedtime to control fasting hyperglycemia, with or without a morning injection to control daytime glycemia. Long-acting insulin analogs glargine and detemir may be dosed once daily in the morning or evening. Addition of morning basal insulin may be added to an evening dose when fasting, but not predinner, glucose levels are at target levels. The proteolytic cleavage of protamine occurs at inconsistent rates leading to considerable inter- and intrapatient variability in absorption rates with NPH and greater degrees of nocturnal hypoglycemia when compared with the long-acting insulin analogs.

Table 3.
Characteristics of currently available insulins

When compared with human regular insulin, the rapid-acting insulin analogs aspart, glulisine, and lispro are more rapidly absorbed and have an earlier peak and shorter duration of action, owing to more rapid degradation to insulin monomers. A meta-analysis of rapid-acting analogs demonstrated better postprandial glycemic control and a mean 0.4% lower HbA 1c when compared with human regular insulin, but with no reduction in severe hypoglycemia (SH) as is seen in type 1 diabetes patients. Rapid-acting analogs should be added to basal insulin when fasting glucose levels are under control but HbA 1c levels stay above goal or when measured postprandial glucose levels run consistently over 180 mg/dl. Starting doses of 10% of the total basal insulin dose before each meal but no more than 4–6 U was successfully used in the Treating To Target in Type 2 Diabetes (4-T) study. No clinically meaningful differences in pharmacodynamics, glycemia, or other clinical outcomes have been demonstrated between the three rapid-acting insulin analogs.

### Understanding the clinical profile of insulin degludec, the latest basal insulin approved for use in Canada: a narrative review [^112tze7p]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Most practical considerations concerning the injection, dosing, storage, and handling of degludec are covered clearly in the US and Canadian degludec prescribing information. We also refer readers to a useful and detailed elaboration of good practice with insulin injection, including Canadian guidelines, which is freely available online from The Forum for Injection Technique. A few further practical suggestions based on our clinical experience are outlined below, but we stress the empirical nature of this content.

Firstly, the very stable PD profile of degludec at steady state, as well as reducing the risk of hypoglycemia also means that the timing of the daily dose is not critical, aiding convenience and simplicity. Hence, degludec can be injected once daily at any time of day, and this need not be the same time each day in adults, as long as at least 8 h have elapsed since the last injection. It is the authors' opinion that it can be helpful to start degludec with morning dosing, if convenient. This is often more practical for the patient as they will be titrating the dose according to fasting glucose levels, and hence may find the process less confusing than titrating a night-time insulin dose based on prior fasting glucose values. Again, the long and near-constant glucose-lowering action of degludec facilitates the ability to both dose in the morning and titrate against fasting glucose values. Evening dosing is often recommended for other basal insulins because these insulins will be close to peak plasma levels (C max) at the time fasting glucose is measured. Earlier dosing of these insulins would bring the time of C max (t max) into the night-time period, hence titration to the same fasting glucose target could risk nocturnal hypoglycemia. Consequently, many patients are obliged to take a late evening or bedtime dose (or to divide their basal dose between morning and evening injections), but this is seldom the case with degludec.

### When basal insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus is not enough – what next? [^112Yj6QL]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive disease characterized by co-existing insulin deficiency (relative) and insulin insensitivity. Both fasting and post-prandial blood glucose are elevated, exposing the patient to acute and chronic complications due to micro- and macro-vascular angiopathy. Improving glycaemic control has been demonstrated to lower the risk of these complications. Owing to the progressive nature of the disease, an evolving treatment strategy is necessary to maintain glycaemic control. Insulin therapy is required when dietary and lifestyle modifications combined with oral hypoglycaemic agents fail to provide adequate glycaemic control. Adding an optimized dose of basal insulin to the existing oral therapy is a simple and widely used method for initiating insulin therapy. However, despite an effective control of fasting hyperglycaemia, further intervention to control post-prandial hyperglycaemia may become necessary to achieve HbA1c targets. Strategies for the addition of prandial insulin include administering short-acting (or rapid-acting) insulin analogues before each meal or twice-daily administration of pre-mixed insulin. As a single large meal often contributes to the greatest part of daytime hyperglycaemia, an alternative strategy is emerging with the addition of a single injection of prandial insulin prior to the meal that induces the largest post-prandial blood glucose excursion measured 2 h after the start of the meal. Over time, additional prandial boluses of insulin may be required to sustain daytime glycaemic control. This strategy offers a simple, stepwise approach to progress from basal insulin to a basal-bolus regimen. Studies are needed to validate this method and better define specific titration tactics.

### Misled by the morning "Fasting" plasma glucose [^115Tym4f]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

Because of its ease and simplicity of its measurement, the morning fasting plasma glucose (FPG), has been as used a surrogate marker for the entire basal day when titrating once-nightly basal insulin. Common in obese insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, late and large evening meals elevate the FPG. This has led to dosing of basal insulin well beyond the basal requirements and contributes to hypoglycemia and weight gain seen with this therapy. It is recommended that during basal insulin titration, the evening meal be limited and hypoglycemia be monitored early in the morning, that bewitching time when the "peakless" basal insulin's action is peaking and the predawn phenomenon insulin sensitivity is higher.

### Glycemic variability in type 1 diabetes compared with degludec and glargine on the morning injection: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^11754Kss]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Compared to IGla, morning injection of long-acting insulin IDeg seems to be associated with lower risk of day-to-day variation in fasting interstitial GV, as well as higher satisfaction with treatment in patients with T1DM.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114vL31g]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes — prandial insulin initiation, intensification options, and NPH conversion: For initiation and titration of prandial insulin, add 4 units a day or 10% of basal insulin dose; if A1C < 8% (64 mmol/mol), consider reducing the basal insulin dose by 4 units or 10%; increase by 1–2 units or 10–15% twice weekly; and for hypoglycemia lower corresponding dose by 10–20%. If bedtime NPH, consider converting to twice-daily NPH regimen with initial dose 80% of current bedtime NPH dose, 2/3 given in the morning and 1/3 given at bedtime. Stepwise doses of prandial insulin (e.g., two, then three additional injections) are described, with the option to proceed to full basal-bolus plan.

### Refining basal insulin therapy: what have we learned in the age of analogues? [^112sE9gF]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The basal insulin analogues glargine and detemir have been subject to a series of trials comparing their clinical profiles to the conventional preparation, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH). Careful review of these trials provides opportunities to learn clinically useful lessons about these insulins.

Methods

MedLine-indexed trials comparing glargine or detemir to NPH were scrutinized for control, tolerability and dose data. Separate considerations were made for types 1 and 2 diabetes, and for basal-bolus and basal plus oral glucose-lowering drugs (OGLD) therapy. Attention was paid to dosing schedules and 24-h glycaemic profiles.

Results

Collectively, the trials demonstrated an improved balance between glycaemic control and tolerability for both analogues compared to NPH, regardless of regimen and diabetes type. Neither once-daily glargine nor detemir reliably provides 24-h basal insulin replacement in all patients with type 1 diabetes; a waning of effect frequently obliges twice-daily administration. When added to OGLDs in type 2 diabetes, goal-titrated once-daily basal insulin generally lowered HbA(1c) by approximately 1.5%, whereas twice-daily administration tended to increase insulin dose disproportionately to improvement in control. Hence, adding bolus insulin may be a preferable intensification method to dividing the basal dose. Varying injection time or dividing the basal insulin dose predictably affects the pattern of hypoglycaemia and bolus dose requirements. Morning administration tends to require higher dosing than evening administration.

Conclusions

Scrutiny of trials involving glargine and detemir has increased our understanding of how best to dose basal insulins. An individualized approach is still necessary however, and several questions remain that require further research.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 201: pregestational diabetes mellitus [^113Zux1k]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Insulin management during labor and delivery — Box 3 outlines that the usual dose of intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin is given at bedtime, the morning dose is withheld or reduced based upon the timing of admission or delivery, and an intravenous infusion of normal saline is begun. Once active labor begins or glucose levels decrease to less than 70 mg/dL, the infusion is changed from saline to 5% dextrose and delivered at 100–150 cc/h (2.5 mg/kg/min) to achieve a glucose level of approximately 100 mg/dL, and glucose levels are checked hourly using a bedside meter to adjust insulin or glucose infusion rates. Regular (short-acting) insulin is administered by intravenous infusion at a rate of 1.25 units/h if glucose levels exceed 100 mg/dL. During induction of labor, an intravenous infusion of short-acting insulin is titrated to maintain hourly blood glucose levels less than 110 mg/dL, and during active labor blood glucose levels are checked at regular intervals, generally hourly.

### Glycemic variability in type 1 diabetes compared with degludec and glargine on the morning injection: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^111x9tkc]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clinical evidence indicates that intensive insulin therapy reduces the risk of long-term complications in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). However, such therapy is associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia and unawareness of hypoglycemia, in part through the modification of glucose-sensing neurons. Previous studies indicated that low hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and short-term variations in blood glucose are independent risk factors for hypoglycemia. However, lack of awareness of occasional episodes of hypoglycemia, such as nocturnal hypoglycemia, is not uncommon, especially in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is particularly useful to identify episodes of hypoglycemia and variability in glycemic level including episodes of both hypo- and hyperglycemia. The normal ranges of glycemic variability (GV) recoded by CGM have been published for normal subjects and patients with T1DM.

Insulin analogue degludec (IDeg) is a formulated insulin analogue of di-hexamers that is reorganized into multi-hexamer compounds at the site of subcutaneous tissue injection, and later degraded to monomers at a slow rate followed by absorption into the systemic circulation. On the basis of our clinical experience, patients with T1DM tend to avoid the use of a single dose of another insulin analogue glargine (IGlar) before breakfast with multiple bolus injections, one for each meal, because of fear of possible insufficient action of IGlar until the next morning. To our knowledge, there are no randomized crossover designed clinical trials that have compared glycemic control in T1DM under treatment with long-acting IDeg and IGlar injection "before breakfast".

Hypoglycemia and fear of hypoglycemia are some of the major concerns among patients, limiting their quality of life (QOL) and their ability to achieve glycemic targets. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of IDeg and IGlar, in the context of GV measured by CGM, including total time spent in hypoglycemia and mean glycemic level. In addition, we used the Diabetes Therapy-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire to assess the duration of hypoglycemia and GV associated with the two insulin analogues, as well as the extent of satisfaction with each treatment.

Types of insulin — onset, peak, and duration (Table 19) list representative pharmacokinetics: Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (human) has onset 1–3 h, peak 5–8 h, and duration Up to 18 h; detemir has onset 1.5 h, near peakless effect, and duration 16–24 h; glargine U300 has onset 6 h, is peakless, and lasts > 30 h; aspart has onset 15 min, peak 1–1.5 h, and duration 3–5 h; faster aspart has onset 4 min, peak 0.5–1.5 h, and duration 3–5 h; lispro aabc has onset 15–17 min, peak ≈ 2 h, and duration 4.6–7.3 h; and inhaled technosphere insulin has onset ≈ 12 min, peak 0.5–1 h, and duration 1.5–3 h. Premixed insulins contain a fixed ratio of intermediate-acting and short- or rapid-acting insulin and must be resuspended uniformly for consistent glucose lowering, with timing and adjustment dependent on glucose levels and insulin kinetics; additional notes state for detemir, up to 40% to 50% of persons may require twice daily dosing (with 12 hours after the morning dose), and for glargine U300, persons with type 1 diabetes may require ∼15% to 30% higher dose compared with glargine U100.

Pharmacokinetics

Several pharmacokinetic parameters describe the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of a drug. Insulin absorption is derived principally through the measure of circulating insulin concentration in relation to time since subcutaneous injection. The evaluation of insulin pharmacokinetics has traditionally been undertaken by the measurements of plasma immunoreactive insulin levels after administration of the preparation in question. Such studies are conducted in normal subjects and patients with type 1 diabetes. Pharmacokinetic action profiles have also been evaluated using the euglycaemic clamp technique in normal subjects and patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, whereby GIRs are examined during maintenance of plasma glucose levels at a predetermined value. These systemic measurements have also been strengthened by measurements of disappearance of radioactivity after subcutaneous administration of various radiolabelled insulin preparations. Together, the measures provide a complete description of the way in which the body processes the insulin from administration to elimination.

Ideally, insulin concentrations should show dose proportionality (i.e. for an increase or decrease in the administered dose, there is a proportional increase or decrease in the insulin concentration) and the profile of insulin concentration over time should resemble the desired glucose lowering profile. Thus for rapid-acting insulin analogues, the insulin concentration should rise to a peak very quickly after injection and be rapidly metabolized to inactive metabolites and eliminated. Duration of action of currently available rapid acting insulin can vary between 3 and 5 h depending on the dose injected. For long-acting insulin analogues, the insulin concentration should be consistent and stable. It should be noted, however, that the waning insulin concentration of current basal insulin analogues may not provide for the increase in morning insulin needed to cover the transient morning increase in insulin resistance (i.e. the dawn phenomenon). For biphasic insulin analogues, the ideal profile would be a combination of both a rapid onset and peak insulin action following injection to cover the postprandial period, followed by a rapid return to a long flat profile to cover basal needs. Current biphasic formulations are not ideal in this respect.

### Dexamethasone in the era of COVID-19: friend or foe? An essay on the effects of dexamethasone and the potential risks of its inadvertent use in patients with diabetes [^116szwQS]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

There is no treatment strategy that is ideal for all patients, and the choice of the regimen to be used will depend on which corticosteroid is in use, its potency and the duration of its action. For short-acting corticosteroids, such as prednisone, the plasma peak occurs in four to six hours after administration, but the pharmacological actions can last throughout the day. It is common for patients who use only morning doses to experience glycemic oscillations throughout the day, with a tendency to normalize blood glucose levels at night. For long-acting corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, or for regimens using multiple doses, glycemic changes can last longer, affecting also fasting glucose.

The American Diabetes Association recommends the use of insulin to correct glycemic oscillations in patients using corticosteroids. For patients receiving only single morning doses of short-acting corticosteroids, the use of intermediate or long-acting insulin analogues is usually the standard approach. For long-acting glucocorticoids, multidose or continuous glucocorticoid use, long-acting insulin may be required to control fasting blood glucose. For higher doses of glucocorticoids, a basal bolus insulin approach is often needed. One recommendation is to initiate or to adjust weight-based NPH insulin at 0.1 units/kg for every 10 mg of prednisone up to a maximum of 0.4 units/kg initially. Other treatment options, especially for treatment naive patients, include using sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones considering their effects on prandial blood glucose and improvement in insulin sensitivity via PPAR agonism, respectively. It is necessary to keep in mind the risks of these medications, considering that sulfonylureas carry a risk of hypoglycemia, while thiazolidinediones are associated with fluid retention. Evidences for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in corticosteroids use are still limited.

### EADSG guidelines: insulin therapy in diabetes [^117HRRMN]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

All patients on insulin therapy together with their caregivers require appropriate education on insulin therapy. Five basic principles of insulin management have been advised: (1) insulin doses should not be skipped. Therefore to avoid high blood glucose levels caused by low or missed doses, short-acting insulin should be given every 6 h, in four equal doses, or rapid-acting insulin before each meal with a long-acting basal insulin; (2) routine daily regimens should reflect the pattern of PPG levels over the previous 2 or 3 days; (3) rapid-acting insulin doses should be based primarily on the amount to be eaten, rather than on premeal glucose levels (although abnormally elevated or depressed levels may require correction); (4) parameters for glucose levels should be set and patients instructed to call (or to administer a correction dose) if the value falls above or below a predetermined range; and (5) to consider providing patients on insulin therapy (or their parents, school nurse, hospital staff, or other health care worker) with an algorithm that uses a basal insulin dose and premeal rapid-acting insulin doses, adjusted for caloric or carbohydrate intake.

Short-Acting Insulin

Short-acting insulin is also commonly referred to as Regular or Neutral insulin. After a subcutaneous (SC) injection, the onset of action of Regular insulin is about 30–60 min, peak effect is in 2–4 h, and duration of action is of 4–8 h. The larger the dose of Regular insulin, the faster the onset of action, but the longer the time to peak effect and the longer the duration of the effect. U-100 Regular insulin is absorbed slightly more quickly than U-500. Regular insulin is metabolized in the liver, spleen, kidney, and muscle. The half-life is 30–60 min. Without using other forms of insulin, short-acting insulin should be given every 6 h, in four equal doses, without ever skipping a dose. Details of pharmacodynamics of short-acting insulin are displayed in Table 3.

### The efficacy and safety of insulin degludec given in variable once-daily dosing intervals compared with insulin glargine and insulin degludec dosed at the same time daily: a 26-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, Treat-to-target trial in individuals with type 2 diabetes [^1156mJoo]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This 26-week, phase 3, treat-to-target trial in individuals with type 2 diabetes was designed to test extreme intervals for basal insulin administration with once-daily doses of IDeg, using a forced dosing schedule that created alternating short (8–12 h) and long (36–40 h) intervals between doses. This rotating dosing regimen (IDeg OD Flex) is clearly not intended for clinical practice; rather, it was used to explore (from an efficacy and safety perspective) the impact of variable timing of basal insulin administration that might be encountered by patients with changing schedules. The trial population encompassed a broad range of individuals who were likely to benefit from either insulin initiation or intensification.

Overall, variable dosing intervals for insulin degludec (IDeg OD Flex) resulted in similar glycemic control, hypoglycemia risk, and weight gain to fixed dosing intervals for either IGlar (IGlar OD) or itself (IDeg OD). The lower FPG level found for IDeg OD Flex compared with IGlar OD did not come at the expense of a higher incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Indeed, IDeg OD Flex was associated with a nonsignificant 23% numerically lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycemia than IGlar OD, consistent with findings from other studies. Because rates of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia were similar for IDeg OD Flex and IGlar OD, regardless of whether IDeg was dosed in the morning or evening, the lower overall rate of nocturnal hypoglycemia associated with IDeg Flex is thought to be due to the more consistent pharmacokinetic profile of IDeg relative to IGlar, as well as lower day-to-day and hour-to-hour pharmacodynamic variability.

### Plasma insulin profiles after subcutaneous injection: how close can we get to physiology in people with diabetes? [^115NJvEj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Because neither insulin detemir nor insulin glargine 100 U/ml are true 24‐h insulins in people with type 1 diabetes, a single injection may not provide full coverage in some individuals. Furthermore, they may not be suitable for morning injection or allow the injection‐time interval to be beyond 24 h, as sometimes occurs in normal life; however, these insulins are better matched to diurnal changes in insulin sensitivity if given in the evening, perhaps even more so than would be the case with a perfectly flat insulin profile. Furthermore, it is still evident that within‐individual variability is a problem from the average pre‐breakfast glucose levels reported in clinical trials – still around two‐thirds higher than the normal level 27, 71, 72. Accordingly, attempts have been made to extend action further, for example, with the development of insulin degludec 27, 71, 73, insulin glargine 300 U/ml 65, 72, and pegylated lispro 21, 22.

The absorption profile of insulin degludec, an acylated analogue of human insulin, is convincingly longer than 24 h, with a half‐life of ∼25 h (vs 13 h for insulin glargine 100 U/ml) 74. This is confirmed by studies of extreme flexibility of injection times, which show no major detriment 75. Interestingly, the mechanism of delayed absorption is very different from that of insulin detemir, the cartridge/vial dihexamers self‐associating subcutaneously into long‐chain multihexamers, which slowly disassociate from their ends 76. This provides essentially zero order kinetics, not changing with depletion of the injection depot until towards the end of the profile. The acylation should mean that, as with detemir, there is some albumin buffering of any erratic absorption. This may also be reflected in the results found in controlled trials versus insulin glargine 100 U/ml, where HbA 1c is unchanged (because of a treat‐to‐target approach) but nocturnal hypoglycaemia is reduced 27, 71, 73. Insulin doses do not rise with insulin degludec despite the longer subcutaneous residence time 26, 27. Speculatively, this may be because the multihexamer structures pack tightly and consistently with fatty acid chains externally 76, perhaps protecting against tissue peptidases.

Day-to-day variability in the glucose - lowering effect of insulin degludec (IDeg) and insulin glargine (IGlar) over 24 h at steady state as shown by the coefficient of variation (CV) for the pharmacodynamic endpoint (area under the curve for glucose infusion rates from 0–24 h). Adapted from Reference (Heise et al.)

The clinical implications of the aforementioned pharmacodynamic and PK properties of IDeg at steady-state are once-daily dosing resulting in a low peak: nadir ratio and consequent less variability of action and plasmatic concentrations less critically dependent upon the time of injections, permitting flexibility in dose timing.

Clinical development program (BEGIN)

The clinical development program of IDeg included 3 therapeutic exploratory trials of short duration (6–16 weeks) and 9 therapeutic confirmatory trials of longer duration (26–52 weeks). The primary objectives of the trials were to confirm the efficacy of IDeg administered once daily in controlling glycemia (change from baseline in HbA1c). Table 1 summarizes the studies conducted in T2D (6 studies; n = 2733 receiving IDeg and n = 1343 receiving active comparators) and in T1D (3 studies; n = 1104 receiving IDeg and n = 474 receiving active comparators). All confirmatory trials were randomized, controlled, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter, multinational and treat-to-target in which IDeg was compared to an active comparator; 5 of the confirmatory trials (3 in T1D and 2 in T2D) were extended for further periods of 26 or 52 weeks to evaluate long-term safety. One trial in T1D and one trial in T2D included a third treatment arm in which IDeg was administered in the morning and in the evening on alternating days (the Fixed Flexible dose schedule) aiming at evaluating the impact of extreme day-to-day variation in the dosing intervals (from 8–12 h to 36–40 h).

Single bedtime long-acting insulin — monitoring guidance indicates that the simplest regimen is a single injection of long-acting insulin at bedtime, and for patients on this regimen, the committee suggests daily fasting BG measurements; because this regimen is associated with some risk of hypoglycemia and may not provide adequate mealtime coverage, adding mealtime agents or short-acting insulin before meals may be beneficial when daytime readings remain above target.

Initiation of prandial insulin — when to add and how to start: If the basal insulin dose is > 0.5 units/kg/day or the bedtime minus morning prebreakfast glucose score is > 50 mg/dL, prandial insulin should be considered. Rapid-acting analogs are preferred over human insulin preparations. Prandial insulin can be initiated at the largest meal at 10% of the basal insulin dose or 5 units with stepwise addition to other meals as needed, or started at all meals simultaneously at 50% of the total daily dose divided by the number of meals.

First-trimester abortion — diabetes management considerations: Women with type 1 diabetes are more prone to hypoglycemia in the first trimester, and an initial increase in insulin requirements for the first trimester is followed by a clinically meaningful reduction in insulin requirement between 7 and 12 weeks of gestation. For procedures, a regular diet and usual medication can be continued under local anesthesia; deep sedation requires preprocedure fasting and a common approach is to administer half of the patient's usual long-acting insulin dose the evening before and omit the morning dose of short-acting insulin, with scheduling early in the day so the patient can eat and take usual morning insulin after the procedure. Modest hyperglycemia poses no acute risk to women undergoing an abortion; for example, a transient blood glucose level of 180–200 mg/dL during an abortion is not worrisome, whereas a blood glucose of 30 mg/dL is a concern.

Discussion

The main purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of morning injection of two long-acting insulin analogues, IDeg and IGlar, on the severity of hypoglycemia and GV using CGM in patients with T1DM. A recent study using CGM suggested that patients with successfully treated T1DM (i.e. HbA1c less than 7.0%) spent more than 90 min/day at blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL. Although no severe hypoglycemia was observed in the present study, the percentage of time spent in hypoglycemia per 24 h was similar under both IDeg and IGlar. Our results, however, showed a higher percentage of time in nocturnal hypoglycemia (between 2400 and 0600 hours; nearly 30% of the time spent in IG less than 70 mg/dL, less than 3.9 mmol/L) under both basal insulin arms, compared with that of a previous study. The different results were probably related to the study design; we applied strict blood glucose titration, allowing with fasting self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) values between 80 and 110 mg/dL (4.4–6.1 mmol/L). Using similar safety endpoints, including hypoglycemia (which was defined as SMBG values of 101–120 mg/dL or 5.5–6.7 mmol/L), Bergenstal et al. demonstrated previously that LY2605541 (peglispro) improved fasting blood glucose values, with a time spent at hypoglycemia of 11% only, compared with 38% under insulin glargine. Thus, the caveats of insulin titration algorithm used in clinical trials could potentially pose serious hypoglycemia risk.

Diabetes

The following recommendations apply to patients with diabetes mellitus:

Type II diabetes mellitus (controlled by oral medication)

The FDG PET/CT study should preferably be performed in the late morning.
Patients must comply with the fasting rules indicated above.
Patients continue to take oral medication to control their blood sugar. If intravenous contrast agent is going to be administered, metformin should be discontinued at the time of the procedure and withheld for 48 h after the procedure (see below).

Type I diabetes mellitus and insulin-dependent type II diabetes mellitus

Ideally, an attempt should be made to achieve normal glycaemic values prior to the FDG PET/CT study, in consultation with the patient and his/her attending medical doctor.
There are three options for scheduling the FDG PET/CT study: It can be scheduled for late morning or midday. The patient should eat a normal breakfast by early morning (around 7.00 a.m.) and inject the normal amount of insulin. Thereafter the patient should not consume any more food or fluids, apart from the prescribed amount of water. FDG should be injected no sooner than 4 h after subcutaneous injection of rapid-acting insulin or 6 h after subcutaneous injection of short-acting insulin. FDG administration is not recommended on the same day after injection of intermediate-acting and/or long-acting insulin. It can be scheduled for early morning. The presence of intermediate-acting insulin administered the evening before should not interfere with the PET/CT study and glycaemia will probably still be under control. If long-acting insulin has been used the evening before, there could be a slight interference with the PET/CT study. Thus, if this is the preferred schedule, intermediate-acting (instead of long-acting) insulin is recommended. The patient should eat a normal breakfast after the PET/CT study and inject the normal amount of insulin. In patients on continuous insulin infusion, if possible the FDG PET/CT study should be scheduled for early in the morning. The insulin pump should be switched off for at least 4 h prior to FDG administration. The patient can have breakfast after the FDG PET/CT study and switch on continuous insulin infusion.

Kidney failure

FDG imaging can be performed in patients with kidney failure, although the image quality may be suboptimal and prone to interpretation pitfalls.

Timing of Administration

Basal insulin should be injected at the appropriate time (usually bedtime), in line with the prescribing information.
Basal insulin may, under some circumstances (e.g. administration by caregivers and nursing home residents), be administered in the morning or afternoon as well, preferably at the same time daily.
Basal insulin analogues provide the advantage of flexibility of timing, making it simple and less intrusive. They involve only one injection per day and do not require adherence to inflexible meal patterns, quantity, and composition. Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) Insulin: With NPH insulin, the preferred injection time is bedtime. First - Generation Basal Insulin Analogues (Gla - 100 and Insulin Detemir): Both of the first-generation basal insulin analogues are also best administered at bedtime. Insulin glargine can be administered anytime each day, irrespective of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels. Second - Generation Basal Insulin Analogues (Insulin Degludec and Gla - 300): These offer more flexibility in the timing of injection and can be administered at any time in the day, but they have to be administered at the same time each day.
Upon realizing that a dose of basal insulin has been missed, the situation can be redressed by immediately administering the dose while ensuring that there is a gap of at least an 8 h between injections. Once this dose has been taken, the patient can return to their regular dosing schedule. In fasting and special populations, the schedule for basal insulin and GLA administration shown in Table 1 should be followed. Table 1 Choice of basal insulin and GLAs in special populations BI basal insulin, DPP4i dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, NPH neutral protamine Hagedorn, GLA oral glucose-lowering agents, TZD thiazolidinediones, SU sulfonylureas

In order to prevent episodes of hypoglycemia during fasts, such as during Ramadan, patients treated with insulin and insulin secretagogues should measure glucose before, during, and after fasting (2–4 times daily). A reduction in the dose of insulin secretagogues should be considered.

### Extensive clinical experience: a simple guide to basal insulin adjustments for long-distance travel [^117C87WL]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Information on the local time at departure is written down on the handout as well as the last time basal insulin was given before departure, glargine 20 units at 8 PM the prior evening. At 8 PM HST only 13 units of glargine are given per the formula on the handout. AFTER the basal insulin is given, the patient changes his watch to EST. The next full dose of glargine is due 8 PM EST after they arrive, which turns out to be 18 hours after the last dose. This reduced time between doses is why the patient took just under ¾ of his usual glargine dose on the flight.

Scenario #2 – twice daily basal insulin adjustment

Patient B is traveling home from Honolulu to New York. He currently takes detemir 10 units twice daily, at 8 AM and 8 PM and rapid acting insulin before meals as part of his basal-bolus regimen. The flight departs at 3:00 PM HST and arrives 7 AM EST. Total flight time is 10 hours. Although the patient takes twice daily basal insulin, the same handout used in the previous example works well and can be used again.

Using the Eastward Travel Handout, information on the local time at departure is written down as well as the last time basal insulin was given before departure, detemir 10 units at 8 AM that morning. The first dose of basal insulin due while traveling is at 8 PM Honolulu time. Per the formula on the handout only 4 units of detemir are given. AFTER the basal insulin is given, he changes his watch to EST. The next full dose of detemir is due 8 AM EST after he arrives, which turns out to be 6 hours after the last dose. This reduced time between doses is why the patient took just under ½ of his usual detemir dose on the flight, a dose that normally lasts 12 hours.

Intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) has onset 1–2 h, peak 4–14 h, and duration 10–24 h; give "75%–80% of evening dose" the day before surgery, and on the day of surgery "Take 50% if BG > 160 mg/dL" and "Hold for BG < 160 mg/dL". Short-acting insulin (human regular) has onset 30 min, peak 2–3 h, and duration 4–6 h; "Administer usual daily dose" the day before surgery and "Hold" on the day of surgery.

### Recommendations for management of diabetes during ramadan: update 2010 [^115xaR36]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Patients treated with insulin.

Problems facing patients with type 2 diabetes who administer insulin are similar to those with type 1 diabetes, except that the incidence of hypoglycemia is less. Again, the aim is to maintain necessary levels of basal insulin to prevent fasting hyperglycemia. An effective strategy would be judicious use of intermediate- or long-acting insulin preparations plus a short-acting insulin administered before meals. Although hypoglycemia tends to be less frequent, it is still a risk, especially in patients who have required insulin therapy for a number of years or in whom insulin deficiency predominates in the pathophysiology. Very elderly patients with type 2 diabetes may be at especially high risk.

Using one injection of a long-acting or intermediate-acting insulin can provide adequate coverage in some patients as long as the dosage is appropriately individualized; however, most patients will require rapid- or short-acting insulin administered in combination with the basal insulin at meals, particularly at the evening meal, which typically contains a larger caloric load. There is some evidence suggesting that use of a rapid-acting insulin analog instead of regular human insulin before meals in patients with type 2 diabetes who fast during Ramadan is associated with less hypoglycemia and smaller postprandial glucose excursions. In a recent study, the use of premixed lispro with neutral protamine lispro in a 50:50 ratio for the evening meal and regular human insulin with NPH in a 30:70 ratio at the early morning meal during Ramadan compared with regular human insulin at 30:70 twice daily was associated with moderate improvement in glycemic control and hypoglycemia.

### An overview of insulin therapy for the non-specialist [^116qvAXF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Nearly all health professionals, whatever their practice or speciality, now have contact with a significant number of insulin-using people with diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes are nearly universally managed on more complex insulin regimens, increasingly with complex support technology, and with some understanding of the concepts underlying these needed by anyone with responsibility for other aspects of their health care. People with type 2 diabetes usually come to insulin therapy in time, now with a prevalence for insulin administration of ≈50%, thanks to improved management of associated health risks giving longer life expectancy. But while some understandings have simplified the usual approach (basal insulin, self-adjustment dose algorithms), the advent of other medical products offering cardio-renal protection, the use of insulin in combination with these, and the marketing of novel insulin analogues and biosimilars, have all added complexity to clinical decision making. However for the insulin user in the mainstream of care (ambulatory diabetes services in primary and secondary care) the broad principles of choice and management of insulin therapy are fairly easily applied. In the current article, the complexity is dissected and addressed, some of the stigma around insulin therapy is neutralised, and the fundamental approach in regular care drawn into focus. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Insulin therapy is used in their diabetes lifetime by nearly all people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), as well as in all people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). In T2DM this is in the context of the usual progression of islet B-cell secretory failure, but also very often in the context of other conditions, from cancer or steroid therapy to acute arterial events or major surgery. Its prescription in these circumstances means that, in pharmaco-epidemiological studies, insulin use is invariably associated with poor health outcomes, but in a series of major RCTs of 5-15years duration no excess of vascular or oncological adverse health outcomes was found. Physiologically insulin secretion occurs in two scenarios, namely basal insulin at night and between meals (≈50%), and in short (≈4h) bursts with meals (≈50%). The former suppresses liver glucose production, which in its absence causes plasma glucose to rise threefold to around 12mmol/l (but much higher if metabolic stress or with sugar-containing drinks). Meal-time insulin secretion in addition promotes glucose storage in skeletal muscle. People with T1DM, having no endogenous insulin secretion, thus require a multiple injection regimen (basal + meal-time), or pumped insulin, often now moderated by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Basal and meal-time preparations of pharmaceutical insulin analogues are also used for T2DM, with GLP-1RA and metformin usually continued. The starting regimen is normally basal only, usually with insulin glargine (100U/ml), originator or biosimilar, while insulin degludec or glargine 300U/ml can have advantage as basal insulins where true 24-h cover is found to be needed. Weekly insulins (developmental or marketed) may have a role in injection acceptability in T2DM, at a cost of some increase in hypoglycaemia. In ambulatory care a meal-time insulin analogue, originator or biosimilar, is added when required, often after some years on basal insulin. Meal insulins are also used in insulin pumps. Hypoglycaemia is a significant issue in T1DM, limiting insulin dosing, but can be helped by CGM, with or without pumps, and careful dose adjustment. It is a much lesser issue in T2DM, until meal-time insulins are introduced, or in people of thinner phenotype, whence again expertise in dose adjustment may be needed. Body weight gain with insulin is usually modest, particularly if basal insulin is begun appropriately before glycosuria has influenced calorie balance. In mainstream ambulatory care the broad principles of insulin therapy are fairly easily applied, the main resources being team familiarity with a basal insulin (glargine/biosimilar), a finger-prick glucose-monitoring system, basic patient education on use of these, and time to supervise dose titration. Beginning with a fixed dose (e.g. 10U/day) and increasing by 2 U twice a week is simple, but may take months of persistent input to reach target fasting plasma glucose levels. In conclusion, insulin is a usual therapy in both T1DM and T2DM, and in the latter initially at least is fairly easily applied, in combination with other glucose-lowering agents. However it can be more challenging in the context of the technology used in T1DM, once meal-time insulin is added to basal in T2DM, and when dose requirements are complex and unstable in conjunction with other medical conditions.

### Insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes [^116dAXuM]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

HOW SHOULD INSULIN THERAPY BE INITIATED?

Basal insulin

The "treat-to-target" clinical trials established that the addition of basal insulin to existing oral glucose-lowering therapy achieves good glycemic control in the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes. According to the ADA/EASD algorithm for the management of type 2 diabetes, insulin could be initiated with either once-daily NPH insulin or a long-acting insulin analog. For several reasons, we consider NPH insulin the preferred option. As previously mentioned, the relative benefit of the long-acting insulin analogs is limited to a reduction in (nocturnal) hypoglycemia. Moreover, this advantage is relevant to only a minority, since most patients with type 2 diabetes starting insulin therapy do not experience hypoglycemia at all. A recent meta-analysis that included six randomized comparisons of NPH and glargine found event rates for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia < 65 mg/dl of only 138 and 91 events per 100 patient-years for these insulins, respectively, in insulin-naive type 2 diabetic patients who achieved an A1C of 7.0%. Finally, in this era of relentlessly increasing incidence rates for type 2 diabetes, physicians cannot afford to disregard the elevated cost of the newer insulin preparations. In the U.S. the average retail price of a 10-ml vial of the long-acting insulin analogs is $105 compared with $53 for a vial of NPH insulin. In this respect, clinicians should realize that when they stop prescribing conventional insulin preparations, with established beneficial effects, they provide a pretext for the manufacturers to withdraw these drugs from the market. Recent examples of such industry responses to low demand are the withdrawal of Novolin R penfills in the U.K. and of Novolin 70/30 in several European countries. Thus, to recapitulate, given its cost-effectiveness, we consider NPH insulin the preferred agent for the initiation of insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes. However, if dose titration is limited by (nocturnal) hypoglycemia, a switch to a long-acting insulin analog should be tried.

### A large difference in dose timing of basal insulin introduces risk of hypoglycemia and overweight: a cross-sectional study [^113ME3V6]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

On the other hand, more user-friendly basal insulin is being considered. Ultra-long-acting insulins have recently been developed, notably insulin glargine U300 and insulin degludec. Glargine U300 has the benefits that its effects last for > 24 h and dosing may occur up 3 h before or after the agreed time of administration. The effects of insulin degludec last for 24–42 h at maximum; an attractive aspect of this drug is also its flexibility of injection timing. Dosing flexibility of insulin degludec by ± 8 h from the usual time of administration can ensure the same adequate glycemic control and frequency of hypoglycemia as fixed dosing of the insulin. In this study, insulin degludec was found to improve glycemic control and to reduce the occurrence of hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes whose variation in dose timing was > 120 min. It is reported that the ability to dose insulin degludec flexibly can positively impact the health-related quality of life. In addition, degludec is likely to be cost effective compared to other basal insulin analogs. Thus, new-generation basal insulin may be helpful for all persons with diabetes.

Irregular dosing of basal insulin is believed to be related to two main factors, namely patient and medical factors, respectively. Patient factors, such as being too busy, forgetting, skipping meals, eating out, traveling, embarrassment about injecting in public and stress or emotional problems, can result in mistiming of insulin injections. With respect to medical factors, healthcare professionals usually instruct persons with diabetes to inject basal insulin at mealtimes in combination with bolus insulin or oral medication, or at the time of waking, bedtime, morning or evening. Persons with diabetes are thus allowed leeway as to when to inject basal insulin. When healthcare professionals educate persons with diabetes at initiation of therapy with basal insulin, it is important to guide them to a regular life style and to individually determine fixed dose timing with an allowance of 2 h from the standpoint of better glycemic control, better body weight control and a lower hypoglycemia risk. On the other hand, when individuals are even then not able to inject basal insulin within 2 h of the agreed dose timing, insulin degludec or glargine U300 can be considered an option to prevent hypoglycemia and to improve glycemic control. Such patient-centered therapeutic strategies may improve not only glycemic control but also the quality of life of persons with diabetes.

### Understanding the clinical profile of insulin degludec, the latest basal insulin approved for use in Canada: a narrative review [^113rEVu8]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Degludec achieves a very long and stable glucose-lowering profile through a unique protraction mechanism. This translates into a low risk of hypoglycemia, the ability to dose in the morning or flexibility, and a 'forgiving' profile should doses be missed or mis-timed. The scale of the hypoglycemia advantage with the newer analogues, degludec and glargine U300, is comparable to that demonstrated for glargine U100 and insulin detemir over NPH some 15 years ago, when standard of care shifted away from NPH. The relative clinical advantages/disadvantages of degludec compared with glargine U300 require clarification and are currently under further investigation.

### How much do I give? Dose estimation formulas for once-nightly insulin glargine and premeal insulin lispro in type 1 diabetes mellitus [^113gtv23]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the mathematical relationships between dosing factors in type 1 diabetic patients using multiple daily injections.

Methods

In this single-center, prospective study in type 1 diabetic patients, the basal continuous glucose monitoring glucose target was less than 130 mg/dL with fewer than 10% of 24-hour readings at less than 70 mg/dL. Basal glucose for the 4-hour meal periods was obtained from once-daily serial meal omissions. On an isocaloric, 50% carbohydrate, fixed diet, the insulin to carbohydrate ratio was adjusted to achieve a 2- to 4-hour postbolus glucose value within ± 20% of premeal glucose. For determining dosing formulas, the slope of the linear regression line comparing the variables of weight, total daily dose (TDD), total basal dose (TBD), insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR), and correction factor (CF) was determined.

Results

Forty-nine patients were included. Titrating insulin glargine to the morning glucose led to hypoglycemia during the rest of the day (2 PM to 4 AM). Therefore the basal glucose target was the nondawn phenomenon portion of the day. The resulting estimation formulas could be rounded to the following: TBD = 0.2 x weight (kg) | TBD = 0.33 x TDD | 90/TBD = ICR = CF/4.5.

Conclusions

Smaller insulin glargine doses to achieve control are in contrast to those much larger doses reported in clinical trials in multiple daily injection-treated type 1 diabetes in which the morning fasting glucose is the basal insulin target.

### EADSG guidelines: insulin therapy in diabetes [^115G9Vba]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of diabetes or hyperglycemia should be confirmed prior to ordering, dispensing, or administering insulin (A). Insulin is the primary treatment in all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (A). Typically, patients with T1DM will require initiation with multiple daily injections at the time of diagnosis. This is usually short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue given 0 to 15 min before meals together with one or more daily separate injections of intermediate or long-acting insulin. Two or three premixed insulin injections per day may be used (A). The target glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for all children with T1DM, including preschool children, is recommended to be < 7.5% (< 58 mmol/mol). The target is chosen aiming at minimizing hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic unawareness, and reducing the likelihood of development of long-term complications (B). For patients prone to glycemic variability, glycemic control is best evaluated by a combination of results with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (B). Indications for exogenous insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) include acute illness or surgery, pregnancy, glucose toxicity, contraindications to or failure to achieve goals with oral antidiabetic medications, and a need for flexible therapy (B). In T2DM patients, with regards to achieving glycemic goals, insulin is considered alone or in combination with oral agents when HbA1c is ≥ 7.5% (≥ 58 mmol/mol); and is essential for treatment in those with HbA1c ≥ 10% (≥ 86 mmol/mol), when diet, physical activity, and other antihyperglycemic agents have been optimally used (B). The preferred method of insulin initiation in T2DM is to begin by adding a long-acting (basal) insulin or once-daily premixed/co-formulation insulin or twice-daily premixed insulin, alone or in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (B). If the desired glucose targets are not met, rapid-acting or short-acting (bolus or prandial) insulin can be added at mealtime to control the expected postprandial raise in glucose. An insulin regimen should be adopted and individualized but should, to the extent possible, closely resemble a natural physiologic state and avoid, to the extent possible, wide fluctuating glucose levels (C). Blood glucose monitoring is an integral part of effective insulin therapy and should not be omitted in the patient's care plan. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values should be used to titrate basal insulin, whereas both FPG and postprandial glucose (PPG) values should be used to titrate mealtime insulin (B). Metformin combined with insulin is associated with decreased weight gain, lower insulin dose, and less hypoglycemia when compared with insulin alone (C). Oral medications should not be abruptly discontinued when starting insulin therapy because of the risk of rebound hyperglycemia (D). Analogue insulin is as effective as human insulin but is associated with less postprandial hyperglycemia and delayed hypoglycemia (B). The shortest needles (currently the 4-mm pen and 6-mm syringe needles) are safe, effective, and less painful and should be the first-line choice in all patient categories; intramuscular (IM) injections should be avoided, especially with long-acting insulins, because severe hypoglycemia may result; lipohypertrophy is a frequent complication of therapy that distorts insulin absorption, and therefore, injections and infusions should not be given into these lesions and correct site rotation will help prevent them (A). Many patients in East Africa reuse syringes for various reasons, including financial. This is not recommended by the manufacturer and there is an association between needle reuse and lipohypertrophy. However, patients who reuse needles should not be subjected to alarming claims of excessive morbidity from this practice (A). Health care authorities and planners should be alerted to the risks associated with syringe or pen needles 6 mm or longer in children (A).

### Mealtime dosing of a rapid-acting insulin analog reduces glucose variability and suppresses daytime cardiac sympathetic activity: a randomized controlled study in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes [^117A6YWP]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Bedtime insulin detemir treatment and not mealtime insulin aspart treatment increased the morning respiratory quotient. Insulin shifts the energy balance from a catabolic to an anabolic state by switching substrate oxidation from lipids to carbohydrates. Our findings corroborate those of a previous study wherein treatment with a long-acting insulin analog increased the morning respiratory quotient in subjects with type 2 diabetes. However, mealtime insulin aspart may have possibly increased the postprandial respiratory quotient.

Patients with type 2 diabetes have higher basal energy expenditure compared with individuals without diabetes. One of the physiologic mechanisms therein includes increased energy consumption due to hepatic gluconeogenesis. Given that treatment with a long-acting insulin analog effectively suppresses hepatic glucose production, it can be presumed to also decrease the basal energy expenditure. Indeed, previous studies have shown that bedtime insulin detemir treatment for 2or 4 daysdecreases the basal energy expenditure. However, in the present study, 2 weeks of bedtime insulin detemir treatment did not change the morning basal energy expenditure, a result that seemingly conflicts with those of previous reports. Further studies are therefore warranted to clarify the time-course changes in basal energy expenditure during insulin treatment.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114TPXyY]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Basal insulin management — risk reduction and overbasalization signals — states that long-acting basal analogs (U-100 glargine and degludec or detemir) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of level 2 hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin, that longer-acting basal analogs (U-300 glargine or degludec) convey a lower nocturnal hypoglycemia risk than U-100 glargine, and that an initial dose reduction is reasonable and typically needed when switching from insulin detemir or U-300 glargine to another insulin; evaluation for overbasalization should be prompted by clinical signals such as bedtime-to-morning glucose differential ≥ 50 mg/dL [≥ 2.8 mmol/L].

### Effects of switching from insulin glargine or detemir to insulin degludec in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^112khwfw]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

When once-daily injection of insulin glargine or detemir is used as basal insulin in insulin-depleted patients, they often show large diurnal variations of blood glucose due to the dawn phenomenon or Somogyi effect. In these patients, it was reported that glycemic control can be improved by splitting the basal insulin dose and giving it twice daily. In the present study, 10 patients have been receiving twice-daily insulin glargine or detemir, so far. The present study demonstrates that changing from twice-daily administration of long-acting insulin to once-daily insulin degludec can maintain the glycemic control with lower number of injection.

The present trial was subject to certain limitations. It was short duration and limited sample size. In addition, the present study was open-label in design and non-cross over trial. Therefore, larger sample size and double-blind crossover comparison may be necessary.

### Comparison of a multiple daily insulin injection regimen (basal once-daily glargine plus mealtime lispro) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (lispro) in type 1 diabetes: a randomized open parallel multicenter study [^117XQcxZ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Although blood glucose control with CSII and insulin glargine–based MDI was similar by other measures, plasma glucose predinner was higher with the latter regimen. This elevation in blood glucose in the late afternoon hours on an insulin glargine–based MDI regimen has been noted previously. In some people with type 1 diabetes, the duration of action of insulin glargine appears to be < 24 h. However, continued food absorption beyond the duration of action of the lunchtime insulin may be another cause of predinner hyperglycemia, as the phenomenon is attenuated when lunch is skipped. With CSII it is possible that this was counteracted by higher basal rates in the afternoon, but these data were not collected. With insulin glargine, an additional bolus of rapid-acting analog 2–3 h after lunch can be given; this was not part of the protocol of the present study. Interestingly, the theoretical advantage of multiple basal rates with CSII did not translate into lower basal plasma glucose levels at other times of day (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, this study confirms that the magnitude of any "dawn phenomenon" is modest when basal insulin is optimally replaced with either CSII or an insulin glargine regimen.

In the present study, glucose variability with CSII and insulin glargine–based MDI was not different. A previous study that compared people on long-term CSII with those switched to insulin glargine–based MDI found a small advantage of CSII in glucose variability, despite no difference in overall glycemic control. However, the importance of variability of blood glucose when A1C, hypoglycemia, and plasma glucose profile are identical is doubtful. Other data support the importance of glucose variability for vascular complications in diabetes, but clinical studies have yet to confirm this.

That the costs of CSII are higher than those of MDI is perhaps obvious given the costs of pumps and infusion sets. There will also be a small saving in any market where insulin glargine is more expensive than insulin lispro. In economic terms, with similar efficacy but higher costs, CSII is "dominated" by MDI. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (U.K.) calculated a higher cost in the order of €1,392 to €1,772 per year, compatible with our results.

### 10 surprising things that can spike your blood sugar… [^113DUgvt]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know When you first found out you had diabetes, you tested your blood sugar often. This helped you understand how food, activity, stress, and illness could affect your blood sugar levels. Even now that you know the ups and downs, some causes of blood sugar spikes may surprise you. Do you know all these blood sugar triggers.
- Sunburn — the pain causes stress, and stress increases blood sugar levels.
- Artificial sweeteners — more research is needed, but some studies show they can raise blood sugar.
- Coffee — even without sweetener. Some people's blood sugar is extra-sensitive to caffeine.
- Losing sleep — even just one night of too little sleep can make your body use insulin less well.
- Skipping breakfast — going without that morning meal can increase blood sugar after both lunch and dinner.
- Time of day — blood sugar can be harder to control the later it gets.
- Dawn phenomenon — people have a surge in hormones early in the morning whether they have diabetes or not.

For people with diabetes, blood sugar can spike.
- Dehydration — less water in your body means your blood sugar is more concentrated.
- Nose spray — some have chemicals that trigger your liver to make more blood sugar.
- Gum disease — it's both a complication of diabetes and a blood sugar spiker. Watch out for other triggers that can make your blood sugar fall. For example, extreme heat can cause blood vessels to dilate. That makes insulin absorb more quickly and could lead to low blood sugar. If an activity or food is new, check your blood sugar before and after to see how you respond.

### Rapid-acting insulin analogues: theory and best clinical practice in type 1 and type 2 diabetes [^111JNLmm]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the discovery of insulin 100years ago, insulin preparations have improved significantly. Starting from purified animal insulins, evolving to human insulins produced by genetically modified organisms, and ultimately to insulin analogues, all in an attempt to mimic physiological insulin action profiles seen in individuals without diabetes. Achieving strict glucose control without hypoglycaemia and preventing chronic complications of diabetes while preserving quality of life remains a challenging goal, but the advent of newer ultra-rapid-acting insulin analogues may enable intensive insulin therapy without being too disruptive to daily life. Ultra-rapid-acting insulin analogues can be administered shortly before meals and give better coverage of mealtime-induced glucose excursions than conventional insulin preparations. They also increase convenience with timing of bolus dosing. In this review, we focus on the progress that has been made in rapid-acting insulins. We summarize pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, clinical trial data supporting the use of these new formulations as part of a basal-bolus regimen and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, and provide a clinical perspective to help guide healthcare professionals when and for whom to use ultra-fast-acting insulins.

### Biosimilar insulins: guidance for data interpretation by clinicians and users [^111KU75f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

However, some other clamp measures are also pertinent. Clearly what matters for a long‐acting insulin is duration of effect (ideally exceeding 24 h) at normal insulin doses, and the peak to 24‐h insulin ratio (concentration and action). The insulin concentrations (including those of the metabolites of insulin glargine, i.e. M1 and M2) can be surprisingly difficult to assess, as concentrations will be low at 24 h after a single injection. Furthermore glucose‐lowering action at 24 h is affected by the prolonged fast, and thus is spuriously elevated. One logical approach from a clinical point of view would be to start the clamp 16 h after a morning injection and a normal day's eating, but this seems never to be performed. Equally, one might expect the biosimilarity of meal‐time insulins to be characterized by lag time of onset after subcutaneous injection, rate of rise of insulin concentration (and effect), and rate of fall back to baseline, but such criteria are difficult to specify, and in practice clinicians will need to use visual inspection of profiles to assure themselves of similar pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles.

Lastly, plasma insulin measurements in people with type 1 diabetes can be problematic because of insulin antibodies (and hence antibody‐bound insulin) confounding radioimmunoassays. This may account for the erratic pharmacokinetic profiles seen in the Lilly study in people with type 1 diabetes – so erratic that they do not contribute to any assessment of biosimilarity 18.

### A randomized, controlled study of once-daily LY2605541, a novel long-acting basal insulin, versus insulin glargine in basal insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes [^115iLxWm]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Basal insulin in combination with oral antidiabetes medications (OADs) has been a successful initial insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes treatment. Once-daily analog basal insulins have a comparable glycemic-lowering effect and reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia rates relative to NPH insulin. This reduced risk for hypoglycemia, as well as a reduction in the need for twice-daily injections, has been attributed to the prolongation of action by retarding subcutaneous absorption, lessening peak activity, and reducing variability of circulating insulin levels. However, the peripheral subcutaneous administration of these insulin analogs does not replicate the twofold higher portal-versus-systemic circulating insulin levels seen with endogenously secreted insulin. Therefore, the net effect of peripheral insulin administration is potentially overstimulation of glucose uptake to compensate for the reduced hepatic insulin action needed to maintain glucose homeostasis.

The basal insulin analog LY2605541 is a novel, long-acting insulin that consists of insulin lispro modified with a 20-kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety having a large hydrodynamic size which delays insulin absorption and reduces clearance, resulting in prolonged duration of action. The increase in functional molecular size appears to alter the distribution of this insulin to tissues. Hypothetically, the fenestrated hepatic sinusoidal endothelium may facilitate greater transport of LY2605541 into the liver relative to peripheral tissues (i.e. muscle and fat), potentially providing a more preferential hepatic action akin to normal physiology.

This exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of LY2605541 versus insulin glargine (GL) when administered once daily in the morning in combination with OADs for 12 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes. The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that LY2605541 would result in lower fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels as measured by self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) at end point (week 12) compared with GL.

### Hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes on antidiabetic medications who fast for laboratory tests [^112fQDc3]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

These findings indicate that patients on antidiabetic medications are at risk for developing hypoglycemia while fasting for laboratory testing. While we are not certain of the causes of hypoglycemia in our patients, a possible explanation for the ensuing hypoglycemia is the lingering effects of antidiabetic medications during a prolonged fast, as hepatic glycogen stores may begin to wane, and release of hepatic glucose may get impaired.

We believe that while the liver can provide glucose during prolonged fasting, this usually is physiologically facilitated by significant reductions in insulin secretion to the nadir. In patients on insulin, especially basal insulin the night before, or on long-acting sulphonylurias, this protective physiologic mechanism is impaired or eliminated, and release of glucose from the liver is thus impaired. We believe that this is particularly more likely to occur in patients with long-standing diabetes who are vulnerable to have impaired glucagon secretion, and in patients with autonomic neuropathy who are at risk of impaired epinephrine release.

Since we realized these recurring events in our patients, we implemented the following educational program at our practice: 1) more frequent glucose monitoring during the morning hours (until the fasting is broken) and cancelling the laboratory tests if necessary; 2) avoiding any type of insulin, whether short- or long-acting, on the morning of the test (patients are routinely instructed to skip scheduled short-acting insulin when skipping a meal but are not always certain about basal insulin); 3) taking less long-acting insulin at night; and 4) reducing or omitting evening doses of sulphonylurias.

In conclusion, we believe that hypoglycemia resulting from fasting for laboratory tests is an overlooked problem. The potential serious harm to patients should be of particular interest to risk managers, laboratories, clinicians, and diabetes educators. Clinicians and diabetes educators should instruct their patients about preparation for fasting for laboratory tests including close glucose monitoring and adjustment of antidiabetic medications.

### Insulin detemir (Levemir) [^116xLbcv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy and safety of LEVEMIR given once-daily at bedtime or twice-daily (before breakfast and at bedtime, before breakfast and with the evening meal, or at 12-hour intervals) was compared to that of once-daily or twice-daily NPH insulin in open-label, randomized, parallel trials of 1155 adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus, 347 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and 869 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The efficacy and safety of LEVEMIR given twice-daily was compared to once-daily insulin glargine in an open-label, randomized, parallel trial of 320 patients with type 1 diabetes. The evening LEVEMIR dose was titrated in all trials according to pre-defined targets for fasting blood glucose. The pre-dinner blood glucose was used to titrate the morning LEVEMIR dose in those trials that also administered LEVEMIR in the morning. In general, the reduction in HbA1cwith LEVEMIR was similar to that with NPH insulin or insulin glargine.

### Insulin glargine: a new basal insulin [^113KNXBe]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, dosing guidelines, adverse effects, drug interactions, and clinical efficacy of insulin glargine.

Data Sources

Primary and review articles regarding insulin glargine were identified by MEDLINE search (1966-July 2001); abstracts were identified through Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science (1995-July 2001) and the American Diabetes Association. Additional information was obtained from the insulin glargine product information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All of the articles and meeting abstracts identified from the data sources were evaluated, and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. Priority was placed on data from the primary medical literature.

Data Synthesis

Insulin glargine is a long-acting, recombinant human insulin analog that is given once daily as a basal source of insulin in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Modification of the basic insulin structure has produced a new insulin that is soluble at an acidic pH, but precipitates in the subcutaneous tissue and is slowly released from a depot. Insulin glargine has a slower onset of action than NPH insulin and a longer duration of action with no peak activity. Once-daily administration of insulin glargine has comparable efficacy to that of NPH insulin administered once or twice daily in basal-bolus regimens when used in combination with intermittent doses of regular insulin or insulin lispro in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and in conjunction with oral antidiabetic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes. Overall, insulin glargine has an incidence of hypoglycemia comparable to or less than that of NPH insulin, with a reduced incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin seen in some studies.

Conclusions

Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin analog capable of providing 24-hour basal insulin coverage when administered once daily at bedtime. Its activity profile, which lacks a pronounced peak, more closely resembles that of endogenous basal insulin than that of other intermediate- or long-acting insulins and appears more likely to be associated with a reduced incidence of hypoglycemia, particularly nocturnal hypoglycemia. Insulin glargine physiologically provides basal insulin but, for most patients, the addition of a rapid-acting insulin, like insulin lispro, before or with meals will need to be included in the treatment regimen to achieve optimal management of blood glucose concentrations.

### A review of basal insulins [^115HebuT]. Diabetic Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Tight glycaemic control (ideally, HbA1c < 7%) is central to reducing the risk of long-term complications of diabetes. This approach, for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, commonly involves the use of basal insulin, and must be achieved with minimal risk of hypoglycaemia (particularly nocturnal episodes). Indeed, concern around hypoglycaemia is a major barrier to achieving tight glycaemic control, and is a common problem with those protracted-acting insulins most frequently used in clinical practice for basal insulin supply. Other drawbacks include inter- and intra-patient variability that compromises dosing reproducibility and unsuitability for single daily dosing. New long-acting human insulin analogues with action profiles designed to overcome these problems are now available in clinical practice or are under evaluation in clinical trials. Clinical evidence suggests efficacy and safety advantages for these analogues over NPH insulin (the most commonly used basal insulin), and may bring closer the goal of tight glycaemic control in patients with diabetes.

### Intermediate acting versus long acting insulin for type 1 diabetes mellitus [^116KSQKD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic disease with short and long term complications. Its goals of therapy are to eliminate the symptoms of hyperglycaemia, reduce the long term microvascular and macrovascular complications and allow the patients to achieve a normal life-style. Basal insulin replacement for insulin dependent patients can be achieved with either intermediate or long acting insulin preparations.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intermediate acting versus long acting insulin preparations for basal insulin replacement in type 1 diabetic patients.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library, as well as reference lists, databases of ongoing trials, and requests from authors of included trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, assessing long acting insulin preparations compared to intermediate acting insulin preparations, in type 1 diabetic patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently scanned the titles. Data were extracted and analysed accordingly.

Main Results

Twenty-three randomised controlled trials were identified. A total of 3872 and 2915 participants in the intervention and in the control group, respectively, were analysed. The weighted mean difference (WMD) for the level of glycosylated haemoglobin was -0.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to -0.04) in favour of the long acting insulin arm. The WMD between the groups in fasting plasma and blood glucose levels was -0.63 (95% CI -0.86 to -0.40) and -0.86 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.72) in favour of the long acting insulins. The odds ratio for a patient on long acting insulin to develop any type of hypoglycaemia was 0.93 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.08) compared to that of a patient on intermediate acting insulins. The OR for severe hypoglycaemic episodes was 0.73 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.87), and 0.70 (95% CI of 0.63 to 0.79) for nocturnal episodes. The WMD between the long and intermediate insulin groups for hypoglycaemic events per 100 patient follow up days was -0.77 (95% CI -0.89 to -0.65), -0.0 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.02) and -0.40 (95% CI -0.45 to -0.34) for overall, severe, and nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes. Weight gain was more prominent in the control group. No difference was noted in the quantity or quality of severe adverse events or deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

Long acting insulin preparations seem to exert a beneficial effect on nocturnal glucose levels. Their effect on the overall diabetes control is clinically unremarkable. Their use as a basal insulin regimen for type 1 diabetes mellitus warrants further substantiation.

### Insulin degludec in type 1 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial of a new-generation ultra-long-acting insulin compared with insulin glargine [^112R1b6X]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Insulin degludec (IDeg) is a basal insulin that forms soluble multihexamers after subcutaneous injection, resulting in an ultra-long action profile. We assessed the efficacy and safety of IDeg formulations administered once daily in combination with mealtime insulin aspart in people with type 1 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

In this 16-week, randomized, open-label trial, participants (mean: 45.8 years old, A1C 8.4%, fasting plasma glucose [FPG] 9.9 mmol/L, BMI 26.9 kg/m(2)) received subcutaneous injections of IDeg(A) (600 μmol/L; n = 59), IDeg(B) (900 μmol/L; n = 60), or insulin glargine (IGlar; n = 59), all given once daily in the evening. Insulin aspart was administered at mealtimes. RESULTS At 16 weeks, mean A1C was comparable for IDeg(A) (7.8 ± 0.8%), IDeg(B) (8.0 ± 1.0%), and IGlar (7.6 ± 0.8%), as was FPG (8.3 ± 4.0, 8.3 ± 2.8, and 8.9 ± 3.5 mmol/L, respectively). Estimated mean rates of confirmed hypoglycemia were 28% lower for IDeg(A) compared with IGlar (rate ratio [RR]: 0.72 [95% CI 0.52–1.00]) and 10% lower for IDeg(B) compared with IGlar (RR: 0.90 [0.65–1.24]); rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia were 58% lower for IDeg(A) (RR: 0.42 [0.25–0.69]) and 29% lower for IDeg(B) (RR: 0.71 [0.44–1.16]). Mean total daily insulin dose was similar to baseline. The frequency and pattern of adverse events was similar between insulin treatments.

Conclusions

In this clinical exploratory phase 2 trial in people with type 1 diabetes, IDeg is safe and well tolerated and provides comparable glycemic control to IGlar at similar doses, with reduced rates of hypoglycemia.

1 INTRODUCTION

In people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), long‐term maintenance of blood glucose levels close to normal is associated with a reduction in progression of microvascular complications and in all‐cause mortality. 1, 2 Current guidelines recommend insulin analogues for people with T1DM, because of the lower associated risk of hypoglycaemia compared with optimized insulin therapy with human insulin. 3 Nevertheless, blood glucose control remains suboptimal in many people, 4, 5 with described barriers including concerns about hypoglycaemia, flexibility of injection schedule and weight gain. 5 Some of these difficulties may be related to action profiles of conventional extended‐acting insulins and the first‐generation long‐acting insulin analogues. 5, 6

In people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) already receiving insulin, the more stable and prolonged pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla‐300) vs those of glargine 100 U/mL (Gla‐100) 7 translate into sustained glycaemic control for 1 year, with less nocturnal hypoglycaemia. 8, 9 In T1DM in the EDITION 4 clinical trial, 549 people were randomized to Gla‐300 or Gla‐100 as basal insulin, and to morning or evening injection. 10 The primary 6‐month results showed equivalent glycaemic control and a lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with Gla‐300 vs Gla‐100 during the first 8 weeks. 10 Glucose profiles, rates of hypoglycaemia and adverse events were comparable, irrespective of morning or evening Gla‐300 injection, 10 suggesting that Gla‐300 provides the freedom to choose a morning or evening injection schedule without compromising glycaemic control or increasing hypoglycaemia. In the current 6‐month, pre‐planned continuation of EDITION 4, we investigated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Gla‐300 compared with Gla‐100, given morning or evening, over 12 months.

### Dual-basal-insulin regimen for the management of dawn phenomenon in children with type 1 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study [^114UufLz]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

To treat early morning hyperglycemia in T1DM children using a basal-bolus insulin regimen with MDII, the basal insulin dose in the early morning hours must be increased. Neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) is an intermediate-acting human insulin with an onset of action in 1–3 h and peak action in 4–8 h. The onset and peak action coincide with early morning hyperglycemia, typically between 2:00 and 5:00 a.m. when NPH is administered at midnight. Thus, the requirement for morning insulin spike can be met by using NPH at midnight. With this rationality, we have been managing DP in our clinic recently with a dual-basal-insulin regimen, consisting of long-acting insulin at bedtime (glargine) and intermediate-acting insulin at midnight (NPH). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a dual-basal-insulin regimen for the treatment of DP in children with T1DM.

Possible Clinical Considerations for Anna

To address Anna's concerns about the suitability of BI treatment and her perception that her BI therapy is no longer needed, she may benefit from education on the nature of T2D, being reminded that diabetes is a progressive disease and that most individuals with T2D eventually require a BI for optimal glycaemic control. Contrary to what Anna might currently believe, good glycaemic control does not mean the remission of diabetes. The fact that her glycaemic control is good reflects the fact that her current BI therapy has been effective in controlling her blood glucose, whereas a different class of antihyperglycaemic drug may not have been as effective.

Given Anna's issues with hypoglycaemia, education around hypoglycaemia self-management and recognising and preventing situations in which hypoglycaemia occurs are important so that she can manage her diabetes more closely. Switching to a second-generation BI, such as Gla-300, may help reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, particularly overnight. As hypoglycaemia is the major reason for Anna's physician to consider a switch from Gla-100 to a second-generation BI analogue, a reduction in the daily dose of insulin could also be an option, as could a change in administration time from evening to morning. Moreover, further adjustments of the insulin dose might be most effective when done at least once weekly until the achievement of the target of fasting glycaemia without hypoglycaemia. Given the lower risk of hypoglycaemia versus first-generation BI analogues, switching Anna's treatment to a second-generation BI analogue such as Gla-300 may help her to maintain her HbA 1c at her individualized target while reducing her fear of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Once she gains confidence in the safety of her BI therapy, her dose could be further uptitrated to reach the general guideline recommended target of below 7%.

Case 3: Basal Insulin Treatment in Older People with T2D

Lorenzo's Concerns

Lorenzo's caregivers, his son and daughter-in-law, are unsure whether Lorenzo's glycaemic control is adequate, but are also aware that there may be risks associated with hypoglycaemia considering his age, including worsening dementia symptoms. They are concerned for his safety. Both caregivers have demanding jobs and they and Lorenzo are worried about the complexity of BI therapy, and Lorenzo in particular is reluctant to start an injectable therapy.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insulin glargine given in the evening as compared with in the morning in type 2 diabetes [^111iDMYD]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after evening versus morning administration.

Research Design and Methods

Ten T2DM insulin-treated persons were studied during 24-h euglycemic glucose clamp, after glargine injection (0.4 units/kg s.c.), either in the evening (2200 h) or the morning (1000 h).

Results

The 24-h glucose infusion rate area under the curve (AUC0-24h) was similar in the evening and morning studies (1,058 ± 571 and 995 ± 691 mg/kg × 24 h, P = 0.503), but the first 12 h (AUC0-12h) was lower with evening versus morning glargine (357 ± 244 vs. 593 ± 374 mg/kg × 12 h, P = 0.004), whereas the opposite occurred for the second 12 h (AUC12-24h 700 ± 396 vs. 403 ± 343 mg/kg × 24 h, P = 0.002). The glucose infusion rate differences were totally accounted for by different rates of endogenous glucose production, not utilization. Plasma insulin and C-peptide levels did not differ in evening versus morning studies. Plasma glucagon levels (AUC0-24h 1,533 ± 656 vs. 1,120 ± 344 ng/L/h, P = 0.027) and lipolysis (free fatty acid AUC0-24h 7.5 ± 1.6 vs. 8.9 ± 1.9 mmol/L/h, P = 0.005; β-OH-butyrate AUC0-24h 6.8 ± 4.7 vs. 17.0 ± 11.9 mmol/L/h, P = 0.005; glycerol, P < 0.020) were overall more suppressed after evening versus morning glargine administration.

Conclusions

The PD of insulin glargine differs depending on time of administration. With morning administration insulin activity is greater in the first 0–12 h, while with evening administration the activity is greater in the 12–24 h period following dosing. However, glargine PK and plasma C-peptide levels were similar, as well as glargine PD when analyzed by 24-h clock time independent of the time of administration. Thus, the results reflect the impact of circadian changes in insulin sensitivity in T2DM (lower in the night-early morning vs. afternoon hours) rather than glargine per se.

### Clinical characteristics of patients responding to once-daily basal insulin therapy in Korean subjects with type 2 diabetes [^113XM9SC]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Most Korean physicians preferred morning injections of insulin detemir over evening injections. Once-daily injections in the morning showed significant A1c-lowering effects but increased overall hypoglycemic episodes. These desirable glycemic effects and undesirable hypoglycemic episodes might be due to increased insulin doses in the morning injections. Although the doses of insulin in the morning injections were significantly higher, this did not affect the increase in the body weight. Previous studies showed consistent with the findings in our study which was once daily insulin detemir is not associated with weight gain. A majority of the patients were injected with detemir in the morning in real clinical practice. While an evening injection is recommended by the available guidelines, results have shown that morning and evening administration of detemir were associated with reductions in A1c. The morning administration group had a larger insulin dose, but they had fewer hypoglycemic events and only 500 g more weight gain compared to the evening administration group. The Korean Diabetes Association does not clearly indicate the injection time of BI treatment. The primary physicians preferred morning injection of BI analog might be more comfortable for the patients and effective in glycemic control. This might be an explanation for morning preference in BI therapy. Observational studies include a wide range of study designs, a defining feature of which is that any intervention studied is determined by clinical practice and not by the protocol. Data from large, prospective observational studies provide information about the safety and efficacy of medicines in daily clinical use. However, observational trials have inherent limitations in terms of their susceptibility to bias, restricting their ability to define causality. However, their strengths include that they reflect daily clinical practice more closely than randomized controlled trials, both in terms of the heterogeneous patient populations that are included, and the medical interventions that they receive. Similarly, our study has several disadvantages of an observational study. First, we did not adjust for a number of confounding variables faced in actual clinical practice. Second, the comparison between patients injecting detemir in the evening with those injecting in the morning is weakened by a small number of patients in the former group. The A 1 chieve study, by nature of its design, has a number of limitations that must be considered when interpreting the data. Third, in terms of the subjects' baseline characteristics, we could not figure out detailed withdrawal reasons, previous drug use including statin, and there were no statistical results on the difference between the subjects who withdrew from the study and the subjects who completed the study.

How to Select a Basal Insulin?

Three generations of basal insulins are available in Canada. The first generation of basal insulin is NPH, a human insulin that has been available for many decades, since 1946. The basal analogues (insulins detemir and glargine (Gla-100)) emerged in the 2000s and provided longer duration of action, improved day-to-day variability, reduced hypoglycemia, especially nocturnal, and did not require resuspension (as does NPH). A next generation of long-acting basal insulins — insulins glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300) and degludec — have emerged with an extended action profile, improved safety, and the advantage of being administered in smaller volumes. Table 5 summarizes the main characteristics of the currently available basal insulins. The panel recognizes that the choice of basal insulin may depend on access, cost, and clinical judgment with respect to the patient's individual needs and lifestyle.

### The optimal morning: evening ratio in total dose of twice-daily biphasic insulin analogue in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes: a 24-week multi-centre prospective, randomized controlled, open-labelled clinical study [^115io8jF]. Diabetic Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

Biphasic insulin analogues are widely used in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus suboptimally controlled on oral anti-diabetic drugs. Several topics in this area remain controversial, including how to divide the daily dose of biphasic insulin analogue. We aimed to determine the optimal dosing ratio of twice-daily biphasic insulin analogue and to compare the glycaemic efficacy among groups of patients using different initial dosing ratios of biphasic insulin analogue.

Methods

A total of 100 poorly controlled insulin-naive subjects with Type 2 diabetes [HbA1c ≥ 58 mmol/mol, (7.5%)] on oral anti-diabetic drugs were randomized into three groups according to initial morning:evening dosing ratio (group I, 50:50; group II, 55:45; group III, 60:40) of twice-daily biphasic insulin analogue (biphasic insulin aspart 70/30, biphasic insulin aspart 30). The primary outcome measure was the difference in pre-breakfast to pre-dinner dose ratio at the end of the study.

Results

Twice-daily biphasic insulin analogue showed a significant improvement in glycaemic control [HbA1c from 70 mmol/mol (8.6%) to 60 mmol/mol (7.6%)] after 24 weeks regardless of the initial dose ratio given. Despite the similar efficacy and safety profiles among three groups, morning dose was significantly increased (from 50:50 to 55:45–60:40) in group I after 24 weeks. However, there was no significant change in splitting ratio in groups II and III (with higher morning dose) over the 24-week treatment period.

Conclusions

These results indicate that initiating twice-daily biphasic insulin analogue on regimens with a higher dose before breakfast than before dinner (i.e. ratio approximately 55:45 to 60:40) might be more appropriate in Korean subjects with Type 2 diabetes.

### Basal-bolus insulin regimen for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: a practical approach [^1143ckMH]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

If the fasting or pre-breakfast blood glucose is 70–90 mg/dl (3.9–5.0 mmol/L), the dose of basal insulin should be decreased by 1 unit (10% if the dose of basal insulin is > 10 units). If the fasting or pre-breakfast blood glucose is < 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L) or the patient experiences nocturnal hypoglycaemia, the basal insulin dose should be decreased by 2 units (10–20% if the dose of basal insulin is > 10 units) and the bedtime snack(s) policy reviewed.

In a scenario where twice-daily basal insulin is used, the adjustments may be more complex. It should be understood that the primary action of basal insulin is that of regulating pre-meal blood glucose values. Accordingly, the morning dose of basal insulin should be adjusted based upon the pre-dinner blood glucose value and less commonly the pre-lunch blood glucose value. The increase in the dose of morning basal insulin is only justified if the upward drift of blood glucose starts after the peak of lunch time prandial insulin is over, implying that the post-lunch blood glucose is in target but the pre-dinner and evening blood glucose values are elevated. However, when both the pre-dinner blood glucose and post-lunch blood glucose levels are elevated, it is the dose of prandial (before lunch) insulin that should primarily be adjusted, and not that of basal insulin. Similarly, in the case of preprandial hypoglycaemia (during the pre-lunch or pre-dinner period), the morning basal insulin dose should be decreased, provided the hypoglycaemia is not explained by missed or inadequate snacks or other factors (such as exercise, vomiting and/or diarrhea). Basal insulin adjustment is explained in the context of various case scenarios in Table 8.

The any time each day Insulin Degludec arm was designed to simulate a worst-case scenario injection schedule of alternating short and long, once daily, dosing intervals (i.e., alternating intervals of 8 to 40 hours between doses). Insulin Degludec in this arm was dosed in the morning on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and in the evening on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Insulin aspart was administered before each meal in all treatment arms.

### Ramadan and diabetes: a narrative review and practice update [^112dTpcB]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Sulphonylureas

Similar to the meglitinide class of oral antidiabetic agents, SUs stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells. However, their mechanism is glucose independent, resulting in a higher risk of hypoglycaemia and therefore making their use during Ramadan a concern.

The timing of taking SUs during Ramadan is key to their safety and efficacy. Although we advise changing patients on modified-release (MR) preparations to standard-release ones (Table 4), in those patients for whom this cannot be done for reasons such as patient preference or practicality of administration, switching the morning MR dose to the evening can be done safely without causing excessive hypoglycaemia. A recently published real-world multinational observational study has shown that MR gliclazide between 60 and 90 mg dose taken daily at Iftaar is associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain whilst maintaining control, in fasting patients with HbA 1c < 9%. Similarly, glimepiride was associated with fewer hypoglycaemic events when the morning dose was switched to the evening at Iftaar.

The duration of action of SUs taken during Ramadan should be considered. The use of glibenclamide has been shown to result in more hypoglycaemic events when compared to glimepiride, gliclazide or repaglinide. The use of older and longer-acting agents, such as glibenclamide, should be avoided during Ramadan and the patient switched to a short-acting SU or to repaglinide.

The newer generation of SUs, such as glipizide, glimepiride and gliclazide, are associatged with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and are therefore safer to take during Ramadan. We recommend that patients on gliclazide should halve the morning dose and take the usual dose in the evening as Iftaar tends to be the larger meal and characterized by a higher glycaemic index. Doses of gliclazide should be switched around if patients are taking a larger dose in the morning and a smaller dose in the evening. Glipizide that is taken once daily should be taken at Iftaar during Ramadan to minimize hypoglycaemia risk.

For those on combination therapy with long-acting insulin, insulin and SU dose should be carefully titrated to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia.

### An overview of insulin glargine [^113ihE32]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Insulin glargine is an innovative, long-acting human insulin analogue, whose prolonged mean activity profile has no pronounced peak. Accordingly, it mimics more closely the natural physiological profile of basal endogenous insulin secretion than do traditional extended-acting insulins such as NPH insulin. As would be expected for a more satisfactory basal insulin, clinical trials comparing insulin glargine with NPH insulin show less nocturnal hypoglycaemia, improved pre-breakfast blood glucose levels, or both. Furthermore, no substantive safety concerns have emerged for insulin glargine. Thus, insulin glargine represents the first major advance in the provision of basal insulin injection therapy for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes for over 50 years.

### Improving type 2 diabetes management in general practice using a second-generation basal insulin analogue insulin glargine 300 U / mL: a practical guide [^115uGgQK]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Case Comment

In patients who are on insulin therapy and experiencing hypoglycaemic episodes, switching to a second-generation basal insulin analogue is an option. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can be used to detect hidden hypoglycaemic episodes. Switching to a second-generation basal insulin analogue is a logical choice e.g. for the elderly, those living alone, those with inadequate glucose control requiring intensification or in patients having difficulties maintaining a strict 24-h dosing schedule.

Hypoglycaemia is a major risk factor for Mary and the risk could be considerably reduced by switching her to a second-generation basal insulin analogue plus a short-acting insulin if required (basal plus) or basal insulin with a GLP-1 receptor agonist. This reflects a flatter 24-h glycaemic lowering effect of the newer-generation insulin analogues.

When commencing glargine U300, the starting dose would be her total daily insulin less 30% [(40 units + 48 units = 88 units) − 30% = 58 units] (see Fig. 2). T h is could be introduced as a single morning or evening dose. Her Gla-300 will be titrated against her fasting blood glucose level (BGL).

Once her morning fasting blood glucose is near 6 mmol/L, and there is no evidence of hypoglycaemia, we can focus on closely monitoring her postprandial blood glucose. If there is significant postprandial BGL excursions (see Fig. 3), consideration could be given to the introduction of a GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefits, to assist with controlling the postprandial glucose and help her reduce weight without a significant increased risk of hypoglycaemia or introducing short-acting insulin, initially to those meals showing the greatest postprandial BGL excursions (basal plus) where a GLP-1 receptor agonist may not be efficacious enough to control significant postprandial hyperglycaemia (see Fig. 4).

### The basis for weekly insulin therapy: evolving evidence with insulin icodec and insulin efsitora alfa [^112Hfd5Y]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Flexibility in time of administration

The stable and predictable PK profile of a once-weekly basal insulin has the potential to minimize patient burden and the micromanagement of insulin therapy that is currently required to maintain desirable glycemic control. These ultra-long-acting insulins would provide more flexibility in the timing of the dosing and may be more forgiving to dosing errors or skipped doses. Compared to once-daily basal insulins discussed earlier (Fig. 2B), once a once-weekly insulin reaches steady state it can be more forgiving and offer more flexibility than once-daily insulins, since skipping a dose may not result in an immediate or irremediable loss of efficacy given the long half-life of these drugs. Icodec dosing guidelines from their protocol offer guidance that for a missed dose it should be taken "as soon as possible" but if 3 days or fewer remain before the next dose, that week's dose should be skipped. There is precedence for this approach of skipping a dose with other weekly agents used in diabetes management, for example, dulaglutide and semaglutide. As discussed earlier, IDeg, the once-daily insulin with the longest half-life, has also been studied for administration within an 8- to 40-hour window without showing loss of efficacy. With weekly insulins having a much longer half-life, similar principles of flexibility could apply.

Similarly, the flat PK profile of once-weekly insulins may also enable more consistent and perhaps less bolus dosing in patients on mealtime insulin since a steady basal insulin coverage over days, particularly during the night or between meals, is likely to reduce bolus needs. On the other hand, one could also argue that the increase in flexibility with dosing could lead to more complacency and worsening of glycemic control. Although real-world evidence would be the ultimate arbitrator for this concern, experience with long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) so far has shown that decreased frequency of injection does not decrease persistence to treatment.

When surveyed, both patients and health care providers indicate a preference for fewer injections both with insulin and GLP-1 RAs. A reduction therefore in patient burden with a simplified, weekly dosing regimen, reducing the injection burden by 313 injections every year may lead to an improvement in adherence and persistence to insulin therapy. In addition, once at steady state, the frequency of testing blood glucose may also be reduced, lowering the treatment burden associated with insulin treatment.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to insulin therapy (monitoring), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor for signs of overbasalization during insulin therapy, such as significant bedtime-to-morning or postprandial-to-preprandial glucose differential, occurrences of hypoglycemia (aware or unaware), and high glycemic variability. Obtain a thorough reevaluation promptly when overbasalization is suspected to further tailor therapy to the patient's needs.

### Learning about new therapies: phase 3 clinical studies – and beyond [^113uKsSn]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The first potential distinction lies in adherence to insulin dosing. If more than a single daily injection of basal insulin is needed, adherence may be inconsistent and hyperglycemia may persist for some people prescribed U100 insulin. This is the main rationale underlying increasing use of U500 regular human insulin. Use of U200 degludec might lead to improved adherence and better glycemic control by replacing two injections of any U100 insulin given by syringe (up to 100 units per injection) or by pen (up to 80 units) with a single daily injection of up to 160 units. However, the current study does not directly address this hypothesis. An adequately powered study of people taking high dosage of insulin is needed.

Another potential advantage of U200 degludec is a lower risk of hypoglycemia. Although the current study did not show less hypoglycemia than with U100 glargine, further studies of certain subpopulations might do so. Both the extended duration of action of the degludec molecule and a flatter time-activity profile associated with a higher concentration of injected insulin could lead to a very stable, flat profile of this formulation. Modest reductions of hypoglycemia, especially at night, have been reported in some but not all earlier studies comparing U100 degludec with U100 glargine. There is reason to believe that an advantage of degludec (or any especially long-acting insulin) over glargine might be most evident in people with lower insulin requirements. In an analysis of data pooled from more than 2,200 individuals with type 2 diabetes who were treated with systematically titrated glargine, younger age, lower BMI, and lower basal insulin dose requirement all were independently associated with greater risk of confirmed hypoglycemia. Thus, younger, less obese individuals needing lower than average dosage of basal insulin might be another subgroup of interest for study of new basal insulin formulations such as U200 degludec.

### Nocturnal glucose metabolism after bedtime injection of insulin glargine or neutral protamine hagedorn insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^116Yk2DN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Aims/Hypothesis

Insulin glargine is a long-acting human insulin analog often administered at bedtime to patients with type 2 diabetes. It reduces fasting blood glucose levels more efficiently and with less nocturnal hypoglycemic events compared with human neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin. Therefore, bedtime injections of insulin glargine and NPH insulin were compared overnight and in the morning.

Methods

In 10 type 2 diabetic patients, euglycemic clamps were performed, including [6,6'](2)H(2) glucose, to study the rate of disappearance (Rd) and endogenous production (EGP) of glucose during the night. On separate days at bedtime (2200 h), patients received a sc injection of insulin glargine, NPH insulin, or saline in a randomized, double-blind fashion.

Results

Similar doses of both insulins had different metabolic profiles. NPH insulin had a greater effect on both Rd and EGP in the night compared with insulin glargine. By contrast, in the morning, insulin glargine was more effective, increasing Rd by 5.8 micromol/kg(-1).min(-1) (95% confidence interval 4.7–6.9) and reducing EGP -5.7 (-5.0 to -6.4) compared with NPH insulin. Nearly 80% of the glucose lowering effect in the morning was due to insulin glargine's reduction of EGP. Its injection was associated with one-third lower morning glucagon levels compared with NPH insulin (P = 0.021).

Conclusion/Interpretation

Nocturnal variations of EGP and Rd explain the reduced incidence of hypoglycemia and lower fasting glucose levels reported for insulin glargine compared with human NPH insulin.

### Better glycemic control and weight loss with the novel long-acting basal insulin LY2605541 compared with insulin glargine in type 1 diabetes: a randomized, crossover study [^111qTaJ9]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Patients required ∼24% less mealtime insulin during LY2605541 treatment than during GL treatment. This was not a result of a relatively higher dose of LY2605541 compared with GL because fasting glycemia was not different between treatments but presumably is due to better daytime coverage from a longer-lasting basal insulin.

Despite morning administration, which should have minimized nocturnal hypoglycemia for the shorter-acting GL, LY2605541 was associated with a lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycemia than GL. However, overall rates of total hypoglycemia were higher during LY2605541 treatment. The higher rate of total hypoglycemia was not a result of a relatively higher dose of LY2605541 compared with GL, because fasting glycemia was not different between treatments and LY2605541 treatment resulted in lower nocturnal hypoglycemia events.

Different treat-to-target algorithms were used for dose titration and for reduction of the two basal insulins after hypoglycemia. The algorithm for LY2605541, while exploratory, was developed based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of that basal insulin. Further clinical experience will be needed to determine the optimal dose adjustment needed in instances of hypoglycemia with LY2605541 as well as the best use of mealtime insulin with this novel long-acting insulin.

Patients treated with LY2605541 lost weight while improving glycemic control. This observation was reaffirmed by sequential observations noted with the crossover design (Fig. 2 B). Weight loss with improved glycemic control was also observed in a LY2605541 Phase 2 trial in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Patients in this study reported significantly more GI-related adverse events with LY2605541 compared with GL. The converse was noted in a study of LY2605541 in type 2 diabetes. Skin disorders were more common with LY2605541 in that study, but the difference between treatment groups in skin disorders was less pronounced in this study.

### The efficacy and safety of insulin degludec given in variable once-daily dosing intervals compared with insulin glargine and insulin degludec dosed at the same time daily: a 26-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, Treat-to-target trial in individuals with type 2 diabetes [^113eq99U]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

The requirement to inject current basal insulin analogs at a fixed time each day may complicate adherence and compromise glycemic control. This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of varying the daily injection time of insulin degludec (IDeg), an ultra-long-acting basal insulin.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This 26-week, open-label, treat-to-target trial enrolled adults (≥ 18 years) with type 2 diabetes who were either insulin naïve and receiving oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (HbA 1c = 7–11%) or previously on basal insulin ± OAD(s) (HbA 1c = 7–10%). Participants were randomized to 1) once-daily (OD) IDeg in a prespecified dosing schedule, creating 8–40-h intervals between injections (IDeg OD Flex; n = 229); 2) once-daily IDeg at the main evening meal (IDeg OD; n = 228); or 3) once-daily insulin glargine at the same time each day (IGlar OD; n = 230). The primary outcome was noninferiority of IDeg OD Flex to IGlar OD in HbA 1c reduction after 26 weeks.

RESULTS

After 26 weeks, IDeg OD Flex, IDeg OD, and IGlar OD improved HbA 1c by 1.28, 1.07, and 1.26% points, respectively (estimated treatment difference [IDeg OD Flex − IGlar OD]: 0.04% points [–0.12 to 0.20], confirming noninferiority). No statistically significant differences in overall or nocturnal hypoglycemia were found between IDeg OD Flex and IGlar OD. Comparable glycemic control and rates of hypoglycemia were seen with IDeg OD Flex and IDeg OD. Adverse event profiles were similar across groups.

CONCLUSIONS

The use of extreme dosing intervals of 8–40 h demonstrates that the daily injection time of IDeg can be varied without compromising glycemic control or safety.

### Low within-and between-day variability in exposure to new insulin glargine 300 U / mL [^112HaeeK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The advent of Gla-100 created the concept of a basal-bolus regimen to replace missing or inadequate insulin secretion, or to support failing oral antihyperglycaemic therapy with basal insulin supplementation. Clinical experience with basal insulin supplementation stipulated the design of long-acting insulin products with the most even supply profile possible. Ideally, this low diurnal fluctuation should be accompanied by high day-to-day reproducibility, should allow flexibility in the preferred once-daily dosing interval, and yet should still allow quick dose adjustments. Gla-300 aims to achieve these goals. The more sustained activity beyond 24-h with Gla-300 versus Gla-100, and the short time to steady state, are reported elsewhere.

The present study demonstrated bioequivalence of two Gla-300 formulations in terms of PK and PD variables, showing that whether people administer Gla-300 using a vial and syringe, or using an insulin pen, the injected insulin has the same effect. In addition, the crossover design of this equivalence study allowed aspects of variability to be assessed.

### New insulin glargine 300 units / mL versus glargine 100 units / mL in people with type 1 diabetes: a randomized, phase 3a, open-label clinical trial (EDITION 4) [^115jgv5i]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes still provides suboptimal outcomes. Insulin glargine 300 units/mL (Gla-300), with a flatter pharmacodynamic profile compared with insulin glargine 100 units/mL (Gla-100), is an approach to this problem.

Research Design and Methods

People with type 1 diabetes, using a mealtime and basal insulin regimen, were randomized open-label to Gla-300 or Gla-100 and to morning or evening injection, continuing the mealtime analog, and followed for 6 months.

Results

Participants (n = 549) were a mean age of 47 years and had a mean duration of diabetes of 21 years and BMI of 27.6 kg/m(2). The change in HbA1c (primary end point; baseline 8.1%) was equivalent in the two treatment groups (difference, 0.04% [95% CI -0.10 to 0.19]) (0.4 mmol/mol [-1.1 to 2.1]), and Gla-300 was thus noninferior. Similar results with wider 95% CIs were found for morning and evening injection times and for prebreakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) overall. Results were also similar for Gla-300 when morning and evening injection time was compared, including overlapping 8-point SMPG profiles. Hypoglycemia did not differ, except for the first 8 weeks of the study, when nocturnal confirmed or severe hypoglycemia was lower with Gla-300 (rate ratio 0.69 [95% CI 0.53–0.91]). Hypoglycemia with Gla-300 did not differ by time of injection. The basal insulin dose was somewhat higher at 6 months for Gla-300. The adverse event profile did not differ and was independent of the Gla-300 time of injection. Weight gain was lower with Gla-300.

Conclusions

In long-duration type 1 diabetes, Gla-300 provides similar glucose control to Gla-100, with a lower risk of hypoglycemia after transfer from other insulins, independent of time of injection, and less weight gain.

The efficacy of Insulin Degludec was evaluated in a 26-week randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in 687 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on basal insulin alone, oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) alone or both basal insulin and OAD. Patients were randomized to Insulin Degludec injected once-daily at the same time each day (with the main evening meal), to Insulin Degludec injected once daily at any time each day or to insulin glargine U-100 injected once-daily according to the approved labeling. The any time each day Insulin Degludec arm was designed to simulate a worst-case scenario injection schedule of alternating short and long, once daily, dosing intervals (i.e., alternating intervals of 8 to 40 hours between doses). Insulin Degludec in this arm was dosed in the morning on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and in the evening on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Up to three of the following oral antidiabetes agents (metformin, sulfonylureas, glinides or thiazolidinediones) were administered as background therapy in both treatment arms.

### The 2021–2022 position of Brazilian diabetes society on insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes: an evidence-based guideline to clinical practice [^114FFuZE]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence

The efficacy and safety profile of ultra-long-acting analogues (glargine U300 and degludec) in PWT1D were evaluated in phase 3 clinical studies using insulin glargine U100 as a comparator. In EDITION 4, a six-month, open-label RCT, participants were randomised to daily insulin glargine U300 or glargine U100, both in combination with prandial insulin at each meal. Glargine U300 demonstrated non-inferiority compared to glargine U100 in reducing HbA1c from baseline. The rates of general, nocturnal and/or severe hypoglycemia were similar between the groups at the end of six months. However, there was a lower incidence of confirmed or severe nocturnal hypoglycemic events in the first eight weeks of the insulin glargine U 300 study (event ratio 0.69; 95% CI 0.53–0.91). There were no differences in results due to the time of application in the morning or at night.
The BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1 study was a 52-week, open-label, treat-to-target clinical trial that compared the use of degludec vs. glargine U100 (both combined with prandial insulin in a multiple-dose regimen). At the end of one year, the efficacy in lowering HbA1c and the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemic events (< 56 mg/dL) were similar between the groups. Notwithstanding, the incidence of confirmed nocturnal hypoglycemia was 25% lower with degludec compared with glargine U100 (4.41 vs 5.86 episodes per patient-year of exposure; p = 0.021). It should be noted that this study excluded people with recurrent severe hypoglycemia or asymptomatic hypoglycemia.
PWT1D at high risk for hypoglycemia were included in the SWITCH 1 study, which compared insulin degludec vs. glargine U100 for the incidence of general, nocturnal, and/or severe hypoglycemia. Degludec promoted an 11% reduction in symptomatic hypoglycemia (p < 0.001), a 36% reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia (p < 0.001), and a 35% reduction in severe hypoglycemia episodes (p = 0.007), compared with insulin glargine U100.
Given the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the ultra-long-acting analogues, the possibility of some flexibility in the time of application of these insulins in the face of an unexpected event is admitted without prejudice to glycemic control and ensuring greater convenience. Although this has not been effectively tested for insulin glargine U300 in PWT1D, insulin degludec has been tested in the BEGIN Flex T1 study. In this 26-weeks open-label, treat-to-target clinical trial, degludec administered in a forced flexible regimen (minimum interval of 8 h and maximum interval of 40 h between doses) was shown to be safe and non-inferior to the use of insulin degludec or glargine U100 given at fixed times.

### Glycemic variability in type 1 diabetes compared with degludec and glargine on the morning injection: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^114pLTvZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Optimal adjustment of basal insulin to overcome hypoglycemia and glycemic variability (GV) depends on its duration of action and peak-less profile. Owing to the ability of long-acting basal insulin to avoid hypoglycemia, we titrated pre-meal glucose to normal fasting blood glucose, 80–110 mg/dL (4.5–6.1 mmol/L), and post-meal glucose to 80–140 mg/dL (4.5–7.8 mmol/L). The purpose of this study was to evaluate two basal insulin analogues degludec (IDeg) and glargine (IGlar), injected in the morning, for GV using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in type 1 diabetes (T1DM).

Methods

In this crossover study, 20 Japanese patients with T1DM (age 54 ± 16 years, disease duration 16 ± 8 years, BMI 24 ± 4 kg/m 2, HbA1c 7.4 ± 0.8%) were randomized into one of two different starting regimens, and CGM was conducted on three consecutive days during the last week of each 12-week titration period. Treatment satisfaction was assessed at the end of each treatment period using the Diabetes Therapy-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (DTR-QOL).

Results

There were no differences in HbA1c, total insulin dosage, body weight changes, and basal to bolus ratio between the IDeg and IGlar arms. The day-to-day variability in fasting interstitial GV on the CGM curves was significantly less in the IDeg than IGlar treatment period (25.9 ± 22.0 vs. 43.8 ± 30.1 mg/dl, p = 0.04). Other markers of GV, calculated by the EasyGV software, including mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), J-index, total and nocturnal hypoglycemia were not different between the two treatment periods. The score of "satisfaction with treatment", a subdomain of the DTR-QOL system, was higher in the IDeg period.

Conclusion

Thus, the morning injection of the two long-acting insulin analogues seemed similar with regard to the magnitude of hypoglycemia in T1DM, but treatment with IDeg was associated with lower day-to-day variation in glucose level. These results suggest that IDeg is safe with minimal morning GV in patients with T1DM.

### A randomized cross-over trial to identify the optimal use of insulin glargine in prepubertal children using a three-times daily insulin regimen [^113Vn9ci]. Diabetic Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

The long-acting insulin analogue glargine reduces nocturnal hypoglycaemia and stabilizes morning blood glucose levels in patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) on multiple injection therapy. However, young children may not tolerate such intensive insulin regimens. We investigated the effects of glargine in various three-injections-daily insulin combinations on 24-h glucose control in prepubertal children.

Methods

Seventeen T1DM prepubertal children (10 boys), median age 10.2 years (range 6.0–12.4), glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) 8.8% (6.8–11.5) were recruited to a randomized, open-label, cross-over study. After a 2-week run-in period (with NPH pre-bed), every child underwent three different 3-week treatment blocks in random order. All treatment blocks included glargine pre-bed, but used different morning insulins: block 1, soluble only; block 2, soluble + NPH; block 3, aspart + NPH. Continuous glucose monitoring was performed for 3 days at the end of the run-in and each treatment block.

Results

Compared with the run-in period on NPH, the three glargine treatment blocks were associated with lower (P < 0.0001) and less variable (P < 0.05) pre-breakfast glucose levels, and with an 8–15% reduction in total daily insulin dose (P < 0.0001). Risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia detected by continuous glucose monitoring varied significantly between the three glargine treatment blocks, and was lowest when children were given aspart + NPH in the morning (block 3).

Conclusion

Insulin glargine pre-bed can be used in three-injections-daily regimens in prepubertal children to lower and stabilize pre-breakfast glucose levels. However, to avoid the risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia, the pre-bed glargine dose should be lowered by giving a further long-acting insulin, such as NPH, in the morning.

### Insulin analogues: a critical view on their future [^115W4VYK]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2008). Low credibility.

Insulin analogues represent a class of insulin formulations with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The introduction of rapid-acting and long-acting insulin analogues into the market in the last decade has helped optimize metabolic control in patients with diabetes. Unfortunately, the number of good randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) that fulfill rigid criteria brought up by evidence-based medicine is low. The consequence is that reimbursement has become an issue, at least in some European countries. In addition to some principal questions about the validity of RCTs to provide the best possible evidence for each and every clinically relevant question, one wonders about the end points of such studies. Other end points, may they be long-term end points such as morbidity and mortality or other short-term end points such as variability in blood glucose levels, are probably more relevant for patients with diabetes. The question is who will fund new clinical studies? From my point of view we will have to start over again on this topic, employing a fresh look on this story. Discussing old data and strategies over and over again will not provide us with the answers needed for the (critical!) evaluation of new diagnostic and therapeutic development.

Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The requirement to inject current basal insulin analogs at a fixed time each day may complicate adherence and compromise glycemic control. This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of varying the daily injection time of insulin degludec (IDeg), an ultra-long-acting basal insulin.

Research Design and Methods

This 26-week, open-label, treat-to-target trial enrolled adults (≥ 18 years) with type 2 diabetes who were either insulin naïve and receiving oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (HbA(1c) = 7–11%) or previously on basal insulin ± OAD(s) (HbA(1c) = 7–10%). Participants were randomized to 1) once-daily (OD) IDeg in a prespecified dosing schedule, creating 8-40-h intervals between injections (IDeg OD Flex; n = 229); 2) once-daily IDeg at the main evening meal (IDeg OD; n = 228); or 3) once-daily insulin glargine at the same time each day (IGlar OD; n = 230). The primary outcome was noninferiority of IDeg OD Flex to IGlar OD in HbA(1c) reduction after 26 weeks.

Results

After 26 weeks, IDeg OD Flex, IDeg OD, and IGlar OD improved HbA(1c) by 1.28, 1.07, and 1.26% points, respectively (estimated treatment difference [IDeg OD Flex - IGlar OD]: 0.04% points [-0.12 to 0.20], confirming noninferiority). No statistically significant differences in overall or nocturnal hypoglycemia were found between IDeg OD Flex and IGlar OD. Comparable glycemic control and rates of hypoglycemia were seen with IDeg OD Flex and IDeg OD. Adverse event profiles were similar across groups.

Conclusions

The use of extreme dosing intervals of 8–40 h demonstrates that the daily injection time of IDeg can be varied without compromising glycemic control or safety.

### An overview of insulin therapy for the non-specialist [^112FmQ2N]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Insulin therapy background

It is more important to glucose control, and thus to long‐term health outcomes, that the type(s) of insulin prescribed is properly dosed and titrated, than which of the myriad choices of marketed preparations is deployed. This is particularly true in T2DM in the overweight majority where insulin therapy is, at least in the first years after it is started, supplementary to considerable continuing pancreatic secretion. Crudely someone requiring a modest dose of basal insulin alone (say 50–60 U/day) will be still secreting 100–200 U/day, and, while islet regulation of that will be defective, it will still increase and decrease according to circulating glucose concentrations. This will partly buffer any 'error' in exogenous insulin dosing, day‐to‐day changes in insulin sensitivity, or variation in subcutaneous insulin absorption, provided enough injected insulin is being taken. This partly explains why hypoglycaemia is much less problem in those with the overweight insulin‐resistant phenotype, but also why it has been difficult to show improved control with modern basal insulins of more appropriate diurnal plasma profiles compared to historical intermediate‐acting insulins in treat‐to‐target clinical trials.

2.3 Basal insulin therapy

NPH insulin was described in 1946, and made available that decade. While extended‐acting, it quickly became clear from clinical experience in T1DM that its profile of action was well under 24 h, while from the 1980s the large extent of the discrepancy, with a hump of absorption at 4–6 h waning to nothing beyond 12–14 h, was described experimentally. Compared to the newer true long‐acting analogues (insulin detemir and insulin glargine), introduced this current century, this problem leads to higher risk of hypoglycaemia (Figure 2). Accordingly, and with once‐daily administration given at bed‐time, these analogues, where affordable, came to replace NPH insulin. Indeed insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla‐100) has come to dominate the basal insulin market (insulin detemir is being withdrawn in some markets), and even remains a standard against which novel basal insulins (such as once weekly) are compared for regulatory purposes.

7.2 Basal insulin

When using injections for insulin treatment, the unique diurnal pattern of insulin requirements in preschool children should be taken into consideration in designing an individualized basal dosing scheme. The low insulin requirement and tendency toward low glucose levels are often most obvious during the night and especially between 3 and 6 AM. Preschool children often need much more insulin late in the evening between 9 PM and 12 AM and the overnight insulin needs are variable from night to night. This creates typical patterns when designing basal insulin dosing plans. If basal analogs are used one should consider their action profile in relationship to insulin requirements.

The low body weight and thus low total insulin dose demands special consideration when using commercially available insulin pumps and insulin preparations, especially in children with a body weight below 5–10 kg. Sometimes very small doses necessitate dilution of U‐100 insulin, or an intermittent basal rate of 0 U/h for limited periods, i.e. every second hour during the night. These approaches may help to meet the needs of the young child's insulin treatment and must be carefully discussed (with advantages and disadvantages) with the primary caregivers so that they are informed of the benefits and risks of the chosen strategy. Insulin should always be prescribed and documented in normal units to avoid hazardous misunderstandings regarding insulin dosing, especially if the child using diluted insulin is admitted to hospital. Any pump containing diluted insulin should be labeled with information regarding the currently contained concentration of insulin.

A glucose and meal‐adjusted basal‐bolus insulin regimen (delivered by injections or pump) requires that basal insulin delivery be fine‐tuned by the caregivers in accordance with the child's current insulin sensitivity. Preschool children have a higher day‐to‐day variation in insulin needs than older children. Insulin sensitivity can be increased after very active days, such as a days at the beach or in the snow, or after a day playing with friends. The overnight long‐acting insulin or basal rate might then be reduced by 10% to 30%. Insulin sensitivity can be markedly reduced (increased insulin resistance), for example, during fever when the long‐ acting insulin or basal rate might need to be increased by 20% to 100% according to glucose levels. Under these circumstances, glucose levels must be carefully monitored and caregivers need constant (24 hour per day/365 days per year) access to support from the diabetes team.

### Effects of shifting from twice daily insulin glargine or… [^114Hz1VB]. ClinicalTrials (2015). Low credibility.

Study Overview Rationale. Degludec is a longer-acting insulin analog compared to glargine and detemir. In a fraction of type 1 diabetic patients, insulin glargine and insulin detemir may not achieve 24h coverage, reflected by raising pre-dinner glucose levels when they are administered at bedtime. As up-titration of bedtime long acting insulin increases risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia, this clinical problem can be addressed by an additional injection of in the morning. These type 1 diabetic patients may benefit from shifting from twice daily insulin glargine/detemir to once daily insulin degludec, which shows an extended activity over 24h, up to 48h. Ideally the long-acting insulin should ensure a duration of 24 hours and be administered once a day. Long acting insulin analogues glargine and detemir are being used in type 1 diabetes. Clinical experience suggests that in a certain percentage of patients with type 1 diabetes, when administered at bedtime, both glargine and detemir have a duration of less than 24 hours, which is manifested by an increase in blood glucose during the late afternoon resulting in pre-dinner hyperglycaemia, a phenomenon that plays regularly on different days or may be inconsistent owing to day-by-day variations in absorption. Possible approaches to address the sunset phenomenon include: the control of capillary BG at h16. 00–17: 00 with eventual administration of an extra shots of rapid-acting insulin to correct the tendency to hyperglycaemia; the use of a second long-acting insulin injection in addition to that of the evening; the replacement of the ultra-fast insulin at lunch with a pre-mixed insulin containing a mix of rapid-acting and protamine-bound intermediate-acting insulin; and the transition to insulin pump therapy.

In phase 3 clinical trials involving patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin degludec showed similar glycaemic control in terms of HbA1c, but with a significant reduction in hypoglycaemia rates, especially at night, compared to glargine. This can also be explained by the lower day-to-day within-subject variability rate of insulin degludec respect to glargine.

### Insulin glargine [^112xoUs5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

In diabetes mellitus, the clinical goal of intensive glycemic control (lowering blood glucose concentrations to normal or near-normal levels) has been hindered by the lack of insulin regimens that duplicate the basal-bolus secretion of insulin by the healthy pancreas. In particular, intensive therapy has been associated with a risk of hypoglycemia.

Objective

This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, dosing guidelines, adverse effects, and potential drug interactions of insulin glargine, a new long-acting recombinant human insulin analogue. Results of clinical trials of its efficacy and tolerability as a basal insulin in the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are summarized.

Methods

Primary research and review articles on insulin glargine were identified through a search of MEDLINE from 1966 to July 2001. Abstracts were identified through a search of the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science from 1995 to July 2001 and proceedings of American Diabetes Association scientific meetings. Additional information was obtained from the product information for insulin glargine. All identified articles and abstracts were evaluated for relevance, and all relevant information was included in the review. Priority was given to data from the primary medical literature.

Results

Insulin glargine has a slower onset of action than human neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, a longer duration of action (up to 24 hours), and no pronounced peak. It has similar tolerability and produces similar glycemic control to once- or twice-daily human NPH insulin, with a similar glucose-lowering effect on a molar basis. A decreased incidence of hypoglycemia, particularly at night, has been reported with insulin glargine compared with human NPH insulin. Insulin glargine appears to be comparable to human NPH insulin in terms of toxicity, adverse effects, immunogenicity, and potential for drug interactions. Results of clinical trials of insulin glargine in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes support its use in combination with a short-acting insulin, insulin lispro, or oral antidiabetic medications. Although insulin glargine cannot be mixed with other insulin preparations, it has the potential convenience of providing basal insulin with once-daily bedtime dosing.

Conclusions

Based on the as yet small amount of data from full clinical study reports in peer-reviewed publications, insulin glargine appears to be a well-tolerated and effective basal insulin preparation for patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (including pediatric patients). Its delayed onset of action and prolonged, flat time-action profile mimic the action of endogenous basal insulin (or an insulin pump), decreasing the risk of hypoglycemic episodes. Insulin glargine may be a useful new option for meeting overnight insulin requirements, although most patients will require a rapid-acting insulin such as insulin lispro with or before meals for optimal management of blood glucose levels.

HUMAN INSULIN AND ITS ANALOGS

Insulin therapy with the conventional mealtime and basal insulin preparations has many shortcomings. First, the absorption of regular human insulin from the subcutaneous tissue is slow, and the metabolic action takes effect only 30–60 min after injection and peaks after 2–3 h. Consequently, treatment with regular insulin is associated with postmeal hyperglycemia and an increased risk of late-postprandial hypoglycemia. Second, the conventional basal NPH insulin has a distinct peak glucose-lowering effect, has a duration of action considerably shorter than 24 h, and is absorbed from the subcutaneous tissue at variable rates. These pharmacodynamic limitations predispose users to elevated glucose levels before breakfast and nocturnal hypoglycemia. To overcome these difficulties, insulin analogs with a modified amino acid sequence from the human insulin molecule were developed. The three rapid-acting analogs (aspart, glulisine, lispro) are absorbed more quickly than regular insulin because of reduced self-association. Their onset of action is within 15 min after subcutaneous injection, and they have a faster and greater peak action. Insulin glargine, the first long-acting insulin analog to reach the market, was initially proclaimed to have the ideal "peakless", nearly 24-h duration of action. However, these initial pharmacodynamic studies raised some criticism, and it should be concluded that there is no such thing as a "peakless" insulin preparation. Nevertheless, both long-acting insulin analogs (detemir and glargine) have a limited peak effect and a longer mean duration of action compared with NPH insulin (with glargine having a slightly longer action than detemir).

It was expected that the rapid-acting and long-acting analogs, which more closely approximate physiological insulin secretion, would confer important clinical benefits. With respect to type 2 diabetes, the topic of this review, it is important to note that most patients with type 2 diabetes have residual endogenous insulin secretion in the context of insulin resistance. Therefore, the rationale for imitating the insulin secretion pattern of human physiology is less convincing than in type 1 diabetes. Indeed, in patients with type 2 diabetes, the rapid-acting analogs were not found to be superior to regular insulin in reducing A1C levels or rates of overall hypoglycemia. The clinical benefits of the long-acting insulin analogs compared with NPH insulin are limited to a reduction in (nocturnal) hypoglycemia.

### Better glycemic control and weight loss with the novel long-acting basal insulin LY2605541 compared with insulin glargine in type 1 diabetes: a randomized, crossover study [^115vvqzQ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The primary objective of this crossover Phase 2 study was to compare the effect of two basal insulins, LY2605541 and GL, on mean BG of 8-point SMBG profiles after 8 weeks of treatment when used in basal-bolus insulin regimens in patients with type 1 diabetes. Mean BG was chosen rather than A1C because of the short duration of the study and the likelihood of a carryover effect in A1C. The study demonstrated LY2605541 was noninferior and superior to GL in achieving a lower mean BG after 8 weeks of treatment. LY2605541 also reduced A1C more than GL. Both sequence groups completed the study with mean values at or near guideline-recommended treatment goals for A1C, which attests to the robustness of study implementation.

In addition to improved glycemic control, LY2605541 achieved lower interday and intraday glycemic variability compared with GL, possibly due to its longer duration and a lower peak-to-trough ratio compared with GL. These basal insulins were both administered before breakfast to compare the effect of their duration on fasting glucose. We anticipated that differences in fasting glycemia might be demonstrated because of difference in duration of action, but this was not observed in the fasting glucose from SMBG profiles.

The molar amount of LY2605541 equivalent to 1 unit of insulin was not known before this study. Because the final dose of LY2605541 in nanomoles per kilogram was empirically determined in this trial, and FBG from SMBG was similar between LY2605541 and GL after 8 weeks, the ratio of the basal insulin doses in nanomoles per kilogram at 8 weeks can be used as a reasonable dose conversion factor. This conversion indicates that 9 nmol LY2605541 has approximately the same effect on glycemic measures as 1 unit of insulin glargine. Similar results were seen in the type 2 diabetes trial. Thus, for Phase 3 trials, LY2605541 will be formulated at 900 nmol/mL to achieve a U-100 concentration.

The difference in laboratory fasting plasma glucose between treatments in this trial is likely to be artificial and not representative of the patient's glycemic pattern because these measurements were obtained later in the morning (∼90 min after the recorded timing of the home-based SMBG FBG values). These laboratory measures were therefore typically obtained more than 24 h after the previous basal insulin dose and would not be representative of the patient's routine, but they do suggest a longer glucose-lowering action of LY2605541.

### Basal insulin analogues in the management of diabetes mellitus: what progress have we made? [^112acZtU]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Insulin remains the most effective and consistent means of controlling blood glucose levels in diabetes. Since 1946, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) has been the predominant basal insulin in clinical use. However, absorption is variable due to the need for resuspension and the time-action profile (peak activity 4-6h after subcutaneous administration) confers an increased propensity for between-meal and nocturnal hypoglycaemia. In the 1980s, recombinant DNA technology enabled modifications to the insulin molecule resulting in the soluble long-acting insulin analogues, glargine and detemir. Both exhibit a lower risk of hypoglycaemia compared with neutral protamine Hagedorn due to improved time-action profiles and reduced day-to-day glucose variability. Glargine is indicated for administration once daily and detemir once or twice daily. Degludec is the latest prolonged-acting insulin which forms long subcutaneous multi-hexamers that delay absorption. Recent phase III trials in type 1 and type 2 diabetes show that degludec was non-inferior to comparators (predominantly glargine) with a minimal although inconsistent reduction in overall hypoglycaemia and a small absolute difference in nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Newer developmental agents include LY2605541 and glargine U300. LY2605541 comprises insulin lispro combined with polyethylene glycol, thereby increasing its hydrodynamic size and retarding absorption from the subcutaneous tissue. Glargine U300 is a new formulation of glargine resulting in a flatter and more prolonged time-action profile than its predecessor. This article reviews recent advances in basal insulin analogues, including a critical appraisal of the degludec trials.

1 INTRODUCTION

Basal insulin is an essential component of the management strategy for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), 1 and is often required when lifestyle interventions and non‐insulin glucose‐lowering agents fail to achieve target glycaemic control. However, basal insulin treatment is often delayed, and/or dose titration is not optimized, resulting in poor glucose control despite initiation of insulin. Studies have identified fear of hypoglycaemia as one of the dominant reasons for suboptimal use of basal insulin. 2 Hypoglycaemic events often occur at night, when warning symptoms are physiologically blunted, and may result in both acute and long‐term clinical consequences. 3 As such, these nocturnal events elicit fear, in both the individuals with T2DM and the healthcare practitioners. Long‐acting basal insulin analogues have been developed to deliver constant and predictable glucose‐lowering effects over 24 hours, providing improved glycaemic control and reduced risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia because of a rather flat pharmacodynamic (PD) profile. 4

Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla‐300) has more stable and prolonged pharmacokinetic (PK) and PD profiles than insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla‐100). 5 The EDITION treat‐to‐target clinical trials showed that the improved PK and PD properties of Gla‐300 translate into clinical benefits such as glycaemic control equivalent to that of Gla‐100 with less hypoglycaemia in individuals with T2DM, primarily, but not exclusively, at night (defined as 0:00–05:59). 6, 7, 8

The value of extending time intervals beyond 00:00–5:59when assessing nocturnal hypoglycaemia has been shown in a patient‐level meta‐analysis of the global EDITION trials in T2DM (EDITION 1, 2 and 3), in which a clinically defined window from 10:00to the time of pre‐breakfast self‐monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) measurement (median, 7:30) resulted in the inclusion of many more hypoglycaemic events compared to the predefined 0:00–5:59window, and confirmed a clinically relevant reduction in the risk of hypoglycaemia with Gla‐300 during the overnight fasting period. 9 However, the EDITION 1 trial 7 examined individuals using prandial insulin in addition to basal insulin; thus, the results may not be specifically attributed to basal insulin alone.

### Glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia during 12 months of randomized treatment with insulin glargine 300 U / mL versus glargine 100 U / mL in people with type 1 diabetes (EDITION 4) [^1126Hf2u]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The difficulty in interpreting morning and evening profiles illustrates a study limitation, namely, that the double comparison (two insulins, and morning versus evening) results in relatively small individual populations (~140 people); consequently, each show relatively variable glucose profiles (Figure 1), particularly for laboratory‐measured clinic FPG and SMPG profiles. That said, for Gla‐300, which is expected from pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies, and notably from a CGM study, to be a true ≥ 24‐hour insulin, 7, 16, 18 there should be no difference in glucose‐related outcomes between morning and evening. Any trend in morning injection control being better than that with evening injections could be explained by the higher dose used by the morning group.

Hypoglycaemia risks and rates did not differ between the 2 study insulins in any of the measures analysed (nocturnal/any time of day, confirmed or severe/documented symptomatic, thresholds of ≤ 3.9 or < 3.0 mmol/L, severe alone) (Table 2). However, as is usual in this type of trial, EDITION 4 was not powered to detect differences in hypoglycaemia. Numerical differences in anytime (24 hours) severe hypoglycaemia event rates, which do not approach statistical significance, can be explained by the fact that 1 participant in the Gla‐300 group reported 42 severe daytime events during the extension period. Cumulative event curves support the rate ratio data in revealing no differences between Gla‐300 and Gla‐100, but there is a trend to divergence of anytime events in the second 6‐month period, which needs further study (Figure 2). These findings differ from those of the EDITION JP 1 study, which investigated evening basal insulin injections; in that study Gla‐300 was associated with a lower risk and rate of nocturnal (0:00–05:59) confirmed (< 3.0 mmol/L [< 54 mg/dL]) or severe hypoglycaemia vs Gla‐100. 15 They also differ from results with another long‐acting insulin (insulin degludec) in T1DM when given as an evening injection, which show lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with insulin degludec vs Gla‐100. 19, 20 However, of note, a trial‐level meta‐analysis of degludec and Gla‐100 in T2DM suggests less reduction in HbA1c with degludec. 21 When Gla‐300 is used in T2DM, an advantage over Gla‐100 was found, both in the basal plus meal‐time study to 1 year, 8 and in the patient‐level meta‐analysis of 3 international studies in T2DM. 22 In both the present study and the degludec studies, nocturnal hypoglycaemia rates remain clinically important even with the new insulins, emphasizing that flat true ≥ 24‐hour insulin profiles still suffer from lack of the minute‐to‐minute control of insulin delivery that is needed physiologically to eliminate the risk of hypoglycaemia. 23

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113C6zMr]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes prandial insulin timing and education: Postprandial glucose excursions are best managed by a well-timed injection or inhalation of prandial insulin. Prandial insulin should ideally be administered prior to meal consumption; however, the optimal time to administer varies based on the pharmacokinetics of the formulation (regular, RAA, or inhaled), the premeal blood glucose level, and carbohydrate consumption. Thus, education on how to adjust prandial insulin to account for nutrition intake and the correction dose based on premeal glucose levels, anticipated activity, and sick-day management can be effective and should be offered to most individuals.

### Bedtime snacking and glycemic deterioration in young children with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily injections: a randomized controlled crossover trial [^114DrhAp]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results have an important clinical implication, especially in cases of fear of hypoglycemia. Fear of hypoglycemia in parents frequently leads to bedtime snacking to avoid nocturnal hypoglycemia. In this regard, encouragement of parents to avoid bedtime snacking may lower nocturnal hyperglycemia and help to achieve glycemic targets.

Previous clinical studies investigated the changing insulin needs of young children at different times of the day. Insulin requirement decreases in the morning (between 03.00–06.00 a.m.) and increases in the first half of the night (between 09.00 p.m.–12.00 a.m.), especially in our study age group. MDI therapy does not allow flexibility for basal insulin and leads parents to give bedtime snacking to children to avoid nocturnal hypoglycemia. However, our results showed that 10 grams of carbohydrates before bedtime caused nocturnal hyperglycemia even if children started their night in the target range. The timing of night snacking in our study is concurrent with the reverse dawn phenomenon timing, which may have exaggerated the hyperglycemia. Conversely, the peak of intermediate-acting insulin was concurrent with the timing of reduced insulin need between 3.00–6.00 a.m. which made people more susceptible to nocturnal hypoglycemia. The transition from intermediate-acting insulin to long-acting insulin decreased this susceptibility. Ultra-long-acting insulins have less peak effect, which may reduce the risk even further compared to insulin glargine and detemir. Thus, decreased susceptibility for hypoglycemia with newer insulins also reduced the need for prophylactic bedtime snacking. Two hypoglycemia events in the late period of control days may be due to this susceptibility; however, hypoglycemia events were infrequent, and snacking resulted in worse glycemic outcomes. Future studies should investigate the effects of bedtime snacks in children using second-generation basal insulin to clarify this issue.

### Plasma insulin profiles after subcutaneous injection: how close can we get to physiology in people with diabetes? [^116FoKwg]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Many people with diabetes rely on insulin therapy to achieve optimal blood glucose control. A fundamental aim of such therapy is to mimic the pattern of 'normal' physiological insulin secretion, thereby controlling basal and meal-time plasma glucose and fatty acid turnover. In people without diabetes, insulin release is modulated on a time base of 3–10 min, something that is impossible to replicate without intravascular glucose sensing and insulin delivery. Overnight physiological insulin delivery by islet β cells is unchanging, in contrast to requirements once any degree of hyperglycaemia occurs, when diurnal influences are evident. Subcutaneous pumped insulin or injected insulin analogues can approach the physiological profile, but there remains the challenge of responding to day-to-day changes in insulin sensitivity. Physiologically, meal-time insulin release begins rapidly in response to reflex activity and incretins, continuing with the rise in glucose and amino acid concentrations. This rapid response reflects the need to fill the insulin space with maximum concentration as early as 30 min after starting the meal. Current meal-time insulins, by contrast, are associated with a delay after injection before absorption begins, and a delay to peak because of tissue diffusion. While decay from peak for monomeric analogues is not dissimilar to average physiological needs, changes in meal type and, again, in day-to-day insulin sensitivity, are difficult to match. Recent and current developments in insulin depot technology are moving towards establishing flatter basal and closer-to-average physiological meal-time plasma insulin profiles. The present article discusses the ideal physiological insulin profile, how this can be met by available and future insulin therapies and devices, and the challenges faced by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes in trying to achieve an optimum plasma insulin profile.

Introduction

Basal–bolus insulin therapy in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) aims to mimic the endogenous insulin secretion profile in healthy individuals and has been shown to improve glycaemic control and reduce the risk of long-term complications. Despite these advantages, the focus on decreasing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in people with T1DM also presents the risk of increased rates of hypoglycaemia, leading to impaired hypoglycaemia awarenessaffecting many aspects of patient well-being that can reduce treatment adherence and lead to suboptimal glycaemic control–. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia can impair quality of sleep, increase fatigue and cause morning headaches. Moreover, people with T1DM have impaired plasma epinephrine responses to hypoglycaemia, with an increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia, especially during sleep. Basal insulin analogues have been developed to provide a long duration of action to cover insulin requirements over an extended period of time while providing a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. Insulin detemir (IDet) and insulin glargine (IGlar) are basal insulin analogues that have shown a longer duration of action and a decreased risk of hypoglycaemia, particularly nocturnal, compared to neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin–. IDet and IGlar have similar time–action profilesand produce similar levels of glycaemic control, but IDet is associated with less variability in plasma glucose (PG) than both IGlar and NPH insulin. Insulin degludec (IDeg) is a novel basal insulin with an ultra-long, flat and stable action profile. Upon subcutaneous injection, IDeg forms soluble multihexamers that slowly and steadily dissociate and release insulin monomers into the circulation. This results in a stable and consistent glucose-lowering effect of > 42 h at steady state–and lower rates of hypoglycaemia than IGlar–. In this BEGIN Basal–bolus Type 1 trial being part of the phase 3a programme for IDeg, we compared the efficacy and safety of IDeg with IDet, both administered once daily (OD) in a basal–bolus regimen with rapid-acting insulin aspart (IAsp) as mealtime insulin in participants with T1DM.

### Novel insulins: expanding options in diabetes management [^116sMxbm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus with intensive insulin therapy usually includes an intermediate- or long-acting basal component for between-meal and nocturnal glycemic control, together with preprandial bolus injections of a short-acting insulin for control of meal-stimulated increases in serum glucose levels. Although the ideal basal/bolus insulin combination has yet to be found, recent developments may provide safer and more effective options. Two new short-acting semisynthetic analogs — insulin lispro and insulin aspart — can be administered as preprandial bolus injections closer to mealtime than regular human insulin, thereby synchronizing insulin administration and food absorption. In clinical trials, postprandial increases in blood glucose levels were significantly less after treatment with insulin lispro or insulin aspart than with premeal regular insulin. Because of their short duration of action, a slightly greater basal insulin supply may be needed when insulin lispro or insulin aspart is used. Inhalation devices for aerosolized regular human insulin offer another alternative to premeal subcutaneous bolus injections. Inhaled insulin is absorbed more rapidly than subcutaneous regular insulin and may therefore be given closer to mealtime. For basal therapy, insulin glargine, a new long-acting analog, is absorbed more slowly after subcutaneous administration than are conventional neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) and ultralente insulin, and has a relatively flat metabolic effect. Clinical trials indicate that insulin glargine is at least as effective as NPH insulin and ultralente insulin, and is associated with a reduced risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Other long-acting analogs, such as fatty acid acylated insulins, have been tested in animal models and are being evaluated in clinical studies.
