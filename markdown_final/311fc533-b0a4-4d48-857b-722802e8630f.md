Atrial fibrillation

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about atrial fibrillation management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and initial assessment. Then, I should classify AF subtype and stage to frame prognosis and therapy. Next, I will assess stroke risk and anticoagulation, followed by deciding on rate versus rhythm control. After that, I need to plan cardioversion logistics and pericardioversion anticoagulation. I will then address risk factor modification and lifestyle interventions, consider special populations, and finally implement follow-up, monitoring, and quality metrics, ensuring shared decision-making throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and establish the clinical context. AF diagnosis requires ECG documentation of irregularly irregular R-R intervals without discrete P waves; I should verify with a 12-lead ECG when possible, and if the rhythm is intermittent, use ambulatory monitoring or validated consumer ECG devices, while remembering that device-detected atrial high-rate episodes must be visually confirmed to avoid artifact misclassification [^115TqNfz] [^117Ubkyr]. I need to check the initial workup for reversible precipitants and structural contributors: obtain labs including thyroid, renal, and hepatic function; perform transthoracic echocardiography to assess left atrial size, left ventricular function, and valves; and consider chest radiography if pulmonary disease is suspected, as this shapes both anticoagulation and rhythm strategy decisions [^115TCGPH] [^115BnwJb]. Hold on, I should verify symptom burden and hemodynamic status because instability mandates urgent electrical cardioversion irrespective of anticoagulation status, whereas stable patients allow for a more deliberate plan [^112AkTaH].

> Next, I should review AF classification and staging to align therapy with disease progression. The updated ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS framework moves beyond duration-only labels to a stage-based model: Stage 1 (risk), Stage 2 (pre-AF), Stage 3A (paroxysmal), 3B (persistent), 3C (long-standing persistent), and 3D (successful ablation), with "permanent AF" denoting a mutual decision to cease rhythm-control attempts; this staging supports earlier risk factor modification and targeted interventions rather than reactive care [^113a3fa2] [^112iqC5q]. Wait, let me verify that I am not conflating paroxysmal with low risk; even paroxysmal AF carries stroke risk and warrants guideline-directed stroke prevention when indicated, so I should not under-treat based on episodic duration alone [^114zYr9z].

> I will now examine stroke and systemic embolism risk using CHA2DS2-VASc, and I need to ensure I apply sex-specific thresholds correctly. For men with score ≥ 2 and women with score ≥ 3, anticoagulation is recommended; for men with score 1 and women with score 2, anticoagulation is reasonable after shared decision-making that considers AF burden, blood pressure, and other modifiers, and aspirin monotherapy should be avoided for stroke prevention in AF without another indication [^114zYr9z] [^116dxXfR]. Hold on, I should verify bleeding risk assessment; while HAS-BLED should not be used to deny anticoagulation in high stroke-risk patients, it helps identify modifiable bleeding risks and guide mitigation strategies such as blood pressure control and minimizing interacting medications [^115GsRLJ] [^113dzXfy]. I need to check agent selection next; for nonvalvular AF, DOACs are preferred over warfarin when not contraindicated, with attention to renal and hepatic function, drug–drug interactions, and avoidance of non–evidence-based dosing to prevent thrombosis or bleeding [^114zYr9z] [^117CMVg2].

> Now, I should decide on rate versus rhythm control, and I must not jump to conclusions based on historical dogma. Historically, AFFIRM and RACE suggested no mortality advantage to rhythm control, but wait, let me reconsider in light of contemporary evidence; recent data and guidelines support an early rhythm-control approach in selected patients to reduce AF progression, hospitalizations, and possibly adverse outcomes, especially in newly diagnosed AF, symptomatic patients, or those with heart failure, while rate control remains appropriate for older, minimally symptomatic patients or when rhythm therapy is unsuitable [^1133Nt8V] [^113TQQor] [^111noMow]. I should confirm patient-specific factors that tilt the balance: younger age, shorter AF duration, higher symptom burden, and patient preference favor rhythm control, whereas older age, longer AF duration, and fewer symptoms favor rate control, all within a shared decision-making framework [^114aKSkj] [^113EdKv5].

> For rate control, let me think about targets and agents. I should aim for a lenient resting heart rate target around < 100–110 bpm in most patients unless symptoms persist or heart failure is present, in which case stricter targets may be needed; beta-blockers are first-line, with nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as alternatives when beta-blockers are contraindicated or insufficient, and digoxin reserved for sedentary patients or as adjunctive therapy due to limited efficacy with exertion [^115TCGPH]. Wait, I should double-check for contraindications such as decompensated heart failure with low EF before using calcium channel blockers and ensure I titrate to symptom relief and objective measures rather than a single rigid number [^115TCGPH].

> For rhythm control, I need to ensure safe pharmacologic and procedural choices. Electrical cardioversion is the most effective acute method and is first-line in hemodynamic instability; in stable patients, both electrical and pharmacologic cardioversion are acceptable, with electrical conversion achieving higher success but requiring sedation, and antiarrhythmic pretreatment can reduce early recurrence in susceptible patients [^114z1UZd] [^11181GGm]. For drug therapy, I should select agents based on structural heart disease: flecainide or propafenone for structurally normal hearts, and amiodarone, sotalol, or dofetilide for significant LV dysfunction or CAD; I must screen for QT prolongation and drug interactions, and consider catheter ablation when antiarrhythmic drugs fail or are not tolerated, especially in heart failure where ablation improves outcomes [^115TCGPH] [^113NEQ5v]. Hold on, I should verify pericardioversion anticoagulation logistics before any strategy is finalized [^111XyJA1].

> Pericardioversion anticoagulation is critical, and I should confirm duration and imaging pathways. If AF duration is ≥ 48 hours or unknown, I need either ≥ 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation before cardioversion or a TEE to exclude left atrial appendage thrombus, followed by ≥ 4 weeks of anticoagulation after cardioversion due to transient atrial mechanical stunning; for AF clearly < 48 hours, cardioversion without prolonged precardioversion anticoagulation may be reasonable in low-risk patients, but I should individualize based on thromboembolic risk and consider TEE even in shorter episodes when risk is elevated [^111XyJA1] [^111tGoXH]. Wait, let me verify that uninterrupted DOAC therapy is acceptable; yes, uninterrupted DOACs or warfarin with therapeutic INR are appropriate around cardioversion when feasible, aligning with contemporary practice [^111tGoXH].

> Next, I should review comprehensive risk factor modification because it meaningfully alters AF burden and progression. I need to ensure aggressive management of hypertension, diabetes, obesity with weight loss, sleep apnea screening and treatment, alcohol moderation, smoking cessation, and regular exercise, as these interventions reduce AF recurrence and improve quality of life; nurse-led or integrated AF clinics can operationalize this care and improve adherence and outcomes [^116NqtUk] [^115AV2EW]. Hold on, I should verify that guideline-directed therapy for concomitant heart failure is optimized, since treating HFrEF with evidence-based meds and devices reduces AF recurrence and improves survival [^notfound].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts. In older adults, I should adopt a geriatric lens: screen for frailty, falls, and polypharmacy, individualize anticoagulation intensity or consider LAA occlusion when bleeding risk is prohibitive, and align rhythm decisions with goals of care and symptom burden rather than pursuing aggressive strategies with limited net benefit [^114oYAkM]. For device-detected subclinical AF or atrial high-rate episodes, I should confirm the diagnosis visually, estimate burden, and consider anticoagulation when stroke risk is high and burden exceeds clinically meaningful thresholds, acknowledging evolving evidence and ongoing trials [^116rAgcG] [^112uMXQY]. In postoperative or acute illness settings, I need to treat precipitants, use beta-blockers first-line for rate control, and reassess the need for long-term anticoagulation after 30–60 days if AF resolves [^116chuoS] [^114uY3B1].

> For follow-up and longitudinal care, I should confirm a structured plan. At 3–6 months, I will reassess symptoms, AF burden with ECG or ambulatory monitoring as indicated, anticoagulation adherence and interactions, and the ongoing need for rate or rhythm control; integrated care pathways and nurse-led clinics can sustain high-quality, guideline-concordant therapy and reduce adverse outcomes over time [^115AV2EW] [^113s277M]. But wait, what if the patient is on warfarin and has fluctuating INRs? I need to check for interacting drugs, variable vitamin K intake, and consider switching to a DOAC when appropriate to improve time in therapeutic range and reduce complications [^117CMVg2].

> Finally, I should double-check that my approach aligns with quality indicators and shared decision-making. Documenting modifiable risk factors and actions taken, using validated decision aids for stroke prevention, and tracking time in therapeutic range for warfarin are concrete steps that improve care quality and patient engagement; I must also ensure equitable care across sex, gender, race, and socioeconomic strata, embedding SDM at every decision point [^116PxmAs] [^117FxfZi] [^111dwEui]. Hold on, I should verify that my recommendations reflect current guideline hierarchies; using COR/LOE consistently and citing contemporary ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS and ESC guidance keeps the plan evidence-based and transparent [^1129YQiL] [^111fCrwf].

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia [^117L1gsV], characterized by irregular atrial activity and loss of atrial contraction, which increases the risk of stroke and heart failure [^111xAZtD]. Diagnosis requires ECG confirmation [^117Ubkyr], and initial evaluation includes echocardiography, thyroid function, and renal function tests [^115TCGPH]. Management centers on **stroke prevention with anticoagulation** [^114zYr9z] guided by CHA2DS2-VASc [^113zvGVi], and symptom control via rate or rhythm strategies [^112dBjHq], with early rhythm control considered in selected patients [^113TQQor]. Catheter ablation is appropriate for **symptomatic AF refractory to medication** [^1139pN8w], and risk factor modification (hypertension, obesity, diabetes, alcohol, sleep apnea) is essential to reduce burden and progression [^116NqtUk] [^112QYdgL]. AF increases stroke risk fivefold [^1157CrYK] and is associated with higher mortality and hospitalizations [^111xAZtD]; individualized, guideline-directed care improves outcomes [^111dwEui].

---

## Pathophysiology

AF arises from **electrical remodeling** [^notfound] with atrial fibrosis and dilatation, creating a substrate for reentry and ectopic triggers — often in the pulmonary veins [^notfound]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Electrical remodeling**: shortened atrial refractoriness and action potential duration [^notfound].
- **Structural remodeling**: fibrosis and dilatation promoting reentry [^notfound].
- **Autonomic imbalance**: increased sympathetic tone and vagal withdrawal [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

AF may be asymptomatic or present with:

- **Palpitations**: common symptom [^1157CrYK].
- **Fatigue and dyspnea**: reduced cardiac output [^115TCGPH].
- **Chest pain**: ischemia or angina [^115TCGPH].
- **Dizziness or syncope**: hemodynamic instability [^115HTVUw].
- **Stroke or TIA**: embolic complications [^111Dw8YH].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis requires **ECG confirmation** [^117Ubkyr]; initial evaluation includes:

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| ECG (12-lead or ambulatory) | Confirm AF, assess rhythm, rate, ischemia [^117Ubkyr] |
| Echocardiography | Structural heart disease, LV function, LA size, thrombus [^115BnwJb] |
| Thyroid function tests | Detect hyperthyroidism [^115TCGPH] |
| Renal and hepatic function | Guide anticoagulant dosing [^113NEQ5v] |
| Electrolytes | Identify abnormalities [^115TCGPH] |

---

## Classification

AF is classified by duration and clinical features [^112iqC5q]:

| **Classification** | **Definition** |
|-|-|
| Paroxysmal | Self-terminates within 7 days |
| Persistent | Continuous > 7 days, requiring intervention |
| Long-standing persistent | Continuous ≥ 12 months |
| Permanent | Accepting AF, no rhythm control attempts |
| Subclinical | Device-detected, asymptomatic [^116rAgcG] |

---

## Risk stratification

Stroke risk is assessed using **CHA2DS2-VASc** [^115GsRLJ], and bleeding risk with HAS-BLED [^113NEQ5v]. CHA2DS2-VASc assigns points for congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (2), diabetes, stroke/TIA/thromboembolism (2), vascular disease, age 65–74, and sex category (female), with higher scores indicating greater stroke risk and a stronger indication for anticoagulation [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Stroke prevention

Anticoagulation is recommended for **CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women** [^114zYr9z]; for intermediate risk (1 in men, 2 in women), anticoagulation is reasonable [^114sKXey]. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over warfarin in nonvalvular AF [^114zYr9z]. Left atrial appendage occlusion is considered for patients with contraindications to long-term anticoagulation [^113NEQ5v].

---

### Rate control

Rate control is appropriate for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients, older adults, or when rhythm control is not feasible [^114aKSkj]. Target heart rate is typically **< 80 bpm at rest** or **< 110 bpm in selected patients** [^notfound]. Agents include beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and digoxin [^116XDtfT].

---

### Rhythm control

Rhythm control is indicated for symptomatic patients, younger patients, or those with heart failure [^111noMow]. Options include **antiarrhythmic drugs** (amiodarone, flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, dofetilide) [^116XDtfT] and **catheter ablation**, which is effective for symptomatic AF refractory to medication [^115TCGPH].

---

## Complications

AF is associated with significant complications:

- **Stroke**: fivefold increased risk [^1157CrYK].
- **Heart failure**: increased incidence and exacerbations [^116sNzgF].
- **Mortality**: higher all-cause mortality [^116sNzgF].
- **Quality of life**: reduced due to symptoms and complications [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Recent advances include **early rhythm control** strategies [^113TQQor], novel anticoagulants, and improved ablation techniques [^notfound]. Ongoing research explores upstream therapies, personalized medicine, and integrated care models [^111xAZtD].

---

## Patient education and lifestyle modifications

Patient education and lifestyle changes are critical [^114MhcLo]: implement **weight loss**, blood pressure control, diabetes management, alcohol moderation, smoking cessation, and regular exercise to reduce AF burden and progression [^116NqtUk].

---

AF is a common arrhythmia with significant morbidity and mortality [^111xAZtD]. Management focuses on **stroke prevention**, symptom control, and risk factor modification, with individualized care improving outcomes [^111dwEui].

Atrial fibrillation guideline methodology and scope — An initial extensive evidence review was conducted from May 2022 to November 2022, and additional relevant studies, published through November 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered and added to the evidence tables when appropriate. The writing committee consisted of cardiologists, cardiac electrophysiologists, surgeons, pharmacists, and patient representatives/lay stakeholders, and the writing committee included representatives from the ACC, AHA, ACCP, and HRS. This document was approved for publication by the governing bodies of the ACC and the AHA and was endorsed by ACCP and HRS. In developing the "2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation" (2023 atrial fibrillation guideline), the writing committee reviewed previously published guidelines, and Table 1 contains a list of these publications deemed pertinent to this writing effort and is intended for use as a resource, thus obviating the need to repeat existing guideline recommendations. The Class of Recommendation (COR) indicates the strength of recommendation and encompasses the estimated magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk, and the Level of Evidence (LOE) rates the quality of scientific evidence supporting the intervention on the basis of the type, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other sources.

### Management of atrial fibrillation: translating clinical trial data into clinical practice [^115kRx1A]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with significant consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. In light of the limitations of available pharmacologic treatment options (suboptimal efficacy plus safety and tolerability issues), atrial fibrillation management should be individualized based on patient characteristics and comorbidities that could influence response to specific management approaches. The importance of adequate anticoagulation should not be overlooked. This review provides a practical guide for primary care physicians, internists, and cardiologists on current management strategies for atrial fibrillation, based on recent guidelines and current clinical data.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to revise the 2001 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation): developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Heart Rhythm Society [^112dBjHq]. Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Management overview — Management of patients with AF involves 3 objectives — rate control, prevention of thromboembolism, and correction of the rhythm disturbance, and these are not mutually exclusive. The initial management decision involves primarily a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy; under the rate-control strategy, the ventricular rate is controlled with no commitment to restore or maintain sinus rhythm, while the rhythm-control strategy attempts restoration and/or maintenance of sinus rhythm and also requires attention to rate control. Depending on the patient's course, the strategy initially chosen may prove unsuccessful and the alternate strategy is then adopted.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — epidemiology and scope of guideline: AF is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disturbance, increasing in prevalence with age, and it is often associated with structural heart disease, although a substantial proportion of patients with AF have no detectable heart disease; hemodynamic impairment and thromboembolic events related to AF result in significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. These guidelines present a comprehensive review of AF definition, classification, epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and clinical characteristics; review management including prevention of AF, control of heart rate, prevention of thromboembolism, and conversion to and maintenance of sinus rhythm; describe treatment algorithms including pharmacological and nonpharmacological antiarrhythmic approaches and antithrombotic strategies; and are a consensus document that attempts to reconcile evidence and opinion from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.

Atrial fibrillation — classification framework: The previous classification of AF was based only on arrhythmia duration and tended to emphasize AF once diagnosed with a focus on therapeutic interventions, whereas a new proposed classification using stages recognizes AF as a progressive disease requiring different strategies at different stages from prevention to screening to rate and rhythm control therapies. The stages highlight addressing AF at the earliest stages, especially emphasizing prevention, risk factor management, and timing for screening in those at highest risk, and the stages are not mutually exclusive. AF is described as the most common arrhythmia in the world and accounting for significant morbidity and mortality.

### Can we improve outcomes in AF patients by early therapy? [^115Uu71p]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation affects at least 1% of the population and causes marked society-wide morbidity and mortality. Current management of atrial fibrillation including antithrombotic therapy and management of concomitant conditions in all patients, rate control therapy in most patients, and rhythm control therapy in patients with severe atrial fibrillation-related symptoms can alleviate atrial fibrillation-related symptoms but can neither effectively prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation nor suppress atrial fibrillation-related complications. Hence, there is a need for better therapy of atrial fibrillation. The etiology of atrial fibrillation is complex. Most of the causes of atrial fibrillation which are known at present perpetuate themselves in vicious circles, and presence of the arrhythmia by itself causes marked damage of atrial myocardium. These pathophysiological insights suggest that early diagnosis and comprehensive therapy of atrial fibrillation, including adequate therapy of all atrial fibrillation-causing conditions, rate control, and rhythm control therapy, could help to prevent progression of atrial fibrillation and reduce atrial fibrillation-related complications. Such a therapy should make use of safe and effective therapeutic modalities, some of which have become available recently or will become available in the near future. The hypothesis that early diagnosis and early, comprehensive therapy of atrial fibrillation can improve outcomes requires formal testing in controlled trials.

### Integrated care of patients with atrial fibrillation: the 2016 ESC atrial fibrillation guidelines [^111M6fEV]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Integrated AF care aligned with patient needs

Once AF is diagnosed, patients should be offered treatment in five domains:
acute haemodynamic stabilisation in haemodynamically unstable patients (eg, by cardioversion, rate control, circulatory support, etc);
detection and treatment of concomitant cardiovascular conditions;
stroke risk assessment and oral anticoagulation in patients with AF at risk for stroke;
rate control therapy in patients with elevated ventricular rates during AF;
rhythm control therapy in patients who remain symptomatic on rate control therapy.

Optimal management of patients with AF requires input from different medical specialties and professions. Integrated care models should be considered for all patients with AF, supporting shared decision-making and empowering patients to own their care, providing support where needed and giving access to all specialist treatment options when appropriate (figure 1). Such care models will require close cooperation between AF specialists, stroke physicians, AF surgeons, general cardiologists and general practitioners. In addition, continued high-quality care may need further support from allied healthcare professionals, patients, and family members.

### Case studies with the experts: management decisions in atrial fibrillation [^112jtifC]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common outpatient arrhythmia. The recent ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines outline a variety of approaches to the management of AF, but their implementation into clinical practice requires multi-faceted patient evaluations and assessments for optimizing patient care. Using a case-based approach, issues such as rate versus rhythm control, anticoagulation, cardioversion, pharmacological and catheter ablation for maintenance of sinus rhythm, and the pathophysiology of AF are discussed. These data were originally presented at a satellite symposium titled Case Studies with the Experts: Management Decisions in AF, held on May 10, 2007, during the annual Heart Rhythm Society meeting.

### Assessment and management of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation [^116XFhhm]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac dysrhythmia encountered in practice. It is currently estimated that AF affects approximately 2% of the general population; however, the true prevalence of AF is likely to be at least 3%-4%when asymptomatic AF is considered. For clinically apparent AF, the investigations and management are relatively well established. The identification of minimally symptomatic patients is challenging, and furthermore, the optimal management is less certain. Although there is some debate about the ideal treatment pathway for asymptomatic AF, in most cases, the investigations and comprehensive management follow the same recommendations as clinically apparent AF. In contrast, beyond risk factor optimisation, the ideal management of subclinical or device-detected AF remains undefined. The purpose of the current review is to discuss the assessment and management of asymptomatic AF.

### Viewpoint: stroke prevention in recent guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: an appraisal [^113G6AX5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Formal guidelines play an important role in disseminating the best available evidence knowledge and are expected to provide simple and practical recommendations for the most optimal management of patients with various conditions. Such guidelines have important implications for many disease states, which thereby could be more professionally managed in everyday clinical practice by clinicians with divergent educational backgrounds, and also more easily implemented in wards or outpatient clinics, eliminating inequalities in health care management. In this brief Viewpoint we provide an appraisal on the recommendations pertinent to the prevention of atrial fibrillation-related stroke or systemic thromboembolism, as provided in recently published guidelines for the management of this arrhythmia.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to management of secondary causes, CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines recommend to use a systematic approach to the identification of traditional modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and/or conditions associated with AF in patients with established AF or at high risk of developing AF, with strict guideline-adherent management to reduce major cardiovascular events
and to prevent recurrence of the arrhythmia and/or decrease its symptom burden.

### Practice implications of the atrial fibrillation guidelines [^113hdVtZ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common and complex cardiac arrhythmias. Using currently available evidence, leading medical societies have established recommendations for the optimal management of atrial fibrillation. These guidelines have recently been updated by 4 consensus groups: the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and a task force of 3 societies from the United States: the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. The present review focused on the similarities and differences among these recently updated guidelines. Key revisions included updated information on newer treatments for rhythm control, treatment options to reduce atrial fibrillation complications, and updated anticoagulant management for thromboprophylaxis.

### The future of atrial fibrillation management: integrated care and stratified therapy [^111xAZtD]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the major cardiovascular health problems: it is a common, chronic condition, affecting 2–3% of the population in Europe and the United States and requiring 1–3% of health-care expenditure as a result of stroke, sudden death, heart failure, unplanned hospital admissions, and other complications. Early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, ideally before the first complication occurs, remains a challenge, as shown by patients who are only diagnosed with the condition when admitted to hospital for acute cardiac decompensation or stroke. Once diagnosed, atrial fibrillation requires chronic, multidimensional management in five domains (acute management, treatment of underlying and concomitant cardiovascular conditions, stroke prevention therapy, rate control, and rhythm control). The consistent provision of these treatment options to all patients with atrial fibrillation is difficult, despite recent improvements in organisation of care, knowledge about atrial fibrillation, and treatment options. Integrated care models that provide patient-centred care in, or close to, the patient's community while maintaining access to all specialist treatment options, emerge as the best approach to achieve consistent delivery of these chronic treatments to all patients with atrial fibrillation. Ongoing research efforts will establish when to initiate oral anticoagulation in patients with device-detected atrial high-rate episodes, quantify the prognostic effect of early and comprehensive rhythm control therapy, including atrial fibrillation ablation, and delineate optimum methods to reduce bleeding complications in patients treated with anticoagulation. Additionally, research efforts are needed to define different types of atrial fibrillation on the basis of the main causes of atrial fibrillation to pave the way for the clinical development of stratified atrial fibrillation therapy.

Atrial fibrillation — pharmacological management of recurrent persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation is organized by symptoms and rhythm strategy. Minimal or no symptoms are managed with anticoagulation and rate control as needed, while disabling symptoms in AF proceed from anticoagulation and rate control to electrical cardioversion as needed, followed by continuation of anticoagulation as needed and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm; consider ablation for severely symptomatic recurrent AF after failure of greater than or equal to 1 AAD plus rate control. For permanent AF, anticoagulation and rate control as needed are used. Initiate drug therapy before cardioversion to reduce the likelihood of early recurrence of AF, and AAD indicates antiarrhythmic drug.

### Is there a role for maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation? [^11527zWH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Recent studies have indicated that outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation who are managed with rate control and anticoagulation are similar to those in patients who have maintenance of sinus rhythm. These studies did not include important groups of patients with atrial fibrillation in whom antiarrhythmic therapy may be appropriate. This perspective argues for the maintenance of sinus rhythm and for the use of antiarrhythmic therapy that includes medications, invasive procedures, and a combination of both in appropriate patients.

Atrial fibrillation — initial clinical assessment emphasizes that diagnosis is based on history and clinical examination and confirmed by electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, sometimes in the form of bedside telemetry or ambulatory Holter recordings, and that initial evaluation involves characterizing the arrhythmia pattern as paroxysmal or persistent, determining its cause, and defining associated cardiac and extracardiac factors pertinent to the etiology, tolerability, or history of prior management. A thorough history will result in a well-planned, focused workup that serves as an effective guide to therapy, and the workup can usually take place during a single outpatient encounter, with delay when the rhythm has not been specifically documented and additional monitoring is necessary. Commonly mentioned triggers include alcohol, sleep deprivation, and emotional stress, and stimulants such as caffeine or exercise may also precipitate atrial fibrillation. The physical examination may suggest atrial fibrillation on the basis of irregular pulse, irregular jugular venous pulsations, and variation in the intensity of the first heart sound or absence of a fourth sound heard previously during sinus rhythm, and examination may also disclose associated valvular heart disease, myocardial abnormalities, or heart failure.

### Atrial fibrillation: common questions and answers about diagnosis and treatment [^115TCGPH]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. It is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults in the primary care setting, and its prevalence increases with age. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults older than 50 years for atrial fibrillation. Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings and should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography or other recording device. The initial evaluation should include transthoracic echocardiography; serum electrolyte levels; complete blood count; and thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests. Stroke risk should be assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by preventing atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral or systemic emboli. Hemodynamically unstable patients, including those with decompensated heart failure, should be evaluated and treated emergently. Most hemodynamically stable patients should be treated initially with rate control and anticoagulation. Rhythm control, using medications or procedures, should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or in some patients based on risk factors and shared decision-making. Electrical cardioversion may be appropriate as first-line rhythm control. Conversion to sinus rhythm with catheter ablation may be considered in patients who are unable or unwilling to take rate or rhythm control medications long-term or if medications have been ineffective.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^116XDtfT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

### Contemporary management of atrial fibrillation: what can clinical registries tell us about stroke prevention and current therapeutic approaches? [^111MvKFg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

As highlighted in this review, registries extend knowledge of the natural history, risk factors, treatment practices, and long‐term outcomes and risks of management strategies within a truly representative population of AF patients managed in clinical practice. Together with patient database evaluations, these resources can greatly improve understanding of the needs and gaps in care for diverse patient subgroups. Though a comprehensive review of administrative databases was not within the scope of this review, increasingly relevant literature derived from mining of patient data can inform the management of patients with AF in an array of care settings.

Registry data are the means by which to determine whether patients are managed in line with evidence‐based guidelines — but they offer more than just a reflection of whether everyday practice adheres to accepted norms or ideals. Follow‐up of large numbers of patients allows assessment of long‐term outcomes and infrequent complications. There is scope to gather more information on the impact of AF and its management on quality of life as well as to provide insights into the overall health economic burden of AF. These registries have already helped shape and improve the way we manage patients, and well‐designed registries have the potential to yield hypotheses to guide future clinical and basic research.

Comprehensive care for atrial fibrillation (AF) — core recommendations and supporting data: Patients with AF should receive comprehensive care addressing guideline-directed LRFM, AF symptoms, risk of stroke, and other associated medical conditions to reduce AF burden, progression, or consequences; in patients with AF, use of clinical care pathways, such as nurse-led AF clinics, is reasonable to promote comprehensive, team-based care and to enhance adherence to evidence-based therapies for AF and associated conditions. Randomized and programmatic evidence includes that the RACE 3 trial found that multifaceted treatment for patients with AF and early heart failure improved maintenance of sinus rhythm, and in a cluster randomized trial of elderly patients with AF, an integrated care intervention consisting of quarterly AF check-ups by trained nurses in primary care, monitoring of anticoagulation therapy in primary care, and easy-access availability of consultants from cardiologists and anticoagulation clinics led to patients assigned to integrated care experiencing a 45% reduction in all-cause mortality when compared with usual care.

### Management of atrial fibrillation in older adults [^114oYAkM]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Most people with atrial fibrillation are older adults, in whom atrial fibrillation co-occurs with other chronic conditions, polypharmacy, and geriatric syndromes such as frailty. Yet most randomized controlled trials and expert guidelines use an age agnostic approach. Given the heterogeneity of aging, these data may not be universally applicable across the spectrum of older adults. This review synthesizes the available evidence and applies rigorous principles of aging science. After contextualizing the burden of comorbidities and geriatric syndromes in people with atrial fibrillation, it applies an aging focused approach to the pillars of atrial fibrillation management, describing screening for atrial fibrillation, lifestyle interventions, symptoms and complications, rate and rhythm control, coexisting heart failure, anticoagulation therapy, and left atrial appendage occlusion devices. Throughout, a framework is suggested that prioritizes patients' goals and applies existing evidence to all older adults, whether atrial fibrillation is their sole condition, one among many, or a bystander at the end of life.

### Misconceptions and facts about atrial fibrillation [^114KAYga]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is an increasingly common arrhythmia associated with substantial but largely preventable risk of ischemic stroke. There has been an exponential increase in research related to atrial fibrillation in recent years, resulting in some major advances in the therapeutic management. Novel oral anticoagulant agents have become available and require thorough assessment of risk-to-benefit ratio. While the knowledge is rapidly accumulating, the basic principles of atrial fibrillation management remain proper recognition, risk stratification, and appropriate prevention of thromboembolic complications. This review highlights some common misconceptions about atrial fibrillation.

Rhythm monitoring tools and methods — recommendations state: Among individuals without a known history of atrial fibrillation (AF), it is recommended that an initial AF diagnosis be made by a clinician using visual interpretation of the electrocardiographic signals, regardless of the type of rhythm or monitoring device. In patients with an intracardiac rhythm device capable of a diagnosis of AF such as from an atrial pacemaker lead, a diagnosis of AF should only be made after it is visually confirmed by reviewing intracardiac tracings to exclude signal artifacts and other arrhythmias. For patients who have had a systemic thromboembolic event without a known history of AF and in whom maximum sensitivity to detect AF is sought, an implantable cardiac monitor is reasonable. Among patients with a diagnosis of AF, it is reasonable to infer AF frequency, duration, and burden using automated algorithms available from electrocardiographic monitors, implantable cardiac monitors, and cardiac rhythm devices with an atrial lead, recognizing that periodic review can be required to exclude other arrhythmias. Among patients with AF in whom cardiac monitoring is advised, it is reasonable to recommend use of a consumer-accessible electrocardiographic device that provides a high-quality tracing to detect recurrences.

### Integrated care of patients with atrial fibrillation: the 2016 ESC atrial fibrillation guidelines [^116sNzgF]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the evolving epidemics in cardiovascular medicine. AF is projected to develop in 25% of currently 40-year-old adults, provokes many, often severe strokes, is associated with increased mortality and often leads to heart failure or sudden death even in well-anticoagulated patients. The last few years have seen the development of new approaches to detect and treat patients with AF, from ECG screening to surgical procedures to prevent recurrent AF. While these improvements provide tools to improve outcomes and quality of life in affected patients, they often need multidisciplinary input into patient management. It therefore seems timely that the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has issued new AF guidelines in August 2016.

Atrial fibrillation — diagnostic investigations require ECG documentation by at least a single-lead recording during the arrhythmia, which may be facilitated by emergency department records, Holter monitoring, or transtelephonic or telemetric recordings; a portable ECG tool may help in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and devices with diagnostic and memory functions may allow accurate and automatic detection. A chest radiograph may detect enlargement of the cardiac chambers and heart failure but is valuable mostly to detect intrinsic pulmonary pathology and to evaluate the pulmonary vasculature, and it is less important than echocardiography for routine evaluation. As part of the initial evaluation, all patients with atrial fibrillation should have 2-dimensional, Doppler echocardiography to assess LA and LV dimensions, LV wall thickness and function, and to exclude occult valvular or pericardial disease and HCM; LV systolic and diastolic performance helps guide decisions regarding antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic therapy, and thrombus should be sought in the LA but is seldom detected without TEE.

For low-risk patients with very brief AF, "For patients with low thromboembolic risk and AF duration < 12 h, the benefit of precardioversion imaging to exclude intracardiac thrombus is uncertain (2b)".

### Rationale, considerations, and goals for atrial fibrillation centers of excellence: a Heart Rhythm Society perspective [^113kuikY]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation centers of excellence — clinical roles, resources, and access pathways — require appropriate staffing and dedicated clinics, with centers committing to multidisciplinary and broad-based development. Relying on a single clinician to manage AF patients is no longer feasible in most, if not all, health care systems, and providing comprehensive AF care is best accomplished through a team-based approach that enables identification, referral, and management in a coordinated fashion. Timely access is particularly important when patients are acutely symptomatic, and pathways and systems are needed to help ensure continuity of care across encounters, while newly diagnosed asymptomatic AF or rapid ventricular rate may be detected in preoperative settings, outpatient clinics, or at home with wearable monitors or smartphone-based or direct-to-consumer applications.

Anticoagulation intensity targets in atrial fibrillation (AF) — For patients with nonvalvular AF, an INR of 1.6 to 3.0 is efficacious and relatively safe; for primary prevention in most AF patients under age 75 y and for secondary prevention, an INR of 2.5 (target range 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended, whereas a target INR of 2.0 (target range 1.6 to 2.5) seems reasonable for primary prevention in patients older than 75 y at high risk of bleeding. Maximum protection against ischemic stroke in AF is probably achieved at an INR range of 2.0 to 3.0, whereas an INR range of 1.6 to 2.5 is associated with incomplete efficacy, estimated at approximately 80% of that achieved with higher-intensity anticoagulation; trials targeting INR 1.4 to 2.8 (estimated mean achieved 2.0 to 2.1) found the largest relative risk reductions, but among AF patients with prior stroke or TIA, targeting 2.2 to 3.5 versus 1.5 to 2.1 found a greater rate of major hemorrhage with the higher intensity. Low-intensity anticoagulation requires special efforts to minimize time below the target range because stroke protection is sharply reduced; major bleeding across 5 randomized trials was 1.2% per year, and contemporary intracerebral hemorrhage rates are typically 0.1% to 0.6%.

Atrial fibrillation — decision-making for patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (2 in women) notes that treatment discussions may be needed and that single-point risk estimates are simplistic. The decision to treat with oral anticoagulants "may at times require additional discussion" because the recommendation strength is "less robust (2a)". The 1-point-concept is "simplistic", and other factors such as AF burden can be considered. In ARISTOTLE, "a single elevated BP measurement" was associated with a "50% increased risk of stroke", and additional patient-specific factors may influence risk but are "unclear" to incorporate into practice.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — antiarrhythmic pretreatment around cardioversion and safety: Antiarrhythmic medications may be initiated out of hospital or in hospital immediately prior to direct-current cardioversion, but risks include paradoxically increasing the defibrillation threshold with flecainide, accelerating the ventricular rate when class IA or IC drugs are given without an atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking agent, and inducing ventricular arrhythmias. Prophylactic drug therapy to prevent early recurrence of AF should be considered individually for each patient; pretreatment with pharmacological agents is most appropriate in patients who fail to respond to direct-current cardioversion and in those who develop immediate or subacute recurrence of AF. In patients with late recurrence and those undergoing initial cardioversion of persistent AF, pretreatment is optional. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy is recommended in conjunction with a second cardioversion attempt, particularly when early relapse has occurred, whereas additional cardioversion, beyond a second attempt, is of limited value and should be reserved for carefully selected patients; infrequently repeated cardioversions may be acceptable in patients who are highly symptomatic upon relapse to AF.

The introduction of evidence-based and structured guidelines has undoubtedly improved the care of cardiologic patients and in many cases simplified decision-making for the treatment team. The European Society of Cardiology in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, the American College of Clinical Pharmacy, and the Heart Rhythm Society, and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Rhythm Society have developed guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation. Because all 3 guidelines refer to almost the same scientific data, their recommendations are undoubtedly largely in agreement. Nevertheless, there are some interesting differences based on different interpretations of the same study, different publication dates, or differences in local conditions and health care resources. The following article aims at lining out these similarities and differences.

Atrial fibrillation oral anticoagulation efficacy — Meta-analysis using intention-to-treat shows adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation reduces all stroke versus placebo with a risk reduction of 62% (95% CI 48% to 72%). By on-treatment analysis excluding patients not undergoing oral anticoagulation at the time of stroke, the preventive efficacy of oral anticoagulation exceeded 80%. Among the randomized trials, 4 were placebo controlled; of the 2 that were double blinded with regard to anticoagulation, one was stopped early because of external evidence that oral anticoagulation was superior to placebo, and the other included no female subjects. In 3 trials dosing was regulated by prothrombin time ratio; 2 used INR target ranges of 2.5 to 4.0 and 2.0 to 3.0. Follow-up was generally between 1 and 2 y, with the longest 2.2 y.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) pericardioversion anticoagulation rationale — early experience and trial data support timing and modality: "This led to an empiric recommendation for 3 weeks of anticoagulation before cardioversion in the prospective, randomized, multicenter ACUTE… study of patients with > 2 days' duration of AF". "Precardioversion anticoagulation of at least 3 weeks may be accomplished via either therapeutic anticoagulation with VKAs or DOACs", and "Cardiac computed tomography… has emerged as an alternate imaging modality to exclude intracardiac thrombus". Justification includes that anticoagulation is continued "for the subsequent 4 weeks after cardioversion", with risks driven by "elevated thromboembolic risks… high early recurrence of AF, and observation of atrial dysfunction 2–5 days". Risks are "elevated around the time of cardioversion, especially within the 30 days after cardioversion", with recovery of atrial systole "over the ensuing 1 month".

Although atrial fibrillation remains the most common cardiac arrhythmia, the treatment and disposition remain varied. An accept-able standard of practice requires an evidence-based approach. This approach has revealed that half of the patients who present with acute atrial fibrillation will convert to sinus rhythm without intervention. In the hemodynamically stable subset, ascertaining the on-set of atrial fibrillation within 48 hours is critical because this period dictates when and if anticoagulation should be instituted and if and where electrical or chemical cardioversion needs be performed. The hemodynamically unstable patient, however, requires emergent cardioversion, irrespective of the chronicity of atrial fibrillation. An evidence-based approach may serve to optimize treatment and obviate the need for unnecessary hospital admissions.

Atrial fibrillation — electrical and pharmacological cardioversion overview is described as follows: Cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is a mode of acute rhythm control and can be achieved electrically or pharmacologically. Electrical cardioversion, given rapidity and efficacy, is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, and cardioversion should also be considered for hemodynamically stable AF intolerant of atrioventricular dyssynchrony, loss of atrial kick, or unable to achieve adequate rate control. In stable AF, both electrical and pharmacological cardioversion are acceptable, safe, and efficacious; electrical cardioversion is more effective than pharmacological cardioversion alone but involves the trade-off of anesthesia or sedation. Thromboembolic risks and considerations for anticoagulation apply to both pharmacological and electrical cardioversion.

### Approach to and management of the acute stroke patient with atrial fibrillation: a literature review [^115yvcat]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Stroke remains an increasing worldwide cause of disability and mortality, and it is the second leading cause of death in industrialized countries. Patients with atrial fibrillation form a unique group with increased risk of cardioembolic stroke. Despite the widespread application of the National Institutes of Health stroke scale and guidelines, patients with atrial fibrillation represent a clinically challenging group that deserves a special approach during the acute stroke phase. The mechanism of stroke in these patients is either cardioembolic [especially with an international normalized ratio (INR) < 2.0] or hemorrhagic (especially with INR > 5.0) (Figure 1). Atrial fibrillation with valvular heart disease significantly increases the risk for ischemic stroke. Specifically, patients with mitral stenosis who develop atrial fibrillation increase their risk of cardioembolism by 3 to 7 times. Many patients with atrial fibrillation still develop ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke despite appropriate use of anticoagulation. Prior stroke, transient ischemic attacks, congestive heart failure, hypertension, age > 75, and diabetes mellitus are all well-established risk factors for the development of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The CHADS-2 score is the most widely studied and clinically used method for stratifying patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. In our review, we present the most recent clinical guidelines and trends for the approach to and management of this patient group.

Atrial fibrillation — implications of the rhythm-control versus rate-control trials: Theoretically, rhythm control should have advantages over rate control, yet a trend toward lower mortality was observed in the rate-control arm of the AFFIRM study and did not differ in the other trials from the outcome with the rhythm-control strategy. The RACE and AFFIRM trials did not address AF in younger, symptomatic patients with little underlying heart disease, in whom restoration of sinus rhythm by cardioversion antiarrhythmic drugs or nonpharmacological interventions still must be considered a useful therapeutic approach. One may conclude from these studies that rate control is a reasonable strategy in elderly patients with minimal symptoms related to AF, and an effective method for maintaining sinus rhythm with fewer side effects would address a presently unmet need.

### Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation [^111Dw8YH]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, which is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The use of oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate or high risk of stroke, estimated by established criteria, improves outcomes. However, to ensure that the benefits exceed the risks of bleeding, appropriate patient selection is essential. Vitamin K antagonism has been the mainstay of treatment; however, newer drugs with novel mechanisms are also available. These novel oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors) obviate many of warfarin's shortcomings, and they have demonstrated safety and efficacy in large randomized trials of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. However, the management of patients taking warfarin or novel agents remains a clinical challenge. There are several important considerations when selecting anticoagulant therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation. This review will discuss the rationale for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation; risk stratification for treatment; available agents; the appropriate implementation of these agents; and additional, specific clinical considerations for treatment.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter — pericardioversion anticoagulation: Anticoagulation is recommended for 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after cardioversion for patients with AF of unknown duration or with AF for more than 48 h, and when acute AF produces hemodynamic instability, immediate cardioversion should not be delayed, but intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous injection of a low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated before cardioversion. Pooled data indicate that 98% of clinical thromboembolic events occur within 10 d, supporting administration of an anticoagulant for at least 4 wk after cardioversion and that continuation for a considerably longer period may be warranted even after apparently successful cardioversion. In a multicenter randomized study (n = 1222), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided and conventional strategies using anticoagulation 3 wk before and 4 wk after cardioversion showed comparably low risks of stroke (0.81% with the TEE approach and 0.50% with the conventional approach). For patients with atrial flutter undergoing cardioversion, anticoagulation should be considered with either strategy, and anticoagulation can be beneficial according to the recommendations as for patients with AF.

Atrial fibrillation — interruption of anticoagulation for procedures is addressed as follows: In patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, it is generally appropriate to substitute unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent thromboembolism; in patients with AF without mechanical valves, anticoagulation may be interrupted for a period of up to 1 wk for surgical or diagnostic procedures that carry a risk of bleeding without substituting heparin, with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin administered intravenously or subcutaneously in high-risk patients or when longer interruption is required. Low-molecular-weight heparins have pharmacological advantages including more predictable bioavailability (greater than 90% after subcutaneous injection).

Many aspects of the management of atrial fibrillation remain controversial. We address nine specific controversies in atrial fibrillation management, briefly focusing on the relations between mechanisms and therapy, the roles of rhythm and rate control, the definition of optimum rate control, the need for early cardioversion to prevent remodelling, the comparison of electrical with pharmacological cardioversion, the selection of patients for long-term oral anticoagulation, the roles of novel long-term anticoagulation approaches and ablation therapy, and the potential usefulness of upstream therapy targeting substrate development. The background of every controversy is reviewed and our opinions expressed. Here, we hope to inform physicians about the most important controversies in this specialty and stimulate investigators to address unresolved issues.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116chuoS]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment after cardiac surgery — rate/rhythm control, cardioversion, and anticoagulation: In postoperative cardiac surgery patients, beta blockers are recommended to achieve rate control for AF unless contraindicated or ineffective, in which case a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is recommended; in hemodynamically stable patients with postoperative AF, rate-control (target heart rate, < 100 bpm) and/or rhythm-control medications are recommended as initial therapy based on symptoms and hemodynamic consequences; in poorly tolerated AF after surgery, direct current cardioversion with antiarrhythmic drug therapy is recommended, with imaging to rule out left appendage thrombus when AF has been present ≥ 48 hours without anticoagulation; in postoperative AF, it is reasonable to administer anticoagulation when safe for 60 days after surgery with reassessment for longer-term need, and for those managed with rate control, at 30- to 60-day follow-up it is reasonable to perform rhythm assessment and, if AF does not revert spontaneously, consider cardioversion after an adequate duration of anticoagulation.

### About atrial fibrillation | Heart disease… [^1157CrYK]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What it is Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way. When a person has AFib, the normal beating in the upper chambers of the heart is irregular, and blood doesn't flow as well as it should from the atria to the lower chambers of the heart. AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. Symptoms Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. Others may experience one or more of the following symptoms:

- Irregular heartbeat.
- Heart palpitations.
- Lightheadedness.
- Extreme fatigue.
- Shortness of breath.
- Chest pain. Risk factors The risk for AFib increases with age. High blood pressure, the risk for which also increases with advancing age, accounts for about 1 in 5 cases of AFib.

Risk factors for AFib include:

- Advancing age.
- High blood pressure.
- Obesity.
- European ancestry.
- Diabetes.
- Heart failure.
- Ischemic heart disease.
- Hyperthyroidism.
- Chronic kidney disease.
- Moderate to heavy alcohol use.
- Smoking.
- Enlargement of the chambers on the left side of the heart. How is AFib related to stroke. AFib increases a person's risk for stroke. When standard stroke risk factors were accounted for, AFib was associated with an approximately fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke. AFib causes about 1 in 7 strokes. Strokes caused by complications from AFib tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. Strokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or by fatty deposits called plaque in the blood vessel lining. What are the consequences of AFib. More than 454, 000 hospitalizations with AFib as the primary diagnosis happen each year in the US. The condition contributes to about 158, 000 deaths each year.

The death rate from AFib as the primary or a contributing cause of death has been rising for more than two decades. Circulation. 2022; 145: e153–e639.

### Definition of atrial fibrillation-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^115HTVUw]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

atrial fibrillation An irregular heartbeat that occurs when the electrical signals in the atria fire rapidly at the same time. This causes the heart to beat faster than normal. Although atrial fibrillation can occur without any signs or symptoms, it may sometimes cause fatigue, chest pain, heart palpitations, trouble breathing, low blood pressure, dizziness or fainting, weakness, and other signs and symptoms. Atrial fibrillation may be caused by certain conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart attack, coronary artery disease, abnormal heart valves, congenital heart disease, lung disease, viral infections, or an overactive thyroid gland. Previous heart surgery, stress, or exposure to caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, or certain medicines may also lead to atrial fibrillation. It may go away on its own or it may last for many years.

If not treated, atrial fibrillation can lead to serious problems, such as blood clots, stroke, and heart failure. It is more common in older adults. Also called afib.

Key Points for Practice
- Anticoagulation is recommended for AF at a CHA 2DS 2-VASc score of 2 for men and 3 for women without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical valve. The score has not been validated for mitral stenosis or mechanical valves. Treatment recommendations apply to paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent AF as well as atrial flutter. In this update, the sections on anticoagulation, catheter ablation, and management of AF complicating acute coronary syndrome were modified, and new sections were added outlining weight loss and device detection of AF; however, this summary focuses on the new and revised recommendations for choosing an anticoagulant and new recommendations for preventing stroke via nonpharmacologic options and use of catheter ablation. Warfarin is the recommended anticoagulant for patients with AF and moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Dabigatran should be avoided in patients with AF and a mechanical heart valve.

Renal and hepatic function should be assessed before initiating direct oral anticoagulant therapy, then at least each year thereafter. Based on new evidence and FDA approval of a new appendage closure system, percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion is an option for patients with AF and a higher risk of stroke who are unable to take anticoagulants for a long duration because of bleeding risk or poor tolerance. Patients treated via this method have fewer hemorrhagic strokes than those treated with warfarin, but with a nonsignificant trend towards more ischemic strokes. For patients with symptomatic AF and heart failure who have decreased left ventricular function, catheter ablation can decrease mortality and hospitalizations linked to heart failure. Evidence indicates that catheter ablation reduces mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure and improves ejection fraction compared with guideline-directed medical therapy alone.

Ablation controls sinus rhythm better than amiodarone. In 2017, the American Academy of Family Physicians published guidelines on AF with the American College of Physicians. These guidelines recommend using the HAS-BLED score to quantify bleeding risk like the ACCP recommendations, but recommend anticoagulant consideration for all patients with CHA 2DS 2-VASc scores of 2 or higher. — Michael Arnold, MD, Editorial Fellow.
