## Question

Treatment of knee effusions

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment of knee effusions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing etiology and red flags such as septic arthritis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach including physical examination, imaging, and arthrocentesis indications. Next, I will consider conservative management, followed by targeted interventions like aspiration with or without intra-articular injections. After that, I must evaluate surgical options and special populations including post-TKA, ACL injury, and pediatrics. Finally, I will outline monitoring and follow-up and distill a bottom-line recommendation that aligns with current guidelines and evidence [^1149YmXB].

> Let me first confirm the importance of etiology because treatment is entirely cause-dependent. Knee effusions commonly arise from osteoarthritis, acute trauma including ACL meniscal injuries, crystal arthropathy, inflammatory arthritis, septic arthritis which is an emergency, and postoperative states including arthroplasty and ACL reconstruction. Hold on, I should verify the emergency status of infection: yes, suspected septic arthritis requires urgent evaluation and management, and aspiration is central to diagnosis and source control. In traumatic effusions after ACL injury, expert consensus supports considering aspiration if the effusion is painful and tense, which may also aid diagnosis and symptom relief [^1164cqXm] [^113zippB] [^1149YmXB].

> I will now examine the bedside diagnostic assessment. Wait, let me verify the reliability of physical exam maneuvers: the modified stroke test demonstrates substantial interrater reliability with a kappa around 0.75 and 73% agreement, supporting its use to grade effusions during follow-up. In the acute setting, a history of self-noted swelling and the ballottement test modestly increase the likelihood of an effusion. In traumatic presentations, the presence of an acute effusion should heighten suspicion for internal derangement warranting further evaluation. I need to ensure I also check for warmth, erythema, and fever as infection red flags, since those findings shift the pathway toward urgent arthrocentesis and cultures [^111TYeXn] [^117ABcKd] [^112793QG] [^1164cqXm].

> Next, I should review imaging to refine the diagnosis and quantify effusion burden. Ultrasound is sensitive and can guide procedures; let me think about techniques that expose occult fluid: dynamic ultrasound during voluntary quadriceps contraction can reveal small suprapatellar effusions not seen on static scans, providing targets for aspiration and injection. I initially thought MRI is simply the gold standard across the board, but wait, I should be precise: MRI is the most robust modality for quantitative effusion-synovitis assessment and predicts structural progression and arthroplasty risk, yet it is not necessary in all patients. In post-arthroplasty knees with PEEK implants, MRI can quantify effusion without metal artifact, enabling 3D volume assessment that tracks the postoperative decline from an early peak, although this is a specialized scenario rather than routine practice [^113HkvKF] [^112oZCfn] [^1177SwYU].

> Let me first confirm when to aspirate and what to send. Arthrocentesis is indicated for painful tense effusions, unexplained effusions, suspected crystal arthropathy, large symptomatic effusions for therapeutic relief, and crucially to rule out infection with Gram stain, culture, cell count, and crystals. I should double-check contraindications: older sources list bacteremia, prosthetic joint, and overlying cellulitis as contraindications; however, hold on, I should verify current practice because this seems too restrictive. Yes, aspiration through cellulitis is contraindicated, but in a prosthetic joint with suspected infection, diagnostic aspiration is actually indicated to rule out periprosthetic joint infection, so I need to correct that interpretation from older summaries. Technically, a superolateral approach to the suprapatellar recess with ultrasound guidance improves accuracy and facilitates both aspiration and injection while minimizing posterior displacement of fluid during knee flexion [^1124G8hH] [^1164cqXm] [^1175SLAw].

> Before jumping to injections, I need to ensure foundational care is optimized. Exercise therapy is first-line and strongly recommended, whether supervised, unsupervised, or aquatic, and should be dosed and progressed to the patient's capacity. Weight reduction when overweight, activity modification, topical or oral NSAIDs when appropriate, and assistive devices including tibiofemoral bracing as indicated for instability or pain are all part of the core package. Tai Chi can be offered as an adjunct for symptom relief and function. Wait, I should confirm these recommendations align across societies: AAOS, EULAR, and ACR are concordant on exercise as a core treatment, with ACR also supporting braces in selected patients [^111MtUFL] [^116rufGU] [^111dWkiw] [^114r8TW1].

> If the effusion remains symptomatic despite initial measures, I should consider therapeutic aspiration. Let me consider the durability of benefit: randomized data show aspiration improves pain and function only transiently, typically about a week, because fluid reaccumulates, though obtaining synovial fluid can accelerate diagnostic clarity in nontraumatic effusions. So, aspiration alone is reasonable for short-term relief and for diagnostic purposes, but I should plan next steps for sustained control if symptoms persist [^112y7z1S] [^1124G8hH].

> Now, I will evaluate aspiration followed by intra-articular injection choices. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify guideline hierarchies and efficacy. Multiple high-quality guidelines prefer intra-articular corticosteroids for short-term pain relief in symptomatic knee OA, and contemporary primary care guidance concurs. Evidence from randomized trials and systematic reviews supports a clinically meaningful but time-limited benefit, with greatest effect at 1 to 4 weeks and sometimes extending to 12 weeks. I need to ensure optimal technique: ultrasound guidance and a superolateral approach to the suprapatellar recess can improve accuracy and experience, particularly when effusions are small or loculated [^112x9kg6] [^117E31KR] [^11348Qd5] [^115hfJDZ] [^111qoaWJ] [^1173jj9a] [^1175SLAw] [^1124G8hH].

> I should double-check therapies to avoid. Viscosupplementation with hyaluronic acid is not recommended routinely due to lack of clinically important benefit and a higher risk of serious adverse events in robust meta-analyses, and AAOS advises against routine use. But wait, there are older and mixed results; still, the most comprehensive recent reviews and guidelines tilt firmly against HA in knee OA, so I should counsel patients accordingly and avoid exposing them to unnecessary injections and risks [^112nSfnE] [^115awaEA] [^1149YmXB].

> What about platelet-rich plasma? The guidance is conflicting: AAOS suggests it may be considered, whereas ACR recommends against PRP for knee OA. Let me reconsider whether it is superior to corticosteroids; the signal is inconsistent and not clearly better than steroids, and heterogeneity in PRP preparations complicates interpretation. Given discordant recommendations, shared decision-making is key, but the balance of evidence does not establish clear superiority over corticosteroids for effusion-prone OA knees [^114DgeQ1] [^11698cJ7].

> I need to ensure I exclude unproven or contraindicated intra-articular biologics. ACR specifically recommends against stem cells, TNF inhibitors, and IL-1 receptor antagonists for knee OA, and also against PRP in its framework, reflecting a cautionary approach where benefit is unproven and potential harms or costs are nontrivial [^11698cJ7].

> For refractory symptoms, I will now examine surgical considerations. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost drifted toward arthroscopy for lavage and debridement in OA, but high-quality guidelines recommend against arthroscopy for primary degenerative disease without mechanical symptoms, and utilization has declined in line with these recommendations. When disease is end-stage and nonoperative measures fail, total knee arthroplasty is the definitive option, recognizing that indications rest on pain, function, and radiographic severity after exhausting conservative care [^114D2TyQ] [^1149YmXB] [^114mV4Q2].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with post-TKA effusions. Let me verify what MRI can offer here: with PEEK-based implants, MRI avoids metal artifact and enables 3D effusion volumetry, showing an early postoperative peak around 1 week with a gradual decline thereafter. Hold on, I should confirm clinical correlations: larger postoperative effusion volumes correlate with higher CRP and ESR and with less improvement in knee scores and ROM. For chronic recurrent post-arthroplasty effusions, radiosynoviorthesis may help, but only after rigorously excluding infection, loosening, and other causes by exam, labs, aspiration, and imaging [^1177SwYU] [^116iQxhQ] [^113UCZjC] [^112q1Mjc].

> For ACL injury, I should confirm that early aspiration is reasonable when effusions are painful and tense, which aligns with consensus guidance. I need to check postoperative norms too: early post-ACLR noninfected aspirates can have WBC counts in the thousands, with an upper 98% CI around 16,200/μL, so I must interpret cell counts in clinical context and alongside Gram stain and culture. Radiographic suprapatellar effusion diameter greater than 10 mm on lateral views is highly specific for internal derangement in young adults after acute trauma, guiding MRI prioritization when appropriate [^113zippB] [^114HHgow] [^114qzGTX].

> In pediatrics, fever plus knee effusion should always prompt consideration of septic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, vasculitides, and malignancy. Hold on, I should verify the imaging cue: point-of-care ultrasound showing heterogeneous complex effusion may point toward inflammatory arthritides like JIA, but definitive diagnosis relies on comprehensive labs and sometimes aspiration with culture in suspected infection. I need to ensure urgent pathways for septic arthritis because delays increase morbidity [^116t3d5N] [^112m19Ax] [^1164cqXm].

> Finally, I should outline monitoring and follow-up. Clinical reassessment at 2 to 4 weeks after aspiration or injection helps gauge durability of symptom control and guides whether further imaging is needed. If effusions recur or symptoms persist, I should consider repeat ultrasound or MRI to reassess effusion-synovitis and structural drivers, and repeat aspiration is reasonable for large symptomatic reaccumulation. Let me double-check an inflammatory marker within the fluid: a synovial WBC cut-point around 242 cells/μL had about 71% sensitivity and 63% specificity for MRI-defined medium/large effusion-synovitis in OA, so while imperfect, it offers a pragmatic threshold to detect inflammatory OA phenotypes and tailor anti-inflammatory strategies, always integrating Gram stain, culture, and crystals when indicated [^1124G8hH] [^111KMngG] [^1162rmm9].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure my recommendation is both evidence-based and practical: build care on exercise and weight management, use diagnostic and therapeutic aspiration when symptomatic and to rule out infection, and for OA-related effusions add an intra-articular corticosteroid injection for short-term relief while planning longer-term strategies; avoid viscosupplementation given lack of meaningful benefit and safety concerns, reserve PRP for shared decision discussions where guidelines conflict, and keep arthroscopy off the table for primary OA without mechanical symptoms, escalating to TKA only when nonoperative measures fail and disease is severe [^112x9kg6] [^11348Qd5] [^112nSfnE].

Knee effusions are managed by identifying the cause and using a stepwise approach: **aspirate tense effusions for diagnosis and relief** [^112zcu96] [^1124G8hH], and **treat the underlying condition** (e.g. antibiotics for infection, disease-modifying therapy for inflammatory arthritis, or surgery for structural lesions). In osteoarthritis, use intra-articular corticosteroids for short-term relief [^11348Qd5] [^115hfJDZ], and **avoid routine hyaluronic acid injections** [^1149YmXB] [^112nSfnE]. Nonpharmacologic care includes **weight loss, exercise, and physical therapy** [^111MtUFL] [^114D2TyQ]. Recurrent or refractory effusions may need repeat aspiration, synovectomy, or radiosynoviorthesis [^1124G8hH] [^112q1Mjc]. Monitor for complications such as infection, cartilage damage, and impaired function, and escalate care if effusions persist or worsen.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential to **identify the underlying cause** of knee effusion and guide appropriate treatment. The following steps are recommended:

- **History and physical examination**: Assess for trauma, systemic symptoms, and underlying medical conditions. Physical examination findings such as self-noticed swelling and positive ballottement test are associated with knee effusion [^117ABcKd].

- **Imaging studies**: MRI is the gold standard for detecting effusion-synovitis and associated structural abnormalities. Ultrasound is a useful adjunct, particularly in detecting occult effusions.

- **Synovial fluid analysis**: Aspiration and analysis of synovial fluid are critical for differentiating between inflammatory, infectious, and degenerative causes of effusion.

---

## Non-pharmacological management

Non-pharmacological interventions are **foundational** in managing knee effusions, particularly in osteoarthritis:

- **Rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE)**: Initial conservative management to reduce swelling and inflammation.

- **Physical therapy and exercise**: Supervised and unsupervised exercise programs, including aquatic exercise, are recommended to improve pain and function [^111MtUFL] [^116rufGU].

- **Weight loss**: Strongly recommended for overweight or obese patients to reduce joint load and inflammation.

- **Assistive devices**: Tibiofemoral knee braces may be offered to improve joint stability and function [^111dWkiw].

---

## Pharmacological management

Pharmacological interventions are **tailored** based on the underlying cause of the effusion:

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Effective in reducing pain and inflammation associated with knee effusions.

- **Intra-articular corticosteroid injections**: Recommended for short-term relief in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis [^11348Qd5] [^115hfJDZ].

- **Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)**: Indicated for inflammatory arthritis-related effusions.

---

## Aspiration and injection techniques

Aspiration and injection techniques are essential for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Aspiration is **recommended** for painful, tense effusions — particularly after knee injury [^112zcu96] — as it provides temporary relief and aids diagnosis [^112y7z1S]. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are effective for short-term relief, and ultrasound guidance improves accuracy and safety.

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgical interventions are considered when **conservative measures fail** or when structural abnormalities are present. Options include arthroscopic synovectomy for chronic inflammatory effusions or synovial hypertrophy; radiosynoviorthesis for chronic inflammatory effusions (particularly in rheumatoid arthritis); and total knee arthroplasty for severe osteoarthritis with persistent effusion and joint damage.

---

## Complications and risks

Potential **complications** associated with knee effusions and their treatments include infection — with a risk of septic arthritis following aspiration or injection — and cartilage damage from chronic effusions, leading to cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis progression. Persistent effusions can cause pain, reduced range of motion, and functional impairment.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are **essential** to assess treatment effectiveness and detect recurrence. Clinical assessment should regularly evaluate pain, swelling, and joint function, while MRI or ultrasound can be used to monitor effusion volume and joint integrity. Patient education should emphasize adherence to treatment plans, weight management, and early reporting of symptoms.

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging **therapies and novel approaches** are being explored for refractory knee effusions. Areas under investigation include targeted biologic agents for inflammatory arthritis-related effusions, regenerative medicine approaches, such as stem cell and platelet-rich plasma injections, and advanced imaging with improved MRI and ultrasound techniques for more precise assessment and monitoring.

---

Knee effusions require a **comprehensive approach**, encompassing diagnosis, non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, aspiration, and surgery. Regular monitoring and emerging therapies are essential for effective management.

### Knee joint aspiration and injection [^1124G8hH]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Knee joint aspiration and injection are performed to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of knee joint diseases. The knee joint is the most common and easiest joint for the physician to aspirate. One approach involves the insertion of a needle 1 cm above and 1 cm lateral to the superior lateral aspect of the patella at a 45-degree angle. Once the needle has been inserted 1 to 1 1/2 inches, aspiration, aided by local compression, is performed. Local corticosteroid injections can provide significant relief and often ameliorate acute exacerbations of knee osteoarthritis associated with significant effusions.

- **Indications for arthrocentesis**: Among the indications are crystal-induced arthropathy, hemarthrosis, unexplained joint effusion, and symptomatic relief of a large effusion.

- **Contraindications**: These include bacteremia, inaccessible joints, joint prosthesis, and overlying infection in the soft tissue. Large effusions can recur and may require repeat aspiration.

- **Medication benefits**: Anti-inflammatory medications may prove beneficial in reducing joint inflammation and fluid accumulations.

### Arthroscopic surgery for degenerative knee arthritis and meniscal tears: a clinical practice guideline [^114D2TyQ]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately 25% of people older than 50 years experience knee pain from degenerative knee disease. Management options include watchful waiting, weight loss if overweight, a variety of interventions led by physical therapists, exercise, oral or topical pain medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular corticosteroid and other injections, arthroscopic knee surgery, and knee replacement or osteotomy. The preferred combination or sequence of these options is not clear and likely varies between patients.

Knee replacement is the only definitive therapy, but it is reserved for patients with severe disease after non-operative management has been unsuccessful. Some believe that arthroscopic debridement, including washout of intra-articular debris, with or without arthroscopic partial meniscectomy to remove the damaged meniscus, may improve pain and function.

### The EANM guideline for radiosynoviorthesis [^112q1Mjc]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

The efficacy of RSO in knee arthroplasty has been a subject of research. RSO was studied for treating recurrent joint effusions after knee arthroplasty; however, only scarce data are available in the literature. The initial results with RSO in knee arthroplasty were reported by Mödder et al. In their study, 107 patients with chronic joint effusion due to polyethylene disease, caused by abrasion particles from the polyethylene inlays, were treated with [90 Y]yttrium citrate. In 93 out of 107 (87%) patients, the joint effusion resolved entirely after therapy.

In another study by Mayer-Wagner et al, 55 patients with chronic joint effusion after knee arthroplasty were treated with radiosynoviorthesis using [90 Y]yttrium colloid. Significant improvements in pain, effusion, and function were seen in 54% of patients. For most of the patients in whom RSO treatment failed, complications of the arthroplasty, such as infection, loosening, allergy, and trauma, were detected. Thus, all these underlying causes of prosthesis failure must be excluded unequivocally prior to RSO using professional clinical examination, laboratory testing of inflammatory blood values, synovial fluid aspiration, and appropriate imaging.

### Viscosupplementation for knee osteoarthritis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VtTL4]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

Thirdly, we found evidence for the non-publication of many adequately powered, industry-funded trials. Examples include large trials on viscosupplementation for knee osteoarthritis, but they were never fully published (ClinicalTrials.com identifier NCT01934218, n = 814; NCT01372475, n = 800; and NCT00988091, n = 596; recruitment for these trials completed in 2016, 2013, and 2011, respectively). These trials, which tested different viscosupplementation formulations with distinct biochemical properties, reported similar or worse treatment effects on osteoarthritis pain than placebo. Only a subgroup analysis of one trial (NCT01934218) has been published, which is indicative of selective reporting. At the time of writing, at least 12 other unpublished trials were known to be completed, but their results were not retrievable (> 3000 patients randomized in total). Additionally, we could not include the data of three unpublished, industry-sponsored, placebo-controlled trials (two of which are large trials), which were previously included in the 2012 systematic review because formal approval was not given by the companies.

Based on the trial sequential analysis, between 2009 and 2021 alone, more than 12,000 patients were subjected to intra-articular injections in viscosupplementation trials, raising ethical concerns. According to our trial sequential analysis, a sufficient number of patients have been accrued to confidently conclude that viscosupplementation is not only ineffective compared with placebo but might also be seriously harmful and therefore should be used cautiously.

### Volume and distribution of early knee effusion after TKA with a PEEK-based knee prosthesis: Correlation with changes in serum inflammation marker levels, knee functional score, and range of motion [^1177SwYU]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

A major advantage of the PEEK prosthesis is its transparency on radiographs and MR, which avoids the metallic artifacts seen in MR images of joints with traditional alloy prostheses. Wittstein et al. revealed that 3D models of knee effusion generated with MR imaging using the SPACE (sampling perfection with application-optimized contrast using different flip angle evolution) sequence and T2WTSE (T2-weighted turbo spin echo) provided accurate estimates of knee effusion volume in a cadaveric study. The relatively precise quantification of knee effusion with MR imaging may be based on the T2WTSE or T2WFSE (T2-weighted fast spin echo) sequence for scanning and 3D reconstruction. In the present study, a T2-weighted PDW-FSE sequence was utilized to optimize the segmentation of the knee effusion image. Sagittal images were utilized to generate the 3D models since axial images might have left the suprapatellar recess uncovered. The 3D MR imaging models displayed the distribution and volume of effusion in the knee with the PEEK prosthesis. Using 3D model analysis, dynamic changes in knee effusion were identified, which were characterized by an early rise in the mean volume to 31.86 ± 15.34 mL at 1 week postoperatively, followed by a gradual decrease to 11.45 ± 5.19 mL at 2 years postoperatively.

### Ultrasound of the knee during voluntary quadriceps contraction: A technique for detecting otherwise occult effusions [^113HkvKF]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

To describe **a technique that can detect synovial effusions not seen on static ultrasound (US) examination** and **the characteristics of patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) for whom this technique proved useful**, a study was conducted using records of 76 patients with knee OA (112 knees) who had undergone US-guided injections over a defined period. From these patients, 45 knees showed no detectable effusion on static US. However, 18 knees (from 14 patients) revealed fluid when scanned during voluntary quadriceps contraction. For all patients, effusion features were documented through physical examination, presence and size on US, with joint entry success determined by retrieval of synovial fluid and/or observation of an air echo or inflow of injected material.

The results indicated that the 14 patients studied were predominantly obese, with an average body mass index of 32.7 ± 2.3 kg/m², including three who were morbidly obese. Radiography mostly showed moderate to severe OA, with Kellgren/Lawrence class 3 or 4 in 10 out of 14 knees for which radiographs were available. The suprapatellar synovial space observed by US was small, with a mean depth of 0.38 ± 0.04 cm. Arthrocentesis yielded 0.5–16 mL of synovial fluid, averaging 2.9 ± 0.6 ml, correlating with effusion depth as seen on US during maximum quadriceps contraction (Spearman's rho = 0.5597, P = 0.0157). In four knees where arthrocentesis did not retrieve fluid, the inflow of injected material and a linear air echo were observed instead.

In conclusion, US of the knee during voluntary quadriceps contraction is effective in identifying effusions not detectable on static US, providing valuable targets for further intervention.

### Volume and distribution of early knee effusion after TKA with a PEEK-based knee prosthesis: Correlation with changes in serum inflammation marker levels, knee functional score, and range of motion [^111X5MiJ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, American Volume (2025). Low credibility.

After total knee arthroplasty (TKA), knee effusion may occur as a result of inflammatory reactions within the prosthetic joint. Excessive knee effusion can result in late postoperative pain, limited postoperative joint motion, and even implant failure. Accurate evaluation of knee effusion is crucial; however, obtaining clear knee-effusion image information through magnetic resonance (MR) is difficult due to the metallic artifacts from traditional alloy knee prostheses. The specific distribution and volume, as well as the dynamic changes in knee effusion after TKA, remain unclear. Moreover, the extent to which effusion relates to periprosthetic knee inflammation and function is unknown.

Applying substitute materials with good radiographic transparency characteristics is a possible solution. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a polyaromatic semicrystalline thermoplastic polymer with beneficial properties such as radiographic transparency, high strength, resistance to fatigue strain, suitability for common sterilization techniques, and excellent biocompatibility, making it useful for biomedical applications. Several orthopedic applications of PEEK are currently available, including its use for the femoral component of hip prostheses, bone anchors, and spinal implants. Our previous study demonstrated good biosafety in goats that underwent TKA with cemented PEEK-on-highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) prosthetic knee joints. An animal model study proved the feasibility of in vivo MR image monitoring after TKA. We recently performed TKA with the PEEK-based implant for the…

### Lubricating ability of aspirated synovial fluid from emergency department patients with knee joint synovitis [^113LNw44]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

To determine if joint effusions encountered in the emergency department (ED) requiring arthrocentesis possess normal lubricating ability or evidence cartilage degeneration, chondroprotection of articulating joint surfaces is provided by lubricin, a mucinous glycoprotein that is a product of megakaryocyte-stimulating factor gene (GenBank U70136) expression. Loss of synovial fluid's (SF) lubricating ability has been implicated in the pathogenesis of degenerative joint disease.

A retrospective ED observational study was conducted from May 1, 1999, to October 1, 2000, involving adult and pediatric patients presenting with radiographically negative knee joint complaints and clinical evidence of joint effusion. Knee joints were aspirated by the emergency physician, and the synovial fluid was tested for lubricating ability and collagen type II degeneration. The lubricating ability was assayed in vitro in an arthrotripsometer oscillating latex apposed to polished glass under a load of 0.35 x 10^6 N/m². Results were reported as the coefficient of friction (μ) relative to that of a 0.9% NaCl control, where a negative delta μ value indicates lubrication. Comparisons of delta μ were made to normal SF and aspirates from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis. Collagen type II fragments were measured by a novel sandwich ELISA.

Synovial fluid aliquots (n = 57) lubricated poorly with delta μ = -0.045 (95% confidence interval = -0.006, -0.083) compared to normal SF with delta μ = -0.095 (95% CI = -0.088, -0.101). Only 20.6% of knee joint aspirates possessed normal lubricating ability.

A positive correlation was observed between the reduction in total knee effusion volume and the actual value of the range of motion (ROM) (R² = 0.36; p = 0.0001) from 3 to 24 months postoperatively. Using the 1-week total knee effusion volume as a reference, there was also a negative correlation between the change in effusion volume in the suprapatellar bursal region (R² = 0.29; p = 0.0006) and ROM. No such correlation was found for the infrapatellar bursal region (R² = 0.05; p = 0.21) or the patellofemoral region (R² = 0.05; p = 0.18).

A negative correlation (R² = 0.19; p = 0.003) was observed between total knee effusion volume and the change in knee functional score (KSS), indicating that greater effusion volume was associated with less postoperative improvement. A negative correlation was also found between knee effusion volume in the suprapatellar bursal region (R² = 0.16; p = 0.006) or patellofemoral region (R² = 0.20; p = 0.002) and the change in the postoperative KSS.

Correlation analyses reveal a positive correlation between the reduction in total knee joint effusion volume (JEV) or effusion volume in the suprapatellar bursal region and the actual value of the ROM. The greater the total JEV or the postoperative JEV in the suprapatellar and patellofemoral bursal regions, the smaller the postoperative improvement in the KSS. CI = confidence interval.

### Volume and distribution of early knee effusion after TKA with a PEEK-based knee prosthesis: Correlation with changes in serum inflammation marker levels, knee functional score, and range of motion [^116iQxhQ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). Low credibility.

The relationship between knee effusion and CRP or ESR value was analyzed. Preoperative values of CRP and ESR served as references for assessing changes in these levels at each postoperative time point. Results indicated that a greater total knee effusion volume post-surgery correlated with higher postoperative CRP and ESR values, as well as more significant changes in these levels postoperatively.

Positive correlations were identified:

- **CRP level and knee effusion volume**: R² = 0.16; p = 0.007.
- **ESR and knee effusion volume**: R² = 0.22; p = 0.001.
- **Change in CRP level and knee effusion volume**: R² = 0.16; p = 0.007.
- **Change in ESR and knee effusion volume**: R² = 0.15; p = 0.009.

These correlation analyses, depicted in Fig. 5, illustrate that greater total knee effusion volume after surgery corresponds to higher postoperative CRP and ESR values or changes in these values relative to preoperative levels. CI = confidence interval.

### Metabolic and inflammatory profiles define phenotypes with clinical relevance in female knee osteoarthritis patients with joint effusion [^116HMGsz]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

- **Methods**: The subjects of this study are part of a prospective cohort of patients that includes men and women with primary knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and persistent joint effusion. The cohort includes 202 KOA patients consecutively recruited after an outpatient visit in our Rheumatology Service from October 2013 to April 2018. At present, the cohort includes 171 women, three of whom were excluded from our study due to their high number of missing values in the parameters used for clustering (> 10%, five variables), leaving 168 female KOA patients for our analysis. We focused the present work on female patients to homogenize the study sample, as previous works have reported numerous sex-related differences in OA regarding metabolic conditions, inflammatory factors, and levels of pain and functional disability. An exhaustive description of the inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the supplementary information available at Rheumatology online.

- **Ethics**: All subjects signed an informed consent authorizing the collection of samples and data for their use in the context of KOA studies. The project was evaluated and approved by the ethical committee of our centre (CEIm Parc Taulí) with approval number 2015/539, and was conducted according to the national and international ethical guidelines (Ethical Standards, Declaration of Helsinki).

- **Samples**: Samples from plasma and joint fluid were systematically extracted at recruitment from all patients in the cohort. Synovial fluid was obtained by aspiration.

### Is local viscosupplementation injection clinically superior to other therapies in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee: A systematic review of overlapping meta-analyses [^111NTqb7]. Arthroscopy (2015). High credibility.

The purpose of this research was to conduct a systematic review of overlapping meta-analyses comparing treatments for knee osteoarthritis (OA). Specifically, it examined intra-articular viscosupplementation (intra-articular hyaluronic acid [IA-HA]) versus oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intra-articular corticosteroids (IA-corticosteroids), intra-articular platelet-rich plasma (IA-PRP), and intra-articular placebo (IA-placebo) to identify which meta-analyses provided the best evidence and potential causes of discordance.

- **Methods**: Literature searches were conducted for meta-analyses that examined the use of IA-HA against NSAIDs, IA-corticosteroids, IA-PRP, or IA-placebo. Clinical data were extracted, and meta-analysis quality was assessed. The Jadad algorithm was used to determine which meta-analyses provided the highest level of evidence.

- **Results**: Fourteen meta-analyses met the eligibility criteria, with evidence quality ranging from Level I to IV. Among studies reporting patient numbers, a total of 20,049 patients were included: 13,698 received IA-HA, 355 received NSAIDs, 294 received IA-corticosteroids, and 5,702 received IA-placebo. Ten studies examined IA-HA versus IA-placebo; of these, five studies reported that IA-HA improved pain, and four reported that IA-HA improved function. No clinically relevant differences in efficacy between IA-HA and NSAIDs were found regarding pain and function. When comparing IA-HA with IA-PRP, IA-HA was found to improve knee function at 2 and 6 months post-injection, though the effects were less robust than those of IA-PRP. In comparison to IA-corticosteroids, the positive effects of IA-HA were noted but further details on the findings were not specified.

### A randomized placebo-controlled trial of arthroscopic lavage versus lavage plus intra-articular corticosteroids in the management of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee [^1173jj9a]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy of intra-articular steroid injections following arthroscopy and joint lavage in symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, seventy-seven patients with OA of the knee were randomized to receive either 120 mg methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) or placebo following arthroscopy. Clinical assessments included severity of pain on movement and at rest, stiffness, presence of joint effusions, range of movement, WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score, and Lequesne functional assessment. Outcome measures were evaluated at baseline and at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. Further arthroscopies and synovial biopsies were performed at the time of clinical response and at relapse.

An intention-to-treat analysis was performed on 71 patients (38 MPA, 33 placebo). Using the OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) response criteria, 58% of the steroid group versus 33% of the placebo group (adjusted relative risk = 2.38) (P = 0.004) responded at 4 weeks. At other time points, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups for pain, stiffness, or WOMAC or Lequesne assessments at any time point.

The response to intra-articular corticosteroids following joint lavage is short-lived (2–4 weeks), with achievement of an OARSI response criterion being the only difference between the two groups.

### Treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee: Evidence-based guideline, 2nd edition [^115s5ChB]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

The treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee: Evidence-based guideline, 2nd edition is based on a systematic review of scientific and clinical research. This guideline contains 15 recommendations and replaces the 2008 AAOS clinical practice guideline. It was reevaluated earlier than the 5-year recommendation of the National Guideline Clearinghouse due to methodological concerns regarding the evidence used in the first guideline. The guideline does not support the use of viscosupplementation for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Additionally, the work group highlighted the need for better research in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.

### Knee effusion volume assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and progression of knee osteoarthritis: data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative [^112oZCfn]. Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

To examine whether baseline knee joint effusion volume and the change in effusion volume over one year are associated with cartilage volume loss, progression of radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA) over four years, and risk of total knee replacement over six years.

This study included 4115 Osteoarthritis Initiative participants, with knee joint effusion volume quantified by MRI at baseline. The change in effusion volume over one year was assessed. Cartilage volume loss and progression of ROA over four years were assessed using MRI and X-ray, and total knee replacement over six years was evaluated. Multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression were employed for data analyses.

- **Results**: Baseline knee effusion volume (per 5 ml) was positively associated with a loss of medial and lateral cartilage volume: regression coefficient 0.13%/year (95% CI 0.10, 0.17) and 0.13%/year (95% CI 0.10, 0.16), respectively, both P < 0.001, progression of ROA [odds ratio (OR) 1.28 (95% CI 1.20, 1.37), P < 0.001], and risk of knee replacement [OR 1.12 (95% CI 1.05, 1.20), P = 0.001]. A 5 mL increase in knee effusion volume over one year was positively associated with medial cartilage volume loss: regression coefficient 0.09%/year (95% CI 0.04, 0.15), P = 0.001, progression of ROA [OR 1.21 (95% CI 1.11, 1.33), P < 0.001], and risk of knee replacement [OR 1.24 (95% CI 1.12, 1.37), P < 0.001].

- **Conclusions**: Knee joint effusion volume assessed from MRI provides a continuous and sensitive measure that was associated with cartilage volume loss, progression of ROA, and risk of total knee replacement.

### The EANM guideline for radiosynoviorthesis [^1175SLAw]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Knee joint positioning is crucial during radiosynoviorthesis. The intraarticular positioning of the needle is verified by detecting a synovial effusion, even minimal, or by injecting a small amount of contrast agent if no effusion is present. A paraarticular injection of [90Y] yttrium colloid can cause severe complications, including skin atrophy and soft tissue necrosis.

The superolateral approach with puncture of the suprapatellar recess is preferred for knee procedures, as it permits the removal of synovial fluid, even in small amounts. Other approaches depend on the therapist's experience and habit. The internal subpatellar approach is recognized as more painful. Bent knee punctures reduce the chances of synovial fluid removal because the effusion might be pushed into the knee's posterior compartment. Therefore, ultrasound guidance is recommended for accuracy (Fig. 1B). Landmarks are identified by palpation, with the patella held between the thumb and index finger, marking its external lateral edge.

A 50-mm or 40-mm, 21-gauge needle is attached to an empty syringe to aspirate any possible effusion. By subluxing the patella, the needle can be slid under the skin and oriented under or directly proximal to the upper part of the patella. This is done while aspirating to detect fluid. Using an applicator, as shown in Fig. 1A, facilitates the puncture and aspiration of joint fluid, allowing a single-handed procedure with the other hand operating the ultrasound device.

### Knee effusions, popliteal cysts, and synovial thickening: Association with knee pain in osteoarthritis [^115V1gEH]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of effusions, popliteal cysts, and synovial thickening with knee symptoms in older persons with and without radiographic (XR) osteoarthritis (OA), using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

- **Methods**: Subjects with and without knee symptoms were recruited from Veterans Affairs and community sources. All participants underwent weight-bearing knee radiographs. They were divided into three groups:
	- The Knee pain/XROA group had knee symptoms and radiographic OA.
	- The No knee pain/XROA group had no knee symptoms but radiographic OA.
	- The No knee pain/no XROA group had no knee symptoms and a normal radiograph.
	- A single knee was imaged using a 1.5 T MR scanner with T1 and T2 weighted and proton density SE imaging sequences. MRIs were analyzed for effusion, popliteal cysts, and synovial thickening.

- **Results**: The mean age of subjects was 67.0 years, with 66.6% being male. The study included 381 subjects with Knee pain/XROA, 52 with No knee pain/XROA, and 25 with No knee pain/no XROA. The prevalence of moderate or larger effusions was 54.6% in the Knee pain/XROA group, 15.6% in the No knee pain/XROA group, and 11.1% in the No knee pain/no XROA group. Popliteal cysts were present in 33.0% of Knee pain/XROA subjects, 28.0% of No knee pain/XROA subjects, and 9.1% of No knee pain/no XROA subjects. After adjusting for the severity of radiographic OA, significant differences were observed between those with and without knee pain in the prevalence of moderate or larger effusions (p < 0.001) and synovial thickening, independent of effusion (p < 0.001), but not in the prevalence of popliteal cysts. Furthermore, among those in the Knee pain/OA group, synovial thickening was associated with the severity of knee pain.

### Interrater reliability of a clinical scale to assess knee joint effusion [^111TYeXn]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). High credibility.

The study focused on the clinical measurement of interrater reliability for a knee joint effusion grading scale in an outpatient orthopaedic physical therapy clinic. Knee joint effusion can be an indicator of joint inflammation or irritation, making objective monitoring crucial for decision-making regarding patient prognosis and progression of therapeutic programs. Clinicians in the study's setting utilized a modified stroke test based on a 5-point grading scale to assess knee joint effusion.

Seventy-five patients (44 males and 31 females) with unilateral knee problems, aged 16 to 65, participated in the study. Effusion assessment was indicated for these patients. Pairs of therapists graded the knee joint effusion using the clinical grading scale. A contingency table was developed and analyzed using Cohen's kappa values to establish interrater reliability, and percent agreement was also calculated.

The results showed a kappa value of 0.75 as a proportion of the maximum possible kappa, with 73% percent agreement. Out of 75 pairs of tests, 54 demonstrated perfect agreement. Only 5 instances had disagreements of 2 grades, with no disagreements exceeding 2 grades.

These findings support the clinical effusion grading scale as a reliable tool for assessing knee joint effusion between therapists in an outpatient orthopaedic physical therapy clinic for patients with unilateral knee dysfunction. Only 5 of the 75 ratings resulted in disagreement.

### Effects of acute joint effusion on balance in patients with knee osteoarthritis [^112JACHT]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of acute joint effusion on balance in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Forty-four female subjects with painful knee osteoarthritis participated in this single-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. All subjects were randomly assigned to either the injection or the control group. A volume of 20 mL of normal saline was injected into the knee joint cavity of the test subjects, who performed static and dynamic balance tests twice before and after joint infusion. The subjects in the control group performed the same tests without joint infusion.

The outcome variables for static measurement included the mean speeds (millimeters per second) of the movement of the center of pressure in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions and the mean velocity moment (square millimeters per second) under both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. For dynamic measurement, time (seconds) and distance (millimeters) of the center of pressure were used.

Significant interaction of the balance-test variables (mean speeds, velocity moment, time, and distance) between the groups and time (P > 0.05) was not found, and there were no significant differences between the groups in any of the balance-test variables (P > 0.05).

This study showed that acute joint effusion has no effect on static or dynamic postural sway in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

### Quantitative assessment of knee effusion-synovitis in older adults: Association with knee structural abnormalities [^115P5Zre]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

To describe the natural history of quantitatively measured knee effusion-synovitis and the longitudinal associations between effusion-synovitis and knee structural factors, including cartilage defects, cartilage volume, subchondral bone marrow lesions, and meniscal pathology, in older adults, a study involving 406 subjects (mean age 63 years, 50% women) was conducted. Subjects were randomly selected at baseline and followed up 2.7 years later.

T2- or T1-weighted fat saturation magnetic resonance imaging was utilized to assess knee effusion-synovitis maximal area, cartilage defects, cartilage volume, bone marrow lesions, and meniscal pathology at both baseline and follow-up. Multivariable generalized linear regression was performed to analyze the associations between the maximal area of effusion-synovitis and other joint structural factors, with adjustments for age, sex, body mass index, tibial bone area, and/or radiographic osteoarthritis (OA).

Over the 2.7 years of follow-up, the size of effusion-synovitis increased in 29%, remained stable in 50%, and decreased in 22% of participants. Baseline effusion-synovitis maximal area was significantly associated with changes in knee cartilage defects (β = 0.18 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07, 0.29]), bone marrow lesions (β = 0.17 [95% CI 0.05, 0.30]), and cartilage volume (β = -0.40 [95% CI -0.71, -0.09]), but not with changes in meniscal pathology. In contrast, baseline structural measures were not associated with change or increase in effusion-synovitis maximal area.

Our findings indicate that knee effusion-synovitis is associated with certain changes in knee structural abnormalities in older adults.

### Metabolic and inflammatory profiles define phenotypes with clinical relevance in female knee osteoarthritis patients with joint effusion [^112wJQCZ]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Despite these efforts, there is as of now no consensus on a comprehensive classification of osteoarthritis (OA) with clinical relevance. In knee osteoarthritis (KOA), the existence of an inflammatory clinical phenotype characterized by the presence of synovitis and higher levels of pain, functional disability, and rate of progression is widely acknowledged. In our study, a data-driven approach was used to identify phenotypes in 168 KOA patients with persistent joint effusion from a prospective KOA cohort. To do so, anthropometric parameters, metabolic factors, and systemic and local inflammatory markers were analyzed using well-established statistical and machine-learning methods in a non-supervised manner. To assess their clinical relevance, differences across phenotypes were assessed regarding pain, functional disability, ultrasound and radiographic severity, and progression.

### Fever and knee effusion in the pediatric patient [^116t3d5N]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

The pediatric patient presenting with fever and knee effusion is a frequent cause for clinical concern. Conducting a comprehensive history and physical examination is essential to guide the appropriate diagnostic evaluation and management. While pediatric knee effusions are often linked to trauma, the presence of fever requires consideration of infectious, rheumatologic, vasculitic, and malignant causes. This review discusses the critical elements of history, physical examination, diagnostic strategies, common causes, and initial management of pediatric patients with fever and knee effusion.

### Synovial fluid proteomics from serial aspirations of ACL-injured knees identifies candidate biomarkers [^11314N7F]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears often result in knee effusion and an increased risk for developing knee osteoarthritis (OA) in the long run. The molecular profile of these effusions could be informative regarding initial steps in the development of posttraumatic OA after an ACL tear.

The study hypothesizes that the proteomics of knee synovial fluid change over time after ACL injury. It is designed as a descriptive laboratory study. Synovial fluid was collected from patients with an acute traumatic ACL tear presenting to the office for evaluation (18.31 ± 19.07 days from injury, aspiration 1) and again at the time of surgery (35.41 ± 58.15 days after aspiration 1, aspiration 2). High-resolution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was used to assess the quantitative protein profile of synovial fluid, and differences in protein profile between the two aspirations were determined computationally.

The results indicated that a total of 58 synovial fluid samples were collected from 29 patients (12 male, 17 female; 12 isolated ACL tears, 17 combined ACL and meniscal tears) with a mean age and body mass index of 27.01 ± 12.78 years and 26.30 ± 4.93, respectively, undergoing unbiased proteomics analysis. The levels of 130 proteins in the synovial fluid changed over time, with 87 increasing and 43 decreasing. Proteins of interest that were significantly higher in aspiration 2 included CRIP1, S100A11, PLS3, POSTN, and VIM, which represent catabolic/inflammatory activities in the joint. Proteins with a known role in chondroprotection and joint homeostasis such as CHI3L2 (YKL-39), TNFAIP6/TSG6, DEFA1, SPP1, and CILP were identified.

### Associations between knee effusion-synovitis and joint structural changes in patients with knee osteoarthritis [^116HsP7Z]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

To describe the associations between effusion-synovitis and joint structural abnormalities in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) over 24 months, a posthoc analysis was conducted using data from a randomized controlled trial involving 413 patients with symptomatic OA (aged 63 ± 7 years, 208 women). Knee effusion-synovitis volume and score, cartilage defects, cartilage volume, and bone marrow lesions (BML) were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. Joint space narrowing (JSN) and osteophytes were evaluated using radiographs. The least significant change criterion was used to define a change in effusion-synovitis volume. Knee symptoms were assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster University OA Index. Multivariable linear/logistic regression and multilevel generalized mixed-effects models were utilized in longitudinal analyses.

Total effusion-synovitis volume increased modestly from baseline (8.0 ± 8.5 ml) to follow-up (9.0 ± 10.5 ml). Baseline BML, cartilage defect, JSN, and osteophyte scores were positively associated with changes in effusion-synovitis volume (p < 0.05). Baseline cartilage defects and JSN were also associated with changes in effusion-synovitis score (p < 0.05). However, neither baseline effusion-synovitis score nor volume consistently predicted changes in the above structures except cartilage volume. In the mixed-effects models, knee effusion-synovitis was positively associated with BML (volume: β = 1.19 ml/grade; score: OR = 1.75/grade) and cartilage defects (volume: β = 1.87 ml/grade; score: OR = 2.22/grade), while negatively associated with cartilage volume.

### Identifying inflammation in knee osteoarthritis: Relationship of synovial fluid white blood cell count to effusion-synovitis on magnetic resonance imaging [^111KMngG]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). High credibility.

Inflammation is a potential pain generator and treatment target in knee osteoarthritis (OA). It can be detected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and by synovial fluid white blood cell count (WBC). However, the performance characteristics of synovial fluid WBC for the detection of synovitis have not been established. This study was undertaken to determine the sensitivity and specificity of synovial fluid WBC in identifying inflammation in knee OA using MRI effusion-synovitis as the gold standard.

- **Methods**: We identified records of patients seen at an academic center with a diagnosis code for knee OA, a procedural code for knee aspiration, and a laboratory order for synovial fluid WBC in the same encounter, as well as an MRI within 12 months of the aspiration. MRIs were read for effusion-synovitis using the MRI OA Knee Score (MOAKS). We dichotomized effusion-synovitis as 1) none or small, or 2) medium or large. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of synovial fluid WBC using MRI effusion-synovitis (medium/large) as the gold standard. We used the Youden index to identify the best cut point.

- **Results**: We included 75 patients. The mean ± SD age was 63 ± 12 years, and 69% were female. The synovial fluid WBC was higher in the medium/large effusion-synovitis group (median 335 [interquartile range (IQR) 312]) than in the none/small group (median 194 [IQR 272]). The optimal cut point was 242, yielding a sensitivity of 71% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 56–83%) and specificity of 63% (95% CI 41–81%).

- **Conclusion**: The sensitivity and specificity of synovial fluid WBC in detecting inflammation in knee OA using MRI effusion-synovitis as the gold standard showed reasonable accuracy.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid injections for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis: What the orthopaedic provider needs to know [^111k87Nn]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Low credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections have been used for decades in the management of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee and remain a common practice. The pain relief from a steroid injection is thought to work by reducing inflammation within the arthritic knee. Substantial variability remains among providers regarding the technique used to perform the procedure, including the site of the injection, the medications injected, and the level of sterility. The success of steroid injections in relieving arthritic knee pain most often occurs in the short term. However, the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections varies within the published literature. The latest American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline does not support conclusive recommendations about the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Providers should be aware of the adverse effects and potential complications of these injections when using them in clinical practice.

### Results of laboratory evaluation of acute knee effusion after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: What is found in patients with a noninfected, painful postoperative knee [^114HHgow]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2010).

Infection after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a rare and potentially devastating complication. No normative data have been reported for knee aspiration after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in the early postoperative period.

- **Hypothesis**: Determining normative laboratory data from a retrospective review of noninfected early postoperative anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction knee effusions will allow for the calculation of an aspirate white blood cell (WBC) threshold value indicative of infection.

- **Study design**: Case series (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 4.

- **Methods**: A 2-year retrospective chart review of 151 anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction patients was performed. Thirty-one noninfected patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria and 1 infected patient had laboratory data collected, including peripheral blood and knee effusion aspirate analyses. Laboratory data from pertinent published studies of infected knees after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were combined with the data of our 1 infected patient, establishing a historical control group. Data were analyzed and results were then compared. Infected aspirate WBC threshold value statistics were then calculated.

- **Results**: Analysis of noninfected knee effusion aspirates revealed a mean WBC count of 9600/uL (standard deviation [SD], 15,200), and a mean of 66% polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells (SD, 34). Aspirate WBC 98% confidence interval (CI) was 2800/uL to 16,200/uL, and the 98% CI for PMN cells was 58% to 84%. Aspirate WBC count > 16,200/uL is 86% sensitive.

### Role of sonographic examination in traumatic knee internal derangement [^114oZwCd]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

The study aimed to define the accuracy of sonographic examination, compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in detecting knee effusion and to determine whether the presence of knee effusions in patients with traumatic knee injury can predict knee internal derangement as assessed by MRI.

- **Design**: Prospective study.
- **Setting**: Hospital rehabilitation department.
- **Participants**: Thirty patients (19 men, 11 women) with traumatic knee injury were recruited. Subjects received sonographic examination and MRI on the same day.
- **Interventions**: Not applicable.
- **Main outcome measures**: The presence or absence of knee effusion was assessed by sonographic examination. MRI was used as the criterion standard to evaluate the presence of knee effusion and internal derangement, which included tears of anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, as well as meniscus tears.
- **Results**: The sensitivity of sonographic examination for detecting knee effusion was 79.1%, and specificity was 50%. The positive-predictive value (PPV) was 86.3%, and the negative-predictive value (NPV) was 37.5%. The PPV of sonographic effusion to internal derangement was 90.9%, and the NPV was 37.5%.
- **Conclusions**: Sonographic examination can accurately detect effusion of the knee. The detection of knee effusion in patients with traumatic knee injury by sonographic examination is highly indicative of internal knee derangement.

### The efficacy and duration of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for knee osteoarthritis: A systematic review of level I studies [^111qoaWJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the efficacy and duration of intra-articular corticosteroid injection in reducing pain caused by knee osteoarthritis and to determine whether the type of corticosteroid used affected these results. Following an electronic search of multiple databases and a review of reference lists from various articles, we found six trials in five papers that compared corticosteroid versus placebo and four papers that compared different corticosteroids.

Results of corticosteroid compared with placebo showed both a statistically and clinically significant reduction in pain at 1 week, with an average difference between groups of 22%. Two of four trials showed triamcinolone to be more effective in pain reduction than other corticosteroids. We concluded that intra-articular corticosteroids reduce knee pain for at least 1 week and that intra-articular corticosteroid injection is a short-term treatment of a chronic problem.

### Viscosupplementation for knee osteoarthritis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115awaEA]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

Trial sequential analysis focused on serious adverse events (15 large, placebo-controlled trials, 6,462 randomized participants) revealed that the cumulative z-score crossed the monitoring boundaries in 2018 (z-score = 2.77, P = 0.006) before the required information size was reached, indicating that the significantly higher rate of serious adverse events in patients receiving viscosupplementation compared with those receiving placebo is a robust finding.

- **Trial sequential analysis**:
	- A trial sequential analysis of 15 large placebo-controlled trials for serious adverse events was conducted. The analysis was based on 6,462 randomized participants. Given the weak association between viscosupplementation and pain reduction in knee osteoarthritis, any increase in the risk of serious adverse events caused by viscosupplementation compared with placebo can be considered a clinically important increase.
	- Cumulative z-scores were calculated under a random effects model. The RIS (required information size) was calculated as the sample size that gives a trial 80% power to detect a 50% relative risk (RR) increase of serious adverse events, assuming a control event rate of 2.5% and a two-sided α = 0.05. O'Brien-Fleming monitoring boundaries are represented by dashed orange lines, and circles denote the z-score for each additional trial. A D² of 25% was assumed. Non-peer-reviewed reports had their disclosure year defined as the earliest year in which the document was first officially created when available within the file or the year of online publication (e.g. results first posted date).

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for knee osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to alternative and complementary therapies, AAOS 2022 guidelines recommend considering offering the following modalities to improve pain and function in patients with knee OA:

- **Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation**: This technique involves the application of electrical currents to nerves through the skin.

- **Extracorporeal shockwave therapy**: A non-invasive treatment that uses shockwaves to reduce pain and improve mobility.

- **U.S. FDA-approved laser treatment**: A laser-based approach that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for managing knee osteoarthritis symptoms.

### Traumatic knee injury: Correlation of radiographic effusion size with the presence of internal derangement on magnetic resonance imaging [^114qzGTX]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Traumatic knee injury is a common clinical presentation. However, knee internal derangement often goes undiagnosed on physical exam. The authors hypothesize that patients with suprapatellar joint effusion greater than 10 mm anteroposterior diameter on lateral radiograph have a high likelihood of knee internal derangement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective review of knee radiographs and MRI in 198 patients aged 18–40 years with acute knee injury was performed. Suprapatellar effusion diameter on lateral radiography was correlated with the presence of internal derangement on MRI. MRI anteroposterior effusion size at four locations was correlated with radiographic suprapatellar effusion measurements.

- **Results**: Logistic regression showed a positive correlation between radiographic effusion size and the presence of internal derangement on MRI exams. When a radiographic effusion size of > 10 mm was established as a positive test, test sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 55%, 96%, 93%, 71%, and 77%, respectively. Statistical analysis showed the radiographic anteroposterior effusion diameter most closely approximated the MRI effusion diameter at the lateral patellofemoral recess.

- **Conclusions**: This study shows that knee radiography is a highly specific screening test for internal derangement in patients less than 40 years old with acute knee injury.

### Diagnostic value of history taking and physical examination to assess effusion of the knee in traumatic knee patients in general practice [^117ABcKd]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

The objective is to assess the diagnostic value of history taking and physical examination for knee joint effusion in patients with a knee injury who consult their general practitioner (GP). Additionally, the study aims to determine the association between effusion seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and internal derangement of the knee.

The design employed is a prospective, observational cohort study set in primary care. Participants included 134 patients aged 18 to 65 years who had suffered a traumatic knee injury and consulted their GP. Interventions were not applicable.

- **Main outcome measures**: Patients filled out a questionnaire, underwent a standardized physical examination, and completed an MRI scan to assess the presence of effusion. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the diagnostic value of history taking and physical examination, assessed by sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios (P < 0.10). The relationship between effusion and internal derangement of the knee was assessed using a chi-square test.

The results from the 134 participating patients indicated that 42 had knee joint effusion as seen on MRI. Multivariate analysis showed an association with knee joint effusion for the symptom "self-noticed swelling" (history taking) and the "ballottement test" (physical examination). The likelihood ratio positive (LR+) was 1.5 for self-noticed swelling and 1.6 for the ballottement test; combined, these improved the diagnostic value to an LR+ of 3.6. Effusion showed a positive association with internal derangement of the knee, with a chi-square of 9.5, indicating substantial relation.

### The young osteoarthritic knee: Dilemmas in management [^113D6sMv]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Analgesic regimes have been proven to effectively improve the pain associated with osteoarthritis (OA). Paracetamol is effective in reducing the pain associated with OA of the knee but is less effective than NSAIDs. Systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, however, are associated with an increased risk of side effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances.

Intra-articular corticosteroids are widely used to manage the symptoms of osteoarthritic joints. Several studies and a Cochrane Review have shown the treatment to be beneficial versus placebo in the knee, but there is little evidence to show that this benefit lasts beyond four weeks. The 2009 Cochrane review analyzed the evidence for hyaluronan (HA) and hylan derivatives for viscosupplementation of the knee.

- **Efficacy and adverse events**: The authors concluded that these products were comparable in efficacy to systemic forms of active intervention but with more local reactions and fewer systemic adverse events. The HA products have a more prolonged effect than intra-articular corticosteroids.

- **Cost and complications**: The numerous different HA preparations and administration regimes make a comparison of cost with corticosteroids difficult, but the raw cost of HA is significantly more expensive than corticosteroids. Infection following joint injection is a rare but recognized complication, and there is evidence of a higher risk of joint infection following total knee replacement (TKR) in patients who have had intra-articular corticosteroid treatment. This makes some surgeons wary of offering intra-articular injections to patients who may be candidates for future joint replacement surgery.

### Low-dose spironolactone: Treatment for osteoarthritis-related knee effusion. A prospective clinical and sonographic-based study [^115H3wJz]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of spironolactone as a treatment for osteoarthritis (OA)-related knee effusion in comparison to ibuprofen, cold compresses, and placebo.

- **Methods**: This study was carried out on 200 patients, aged 40 years or older, attending the outpatient clinic of the Rheumatology Department of Sohag University Hospital with unilateral knee effusion related to OA based on clinical examination, musculoskeletal ultrasonography (US), and synovial fluid analysis. In group 1, 50 patients received spironolactone 25 mg daily for 2 weeks; in group 2, 50 patients took ibuprofen 1200 mg daily for 2 weeks; in group 3, 50 patients used cold compresses 2 times daily for 2 weeks; and in group 4, 50 patients received a placebo for the same duration. Fluid greater than 4 mm was considered effusion. A decrease in fluid to reach below 4 mm thickness was considered complete improvement, and any decrease that did not reach below 4 mm thickness was considered partial improvement.

- **Results**: The mean age of the participants was 51.2 ± 8.1 years. The mean duration of effusion was 16.5 ± 3.6 days. In group 1, 66% had complete improvement, 20% partial improvement, and 14% no response. In group 2, 24% had complete improvement, 12% partial improvement, and 64% no response. In group 3, 28% had complete improvement, 14% partial improvement, and 58% no response. In group 4, only 6% had complete improvement, 10% partial improvement, and 84% no response.

Low-dose spironolactone is concluded to be a safe and effective medical treatment for OA-related knee effusion.

### Decreasing trends in arthroscopic treatment of knee osteoarthritis after publication of the 2013 Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guidelines [^114mV4Q2]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

The authors aimed to analyze the utilization trends of arthroscopic lavage and/or débridement for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee in patients without concomitant injuries, such as meniscal tears or loose bodies. This exploration of arthroscopic utilization rates was prompted by consistent findings in the 2013 and 2021 AAOS clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on the nonarthroplasty management of knee OA, which included over three decades of published research on this topic. Both guidelines found convincing evidence against the use of arthroscopy for this patient population.

The 2013 AAOS CPG strongly recommended against arthroscopy, and the most recent 2021 AAOS CPG issued a moderate strength recommendation, stating, "Arthroscopy with lavage and/or débridement in patients with a primary diagnosis of knee OA is not recommended". Guidelines with "strong" or "moderate" strength of recommendations indicate that the evidence supporting the recommendation is of high quality, and the likelihood of the recommendation being overturned by future publications on the chosen topic is low.

Additionally, it is important to consider the utilization of conservative treatment options for knee OA that may have influenced the trends in arthroscopic intervention. The most common conservative treatment options include physical therapy (PT), intra-articular corticosteroid injections (CSIs), and viscosupplementation injection (VSI) using agents like hyaluronic acid. The 2013 AAOS CPG gave an inconclusive recommendation for the use of CSIs for knee OA, whereas the 2021 AAOS CPG issued a…

### A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of intraarticular hyaluronic acid for osteoarthritis of the knee [^1155fbM8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy of intraarticular (IA) injections of hyaluronic acid (HA) compared to placebo in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, and to evaluate patient satisfaction with treatment relative to placebo, a comparison was made between a series of 3 versus 6 consecutive IA injections.

Methods - **Trial design**: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm parallel design trial with 106 patients having radiologically confirmed knee OA.

- **Injection regimen**: Two-milliliter IA injections using 20 mg/ml HA sodium salt or saline placebo were administered once weekly over 3 weeks (HA and placebo groups). This was followed by once-weekly IA injections with 2.0 mL (20 mg/ml) HA for an additional 3 consecutive weeks.

- **Efficacy assessments**: The primary efficacy assessment focused on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) score for knee pain (Week 3 score). Secondary efficacy assessments included WOMAC scores for knee pain at Weeks 6 and 12 (follow-up), WOMAC stiffness, physical function, and quality of life scores. Additional assessments involved visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain at rest and after walking and stepping activity, range of knee joint motion, and global patient satisfaction with treatment and quality of life using the SF-36.

Results - **Knee function improvements**: After 3 weeks of study treatment, both groups showed improvements in knee function, with the HA group demonstrating greater improvement in the WOMAC knee pain score compared to placebo (p < 0.01).

- **Overall improvements**: The HA group showed greater (p < 0.05) improvement in the overall WOMAC score and VAS pain following walking and stepping activity at Week 3.

### Effectiveness of aspiration in knee joint effusion management: a prospective randomized controlled study [^112y7z1S]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Knee effusion is a common symptom in various knee disorders of both traumatic and non-traumatic aetiology. Although intra-articular aspiration is a widespread treatment approach, its beneficial effect has not been confirmed by a randomized controlled study. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of joint aspiration in acute knee effusion, in relation to traumatic or non-traumatic aetiology.

One hundred sixty-seven consecutive patients with acute knee joint effusion were allocated in a randomized controlled fashion into two groups. In the first group, joint aspiration was performed, while in the second group, no aspiration was performed. Post management, range of motion, pain relief, use of analgesics, and oedema were evaluated. The Knee Society Score and the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Evaluation Form were also obtained. Additionally, a subgroup analysis of results in relation to the presence of trauma was performed.

Aspiration exhibited a temporary improvement in all clinical parameters evaluated, especially in post-traumatic effusion. However, this improvement lasted only for the first week due to the early re-accumulation of the effusion. There was no difference between the groups regarding clinical outcome in neither trauma nor non-trauma patients at the end of the follow-up period. Aspiration aided in the earlier establishment of the diagnosis in non-trauma cases of effusion.

In conclusion, aspiration resulted in only temporary improvement of the outcomes in the treatment of knee effusion.

### Volume and distribution of early knee effusion after TKA with a PEEK-based knee prosthesis: Correlation with changes in serum inflammation marker levels, knee functional score, and range of motion [^116mJ5KE]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

Early knee effusion is a common phenomenon after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), with potential clinical implications. Unlike traditional alloy knee prostheses, the polyetheretherketone (PEEK) knee system has radiographic transparency on magnetic resonance (MR) scans, which allows analysis of prosthetic knee effusion. We aimed to identify the distribution and volume of knee effusion after TKA with the PEEK prosthesis using MR imaging and to analyze whether dynamic changes in effusion were correlated with serum inflammatory marker changes and knee function recovery.

- **Methods**: Nine patients with osteoarthritis who were 59 to 74 years old underwent unilateral TKA with the PEEK prosthesis between June 2021 and August 2021. Dynamic early postoperative changes in the volume and distribution of knee effusion were evaluated using 3D MR stereoscopic images. Serum inflammatory markers were measured via blood tests, and joint function was evaluated using the subjective functional score of the Knee Society Score (KSS) and knee range of motion (ROM). Linear regression analyses were performed to assess correlations between knee effusion volume and inflammatory markers, and between knee effusion volume and joint function.

- **Results**: The mean serum inflammatory marker levels increased significantly at 1 week after TKA with the PEEK prosthesis and then gradually decreased with time from 1 to 6 months. The mean total knee effusion volume gradually decreased over time. Concurrently, the mean KSS subjective functional score and mean knee ROM improved with time.

### The association of meniscal damage with joint effusion in persons without radiographic osteoarthritis: the Framingham and MOST osteoarthritis studies [^113Ghj8g]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2009). Low credibility.

To assess the cross-sectional association between meniscal status and joint effusion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in knees without radiographic osteoarthritis (OA), knees without OA (Kellgren/Lawrence grade 0) from the Framingham and MOST studies were examined by MRI. Meniscal status was assessed with a score of 0–4 in the anterior horn/body/posterior horn of the medial/lateral meniscus, and effusion was assessed using a score of 0–3. The odds ratios (ORs) of joint effusion in those with meniscal damage were estimated using a logistic regression model. A subanalysis was performed for knees without MRI-detected cartilage damage.

Of the 1368 knees, 296 (21.6%) showed meniscal pathology in at least one subregion. Effusion was present in 133 (44.9%) of knees with meniscal damage, compared to 328 (30.6%) in those without meniscal damage. The adjusted OR of effusion in a knee with meniscal damage was 1.8, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of [1.4, 2.4]. The OR of effusion for the group with meniscal pathology in two compartments was 5.4, with a 95% CI of [2.1, 14.3]. For knees without any cartilage lesions but with meniscal damage in any compartment, the OR was 2.3, with a 95% CI of [1.1, 4.5].

In conclusion, knees without OA but with meniscal pathology exhibit joint effusion to a significantly higher degree than knees without meniscal damage. The association persists for knees without cartilage damage, and the prevalence of effusion is further increased when present in two compartments. Concomitant occurrence of synovial activation and meniscal damage contributes to understanding the pathophysiology involved.

### Knee effusion affects knee mechanics and muscle activity during gait in individuals with knee osteoarthritis [^115UrRt1]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2012). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that knee effusion presence in those with knee osteoarthritis (OA) alters knee joint muscle activation patterns and sagittal plane mechanics during gait, thirty-five patients with medial compartment knee OA were assessed for the presence of effusion using a brush test. Based on the results, they were assigned to the knee effusion (n = 17) and no knee effusion (n = 18) groups. Electromyograms from seven lower extremity muscles (lateral and medial gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis and medialis, rectus femoris, and the lateral and medial hamstrings), leg motion, and ground reaction forces were recorded during self-selected walking. Isometric knee extensor, plantar flexor, and knee flexor strength were measured. Discrete measures from angular knee motion and net external moment of force waveforms were identified. Principal component analysis extracted electromyographic waveform features. Analysis of variance models tested for main effects (group, muscle) and interactions (α = 0.05), while Bonferroni post-hoc testing was employed.

No differences in age, body mass index, knee pain, Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index scores, gait velocity, and muscle strength were found between groups (P > 0.05). Individuals with effusion had a greater overall quadriceps activation and prolonged hamstring activation into mid-stance (P < 0.05). Knee joint flexion angles were higher (P < 0.05) and net external knee extension (KE) moments in mid to late stance were lower in the effusion group.

### Management of knee osteoarthritis: Knee lavage combined with hylan versus hylan alone [^112qKwdf]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

To assess the difference in efficacy between knee lavage plus the standard hylan G-F 20 (a derivative of hyaluronan) protocol and the standard hylan G-F 20 as per standard usage protocol alone for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a nonrandomized prospective study was conducted. Patients chose their treatment group, with follow-up averaging 1.1 years. The study was set in the faculty practice of a single physician at a major teaching hospital and involved 81 patients with documented knee OA on magnetic resonance imaging.

- **Interventions**: Group 1 (n = 44) received a single-needle lavage 1 week before the standard hylan G-F 20 protocol; group 2 (n = 37) received the standard hylan G-F 20 protocol alone.

- **Main outcome measures**: Pre- and posttreatment scores on the Lysholm-II Questionnaire and a visual analog scale (VAS) were documented for each patient. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistical analysis.

A successful outcome was noted in 79.5% of group 1 patients and in 54% of group 2 patients (p < 0.05). In the management of knee OA, the use of knee lavage before viscosupplementation with hylan G-F 20 yields better results than using hylan G-F 20 alone. The presence of radiologic grade IV knee OA or moderate to severe patellofemoral arthritis are negative prognostic factors.
