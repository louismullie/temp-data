## Question

what is left atrial dysfunction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what left atrial dysfunction is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal phasic functions of the left atrium. Then, I should define left atrial dysfunction conceptually and distinguish it from structural remodeling. Next, I will quantify dysfunction using validated imaging parameters and outcome-derived cutoffs. After that, I need to elucidate mechanisms linking left atrial and left ventricular function. Finally, I will examine the clinical significance across stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, and consider diagnostic integration and implications for care.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental physiology so I don't skip steps: the left atrium serves reservoir, conduit, and contractile (booster pump) roles across the cardiac cycle, dynamically modulating left ventricular filling and cardiac output, with these phases tightly coupled to ventricular pressure, compliance, and relaxation properties; any discussion of dysfunction has to map back to these phasic functions to remain clinically precise.

> Now, I should define the entity carefully before attributing consequences; left atrial dysfunction refers to impairment of one or more of the atrium's phasic mechanical functions — reservoir, conduit, or contractile — manifesting as reduced compliance, impaired emptying, or loss of booster contribution, and spanning a continuum from subclinical abnormalities to overt atrial failure, which is atrial dysfunction sufficient to impair cardiac performance and outcomes.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about size being synonymous with dysfunction; in fact, I almost said enlargement precedes dysfunction, but that would be backwards in many patients — functional impairment often precedes and can occur without left atrial enlargement, with robust data showing substantial dysfunction in people with normal left atrial volume and mediation analyses indicating that nearly half of the volume effect on atrial fibrillation risk is explained by impaired function rather than size alone [^114TT5be] [^112xtQmX].

> Next, I will quantify dysfunction and I need to check that I cite validated indices and thresholds; volumetric measures include the left atrial emptying fraction computed as the difference between end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes divided by end-systolic volume, the left atrial function index that combines emptying fraction, left ventricular outflow tract velocity–time integral, and indexed end-systolic left atrial volume, and the left atrial expansion index defined as the percentage change from minimum to maximum atrial volume, each linked to filling pressures and outcomes; outcome-derived cutoffs suggesting abnormality include a left atrial emptying fraction less than 55% and a left atrial function index less than 40.5 [^1136KdED] [^112PFrKi] [^111fEB8a] [^115k6e9a] [^116wGAz9].

> I will now examine deformation analysis, because strain often detects disease earlier than volume; speckle-tracking echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking quantify reservoir, conduit, and contractile strain, with left atrial reservoir strain emerging as the most sensitive marker of early dysfunction and an outcome-relevant threshold around 23% in population data — let me verify measurement conventions and note that standardized gating and segmental averaging are essential to reduce variability [^111f4qVa] [^1118uH1b] [^111jhx4B] [^116wGAz9].

> Let me think about mechanisms next, because pathophysiology guides interpretation; chronic pressure and volume stressors induce fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and matrix remodeling that raise atrial stiffness and blunt reservoir function, while elevated left ventricular filling pressures acutely and chronically impair atrial mechanics through atrioventricular coupling; superimposed atrial cardiomyopathy — fibrosis, inflammation, and electrical remodeling — can predispose to arrhythmia and thromboembolism independent of atrial fibrillation, creating a vicious cycle especially evident in heart failure where atrial dysfunction both reflects and worsens ventricular disease [^116fmyL2] [^116rns7X] [^111LbutQ] [^114dTFxr] [^113ucvet].

> Wait, I should confirm the distinct profiles in HFpEF versus HFrEF to avoid oversimplification; in HFrEF, eccentric left atrial remodeling with larger volumes predominates, whereas in HFpEF, left atrial stiffness, pulsatility, and wall stress are higher at comparable mean pressures, contributing to a higher atrial fibrillation burden and stronger links to pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular dysfunction, emphasizing that left atrial dysfunction is both a marker and a mediator in these syndromes [^113yFAR2].

> Turning to clinical consequences, I need to check the strength of evidence for stroke risk independent of atrial fibrillation; observational cohorts show that lower left atrial function index predicts ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack even in patients without known atrial fibrillation, supporting the concept that atrial cardiomyopathy confers thromboembolic risk through a prothrombotic atrial substrate in sinus rhythm, although causality cannot be fully established and residual confounding remains possible [^114LryXt] [^114dTFxr] [^1176s74M].

> For incident atrial fibrillation, let me review which phasic components matter most; impaired reservoir and passive emptying functions are independently associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation beyond clinical factors and atrial volume, with mediation analyses indicating that approximately 46% of the volume effect on atrial fibrillation is transmitted through dysfunction, and with global dysfunction frequently present despite normal indexed volume — interestingly, booster pump indices are less consistently predictive in some imaging modalities [^112xtQmX] [^115PJG2L] [^114TT5be].

> I should also review heart failure outcomes and verify comparative prognostic weight; in HFpEF cohorts, reduced left atrial reservoir strain correlates with higher pulmonary vascular resistance, lower peak oxygen consumption, and independently associates with hospitalization and death, while in coronary disease with preserved ejection fraction, lower left atrial function index presages heart failure hospitalization, all reinforcing the prognostic primacy of atrial mechanics across phenotypes [^111gESWE] [^116nQYQT] [^111fEB8a].

> But wait, diagnosing diastolic dysfunction is often indeterminate with conventional echocardiography, so I need to check how left atrial mechanics can be integrated; algorithms that incorporate left atrial reservoir strain can reclassify indeterminate cases while maintaining outcome discrimination, and indexing reservoir strain to estimated atrial pressure (for example, dividing by E/e') improves diagnostic performance as a surrogate for atrial compliance, though in atrial fibrillation rhythm, specialized approaches and cycle length considerations are required [^112cYWg7] [^115m5hkj] [^116TQzvo].

> Let me reconsider practical cut points, because misapplying normal ranges is a common pitfall; while normal left atrial reservoir strain values can vary by platform and methodology, outcome-based thresholds around 23% for reservoir strain and 40.5 for the left atrial function index are supported by population data, and I should emphasize that laboratory-specific reference ranges and vendor calibration are crucial to avoid overcalling disease in low-risk individuals [^116wGAz9].

> I will now examine broader systemic links so I don't miss extracardiac signals of atrial disease; worse left atrial reservoir strain has been associated with cognitive impairment and cerebrovascular imaging markers even in the absence of documented atrial fibrillation, postpartum women after preeclampsia exhibit attenuated atrial strain and increased stiffness, and in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left atrial myopathy — including reduced booster pump strain — tracks with sarcomere mutation status and adverse remodeling, though causality is not proven and confounding by comorbidities must be kept in mind [^113wb1pW] [^116vbVQ2] [^112HEPt1] [^114zrK8o].

> Finally, I need to check implications for therapy and monitoring without overstating the evidence; left atrial reverse remodeling has been observed with targeted interventions, and rhythm control strategies that reduce atrial fibrillation burden can improve atrial function and outcomes in selected heart failure populations, while emerging data from myosin activation suggest potential favorable effects on atrial volumes and emptying, but prospective trials specifically targeting atrial mechanics and validating them as modifiable surrogates remain a key unmet need [^115DZvVx] [^115HiX2r] [^112o5uVR] [^113ucvet].

> In summary — and I should double-check that I've kept function distinct from size — left atrial dysfunction is a measurable impairment of reservoir, conduit, or contractile performance that often precedes enlargement, arises from structural, hemodynamic, and electrophysiologic remodeling, and independently tracks with thromboembolism, incident atrial fibrillation, and heart failure outcomes; careful assessment using volumetric indices and atrial strain with outcome-based thresholds provides earlier and richer risk stratification than size alone and should be integrated with diastolic evaluation and clinical context [^113goa2R] [^112xtQmX] [^116wGAz9] [^111gESWE] [^114LryXt] [^111LbutQ].

Left atrial dysfunction is **impaired reservoir, conduit, or booster-pump function** [^113goa2R] of the left atrium, which may precede or occur without atrial enlargement [^114TT5be] [^111LbutQ]. It is best detected by reductions in LA reservoir strain (< 23%) [^116wGAz9] and LA emptying fraction (< 55%) and is **linked to higher risks of atrial fibrillation, stroke, and heart failure hospitalization** [^115PJG2L] [^114LryXt] [^111fEB8a] [^111gESWE]. Early identification with **echocardiographic strain or CMR** [^111f4qVa] enables risk stratification [^1136KdED] and guides therapy to prevent progression and adverse events.

---

## Physiological role of the left atrium

The left atrium has **three phasic functions** — reservoir during ventricular systole, storing pulmonary venous return; conduit in early diastole, passively transferring blood to the left ventricle; and booster-pump in late diastole, actively augmenting LV filling [^111AveBV]. These phases are essential for efficient LV filling and cardiac output, especially during exercise or stress [^113goa2R] [^113PdomV].

---

## Definition and characterization of left atrial dysfunction

Left atrial dysfunction is **impaired reservoir, conduit, or booster-pump function**, often preceding or occurring without LA enlargement [^114TT5be] [^111LbutQ]. It reflects reduced compliance, increased stiffness [^113goa2R], and impaired contractility, measured by echocardiographic strain [^111f4qVa] and volumetric indices [^1136KdED].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Left atrial dysfunction arises from **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Increased left atrial pressure**: Chronic elevation from LV diastolic dysfunction or mitral valve disease causes LA remodeling and dysfunction [^111LbutQ] [^113RbPoB].

- **Atrial fibrillation**: AF promotes electrical and structural remodeling, fibrosis, and impaired LA function [^116fmyL2] [^114TT5be] [^113ucvet].

- **Hypertension and LV hypertrophy**: Elevated afterload and LV hypertrophy increase LA stiffness and reduce compliance [^116rns7X] [^111LbutQ].

- **Myocardial ischemia and cardiomyopathies**: Ischemia and infiltrative disease impair LA mechanics [^114zrK8o].

- **Aging and comorbidities**: Age, obesity, and diabetes contribute to LA remodeling and dysfunction [^111AveBV] [^115y4cgF].

---

## Clinical implications and consequences

Left atrial dysfunction has **major clinical consequences**:

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Increases AF risk and recurrence after ablation [^115PJG2L] [^114zr4C2].

- **Stroke and thromboembolism**: Impaired LA function promotes stasis and thrombus formation, increasing stroke risk even without AF [^114LryXt] [^114dTFxr].

- **Heart failure**: Predicts HF hospitalization [^113yFAR2] and progression, especially in HFpEF [^111fEB8a] [^111gESWE].

- **Exercise intolerance**: Reduced LA function limits cardiac output during exertion [^111KBfft] [^113PdomV].

---

## Diagnostic assessment

Accurate assessment relies on **multimodality imaging** [^115m5hkj]. Key echocardiographic thresholds for LA dysfunction include **LA reservoir strain < 23%** and LA emptying fraction < 55% [^116wGAz9] [^112cYWg7]:

| **Imaging modality** | **Parameters assessed** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Echocardiography | - LA volume index <br/> - LA emptying fraction <br/> - LA strain (reservoir, conduit, booster) | - First-line <br/> - Widely available <br/> - Early detection [^113goa2R] |
| Cardiac MRI | - LA volumes <br/> - LA strain <br/> - Fibrosis (LGE) | High reproducibility and detailed tissue characterization [^1118uH1b] [^111f4qVa] [^1136KdED] |
| Cardiac CT | LA volumes and LA function | Useful when MRI is contraindicated [^114TT5be] [^112xtQmX] |

---

## Prognostic significance

Left atrial dysfunction **independently predicts adverse outcomes**, including higher risks of incident and recurrent atrial fibrillation [^114TT5be] [^115PJG2L], increased ischemic stroke risk even without AF [^114LryXt] [^114dTFxr], and higher rates of heart failure hospitalization and mortality, notably in HFpEF [^111fEB8a] [^111gESWE]. It is also associated with higher all-cause mortality in diverse populations [^1118uH1b] [^1176s74M].

---

## Therapeutic interventions

Management targets **underlying causes** and LA remodeling:

- **Risk factor control**: Treat hypertension, diabetes, and obesity to reduce LA load [^115DZvVx] [^115y4cgF].

- **Rhythm control**: AF ablation or antiarrhythmic therapy can improve LA function and reduce AF burden [^113ucvet].

- **Anticoagulation**: Prevents thromboembolism in patients with AF or high stroke risk [^113ucvet].

- **Novel therapies**: Agents such as omecamtiv mecarbil may improve LA function and reduce AF/stroke risk [^112o5uVR].

---

Left atrial dysfunction is **impaired reservoir, conduit, or booster-pump function** [^113goa2R] that often precedes LA enlargement and is best detected by strain imaging [^116wGAz9]. It is a **strong, independent predictor of AF, stroke, and HF**, and early detection with echocardiography or CMR enables targeted therapy to improve outcomes.

### Relation of left atrial dysfunction to ischemic stroke in patients with coronary heart disease (from the Heart and Soul Study) [^114LryXt]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

This study sought to determine whether left atrial (LA) dysfunction independently predicts ischemic stroke. Atrial fibrillation (AF) impairs LA function and is associated with ischemic stroke; however, ischemic stroke frequently occurs in patients without known AF. The direct relation between LA function and the risk of ischemic stroke is unknown. We performed transthoracic echocardiography at rest in 983 subjects with stable coronary heart disease. To quantify LA dysfunction, we used the left atrial function index (LAFI), a validated formula incorporating LA volumes at end-atrial systole and diastole. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between LAFI and ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Over a mean follow-up of 7.1 years, 58 study participants (5.9%) experienced an ischemic stroke or TIA. In patients without known baseline AF or warfarin therapy (n = 893), participants in the lowest quintile of LAFI had more than three times the risk of ischemic stroke or TIA (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 9.7, p = 0.03) compared with those in the highest quintile. For each standard deviation (18.8 U) decrease in LAFI, the hazard of ischemic stroke or TIA increased by 50% (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 2.1, p = 0.04). Among measured echocardiographic indexes of LA function, including LA volume, LAFI was the strongest predictor of ischemic stroke or TIA. In conclusion, LA dysfunction is an independent risk factor for stroke or TIA, even in patients without baseline AF.

### Subclinical left atrial dysfunction profiles for prediction of cardiac outcome in the general population [^116wGAz9]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Echocardiographic definitions of subclinical left atrial dysfunction based on epidemiological data remain scarce. In this population study, we derived outcome-driven thresholds for echocardiographic left atrial function parameters discriminating between normal and abnormal values.

In 1,306 individuals (mean age, 50.7 years; 51.6% women), we echocardiographically assessed left atrial function and LV global longitudinal strain. We derived cut-off values for left atrial emptying fraction (LAEF), left atrial function index (LAFI), and left atrial reservoir strain (LARS) to define left atrial dysfunction using receiver-operating curve threshold analysis. The main outcome was the incidence of cardiac events and atrial fibrillation (AFib) on average 8.5 years later.

For the prediction of new-onset AFib, left atrial cut-offs yielding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity (highest Youden index) were: LAEF less than 55%, LAFI less than 40.5, and LARS less than 23%. Applying these cut-offs, abnormal LAEF, LAFI, and LARS were, respectively, present in 27%, 37.1%, and 18.1% of the cohort. Abnormal LARS (< 23%) was independently associated with a higher risk for cardiac events and new-onset AFib (P ≤ 0.012). Participants with both abnormal LAEF and LARS presented a significantly higher risk to develop cardiac events (hazard ratio: 2.10; P = 0.014) and AFib (hazard ratio: 6.45; P = 0.0036) than normal counterparts. The concomitant presence of an impaired LARS and LV global longitudinal strain improved prognostic accuracy beyond a clinical risk model for cardiac events.

### Prognostic utility and clinical significance of cardiac mechanics in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Importance of left atrial strain [^111gESWE]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) enlargement is associated with adverse events in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the role of LA mechanics, specifically LA strain measures, in HFpEF has not been well studied. We hypothesized that in HFpEF, reduced (worse) LA strain is a key pathophysiologic abnormality and is a stronger correlate of adverse events than left ventricular or right ventricular longitudinal strain.

- **Methods and results**: We evaluated baseline LA function in 308 patients with HFpEF who were followed up longitudinally for adverse outcomes. All patients underwent speckle-tracking echocardiography for measurement of left ventricular longitudinal strain, right ventricular free wall strain, and LA booster, conduit, and reservoir strains. The clinical and prognostic significance of left ventricular, right ventricular, and LA strain measures was assessed by regression analyses. The mean age was 65 ± 13 years, 64% were women, 26% had atrial fibrillation, and LA enlargement was present in the majority of patients (67%). Decreased LA reservoir strain was associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance (P < 0.0001) and decreased peak oxygen consumption (P = 0.0001). Of the left ventricular, right ventricular, and LA strain measures, LA reservoir strain was the strongest correlate of adverse events and was independently associated with the composite outcome of cardiovascular hospitalization or death (adjusted hazard ratio per 1-SD decrease in LA strain, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.15–2.07; P = 0.006).

- **Conclusions**: Abnormal indices of LA mechanics, particularly LA reservoir strain, are significant in HFpEF.

### Left atrial phasic function by cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking is a strong predictor of incident cardiovascular events [^1118uH1b]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The prognostic importance of left atrial (LA) dysfunction is increasingly recognized. Magnetic resonance imaging can provide excellent visualization of the LA wall. We aimed to study the association of LA dysfunction measured using feature-tracking magnetic resonance imaging with incident adverse cardiovascular events among subjects with or without heart failure (HF) at baseline.

- **Methods and results**: We prospectively studied 640 adults without HF (n = 419), HF with preserved ejection fraction (n = 101), or HF with reduced ejection fraction (n = 120). We measured phasic LA function by volumetric and feature-tracking methods to derive longitudinal strain. The composite outcome of incident HF hospitalization or death was adjudicated during a median follow-up of 37.1 months. Measures of LA phasic function were more prominently impaired in subjects with HF with reduced ejection fraction than among subjects with HF with preserved ejection fraction.

In unadjusted Cox proportional hazards models, all measures of phasic LA function and volumes (maximum, minimum, and diastatic) were associated with the composite outcome. However, in analyses that adjusted for clinical risk factors, HF status, maximum LA volume, left ventricular mass, and left ventricular ejection fraction, measures of conduit and reservoir LA function, but not booster-pump function, were associated with the composite outcome. The strongest associations were observed for conduit longitudinal strain (standardized hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49–0.88; P = 0.004) and conduit strain rate.

### Left atrial phasic function: Physiology, clinical assessment and prognostic value [^113goa2R]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) phasic function provides significant insights into the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. LA function is described in three phases: reservoir (atrial filling, during systole), conduit (passive emptying, during early diastole), and contractile (active emptying, during late diastole). LA phasic function can be evaluated by different imaging modalities and a variety of techniques, including volumetric analysis, deformation (strain), and Doppler methods. LA phasic function, particularly LA reservoir strain, is more sensitive and provides earlier detection of LA dysfunction than alterations in LA volume.

LA function parameters have also demonstrated significant diagnostic and prognostic value, particularly in heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. However, there remain barriers to the implementation of phasic function parameters in clinical practice and guidelines. This review outlines the physiology of LA phasic function, methods of assessment, and its diagnostic and prognostic utility in varying pathologies.

### Left atrial functional impairment as a predictor of atrial fibrillation: insights from cardiac CT [^114TT5be]. European Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Both LA remodeling and dysfunction contribute to AF risk. LA remodeling occurs in response to a chronic pathological stimulus such as hypertension and increased fat mass and is associated with an increased risk of AF events. LA enlargement is often used clinically as a simple measure of LA structural remodeling. However, LA structural remodeling is the result of a complex pathophysiological process that involves alterations in cardiomyocyte, fibroblast, and non-collagen infiltrative compartments of the atrium and is accompanied by functional LA impairment.

The development of AF can contribute to adverse atrial remodeling and dilatation. However, this phenomenon has been demonstrated to occur predominantly in persistent AF. We observed a remarkable similarity in LA size and function between individuals with previous paroxysmal AF episodes and those at risk for future AF. These results suggest that in patients with a low AF burden, AF is a consequence of a dysfunctional LA rather than its cause. In these patients, LA enlargement is secondary to associated processes causing LA pressure and/or volume overload.

There is growing evidence that a large proportion of patients who develop AF (especially paroxysmal AF) do not have an enlarged LA, suggesting that LA dysfunction per se (without overt LA remodeling) increases the propensity to develop AF. We identified global LA dysfunction in approximately half of subjects with normal LAVI. Furthermore, the increased LA volume explained only about 14% of the variability in LATEF, with the remainder determined by other risk factors such as age.

### Left atrial dimension and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with and without atrial fibrillation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1176s74M]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of left atrial (LA) dimensions may differ between patients with and without atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **Methods**: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for studies that investigated the association between LA echocardiographic parameters measured by transthoracic echocardiography and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with or without AF. Data were independently abstracted by two reviewers and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. The primary outcome was incident stroke or thromboembolic events. Secondary outcomes were heart failure, all-cause mortality, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE).

- **Results**: Twenty-three studies on patients with AF (14,939 patients) and 68 studies on patients without AF (50,720 patients) were included in this systematic review. Increasing LA diameter was significantly associated with stroke and thromboembolic events in patients without AF (risk ratio (RR) 1.38, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.87; p = 0.03) but not in patients with AF (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.07; p = 0.27; p for difference = 0.05). Increasing LA diameter index was significantly associated with MACE in both patients with AF (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.17; p < 0.001) and those without AF (RR 2.98, 95% CI 1.90 to 4.66; p < 0.001), with stronger effects in non-AF populations (p for difference < 0.001). Greater LA volume index was significantly associated with the risk of MACE in patients with AF (RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.02; p = 0.03) and in non-AF populations (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.10; p < 0.001), with the association being stronger in individuals without AF (p for difference < 0.001).

### Left atrial size: Physiologic determinants and clinical applications [^113RbPoB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) enlargement has been proposed as a barometer of diastolic burden and a predictor of common cardiovascular outcomes such as atrial fibrillation, stroke, congestive heart failure, and cardiovascular death. It has been shown that advancing age alone does not independently contribute to LA enlargement, and the impact of gender on LA volume can largely be accounted for by the differences in body surface area between men and women. Therefore, enlargement of the left atrium reflects remodeling associated with pathophysiologic processes.

In this review, we discuss the normal size and phasic function of the left atrium. Further, we outline the clinically important aspects and pitfalls of evaluating LA size, and the methods for assessing LA function using echocardiography. Finally, we review the determinants of LA size and remodeling, and we describe the evidence regarding the prognostic value of LA size. The use of LA volume for risk stratification is an evolving science. More data are required with respect to the natural history of LA remodeling in disease, the degree of LA modifiability with therapy, and whether regression of LA size translates into improved cardiovascular outcomes.

### The emerging role of atrial strain assessed by cardiac MRI in different cardiovascular settings: an up-to-date review [^111f4qVa]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

The function of the left atrium (LA) in modulating left ventricular filling is very important and can be subdivided into three consecutive phases: (1) a reservoir for pulmonary veins during left ventricle (LV) systole; (2) a conduit for blood flow from pulmonary veins toward the LV during LV early diastole; and (3) a booster pump to increase LV filling during late diastole.

Over the past decade, LA size has been widely recognized as an essential marker of adverse cardiovascular events. However, LA enlargement itself does not explain the whole LA function during the cardiac cycle. On the other hand, LA contractile function has been confirmed as a marker of LA functional status and a sensitive tool for detecting early-state diseases.

Recently, strain analysis has been proposed as a tool to assess LA phasic function. LA volume and function are traditionally evaluated by echocardiography. In this scenario, speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) was the first modality to assess atrial strain, but it has several limitations, including a suboptimal field of view in the setting of poor acoustic windows and high interobserver variability. Conversely, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a mainstay in the non-invasive assessment of LA volume and function. Kowallick et al. showed the potential of cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) for assessing LA strain and strain rate (SR) parameters. Several studies have demonstrated that LA deformation detected by CMR-FT can allow for an accurate and reproducible analysis of LA function.

### Improving the assessment of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction by including left atrial strain in the algorithm [^112cYWg7]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). High credibility.

The latest guidelines on echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) leave a significant proportion of patients with LVDD status undetermined. We aimed to examine the implication of an alternative algorithm incorporating left atrial (LA) strain as a tiebreaker on the indeterminate LVDD category.

- **Methods and results**: We included 823 patients who underwent echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance within 7 days. LVDD was assessed by echocardiography following contemporary guidelines and an alternative algorithm including LA reservoir strain as a tiebreaker. LVDD was examined for its association with LV myocardial scar burden by cardiac magnetic resonance and a composite outcome. There were 275 patients (33%) who had LVDD, of whom 119 had advanced grades of LVDD (grades II-III), and 117 (14%) had an indeterminate LVDD grade. When LA strain was applied at cutpoints of 18%, 24%, and 35%, patients were reclassified as normal or LVDD-dependent accordingly. Reclassification allowed a similar outcome risk stratification as the guidelines.

- **Conclusions**: LA reservoir strain improved LVDD assessment by eliminating indeterminate status/grade while maintaining the same effective outcome stratification as the guidelines.

### Left atrial disease and left atrial reverse remodelling across different stages of heart failure development and progression: a new target for prevention and treatment [^112o5uVR]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

While the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on atrial function have not been assessed, at the time of writing, new drugs acting directly on cardiac function may impact the left atrium (LA). Compared with placebo, the myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil improved LA function, as evidenced by a reduced LA minimal volume and a larger emptying fraction in the Chronic Oral Study of Myosin Activation to Increase Contractility in HF (COSMIC-HF) trial. It also reduced the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke, likely through an improvement in LA function, in the larger Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in HF (GALACTIC-HF) trial.

Rhythm control for AF may improve LA function and patient outcomes. These effects, shown also after pulmonary vein isolation, may be particularly effective in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), such as 79% of the patients analyzed in the Catheter Ablation versus Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation (CABANA) trial. Improvement in LA function, as well as in outcomes, has also been demonstrated in the Catheter Ablation versus Standard Conventional Therapy in Patients with Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Atrial Fibrillation (CASTLE-AF) trial, which enrolled patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

Our review shows that LA reverse remodelling may occur in clinical practice and may relate to better outcomes. Changes in LA size and function may be related to the progression of cardiac function and thus be a target of treatment or a surrogate measurement of the severity of cardiac conditions.

### Reproducibility of left atrial function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [^1136KdED]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) remodeling is associated with left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. LA volume (LAV) and emptying fraction (LAEF) are recognized as predictors of adverse outcomes across a range of cardiovascular diseases associated with LV diastolic dysfunction, including aortic stenosis (AS), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic kidney disease, and heart failure with preserved and reduced ejection fraction. Additionally, LA remodeling post-intervention, such as aortic valve replacement, predicts long-term outcomes.

LA strain is an emerging imaging marker of LA function, describing LA deformation. Traditionally, LA function is assessed by measures such as LAV and LAEF. Assessing LA deformation may overcome the limitations of volumetric assessment, such as geometric assumptions using the biplane area length method, and may also provide early detection of functional impairment. Strain abnormalities, even with normal LA size, have been shown in diabetic and hypertensive patients and those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. LA strain has been reported to correlate with LV filling pressure and is a sensitive marker for early LV diastolic dysfunction. It is also recognized as a predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in women and in diseases associated with ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

Strain and strain rate measurement is now possible from routinely acquired cine images. This may be advantageous due to the unlimited imaging windows provided by CMR, which is recognized for its versatility.

### Left atrial functional impairment as a predictor of atrial fibrillation: Insights from cardiac CT [^112xtQmX]. European Radiology (2025). High credibility.

A strong association exists between left atrial (LA) structural remodeling and the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). The role of LA function in AF prediction remains unclear. We studied the relationship between LA function and incident AF using cardiac CT.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent multiphasic cardiac CT. LA volumes and parameters of LA global, reservoir, and booster function were calculated. The association between measures of LA function and incident AF was analyzed using multivariable Cox regression adjusting for clinical variables, LA volume, and left ventricular function.

- **Results**: A total of 1025 patients (age 64 years ± 14) were evaluated. Over a median of 3.9 years, 90 patients developed AF. There was a significant association between LA total emptying fraction (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.05; 95% CI: 1.02–1.05 per 1% decrease, p < 0.001), LA reservoir function (HR 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02–1.06 per 1mL/m² decrease in LA expansion index, p < 0.001), and passive LA emptying (HR 1.08; 95% CI: 1.03–1.13 per 1% decrease in LA passive emptying fraction, p < 0.001) with incident AF, but no association with LA booster function. Incorporating LA function into predictive models improved risk stratification beyond clinical variables and LA volume. Mediation analysis demonstrated that 46% of the effect of LA volume on AF was mediated via LA dysfunction.

- **Conclusion**: LA functional impairment is common even in patients with normal LA volume and provides additional prognostic information for AF risk. The findings underscore the significance of assessing LA function in the evaluation and management of AF risk.

### Left atrial disease and left atrial reverse remodelling across different stages of heart failure development and progression: A new target for prevention and treatment [^115DZvVx]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

The left atrium is a dynamic chamber with unique characteristics. Stressors and disease mechanisms can significantly alter its structure and function, leading to left atrial remodelling and disease. Left atrial disease is a predictor of poor outcomes and may result from left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, as well as neurohormonal and inflammatory activation. It can actively contribute to the progression and clinical course of heart failure through multiple mechanisms, such as affecting left ventricular filling and fostering the development of atrial fibrillation and subsequent embolic events. There is growing evidence that therapy may improve left atrial function and reverse left atrial remodelling, although whether this leads to changes in patient prognosis remains unknown.

In this review, we report on data regarding changes in left atrial size and function across different stages of heart failure development and progression.

- **Drug therapies, lifestyle interventions, and procedures**: At each stage, these have been associated with improvements in left atrial structure and function, specifically a reduction in left atrial volume and/or an improvement in left atrial strain function. This process, known as left atrial reverse remodelling, has, in some cases, been associated with improvements in clinical outcomes. Further evidence is needed, particularly concerning the possible role of left atrial reverse remodelling as an independent mechanism affecting the patient's clinical course and regarding better standardization of clinically meaningful changes in left atrial measurements.

### Left atrial remodeling and function in advanced heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction [^113yFAR2]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2015). High credibility.

Left atrial (LA) structure and function are altered in most heart failure (HF) patients, but there may be fundamental differences in LA properties between heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

- **Methods and results**: One hundred ninety-eight HF patients (51% HFpEF, New York Heart Association 3.1 ± 0.7) and 40 HF-free controls underwent catheterization, echocardiography, and follow-up. Compared with controls, HF patients had larger and more dysfunctional left atria. At identical mean LA pressure (20 versus 20 mmHg; P = 0.9), HFrEF patients had larger LA volumes (LA volume index 50 versus 41 mL/m(2); P < 0.001), whereas HFpEF patients had higher LA peak pressures, lower LA minimal pressures, higher LA stiffness (0.79 versus 0.48 mmHg/mL; P < 0.001), greater LA pulsatility (19 versus 13 mmHg; P < 0.001), and higher wall stress variations. Despite smaller LA volumes, better function, and less mitral regurgitation, HFpEF patients had more atrial fibrillation (42 versus 26%; P = 0.02). LA dysfunction was associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular dysfunction in both HF phenotypes. After a median follow-up of 350 days, 31 HFpEF and 28 HFrEF patients died. LA function (total LA EF) was associated with lower mortality in HFpEF (hazard ratio 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.2–0.9; P < 0.05), but not in HFrEF.

- **Conclusions**: HFrEF is characterized by greater eccentric LA remodeling, whereas HFpEF is characterized by increased LA stiffness, which might contribute to a greater atrial fibrillation burden. LA function is associated with pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular dysfunction in both HF phenotypes.

### Association of atrial fibrillation progression with left atrial functional reserve and its reversibility [^114zr4C2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia encountered in daily practice, affecting a growing number of people worldwide due to the aging populations. AF carries a significant risk for heart failure (HF), particularly HF with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, with a 7-fold elevated risk, and the incidence of HF increases with AF progression.

Over the past three decades, catheter ablation of AF has evolved from an investigational procedure to an established therapy for restoring sinus rhythm, and recent studies have demonstrated its beneficial effect for HF prevention. Left atrial (LA) functional alteration plays a key role in the incidence and maintenance of AF as well as subsequent HF occurrence. LA reserves blood from the pulmonary vein and modifies left ventricular (LV) filling in response to the variation of preload. Impaired LA reservoir strain (LARS), assessed by speckle-tracking echocardiography, reflects reduced LA compliance, which precedes LA enlargement and serves as a sensitive and reliable marker of AF recurrence and adverse cardiovascular events in patients with AF. More recently, particular attention has been given to LA functional reserve, which reflects LA distensibility corresponding to increased preload in patients with HF, and LARS response to passive leg lifting (PLL) — a simple and noninvasive maneuver that rapidly increases venous return to the central circulation — corresponds to LA functional reserve. However, the relationship between the progression of AF and LA functional remodeling is not well described.

### Structural and functional remodeling of the left atrium: Clinical and therapeutic implications for atrial fibrillation [^116fmyL2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) structural and functional remodeling reflects a spectrum of pathophysiological changes that occur in response to specific stressors. These changes include alterations at the levels of ionic channels, cellular energy balance, neurohormonal expression, inflammatory response, and physiological adaptations. There is convincing evidence demonstrating an important association between LA remodeling and atrial fibrillation (AF). Measures that prevent, attenuate, or halt these processes of LA remodeling may have a major public health impact concerning the epidemic of AF. This review describes the mechanisms involved in LA remodeling and highlights existing and potential therapeutic options for its reversal, and implications for AF development.

### Left atrial volume predicts abnormal exercise left ventricular filling pressure [^113PdomV]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Latent heart failure at rest can be observed in several patients upon exercise. Considering left atrial (LA) remodeling as the reflection of the cumulative effects of the left ventricular (LV) filling pressure (FP) over time, our aim was to investigate whether the LA volume would predict abnormal exercise LVFP.

- **Methods and results**: Ninety patients (58.6 ± 10.8 years, 74 men) underwent exercise echocardiography. The LA maximal volume was measured by the Simpson method and indexed to body surface area. LVFP was assessed by the ratio between early peak diastolic velocities of mitral inflow and the septal annular mitral plane (E/e'). Exercise E/e' > 13 was used as a threshold to define abnormal LVFP. Indexed LA volume was correlated with E/e' at rest (r = 0.37, P = 0.003), but the correlation was better with exercise E/e' (r = 0.54, P < 0.001). Patients with exercise E/e' > 13, compared with the rest of the population, were older and achieved milder effort. An LA volume index > 33 mL/m² predicted an abnormal exercise LVFP with 91% sensitivity and 78% specificity. None of the patients with an LA volume index below this threshold had an exercise E/e' > 13.

Exercise LVFP is a determinant of LA size. The LA volume index seems helpful for predicting abnormal exercise LVFP. The potential use of LA remodeling to identify the patients benefitting most from exercise echocardiography should be investigated.

### Left atrial strain and compliance in the diagnostic evaluation of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^115m5hkj]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Low credibility.

The function of the left atrium (LA) is impaired in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and predicts disease severity and the risk of adverse outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate whether LA strain could enhance the diagnosis of HFpEF.

Consecutive patients with unexplained exertional dyspnoea and suitable image quality for measuring LA strain underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing to ascertain the presence of HFpEF or non-cardiac causes of dyspnoea (NCD). LA reservoir strain was measured in all patients. In patients with sinus rhythm, LA conduit and booster strain were also measured. LA strain was measurable in 363 of 378 examinations (96.5%; HFpEF: 238, NCD: 125). LA reservoir strain was significantly different between patients with HFpEF and NCD, showing means of 29 ± 16% versus 40 ± 13%, respectively.

- **Predictive markers**: Significant predictive markers included tricuspid regurgitation velocity > 2.8 m/s (+0.082, P = 0.0085), left ventricular hypertrophy (+0.0159, P < 0.0001), and left ventricular global longitudinal strain (+0.0198, P < 0.0001).
- **LA compliance**: Indexing LA reservoir strain to estimated LA pressure (E/e') as a surrogate for LA compliance improved diagnostic performance (AUC 0.772, P < 0.0001), with a +0.053 increase compared to LA reservoir strain alone (P = 0.003).

Left atrial reservoir strain may provide enhanced diagnostic accuracy beyond conventional measures.

### Atrial fibrillation burden: A new outcome predictor and therapeutic target [^113ucvet]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

At the same time, the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) enhances the risk of heart failure events, stroke, and cardiovascular death.

- **Atrial fibrillation and left ventricular function**: Atrial fibrillation directly impairs ventricular function and can result in arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy that will reverse after restoring normal sinus rhythm using AF ablation. In some patients, heart failure can predispose them to AF, as AF and heart failure share genetic and acquired pathomechanisms. A high AF burden is associated with more heart failure events in a large population of patients with paroxysmal AF. There is a strong bidirectional association between heart failure and AF burden, where heart failure can contribute to AF and vice versa. Controlled clinical trials of rhythm control and AF ablation — interventions that lower AF burden — reduce heart failure events in patients with reduced left ventricular function and AF. Ongoing studies testing AF ablation will determine whether reducing AF burden can improve outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and AF (NCT055008256).

- **Atrial fibrillation and stroke**: Reduced flow in the left atrium, especially in the left atrial appendage, endothelial dysfunction, and activation of local and systemic prothrombotic signaling combine to enhance thrombogenesis in the left atrium and increase cardioembolic strokes in patients with AF. This leads to cardioembolic strokes that are commonly found in patients with AF. The incidence of cardioembolic strokes can be significantly reduced by oral anticoagulants.

### Phenotypes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: An illustrative review of MRI findings [^114zrK8o]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The left atrium (LA) is often enlarged in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients, and its size provides important prognostic information. An enlarged LA is related to increased morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular patients. It is considered a marker for risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and potentially lethal arrhythmic events among HCM patients.

Volumetric MR quantification is the best approach to assess LA size, though it may be time-consuming. An area ≧ 15 cm²/m² and a transverse diameter ≧ 2.8 cm/m² in the four-chamber view are valuable alternatives for identifying LA enlargement. The cause of LA enlargement is multifactorial. The most common mechanisms are systolic anterior motion (SAM)-related mitral regurgitation and elevated left ventricular (LV) filling pressures. Mild or moderate LA dilatation is common and is related to LV diastolic dysfunction. Severe LA dilatation is prevalent when mitral regurgitation is associated with left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in HCM, occurring in 20% of cases. LA remodeling is the strongest predictor of atrial fibrillation, independent of age and functional class.

The hallmarks of HCM include left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and microvascular ischaemia. It is yet to be determined if there is a causative link between these features. Microvascular ischaemia in HCM, attributed to increased oxygen requirements due to hypertrophy, impaired ventricular relaxation, microvascular dysfunction of intramyocardial arterioles, and LVOT obstruction, is associated with chest pain, clinical deterioration, diastolic dysfunction, and adverse outcomes.

### Left atrial functional impairment as a predictor of atrial fibrillation: Insights from cardiac CT [^115PJG2L]. European Radiology (2025). High credibility.

- **Objectives**: A strong association exists between left atrial (LA) structural remodeling and the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). The role of LA function in AF prediction remains unclear. We studied the relationship between LA function and incident AF using cardiac CT.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent multiphasic cardiac CT. LA volumes and parameters of LA global, reservoir, and booster function were calculated. The association between measures of LA function and incident AF was analyzed using multivariable Cox regression adjusting for clinical variables, LA volume, and left ventricular function.

- **Results**: 1025 patients (age 64 years ± 14) were evaluated. Over a median of 3.9 years, 90 patients developed AF. There was a significant association between LA total emptying fraction (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.05; 95% CI: 1.02–1.05 per 1% decrease, p < 0.001), LA reservoir function (HR 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02–1.06 per 1 mL/m² decrease in LA expansion index, p < 0.001), and passive LA emptying (HR 1.08; 95% CI: 1.03–1.13 per 1% decrease in LA passive emptying fraction, p < 0.001) with incident AF, but no association with LA booster function. Incorporating LA function into predictive models improved risk stratification beyond clinical variables and LA volume. Mediation analysis demonstrated that 46% of the effect of LA volume on AF was mediated via LA dysfunction.

- **Conclusion**: LA functional impairment is common even in patients with normal LA volume and provides additional prognostic information for AF risk. The findings underscore the significance of evaluating LA function to enhance AF risk prediction strategies.

### Left atrial volumes and function, and long-term incidence of ischemic stroke in the general population [^114dTFxr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Approximately 25% of ischemic strokes occur without an identified cause, with undetected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) often suspected as the underlying reason. Several studies utilizing prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring following cryptogenic ischemic stroke have demonstrated increased detection rates of AF lasting more than 2 minutes within the first year. However, the clinical significance and consequence of short runs of subclinical AF post-stroke remain debated. Detection of AF beyond the first year could represent natural progression rather than causation of ischemic stroke. These queries have prompted growing interest in exploring an atrial cardiomyopathy entity as a potential substrate for both AF and ischemic stroke.

Reduction in left atrial (LA) global function, as indicated by left atrial ejection fraction (LAEF) observed in our study, could function as an early marker of a functional component of atrial cardiomyopathy. Notably, a correlation between LAEF, diastolic measures, and more extensive fibrosis has been established, highlighting the complex interplay between cardiac structure and function. The hypothesis of atrial cardiomyopathy and its possible correlation with ischemic stroke is supported by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging studies of the LA utilizing late gadolinium enhancement as a surrogate marker of LA fibrosis. These studies have exhibited increased LA with late gadolinium enhancement in patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source.

### Left atrial disease and left atrial reverse remodelling across different stages of heart failure development and progression: A new target for prevention and treatment [^115y4cgF]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022).

The left atrium (LA) is a thin-walled dynamic chamber that plays an important role in global cardiac performance. It contributes to left ventricle (LV) filling and cardiac output and maintains a dynamic interaction with the LV. In response to varying stressors (i.e. electrical, mechanical, and metabolic), the LA can undergo a remodelling process resulting in its persistent dilatation with functional impairment. LA enlargement and dysfunction are well-established markers of diastolic and systolic dysfunction, as well as predictors of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, including atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke, heart failure (HF), and subsequent mortality. This relationship is highly related to LV function and has been shown across all the ejection fractions, even in advanced HF. However, recent data suggest a possible independent contribution of LA dysfunction in HF.

In the past decades, the concept of LA remodelling has evolved, and the contribution of the LA to the pathophysiology of HF has grown in appreciation. Indeed, changes in LA structure and function may be either a marker of HF severity or a mechanism actively contributing to the progression of cardiac dysfunction. One manifestation of LA disease, AF, contributes substantially to morbidity in patients with HF. Recent data suggest that timely therapeutic intervention may attenuate the process of deleterious LA remodelling and potentially promote reverse LA remodelling, with a consequent improvement in clinical symptoms and outcomes. In contrast, age and endurance exercise are related to LA enlargement even in the absence of HF.

### Left atrium and cardiovascular risk: Does functionality matter more than size [^111AveBV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The left atrium (LA) is often regarded as a biomarker of cardiovascular risk. It serves several important functions: it modulates left ventricular filling and cardiovascular performance by functioning as a reservoir for pulmonary venous return during ventricular systole; acts as a conduit for pulmonary venous return during early ventricular diastole; and functions as a booster pump that augments ventricular filling during late ventricular diastole. It is highly dynamic and demonstrates structural, functional, and electrical remodeling in a time-dependent manner in response to various pathophysiological insults.

The hallmark of structural remodeling is atrial dilatation, frequently accompanied by increased interstitial fibrosis with cardiac structural alterations. Functional impairment may occur with or without alteration in LA size. Remodeling that occurs in the initial phase is often reversible, in contrast to remodeling that occurs with ongoing "stressors" over a longer duration. These maladaptive changes have a strong association with a wide array of conditions, including heart failure, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea.

In tandem with structural change, electrophysiologic abnormalities develop, including global and regional conduction slowing and changes in refractoriness, predisposing to the onset of atrial arrhythmias and ultimately atrial fibrillation (AF).

### Cardiovascular and systemic determinants of exercise capacity in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111KBfft]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Left atrial enlargement is increasingly recognized for its association with adverse cardiac outcomes, including atrial fibrillation, stroke, and heart failure. Additionally, the left atrium plays an important role in the cardiovascular response to exercise, especially if left ventricular (LV) diastology is impaired. In diastolic LV dysfunction, prolonged relaxation time leads to a greater dependence on the atrial contribution at end-diastole for optimal filling. Diastolic filling time is inversely proportional to heart rate, and this association is more pronounced during exercise. Reduced LV relaxation time leads to a greater dependence on atrial contribution at end-diastole for optimal filling. Impaired atrial systolic function will compromise cardiac output with effort, which underscores the role of the left atrium in maintaining exercise capacity.

- **Atrial geometry, function, and electrophysiological alterations**: These are well-defined in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and in atrial fibrillation, and have been closely linked with reduced exercise capacity and heart failure-related outcomes. However, atrial myopathy in type 2 diabetes (T2D) appears distinct. In adults with T2D, abnormalities of left atrial geometry have been described, but the results are contradictory. While some studies reported smaller LA volumes in subjects with T2D, others have shown the opposite. Smaller atrial volumes are observed in T2D in the presence of HFpEF, a disease typically associated with increased LA volumes. We have recently compared patients with HFpEF with and without T2D, noting higher BMI and higher filling pressures (E/e′) than patients without T2D.

### Left atrial structure and function, and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111LbutQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Defining left atrial (LA) function has recently emerged as a powerful parameter, particularly in the evaluation of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Echocardiographic assessment of LVDD by echocardiography remains a challenging task; recent recommendations provide a simpler approach than previous ones. However, the shortcomings of the proposed approach, including transmitral flow, tissue velocity, maximum left atrial volume (LAV), and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, lead to the presence and severity of LVDD remaining undetermined in a significant proportion of patients.

Maximum LAV is a surrogate measure of the chronicity and severity of LVDD, but LAV alone is an insensitive biomarker of the early phases of LVDD, because the LA may take time to remodel. Because the primary function of the LA is to modulate LV filling, it is not surprising that functional LA changes become evident at the earliest stages of LVDD. Moreover, LA function may provide additive value, not only in diagnosing LVDD but also in grading its severity and in monitoring the effects of treatment.

The review provides a critical appraisal of the existing evidence for the role of LA metrics in the evaluation of LVDD and consequent heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

### Left atrial function predicts heart failure hospitalization in subjects with preserved ejection fraction and coronary heart disease: Longitudinal data from the Heart and Soul Study [^111fEB8a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

This study sought to determine whether left atrial (LA) dysfunction predicts heart failure (HF) hospitalization in subjects with preserved baseline ejection fraction (EF).

Among patients with preserved EF, factors leading to HF are not fully understood. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated LA dysfunction at the time of HF, but longitudinal data on antecedent atrial function are lacking. We performed resting transthoracic echocardiography in 855 subjects with coronary heart disease and EF ≥ 50%. The left atrial functional index (LAFI) was calculated as ([LA emptying fraction × left ventricular outflow tract-velocity time integral] / [indexed LA end-systolic volume]), where LA emptying fraction was defined as (LA end-systolic volume − LA end-diastolic volume) / LA end-systolic volume. We used Cox models to evaluate the association between LAFI and HF hospitalization.

Over a median follow-up of 7.9 years, 106 participants (12.4%) were hospitalized for HF. Rates of HF hospitalization were inversely proportional to quartile (Q) of LAFI: Q1, 47 per 1,000 person-years; Q2, 18.3; Q3, 9.6; and Q4, 5.3 (p < 0.001). Each standard deviation decrease in LAFI was associated with a 2.6-fold increased hazard of adverse cardiovascular outcomes (unadjusted hazard ratio: 2.6, 95% confidence interval: 2.1 to 3.3, p < 0.001), and the association persisted even after adjustment for clinical risk factors, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and a wide range of echocardiographic parameters (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.0).

### Hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy have global left atrial dysfunction and impaired atrio-ventricular coupling [^116rns7X]. Journal of hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to comprehensively investigate left atrial (LA) reservoir, conduit, and booster pump functions, as well as their predictors in patients with primary systemic arterial hypertension (HTN) and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy.

- **Methods**: Thirty patients with HTN and LV hypertrophy, but no history of atrial arrhythmia or heart failure, were compared with 29 normotensive controls. Speckle-tracking echocardiography of the LA wall was used to measure systolic and diastolic strains and strain rates. Early diastolic velocity of transmitral flow/early diastolic mitral annular motion velocity (E/E')/peak systolic LA strain (S-LAs) was used as an index of LA stiffness.

- **Results**: HTN patients had higher LV mass index, impaired LV diastolic function, and higher LA volume index than controls. LA reservoir, conduit, and booster pump functions were significantly lower and LA stiffness was greater. Multiple regression analysis indicated that increased LV mass and LV filling pressures, as well as reduced LV strain or E', were predictors for reduced atrial function.

- **Conclusion**: HTN patients showed a significant impairment of the three components of LA function. These changes were correlated with LV hypertrophy and dysfunction, presumably related to LA fibrotic changes, underlining the importance of LA-LV coupling. The prognostic value of these new speckle-tracking echocardiography-based LA strain indices needs to be evaluated by future studies.

### Atrial dysfunction in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation [^111ecd81]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal and permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) are common in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This study sought to determine the implications of left atrial (LA) myopathy and dysrhythmia across the spectrum of AF burden in HFpEF.

Consecutive patients with HFpEF (n = 285) and control subjects (n = 146) underwent invasive exercise testing and echocardiographic assessment of cardiac structure, function, and pericardial restraint. Patients with HFpEF were categorized into stages of AF progression: 181 (65%) had no history of AF, 49 (18%) had paroxysmal AF, and 48 (17%) had permanent AF. Patients with permanent AF were more congested with greater pulmonary vascular disease and lower cardiac output. LA volumes increased, while LA compliance, LA reservoir strain, and right ventricular function decreased with increasing AF burden. The presence of permanent AF was characterized by a distinct pathophysiology, with greater total heart volume caused by atrial dilatation, leading to elevated filling pressures through heightened pericardial restraint. Survival decreased with increasing AF burden. Ten-year progression to permanent AF was common, particularly in paroxysmal AF (52%), and the likelihood of AF progression increased with higher AF stage, poorer LA compliance, and lower LA strain.

LA compliance and mechanics progressively decline with increasing AF burden in HFpEF, increasing the risk for new onset AF and progressive AF. These changes promote development of a unique phenotype of HFpEF.

### Prognostic relevance of left atrial dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116nQYQT]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) size is an established marker of risk for adverse outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the independent prognostic importance of LA function in HFpEF is not known.

- **Methods and results**: We assessed LA function measured by speckle-tracking echocardiography in 357 patients with HFpEF enrolled in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial who were in sinus rhythm at the time of echocardiography. Lower peak LA strain, indicating LA dysfunction, was associated with older age, higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, worse LV and right ventricular systolic function, and worse LV diastolic function.

At a mean follow-up of 31 months (interquartile range: 18–43 months), 91 patients (25.5%) experienced the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, and aborted sudden death. Lower peak LA strain was associated with a higher risk of the composite endpoint (hazard ratio: 0.96 per unit of reduction in strain; 95% confidence interval: 0.94–0.99; P = 0.009) and of HF hospitalization alone (hazard ratio: 0.95 per unit of reduction in strain; 95% confidence interval: 0.92–0.98; P = 0.003). The association of LA strain with incident HF hospitalization remained significant after adjustment for clinical confounders, but not after further adjustment for LV global longitudinal strain and the E/E' ratio, parameters of LV systolic and diastolic function, respectively.

### Integration of left atrial function assessment, genetic risk, and clinical risk factors improves prediction of incident atrial fibrillation [^111qS23q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a serious public health concern, with increasing prevalence in the aging population. The most feared consequence of AF is stroke, and oral anticoagulants are highly effective in reducing the risk of stroke and related death. Therefore, risk stratification of AF to early detect and potentially prevent AF-related adverse events is of clinical significance. However, 10% of all strokes are associated with previously unknown AF; thus, risk prediction of AF still needs to be improved.

The integration of clinical, imaging, and genetic markers might improve risk prediction of AF. Several lines of evidence suggest that intrinsically prothrombotic atrial myopathy precedes and promotes the development of AF. Although left atrial (LA) size has traditionally been considered a marker of LA myopathy, LA mechanical dysfunction precedes LA enlargement and is more strongly associated with AF. Distinct from functional changes of the LA, the genetic contribution in the pathogenesis of AF has been well recognized.

Genome-wide association studies have revealed over 100 AF-associated loci that might improve AF prediction. By summing each of the genetic variants, a polygenic risk score (PRS) significantly improves risk prediction of AF. A pattern of AF risk prediction integrating LA mechanical dysfunction and PRS is a promising risk prediction strategy because these two markers represent different aspects of future AF risk. LA mechanical dysfunction reflects the underlying substrate, whereas the PRS reflects inherited risks. However, no study at the time of writing.

### Atrial failure as a clinical entity: JACC review topic of the week [^112Wf5fy]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Atrial dysfunction has been widely considered a marker or consequence of other cardiac conditions rather than the cause itself. Here, we propose the term atrial failure as a clinically relevant entity, defined as any atrial dysfunction causing impaired heart performance, symptoms, and worsening quality of life or life expectancy. Aspects of the etiology, mechanisms, and consequences of atrial failure are discussed. Recent advances in cardiac electrophysiology and imaging have improved our understanding of the highly complex atrial anatomy and function, underlying the paramount importance of the atria in optimal heart performance. It is time to reappraise the concept of the failing atrium as a primary cause or aggravating factor of the symptoms in many of our patients. The concept of atrial failure may foster basic and translational research to gain a better understanding of how to identify and manage atrial dysfunction.

### Endothelial dysfunction and lung capillary injury in cardiovascular diseases [^112rx5KF]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac dysfunction of both systolic and diastolic origins leads to increased left atrial pressure, lung capillary injury, and increased resistance to gas transfer. Acutely, pressure-induced trauma disrupts the endothelial and alveolar anatomical configuration and definitively causes an impairment of cellular pathways involved in fluid-flux regulation and gas exchange efficiency, a process well identified as stress failure of the alveolar-capillary membrane.

In chronic heart failure (HF), additional stimuli other than pressure may trigger the true remodeling process of capillaries and small arteries characterized by endothelial dysfunction, proliferation of myofibroblasts, fibrosis, and extracellular matrix deposition. In parallel, there is a loss of alveolar gas diffusion properties due to the increased path from air to blood (thickening of extracellular matrix) and loss of fine molecular mechanisms involved in fluid reabsorption and clearance. Deleterious changes in gas transfer not only reflect the underlying lung tissue damage but also portend independent prognostic information and may play a role in the pathogenesis of exercise limitation and ventilatory abnormalities observed in these patients.

Few currently approved treatments for chronic HF have the potential to positively affect structural remodeling of the lung capillary network. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are one of the few currently established options. Recently, more attention has been paid to novel therapies specifically targeting the nitric oxide pathway as a suitable target to improve endothelial function.

### Left atrial remodelling in patients with myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or both: the VALIANT Echo study [^116yzm7H]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were to assess the relationship between left atrial (LA) size and outcome after high-risk myocardial infarction (MI) and to study the dynamic changes in LA size during long-term follow-up.

- **Methods and results**: The VALIANT Echocardiography study prospectively enrolled 610 patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, heart failure (HF), or both following MI. We assessed LA volume indexed to body surface area (LAVi) at baseline, 1 month, and 20 months after MI. Baseline LAVi was an independent predictor of all-cause death or HF hospitalization (P = 0.004). In patients who survived to 20 months, LAVi increased a mean of 3.00 ± 7.08 mL/m(2) from baseline. Hypertension, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and LV mass were the only baseline independent predictors of LA remodelling. Changes in LA size were related to worsening in MR and increasing in LV volumes. LA enlargement during the first month was significantly greater in patients who subsequently died or were hospitalized for HF than in patients without events.

- **Conclusion**: Baseline LA size is an independent predictor of death or HF hospitalization following high-risk MI. Moreover, LA remodelling during the first month after infarction is associated with adverse outcomes.

### Atrial secondary tricuspid regurgitation: pathophysiology, definition, diagnosis, and treatment [^111PXJnN]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

The proposal of a standardized nomenclature and definition of atrial secondary tricuspid regurgitation is outlined. The term 'secondary' is used throughout this document in agreement with the societal guidelines, although 'functional' TR has been used interchangeably with STR in the literature to distinguish patients having an abnormal leaflet coaptation secondary to RA/TA dilation or RV remodeling. The terms 'idiopathic' TR and 'isolated' TR have been variably used to describe TR occurring in isolation due to either AF, a primary disease of TV, a device, or to the TR progression after left-sided valve surgery. To avoid any confusion, these terms should no longer be used to describe A-STR.

The new definition of the A-STR phenotype proposed in this document includes specific criteria. Overlapping imaging features of A-STR and V-STR may present in a single patient, for instance, when A-SMR (or other left-sided diseases) becomes significant during the A-STR disease course, leading to significant post-capillary PH and RV remodeling. Alternatively, a superimposed event known to cause TR may occur in A-STR patients, such as new LV dysfunction or pacemaker implantation with concomitant cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED)-related TR.

Finally, the chronic volume overload due to the long-standing A-STR will eventually lead to overt RV remodeling and dysfunction, and a ventricular component will be added to the initial atrial mechanism. In the presence of supporting evidence attesting to the initial A-STR mechanism, these cases should be labeled as mixed STR.

### Left atrial myocardial mechanics: Association with cognitive dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease, and circulating biomarkers [^111jhx4B]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in accordance with American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. Measures included those of left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) chamber size (LA volume index, LV mass index [LVMI], LV diastolic and systolic dimensions), LV systolic function (LV ejection fraction), and diastolic function (E/e', pulmonary artery systolic pressure). Phasic LA strain, namely reservoir (LASr), conduit (LAScd), and contractile (LASct), corresponding to the LA reservoir, conduit, and contractile phases of the LA cycle, respectively, were determined using Automated Function Imaging software (EchoPAC v110.1.8, GE Healthcare) via speckle-tracking echocardiography. LA strain analyses were conducted by a single experienced echocardiologist using R‐R gating along a region of interest delineated by the endocardial border. Data were averaged from 12 segments in biplane apical views acquired at 60 to 80 Hz.

- **Atrial strain measurement by speckle-tracking echocardiography**: The region of interest is delineated by the endocardial border of the LA during speckle-tracking echocardiography. The LA strain curve has three phases: reservoir (LASr), conduit (LAScd), and contractile (LASct) strain. LASr is measured as the difference in strain values between mitral valve opening and LV end-diastole. LAScd is measured as the difference in strain values at the onset of atrial contraction and mitral valve opening. LASct is the difference in strain values at LV end-diastole and onset of atrial contraction.

### Left atrial mechanics following preeclamptic pregnancy [^116vbVQ2]. Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Preterm preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication associated with myocardial dysfunction and premature cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Left atrial (LA) strain is a noninvasive index of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and an early marker of heart failure risk. This study aimed to evaluate LA strain during the postpartum period in participants with and without preterm preeclampsia and to assess whether this varied in the presence of hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, or both.

- **Methods**: In this longitudinal cohort study, 321 women from 28 hospitals with preterm preeclampsia (cases) underwent cardiovascular assessment 6 months postpartum. This is a secondary analysis of the PHOEBE study (ISRCTN01879376). An uncomplicated pregnancy control group (n = 30) was recruited from a single center for comparison. A full cross-sectional transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, and from these images, the myocardial strain of the left atrium, including reservoir, conduit, and contractile strain, as well as LA stiffness, were calculated.

- **Results**: At 6 months postpartum, compared with controls, prior preeclampsia was associated with a significantly attenuated LA reservoir, conduit, and contractile strain, as well as increased LA stiffness (all P < 0.001). LA strain was further reduced in preeclamptic women who had and had not developed hypertension, systolic, or diastolic dysfunction at 6 months postpartum (all P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: LA mechanics were significantly attenuated at 6 months postpartum in participants with preterm preeclampsia, regardless of the development of hypertension or cardiac dysfunction.

### A real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic quantitative analysis of left atrial function in left ventricular diastolic dysfunction [^112PFrKi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function provides important information about hemodynamics and has prognostic implications for various cardiac diseases. In particular, left atrial (LA) volume is an increasingly significant prognostic biomarker for diastolic dysfunction. The aim of this study was to assess left ventricular diastolic function by measuring changes in LA volume using real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography.

The 106 subjects were divided into four groups (normal, impaired relaxation, pseudonormal, and restrictive) based on diastolic function, as assessed by transmitral flow patterns. LA volume was measured during a heart cycle using real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography. LA stroke volume (maximum LA volume − minimum LA volume) and the LA ejection fraction (LA stroke volume/maximum LA volume × 100) were calculated using Doppler imaging to assess their correlation with other parameters used to evaluate left ventricular diastolic function, including transmitral flow pattern and early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E').

LA volume indexed to body surface area was dilated in subjects with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, whereas the LA ejection fraction was lower. The maximum LA volume, minimum LA volume, and LA ejection fraction were significantly different between each group, and each was significantly correlated with the ratio of early diastolic transmitral flow velocity (E) to E' (E/E'). The LA ejection fraction correlated best with E/E' (r = -0.68, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, cyclic changes in LA volume could be measured using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography.

### Measures of left atrial function predict incident heart failure in a low-risk general population: The Copenhagen City Heart Study [^115Wd1tD]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

This study investigated left atrial (LA) parameters, as measured by transthoracic echocardiography, to predict incident heart failure (HF) in a community cohort.

In a large general population study (n = 2221), participants underwent a health examination that included echocardiography. The maximum and minimum LA volumes, indexed to body surface area (LAVImax and LAVImin), were measured, and the LA emptying fraction (LAEF) and LA expansion index (LAEI) were calculated. Among 1951 participants without atrial fibrillation or significant valve disease, the mean age was 59 ± 16 years, and 58% were women. At baseline, 1% (n = 16) had a left ventricular ejection fraction of < 50%, 44% had hypertension, and 10% had diabetes.

During follow-up (median 15.8 years, interquartile range: 11.3–16.2 years), 187 (10%) participants were diagnosed with incident HF. Participants diagnosed with HF during follow-up had larger LAVImax and LAVImin, and lower LAEF and LAEI, compared to those without HF. In unadjusted analysis, LAVImax, LAVImin, LAEF, and LAEI were predictors of incident HF. After multivariable adjustment for clinical and echocardiographic parameters, only LAVImin remained an independent predictor of incident HF (hazard ratio per 1 standard deviation increase: 1.22 [95% confidence interval 1.01–1.47], p = 0.038).

In conclusion, in the general population, LAVImin is an independent predictor of incident HF. Conversely, LAVImax, currently the only LA measure in a routine echocardiographic examination, was not an independent predictor of incident HF.

### Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in the community: Impact of diagnostic criteria on the burden, correlates, and prognosis [^112mxaCJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (DD) is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation, and cardiovascular death. Using standard criteria, age is the dominant predictor of DD; indeed, the prevalence of DD rises with advancing age, ranging from 27% to 43% in middle-aged adults to becoming almost ubiquitous (88%) in those older than 85 years. Whether DD represents a largely unavoidable consequence of cardiac senescence versus a result of accumulating cardiovascular risk factors remains unresolved. Determining the relative contributions of both nonmodifiable (age and sex) and modifiable risk factors to the development of DD is integral to disease prevention efforts.

Echocardiographic assessment of diastolic function has several limitations. Reduced diastolic function is considered to be an intermediate phenotype in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF), particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction. However, HF with preserved ejection fraction trials have repeatedly demonstrated that traditional echocardiographic features of DD are not required to develop the condition and were absent in approximately one-third of patients. Furthermore, the evidence supporting DD as an independent predictor of future HF is restricted to a small number of studies. These observations contrast with data suggesting that DD is common in asymptomatic individuals in the community, with the majority having some degree of DD by advanced age.

### Left atrial roof enlargement is a distinct feature of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111UfFqq]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). High credibility.

Computational 3-dimensional left atrial anatomic postprocessing of cardiovascular magnetic resonance short-axis cine sequences allows identification of early phenotypic remodeling patterns in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This highlights that atrial roof dilation is an early sign that precedes global left atrial dilatation in the progression of HFpEF and provides initial evidence of its ability to predict risks of atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular hospitalization. Given new advances in the medical therapy of HFpEF, early identification of patients with HFpEF based on routinely acquired cine sequences may improve prognosis. This shape signature could facilitate early diagnosis and the development of risk prediction models. Identification of left atrial roof and pulmonary vein ostia dilatation may guide clinical decision-making in HFpEF with concomitant atrial fibrillation. Currently, the left atrial HFpEF shape score is proposed to be computed from a short-axis cardiovascular magnetic resonance acquisition. In the future, the methodology could be extended to more widely used data sets based on clinical routine echocardiography.

At the time of writing, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for more than 40% of patients with heart failure. Right heart catheterization is the reference standard for early diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction, which is defined by a threshold in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) at rest or during exercise-stress, respectively.

### Echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular diastolic function and filling pressure in atrial fibrillation [^116TQzvo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Diastolic dysfunction has been linked to two epidemics: atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure. The presence and severity of diastolic dysfunction are associated with an increased risk for first AF and first heart failure in patients with sinus rhythm. Furthermore, the risk for heart failure is markedly increased once AF develops. The evaluation of diastolic function once AF has developed remains a clinical challenge. The conventional use of Doppler echocardiography for the assessment and grading of diastolic dysfunction relies heavily on evaluating the relationship between ventricular and atrial flow characteristics. The mechanical impairment of the left atrium and the variable cycle lengths in AF render the evaluation of diastolic function difficult. A few Doppler echocardiographic methods have been proven clinically useful for the estimation of diastolic left ventricular filling pressures in AF, but these appear to be underutilized. Several innovative methods are emerging that promise to provide greater precision in diastolic function assessment, but their clinical utility in AF remains to be established. In conclusion, this review provides an up-to-date discussion of the evaluation of diastolic function assessment in AF and how it may be important in the clinical management of patients with AF.

### The association of age and left atrial dysfunction in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111BZtsB]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is common in atrial fibrillation (AF) and is often driven by an underlying left atrial (LA) cardiomyopathy. We hypothesize that advancing age is a key risk factor for the development of LA cardiomyopathy and HFpEF in patients with AF.

- **Objectives**: To determine the impact of age on invasive and non-invasive measures of LA structure and function.

- **Methods**: Consecutive symptomatic AF patients with preserved left ventricular (LV) function undergoing catheter ablation were enrolled. During ablation, invasive hemodynamic assessment was performed to quantify LA pressure and stiffness. Non-invasive assessment included LA reservoir strain and indexed volumes, LV global longitudinal strain, end diastolic volume (LVEDV), and natriuretic peptides. Functional capacity was determined through cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and disease-specific patient-reported symptoms were assessed. Results were adjusted for common risk factors.

- **Results**: Of 125 patients, advancing age was associated with increased LA pressure (β = 0.08, P = 0.05) and stiffness (β = 0.10, P = 0.002). Patients over 65 years had greater LA stiffness (P < 0.001), but no difference in LA pressure (P = 0.11). Non-invasive measures revealed reduced LA reservoir strain (β = -0.37, P < 0.001), increased LA minimum (β = 0.24, P < 0.001) and maximum volumes (β = 0.24, P = 0.007), reduced LVEDV (β = -0.63, P = 0.005), and increased natriuretic peptides (β = 12.8, P = 0.01) with age. Age was associated with reduced peak oxygen consumption (β = -0.15, P = 0.02), but not AF (β = -0.01, P = 0.66) or heart failure symptoms.

### Impaired left atrial function in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111R17NP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) enlargement is present in the majority of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) patients and is a marker of risk. However, the importance of LA function in HFpEF is less well understood.

- **Methods and results**: The PARAMOUNT trial enrolled HFpEF patients with an LVEF ≥ 45% and NT-proBNP > 400 pg/mL. We assessed LA reservoir, conduit, and pump function using two-dimensional volume indices and speckle tracking echocardiography in 135 HFpEF patients in sinus rhythm at the time of echocardiography and 40 healthy controls of similar age and gender. Systolic LA strain was related to clinical characteristics and measures of cardiac structure and function. Compared with controls, HFpEF patients had worse LA reservoir, conduit, and pump function. The differences in systolic LA strain (controls 39.2 ± 6.6% vs. HFpEF 24.6 ± 7.3%) between groups remained significant after adjustments and even in the subsets of HFpEF patients with normal LA size or without a history of atrial fibrillation (AF). Among HFpEF patients, lower systolic LA strain was associated with a higher prevalence of prior heart failure hospitalization and history of AF, as well as worse left ventricular (LV) systolic function, and higher LV mass and LA volume. However, NT-proBNP and E/E' were similar across the quartiles of LA function.

- **Conclusions**: In this HFpEF cohort, we observed impairment in all phases of LA function, and systolic LA strain was decreased independent of LA size or history of AF. LA dysfunction may be a marker of severity and play a pathophysiological role in HFpEF.

Trial Registration: NCT00887588.

### Left atrial expansion index predicts left ventricular filling pressure and adverse events in acute heart failure with severe left ventricular dysfunction [^115k6e9a]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2016). Low credibility.

The power of left atrial (LA) parameters for predicting left ventricular (LV) filling pressure and adverse events in acute heart failure (HF) with severe LV dysfunction, either sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation (AF), is not fully understood.

- **Methods and results**: Echocardiography was performed in 141 patients with acute decompensated congestive HF and LV ejection fraction < 35%, including 42 with permanent AF. The LA expansion index was calculated as (Volmax − Volmin) × 100%/Volmin, where Volmax was defined as maximal and Volmin as minimal LA volume. Of 141 patients, invasive LV filling pressures within 12 hours of LA expansion index measurement were available in 109. The endpoints were 3-year frequencies of HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Over a median follow-up of 3.1 years, 74 participants (52.5%) reached the endpoints (sinus vs. AF group: 48.5% vs. 61.9%, respectively; p = 0.047). Multivariate analysis revealed that adverse events of both groups were only independently associated with age and LA expansion index. Rates of adverse events were proportional to LA expansion index. There was a good logarithmic relationship between LA expansion index and LV filling pressure, regardless of presence or absence of AF.

- **Conclusions**: LV filling pressure can be estimated well by LA expansion index, with or without AF. The LA expansion index predicts adverse events in HF patients with severe systolic dysfunction.

### Left atrial myocardial mechanics: Association with cognitive dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease, and circulating biomarkers [^113wb1pW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of dementia. Although both are age-related and share many risk factors, AF may contribute to cognitive impairment through chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardioembolism. Longitudinally, brain morphological changes and an increase in silent brain infarcts have been detected among individuals with AF.

It is increasingly recognized that AF is predated by an atrial substrate characterized by myocyte necrosis and fibrosis. Given the frequent lack of a temporal relationship between stroke and AF, this proinflammatory, thrombogenic atrial myopathic state could plausibly promote cognitive decline before AF manifests. Several studies have examined the association of "atrial cardiomyopathy" with cognitive impairment, focusing on ECG and echocardiographic parameters. More recent studies have reported associations between worse left atrial (LA) reservoir strain (LASr) with incident dementia, decline in executive function, an increase in cerebral microbleeds (CMB), and silent brain infarcts. However, these were largely community-based, variably included subjects with AF, and did not explore associations of LA strain with causes of cognitive dysfunction.

We thus aimed to determine the association of LA strain with cognitive dysfunction and its pathogenetic subtypes in subjects without AF and investigate underlying mechanisms through associations of LA strain with neuroimaging markers of cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) and circulating inflammatory and neuronal biomarkers.

### Association between left atrial myopathy and sarcomere mutation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Insights into left atrial strain by MRI feature tracking [^112HEPt1]. European Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Left atrial (LA) myopathy, characterized by LA enlargement and mechanical dysfunction, is associated with worse prognosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), while the impact of sarcomere mutation on LA myopathy remains unclear. We aimed to assess the association between LA myopathy and sarcomere mutation and to explore the incremental utility of LA strain in mutation prediction.

A total of 105 consecutive HCM patients (mean age 47.8 ± 11.9 years, 71% male) who underwent HCM-related gene screening and cardiac MRI were retrospectively enrolled. LA volume, ejection fraction, and strain indices in reservoir, conduit, and booster-pump phases were investigated respectively.

Fifty mutation-positive patients showed higher LA maximal volume index (59.4 ± 28.2 vs. 43.8 ± 18.1 mL/m², p = 0.001), lower reservoir (21.3 ± 7.9 vs. 26.2 ± 6.6%, p < 0.001), and booster-pump strain (12.1 ± 5.4 vs. 17.1 ± 5.0%, p < 0.001) but similar conduit strain (9.2 ± 4.5 vs. 9.1 ± 4.5%, p = 0.909) compared with mutation-negative patients. In multivariate logistic regression, LA booster-pump strain was associated with sarcomere mutation (odds ratio = 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.77–0.96, p = 0.010) independent of maximal wall thickness, late gadolinium enhancement, and LA volume. Furthermore, LA booster-pump strain showed incremental value for mutation prediction added to Mayo II score (AUC 0.798 vs. 0.709, p = 0.024).

In conclusion, in HCM, mutation-positive patients suffered worse LA enlargement and worse reservoir and booster-pump functions. LA booster-pump strain was a strong factor for sarcomere mutation prediction.

### Left atrial disease and left atrial reverse remodelling across different stages of heart failure development and progression: A new target for prevention and treatment [^115TQkeG]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

Atrial disease, as stated in the recent European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HF guidelines, can be defined as a complex of subclinical structural, electrophysiological, and functional changes that affect the atria with the potential to produce clinical consequences. Signs and symptoms may include those of heart failure (HF) and/or atrial arrhythmias, resulting from both a failing left ventricle (LV) and a dysfunctional left atrium (LA), proving the active role of atrial disease in HF pathophysiology and other pathophysiological processes. Impaired atrial contractile reserve and LA enlargement independently predict mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, as well as atrial fibrillation (AF) onset or recurrence and severity of functional impairment in HF patients.

The temporal process occurring after the removal of external stressors, leading to a reduction in LA volume and/or restoration of specific functional parameters, is called reverse remodelling.

Only recently has attention shifted to quantifying and evaluating LA reverse remodelling as a potential biomarker that responds to specific therapeutic interventions, potentially providing prognostic information. One critical aspect is that the response to therapeutic interventions is potentially different in acute or chronic settings and in early or late stages of atrial failure. In the early stage, the LA is less abnormal and potentially more capable of responding to changes in myocardial structure and function. When stressors persist over time, LA remodelling progresses, making reversal less likely.

### The predictive value of changes in left atrial volume index for rehospitalization in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^114KZ8Sv]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, affecting at least 26 million people. According to the left ventricular ejection fraction, HF is classified into HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with mid‐range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Among them, HFpEF has become the dominant form of HF and increases with age, reaching 70% in patients over 65 years of age. At the time of writing, no treatment has been shown to convincingly reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with HFpEF. Thus, it is urgent to identify a reliable marker that can effectively predict the prognosis of HFpEF.

HFpEF is characterized by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, LV diastolic dysfunction, and left atrial (LA) enlargement. The left atrial volume index (LAVI), measured by two‐dimensional (2D) echocardiography, is an accurate descriptor of LA volume and is recommended in the latest guidelines for the diagnosis of HFpEF. The 2015 recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults from the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE), in association with the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI), indicate that LAVI can be categorized as normal (≤ 34 ml/m²), mild dysfunction (34–41 ml/m²), moderate dysfunction (42–48 ml/m²), and severe dysfunction (> 48 ml/m²). However, LAVI is a dynamic parameter; the expansion of LAVI occurs during cardiac injury, abnormal neurohormonal factors, and sustained cardiac pressure and/or volume overload. In contrast, such expansion could be reversed in some scenarios under optimal management, indicating its potential role as a prognostic indicator.

### Left atrial disease and left atrial reverse remodelling across different stages of heart failure development and progression: a new target for prevention and treatment [^115HiX2r]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

Left atrial remodelling and LA disease are markers of cardiovascular (CV) disease and may also affect clinical outcomes. Counteracting the underlying mechanisms and removing the causative factors may restore LA structure and function. Increasing evidence indicates significant LA reverse remodelling after the initiation of medical therapy across all stages of heart failure (HF) development and progression. Although a clear definition of LA reverse remodelling is needed, assessing LA response to targeted therapies appears to be a valid parameter to redefine patients' risk stratification. Prospective clinical trials are required to establish the role of LA reverse remodelling as a marker of therapeutic response in clinical practice and to assess its potential independent role as a mechanism in the development and progression of HF.

### Atrial structure and function and its implications for current and emerging treatments for atrial fibrillation [^114g88UY]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) structure and function are intimately related to the clinical phenotypes of atrial fibrillation (AF) and have direct implications for the success or otherwise of various therapeutic strategies. In conjunction with intrinsic structural characteristics of the LA, pathological remodeling to a large extent dictates the clinical course of AF. Remodeling is a product of the physiological and structural plasticity of the LA in disease states, including AF itself, and manifests as electrical, physical, and structural changes that promote the substrate necessary for AF maintenance. The degree of remodeling impacts the efficacy of pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and interventional treatments for AF. Evolving therapies seek to specifically target these processes, although several remain in the development phase. Catheter ablation (CA) is now firmly established as a highly effective treatment for AF; however, increasing its efficacy in the remodeled LA of more severe AF phenotypes remains an ongoing challenge.

### Atrial imaging and cardiac rhythm in cryptogenic embolic stroke: The ARIES study [^113uYUEr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Three-dimensional advanced echocardiography was performed on all 109 patients as described in the Methods section, although not all measurements were collected due to technical difficulties or limited patient cooperation. Compared with patients with normal sinus rhythm (NSR), patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) presented with higher 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional left atrial (LA) volumes, higher LA ejection fraction (50 ± 14.6 versus 62.7 ± 11.8, P = 0.001), lower LA reservoir strain (22.0 ± 8.6 versus 30.4 ± 10.5, P < 0.001), and lower LA contraction strain (10.5 ± 8.18 versus 17.1 ± 7.5, P < 0.001). After multivariate regression analysis adjusted by age, hypertension, and CHA₂DS₂-VASc score, all differences remained statistically significant. Compared with the group with NSR, the group with high burden of ectopic atrial activity (HBEA) showed higher LA indexed volumes (33.4 ± 12.4 versus 27.3 ± 11.8 mL/m², P = 0.043) and lower LA reservoir strain (26.6 ± 12.5 versus 31.0 ± 10.1, P = 0.034); however, these differences were not statistically significant when adjusted for age and CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. Compared with the group with HBEA, the group with AF presented higher LA volumes, lower LA ejection fraction (50 ± 14.6 versus 60.3 ± 9.6, P = 0.016), and lower LA contraction strain (10.1 ± 8.0 versus 14.9 ± 8.0, P = 0.022). An adjusted analysis was unnecessary, given that there were no statistically significant baseline differences between the two groups.
