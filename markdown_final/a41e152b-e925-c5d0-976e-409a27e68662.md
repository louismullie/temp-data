## Question

In North Carolina, Jim bought 10 gallons of gas at $2.00/gallon. He paid $1.00 more per gallon in Virginia where he bought another 10 gallons of gas. How much has he spent on gas?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much Jim spent on gas in total after buying 10 gallons in North Carolina at $2.00 per gallon and 10 gallons in Virginia at $1.00 more per gallon. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cost in North Carolina. Then, I should verify the price per gallon in Virginia and calculate that cost. Finally, I will add the two amounts to get the total expenditure and double-check the arithmetic.

> Let me first confirm the North Carolina purchase: 10 gallons at $2.00 per gallon equals $20.00, so that part is straightforward.

> Wait, let me verify the Virginia price before I multiply. The problem states Jim paid $1.00 more per gallon in Virginia, so the Virginia price is $2.00 + $1.00 = $3.00 per gallon. I initially wondered if the "more" could imply a percentage increase, but the wording is explicit about a $1.00 increment, so I should stick with $3.00 per gallon.

> Next, I should calculate the Virginia cost: 10 gallons at $3.00 per gallon equals $30.00. Hold on, I should double-check that multiplication to avoid a silly error — yes, 10 × 3 is 30.

> Now, I will add the two purchases to get the total: $20.00 in North Carolina plus $30.00 in Virginia equals $50.00. Let me reconsider the sum to ensure accuracy — 20 + 30 is indeed 50.

> Final answer: Jim spent a total of $50.00 on gas.

## Calculation breakdown

| **Location** | **Quantity (gallons)** | **Price per gallon ($)** | **Total cost ($)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| North Carolina | 10 | 2.00 | 20.00 |
| Virginia | 10 | 3.00 | 30.00 |
| Total | 20 | N/A | 50.00 |

---

Therefore, Jim spent a total of **$50.00** on gas.

### Promoting low-flow anaesthesia and volatile anaesthetic agent choice [^115Bwc5u]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Background

As doctors, we are increasingly aware of the financial implications of our practice. The need to work in a more conscientious, efficacious and cost-effective manner is greater than ever before. Environmental and financial benefits can be seen through employing the use of low-flow anaesthesia.

Aims

This quality improvement project aimed to make anaesthetic practice more environmentally friendly and to reduce departmental spending. This could be achieved by promoting the use of low-flow anaesthesia and by encouraging isoflurane use where appropriate.

Methods

All anaesthetic consultants and trainees were invited to fill out an initial questionnaire relating to their personal preferences and practices when conducting anaesthesia. There were specific questions relating to low-flow anaesthesia and isoflurane use. Our main measure of improvement was any decrease in the number of bottles of volatile agent ordered by the department from pharmacy. Monthly spot audits were conducted to assess gas flow rates and volatile agent use in theatre. Departmental spending figures relating to the purchase of volatile agent bottles were obtained from pharmacy. Information was then disseminated to anaesthetists on a monthly basis via a 'low-flow board', which showed pictorial and graphical representations of differing gas flows and volatile agent usage in relation to cost.

Results

Our project showed a trend for the increased use of low-flow anaesthesia within the department. We also showed a decrease in the number of bottles of volatile agent ordered: 18% fewer bottles ordered compared with the same period the previous year. This represented a 25% decrease in total departmental expenditure on volatile agents despite an increase in theatre activity.

Conclusion

Increasing awareness regarding anaesthetic choices and promoting low-flow anaesthesia and isoflurane use, translated into an overall decreased departmental spend on volatile agents without affecting patient care.

### Are gender-affirming plastic surgeons adequately compensated? An analysis of relative value units [^112gLP33]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Gender-affirming surgery (GAS) has a complicated history within US health care. As GAS procedures and reimbursement availability continue to uptrend, the present study aims to investigate whether compensation is equitable between GAS procedures and general plastic surgery procedures.

Methods

The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for all surgeries performed by plastic surgeons from 2016 to 2020. Cases were assigned to the GAS or non-GAS cohort using ICD-10 codes. Duplicate Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes were removed for analysis. Operative time, total wRVUs, wRVUs per hour (wRVU/h), reoperation/readmission rate, and number of concurrent procedures were compared between the cohorts.

Results

A total of 132,319 non-GAS and 3,583 GAS were identified. After duplicate CPT removal, 299 cases (21 unique CPTs) remained in the GAS cohort and 20,022 (37 unique CPTs) in the non-GAS cohort. Operative time was higher in the GAS cohort (262.9 vs 120.7 min, P < 0.001), as were total wRVUs (59.4 vs 21.6, P < 0.001). Reoperation/readmission rate (7.0% vs 6.0%) and wRVU/h (15.8 vs 15.1) were not significantly different (all P > 0.05). There was a positive correlation between total operative time and total wRVUs (P < 0.001) and a negative correlation between total operative time and wRVU/h (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Proportional wRVUs are allocated to gender affirming plastic procedures. However, the RVU scale does not allocate proportional wRVUs to longer operative times for both GAS and general plastic surgeries. Compensation for gender affirming plastic surgeries is higher than that of general plastic surgeries; however, there is no difference in wRVUs per hour on comparison.

Differential change in price inflation

The spending power of nominal income – its value in real terms – is determined by price inflation, but price inflation is experienced differently across the population. During 2021 and 2022, prices for electricity and gas increased at a higher rate than those for other goods and services. As poorer households spend a higher proportion of their total expenditure on electricity and gas (online supplemental table 1 and online supplemental figure 2)this means they will have experienced a higher price inflation rate.

Our second step was therefore to calculate differential price inflation rates for quintiles (fifths) of the household income distribution. We estimated differential price inflation on the basis of the proportion of household expenditure spent on energy and other goods and services, by income quintile (2020/21, online supplemental table 1). Expenditures in all groups except for electricity and gas were inflated by the latest available detailed Consumer Prices Index (CPI) figures (August 2022). For example, food expenditures were inflated by the CPI inflation figure for food items.

Annual unmitigated inflation for electricity and gas in October 2022 was calculated between the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) price caps for October 2021 (costing £1277 per year for a typical household)and October 2022 (£3549 per year for a typical household)and was 178%. The UK Government implemented the EPG of £2500 per year for a typical household from October 2022, reducing the annual electricity and gas inflation rate to 96% (ie, mitigated price inflation for electricity and gas). We increased each income quintile's average expenditure on electricity and gas (online supplemental table 1) by 178% and 96% for the unmitigated and mitigated situations, respectively. We then divided the resulting overall expenditure by the original expenditure to give an annual inflation figure for each quintile.

### What's important (arts and humanities): shouldn' T our GOAL! Be to find a better way? [^1177aZon]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

The health-care sector is one of the largest contributors to the world's carbon footprint, being responsible for almost 7% of global emissions of greenhouse gases. Putting this into perspective, health care's annual environmental footprint is equivalent to approximately 514 coal-fired power plants! Or, if the health-care sector were a country, it would be the world's fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gasses after the U.S. China, India, and Russia. The largest portion of carbon emissions comes from energy generated for heating, cooling, ventilation, and hot water production in health-care facilities, followed by the manufacturing, delivery, servicing, and consumption and disposal of products.

A recent systematic review examining the carbon footprint of surgical services revealed that the primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions were energy consumption (for maintaining the OR environment), disposal of single-use items, and anesthetic gases. ORs utilize 3 to 6 times more energy per square foot than the hospital as a whole, due to the demanding heating, ventilation, and air conditioning requirements, as well as lighting, patient-monitoring equipment, and long hours of use. In addition to the large energy consumption, surgical services are responsible for approximately 20% to 30% of the total waste generated in hospitals. Most of the waste generated in ORs is nonhazardous; however, such waste is often mistakenly disposed of as though it were hazardous, and therefore is processed with methods that cause substantially more emission of pollutants and thus a greater environmental footprint. Finally, the use of anesthetic gases in surgery is an important contributor to greenhouse emissions. In the U.K. anesthetic gases represent 5% of the carbon footprint for all acute National Health Service organizations. A 2005 study conducted in 1,100 Canadian hospitals estimated that anesthetic emissions were the equivalent of > 1.1 million tons of CO 2, equivalent to the total annual emissions of 68,000 Canadians. Only 5% to 20% of anesthetic gases administered to patients are metabolized, with the rest released into the atmosphere, where they can have warming effects on the atmosphere for many years. The atmospheric lifetime and consequently the degree to which a given anesthetic impacts global warming depends on its chemical composition. For instance, sevoflurane has an atmospheric lifetime of 1 to 5 years; isoflurane, 3 to 6 years; desflurane, 9 to 21 years; and nitrous oxide, 114 years. Using nitrous oxide in a 1-hour surgery warms the atmosphere the same as 16 kg of CO 2, and is equal to driving a car 106 km. A 1-hour surgery using desflurane anesthesia has > 2,500 times more warming effect than CO 2, warming the atmosphere the same as 30 to 60 kg of CO 2, which is the equivalent of driving a car 200 to 400 km.

### Clinician and health service interventions to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions generated by healthcare: a systematic review [^113kNxic]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Outcome measures

The outcomes reported in each study are summarised in online supplemental file 6. 18 studies reported GHG emissions as an outcome,15 reported financial costs,20 reported effectiveness measures, and only single studies reported harmand staff acceptability. No studies reported engagement with the intervention or patient-relevant outcomes other than death.

GHG emissions were reported in different units such as CO 2 e per period of time, per patient or admission, wasted, savedor in terms of global warming potential. In one study, the unit of GHG emissions reported was unclear. Various methods of measuring the GHG emissions of clinical care were also used with only four studies using life cycle assessment (LCA), the international standard for assessing the environmental impact of a product or service across its life cycle.

Financial costs were estimated or measured and reported differently across the studies. For example, total expenditure on volatiles before and after intervention, total cost savings on biochemistry tests, and total cost of non-hazardous waste disposal by recycling and landfill.

Various ways of measuring effectiveness were used including volatile bottle usage, fresh gas flow rates, minutes of volatile agent use, total waste weight generated, incinerated, diverted and saved, electrical energy (kWh) wasted per yearand reduction in unnecessary tests. Harm was measured in terms of patient mortality, while acceptability was measured using an anonymous staff survey.

Risk of bias of included studies

Study risk of bias assessment is reported in online supplemental file 7. One study was judged to be at low risk of bias across all items. Seven studies were deemed at low risk of bias for confounding, three for generalisabilityand four for outcome reporting.

### GRIN: "GRoup versus INdividual physiotherapy following lower limb intra-muscular botulinum toxin – A injections for ambulant children with cerebral palsy: an assessor-masked randomised comparison trial": study protocol [^113rdifv]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the acknowledged success of physiotherapy rehabilitation combined with BoNT-A injections, relative effectiveness of the specific components of physiotherapy rehabilitation, including intensity and dose, is difficult to interpret because it is often poorly described. Results of a number of systematic reviews and consensus papers found limited evidence to support or refute individual physiotherapy modalities post lower limb BoNT-A injections. The content of physiotherapy rehabilitation outlined in reported studies has included: active and passive stretching of muscle agonists; functional or resistive strengthening of the antagonists; functional mobility training and/or gait training. One retrospective, controlled intervention study has directly compared the specific content of two physiotherapy approaches following lower limb BoNT-A injections. Thirty-eight children with CP (mean age 7 years, 7 months, GMFCS I-III, 11 unilateral, 27 bilateral motor distribution) who received Neurodevelopmental Treatment (NDT, mean total dose 24.2 hours) were randomly selected and retrospectively matched to a group of children who received conventional physiotherapy (CPT, mean total dose 20.5 hours). Content of physiotherapy, determined via therapist questionnaires, and improvement of impairment and gait-related goals (GAS) were compared between groups two months post injection. Both approaches utilized muscle tone inhibition techniques, stretching, strengthening and functional training, with the NDT group spending a greater proportion of time on functional training (NDT 42%; CPT 28%, p = 0.009). Whilst the NDT group showed greater goal attainment post intervention (mean converted GAS score NDT 56, CPT 52, p = 0.008), results should be interpreted cautiously. Therapy content was only described and analysed for 62% (n = 47) of children due to reduced completion of questionnaires by treating physiotherapists. As GAS goals were impairment-based it is unclear from this study if a more functional approach to training translates to improvement in goals related to function and participation.

### Intestinal gas homeostasis: disposal pathways [^111g3ng3]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with functional gut disorders frequently complain of gas-related symptoms, but the role of intestinal gas in this context is not clear, because intestinal gas homeostasis is incompletely understood. Our aim was to compare the proportion of the gas produced by colonic fermentation that is evacuated per anus and that eliminated via alternative pathways.

Methods

In 20 healthy subjects, gas evacuated per anus was collected for 4 h after a standard flatulogenic test meal. Paired studies were performed without and with high-rate infusion of exogenous gas (24 mL/min) into the jejunum to wash-out of the gut the endogenous gas produced by bacterial fermentation. The exogenous gas infused was labeled (5% SF 6) to calculate the proportion of endogenous gas evacuated.

Key Results

In the experiments with gaseous wash-out, 1817 ± 139 mL of endogenous gas was produced over the 4-h study period. However, in the experiments without wash-out (basal conditions), 376 ± 43 mL were evacuated, indicating that only 23 ± 3% of the gas produced was finally eliminated per anus, while the rest (77 ± 3%) had been previously eliminated via alternative pathways.

Conclusions & Inferences

Intestinal gas homeostasis is a highly dynamic process by which a large proportion of the gas produced by bacterial fermentation of meal residues is rapidly absorbed into the blood and/or metabolized by gas-consuming microorganisms, and only a relatively modest proportion is eliminated per anus. These data contribute to clarify the complex dynamics of intestinal gas and may help interpret the pathophysiology of gas-related symptoms.

### Cooking with natural gas: just the facts, please [^111gmMXs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

What Are Evidence-based Recommendations for Clinicians?

Both the latest National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines and the Global Initiative for Asthma strategy report call for people with asthma to avoid exposure to respiratory tract irritants because of the potential for exacerbations. As noted above, NO 2 is a respiratory tract irritant at concentrations that may occur in some homes during gas cooking.

### Association of breathing effort with survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^115SYYb5]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The main findings of this study are: 1) Median values of effort variables remained within normal ranges and did not differ significantly between groups; 2) However, nonsurvivors spent a significantly greater proportion of time within the high-effort range (including Pmus, PTPes, ΔPes, and ΔPdi) during the first 7 days of spontaneous breathing compared with survivors; and 3) The median daily proportion of time with a high dynamic transpulmonary pressure (ΔPLdyn > 25 cm H₂O) was also significantly higher in nonsurvivors.

This study suggests that prolonged exposure to high respiratory effort may be associated with ICU mortality in ARDS patients. However, given the observational nature of the study, these findings should be interpreted with caution. While this study does not establish a causal relationship, our findings emphasize the potential relevance of continuously monitoring respiratory effort in the clinical setting.

Despite the prolonged period before resuming spontaneous breathing (median [IQR], 9 d [4–21 d] for survivors vs. 11 d [1–24 d] for nonsurvivors; p = 0.975), both survivors and nonsurvivors were substantially exposed to spontaneous breathing during most of their time on mechanical ventilation. Survivors spend a median of 75%, and nonsurvivors 89%, of the total mechanical ventilation period in spontaneous breathing. Furthermore, in terms of ventilation settings, respiratory mechanics, and gas exchange, both groups were comparable at onset of spontaneous breathing.

A possible explanation for this association is the concept of P-SILI, a hypothesis that has been discussed in both experimental and clinical literature. However, the role of prolonged high respiratory effort in this context remains to be fully elucidated. According to this hypothesis, patients may exacerbate lung damage through various mechanisms, including increased respiratory effort. Prolonged exposure to high respiratory effort may increase transpulmonary pressure and lung stress, potentially contributing to lung injury over time. However, the exact clinical impact of sustained high effort remains uncertain.

### Mutual reinforcement of land-based carbon dioxide removal and international emissions trading in deep decarbonization scenarios [^116AXTGZ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

When CDR is allowed, the lower mitigation costs reflected in lower carbon prices increase GDP. Higher GDP, in turn, increases overall food consumption, and that higher demand increases crop prices. Trade in GHG permits further increases GDP, consumption, and crop prices (Supplementary Fig. 6). In addition to this income effect, agricultural prices are also affected by land use — more land use changes in the scenarios with CDR (Supplementary Fig. 5) drive prices higher. However, despite higher agricultural prices, overall GDP is still improved with the deployment of CDR.

Across the scenarios, the scale of emissions traded and the scale of CDR both move in the opposite direction of the carbon prices. As a result, the total amount of resources spent on international offsets is similar with and without CDR, and reaches over $7 trillion (real 2007 USD) by 2100 (Fig. 5a). A growing portion of that spending comes from emerging economies. Although some countries have large expenses buying permits when trading is allowed, this strategy is less costly than not trading at all. Similarly, the total revenue received by CDR producers is similar with and without emissions trading and will reach over $9 trillion by 2100 (Fig. 5b). With trading, the vast majority of CDR revenue accrues in emerging economies. Importantly, while these scenarios involve similar amounts of resource transfers, the efficiency of the implied spending differs substantially, as evidenced by the differential implications for GDP. Spending is most efficient when both CDR and emissions trading are unconstrained. Under a more stringent climate mitigation scenario (~1.5 °C), the scale of offset spending and CDR revenue is higher, and the difference in CDR revenue under different trading assumptions is larger (Supplementary Figs. 12–14).

### Diverse decarbonization pathways under near cost-optimal futures [^115KgZf9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Figure 1c shows that the distribution of natural gas use exhibits significant variation across the near cost-optimal pathways, with consumption in 2050 ranging from less than 3 EJ to 21 EJ, the latter being comparable to 2020 levels. This diversity in natural gas use is primarily driven by the industrial sector, which encompasses various applications, including direct air capture (DAC), hydrogen production through steam methane reforming (with and without CCS), and industrial manufacturing and non-manufacturing demands. In the least-cost current-policy pathway, industrial natural gas consumption increases steadily through 2050, surpassing the levels seen in any of the net-zero pathways. The range of industrial natural gas used in the near cost-optimal net-zero pathways often exceeds the results in the current-policy case until the last decade of the study period (i.e. 2040–2050). While natural gas use in the current-policy pathway may be comparable in magnitude to the decarbonization pathways, the drivers of such consumption differ. A substantial portion of natural gas is allocated to DAC or hydrogen production in the decarbonization pathways. For instance, the least-cost net-zero pathway uses about 8 EJ of natural gas for DAC in 2050, accounting for almost half of total natural gas use. In the current-policy pathway, these technologies are not widely adopted, and natural gas is primarily used for process heat or conventional boilers in the industrial sector. Within the electric sector, natural gas use undergoes a rapid reduction, declining from approximately 9 EJ in 2020 to less than 2.5 EJ by 2030 in over half of the near cost-optimal pathways. By mid-century, natural gas use in the electricity sector approaches zero in all modeled net-zero pathways. In the commercial sector, natural gas use remains relatively constant until 2035 across the pathways, after which it will decrease to approximately one-tenth of the current commercial natural gas use by 2050 (0.1–0.5 EJ, Interquartile Range, IQR). By contrast, the transition from natural gas in the residential sector is slower, with levels remaining relatively constant until 2040 before declining to a median of 0.3 EJ (0–0.9 EJ, IQR). Overall, reductions in natural gas use across all decarbonization pathways are a consequence of the increased electrification of end-use technologies in all sectors. However, despite substantial reductions, all decarbonization pathways retain some level of natural gas use. Compared to coal and petroleum, natural gas is a lower-carbon alternative, particularly for challenging-to-decarbonize processes in the industrial sector. It is important to acknowledge that factors not considered in Temoa, such as labor impacts and energy security perceptions, will likely influence natural gas use during a low-carbon transition.

### Effect of radiation schedule on transportation-related carbon emissions: a case study in rectal cancer [^115sPVRu]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 334 patients treated with preoperative, definitive chemoradiation were evaluable, with 73 and 261 having received SCRT and LCRT, respectively. The median dose delivered for SCRT was 25 Gy in 5 fractions and for LCRT, 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions.

Total distance traveled for the treatment course was significantly greater in patients treated with LCRT in comparison with patients who received SCRT (median for LCRT, 1417 miles; median for SCRT, 319 miles; P < .001). Similarly, total time spent traveling was significantly higher in the LCRT versus SCRT group (median for LCRT, 30.6 hours; median for SCRT, 6.5 hours; P < .001). Cost projections quantifying dollars spent per treatment course additionally attributed higher transportation-associated costs to LCRT (median for LCRT, $892; median for SCRT, $187; P < .001) (Table 1).

Over the total treatment course, LCRT was associated with nearly 4.5 times greater GHG emissions than SCRT. Total CO 2 e emissions for LCRT and SCRT were 665.3 kg CO 2 e and 149.9 kg CO 2 e per patient treatment course, respectively (P < .001), with a net difference of 515.4 kg CO 2 e (Table 2).

### The role of natural gas in reaching net-zero emissions in the electric sector [^116LWTzL]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Replacing coal with natural gas has contributed to recent emissions reductions in the electric sector, but there are questions about the near- and long-term roles for gas under deep decarbonization. In this study, we assess the potential role for natural gas and carbon removal in deeply decarbonized electricity systems in the U.S. and evaluate the robustness of these insights to key technology and policy assumptions. We find that natural-gas-fired generation can lower the cost of electric sector decarbonization, a result that is robust to a range of sensitivities, when carbon removal is allowed under policy. Accelerating decarbonization to reach net-zero in 2035 entails greater contributions from natural gas than in 2050. Nonetheless, wind and solar have higher generation shares than natural gas for most regions and scenarios (52–66% variable renewables for net-zero scenarios versus 0–19% for gas), suggesting that natural gas generation can be substituted more easily than its capacity.

### The refinery of the future [^112XUd3D]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Fossil fuels-coal, oil and gas-supply most of the world's energy and also form the basis of many products essential for everyday life. Their use is the largest contributor to the carbon dioxide emissions that drive global climate change, prompting joint efforts to find renewable alternatives that might enable a carbon-neutral society by as early as 2050. There are clear paths for renewable electricity to replace fossil-fuel-based energy, but the transport fuels and chemicals produced in oil refineries will still be needed. We can attempt to close the carbon cycle associated with their use by electrifying refinery processes and by changing the raw materials that go into a refinery from fossils fuels to carbon dioxide for making hydrocarbon fuels and to agricultural and municipal waste for making chemicals and polymers. We argue that, with sufficient long-term commitment and support, the science and technology for such a completely fossil-free refinery, delivering the products required after 2050 (less fuels, more chemicals), could be developed. This future refinery will require substantially larger areas and greater mineral resources than is the case at present and critically depends on the capacity to generate large amounts of renewable energy for hydrogen production and carbon dioxide capture.

### Global fossil fuel reduction pathways under different climate mitigation strategies and ambitions [^1143dCA6]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Consequently, the first policy implication of our analysis is that governments could better align their climate and energy policies by planning for and implementing an active transition away from coal, oil, and gas production along with use, starting now. Only a few fossil fuel-producing countries have begun to consider the alignment of their production and export targets with national and international climate goals, and many continue to subsidize, invest in, and plan on expanding production. This disconnect perpetuates the "production gap", undermining the Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal and creating risks of stranded communities and assets. Additionally, prior studies have shown that, to keep within the carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5 °C with a 50% likelihood, 90% of coal and 60% of oil and gas must remain unextracted, while projected CO 2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel-production or -combustion infrastructure without additional abatement would already exceed this budget. Combining policies to limit fossil fuel supply with policies to limit demand reduces the overall cost of achieving emission reduction goals, promotes policy coherence, helps to ensure that renewable deployment will lead to an energy transition as opposed to an addition, and directly challenges public and private vested interests who continue to lock in high fossil fuel dependence –. Furthermore, planning for and implementing a managed and equitable transition with international cooperation can help to ensure a fairer distribution of the shrinking carbon budget, and to minimize disruption for fossil fuel-dependent communities and workers.

### Crowd oil not crude oil [^1136ZGzb]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The world's population currently stands at 7.6 billion people and is growing at the rate of 83 million people per year. Annual estimates of the CO 2 emission load for all countries in the world place the sum total of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions in the range of 40 billion metric tons.

Given information on the number of houses, apartment blocks and office buildings in these countries that are, or could be, outfitted with A/C systems, it should be possible to appraise the associated greenhouse gas reduction potential and assess the global capacity to produce, store, distribute, use and recycle renewable hydrocarbon fuels in this way. Moreover, a sustainability assessment based on life cycle analysis and life cycle costing should be capable of providing the necessary insight into the mass, energy and economic flows for such a distributed social technology and sustainability project.

Gas fuel prevalence and natural gas heat content — More than 50% of American homes use gas fuel. For natural gas, the heat content may vary from 700 to 1,300 British thermal units (BTUs) per cubic foot, with a generally accepted average figure of 1,000 BTUs per cubic foot.

### Unextractable fossil fuels in a 1.5 ° C world [^112pcyPw]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Parties to the 2015 Paris Agreement pledged to limit global warming to well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial times 1. However, fossil fuels continue to dominate the global energy system and a sharp decline in their use must be realized to keep the temperature increase below 1.5°C (refs. 2–7). Here we use a global energy systems model 8 to assess the amount of fossil fuels that would need to be left in the ground, regionally and globally, to allow for a 50 per cent probability of limiting warming to 1.5°C. By 2050, we find that nearly 60 per cent of oil and fossil methane gas, and 90 per cent of coal must remain unextracted to keep within a 1.5°C carbon budget. This is a large increase in the unextractable estimates for a 2°C carbon budget 9, particularly for oil, for which an additional 25 per cent of reserves must remain unextracted. Furthermore, we estimate that oil and gas production must decline globally by 3 per cent each year until 2050. This implies that most regions must reach peak production now or during the next decade, rendering many operational and planned fossil fuel projects unviable. We probably present an underestimate of the production changes required, because a greater than 50 per cent probability of limiting warming to 1.5°C requires more carbon to stay in the ground and because of uncertainties around the timely deployment of negative emission technologies at scale.

Decompression sickness ("the bends") — mechanism and gas kinetics are described: Breathing air under pressure causes excess inert gas (usually nitrogen) to dissolve in and saturate body tissues; the amount of gas dissolved is proportional to and increases with total depth and time below the surface; if ascent allows supersaturation, bubbles form that interfere with blood flow and tissue oxygenation, and the excess dissolved gas must be cleared through respiration.

Alexander and colleagues looked at the environmental impact of volatile anesthetics after implementation of modern, low-flow anesthetic machines that regulate expired end tidal gas concentrations and adjust flow rates. From 2012 to 2016, they found a difference in CO 2 eq of 8.9 million kg, representing a 66% reduction in GHG emissions and a total volume of volatile anesthetic use from 1703L to 1173L. Similarly, Boyle et al. purchased machines with a lower gas flow rate and educated staff on environmental harm from volatile anesthetics, particularly desflurane. They noted a total volatile spend of €30,943 which equated to a 52% cost saving as well as an 81% reduction in CO 2 eq from 394,126 to 74,004 kg. Carter et al. sought to implement the use of low flow anesthesia and encourage the use of cheaper and environmentally conscious gases like isoflurane. They reported a 25% decrease in total expenditure of volatile agents despite an increase in operating room activity. Glenski and Levine implemented low-flow software on anesthesia machines and education initiatives, achieving 20% decrease in sevoflurane use per month.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^117X2dZA]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Biomass exposure and household air pollution in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) — in high income countries tobacco smoking accounts for over 70% of cases, whereas in LMICs it contributes to around 30% to 40% of the total burden; because LMICs together contribute to over 85% of the global COPD burden, non-smoking risk factors now contribute to over 50% of the global burden. Biomass fuels such as wood, animal dung, crop residues and coal burned in open fires or poorly functioning stoves may lead to very high levels of household air pollution, and household air pollution exposure is associated with an increased risk of developing COPD in LMICs. Almost three billion people worldwide use biomass and coal as their main source of energy for cooking, heating, and other household needs. Based on a systematic review, the use of gas for heating and cooking reduced the risk of COPD and other respiratory diseases and may be considered as a transitional fuel option in areas where clean fuel (electricity) is not readily available.

### Household cooking fuel estimates at global and country level for 1990 to 2030 [^112wNoQX]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Household air pollution generated from the use of polluting cooking fuels and technologies is a major source of disease and environmental degradation in low- and middle-income countries. Using a novel modelling approach, we provide detailed global, regional and country estimates of the percentages and populations mainly using 6 fuel categories (electricity, gaseous fuels, kerosene, biomass, charcoal, coal) and overall polluting/clean fuel use - from 1990–2020 and with urban/rural disaggregation. Here we show that 53% of the global population mainly used polluting cooking fuels in 1990, dropping to 36% in 2020. In urban areas, gaseous fuels currently dominate, with a growing reliance on electricity; in rural populations, high levels of biomass use persist alongside increasing use of gaseous fuels. Future projections of observed trends suggest 31% will still mainly use polluting fuels in 2030, including over 1 billion people in Sub-Saharan African by 2025.

### Physical and virtual carbon metabolism of global cities [^116BwPU9]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Urban activities have profound and lasting effects on the global carbon balance. Here we develop a consistent metabolic approach that combines two complementary carbon accounts, the physical carbon balance and the fossil fuel-derived gaseous carbon footprint, to track carbon coming into, being added to urban stocks, and eventually leaving the city. We find that over 88% of the physical carbon in 16 global cities is imported from outside their urban boundaries, and this outsourcing of carbon is notably amplified by virtual emissions from upstream activities that contribute 33–68% to their total carbon inflows. While 13–33% of the carbon appropriated by cities is immediately combusted and released as CO 2, between 8 and 24% is stored in durable household goods or becomes part of other urban stocks. Inventorying carbon consumed and stored for urban metabolism should be given more credit for the role it can play in stabilizing future global climate.

### Origin of compact exoplanetary systems during disk infall [^1147i495]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

As a molecular cloud core collapses, a circumstellar disk forms because infalling gas and entrained grains have too much angular momentum to fall directly onto the star. The timescale over which infall occurs is constrained by surveys of young stellar objects. Estimated median lifetimes (half-lives), t₁/₂, for Class 0 + I objects undergoing infall range from about 0.1 to 0.5 Myr, with an additional 0.1 to 0.4 Myr spent in a subsequent "flat SED" phase, which may be associated with remnant infall.

A nearly universal assumption is that planet accretion begins only after infall ends. Yet, increasing observational evidence points to an earlier start to accretion. The mass in sub-cm particles in 1 to 3 Myr old disks seems too low to explain observed compact systems, suggesting that most solids have accreted into larger sizes by this time. The flux density at different wavelengths in systems undergoing infall is indicative of grain growth, and there is evidence for mm-sized pebbles in the collapsing envelopes and disks of protostars that are only about 10⁵ yr old. Further, large-scale dust rings and gaps in disks undergoing infall hint that large bodies may exist or be forming by this time.

In this work we develop a concept in which compact system planets form during the end stages of infall. Planets accrete close to the star with their masses regulated by a balance between mass accumulation from the infalling solids and the inward gas-driven migration that becomes faster as the planetary mass increases. Across a wide range of disk conditions, we find that this balance naturally leads to total planetary system masses of a few × 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ times the stellar mass, in agreement with the observed properties of compact systems (Fig. 1).

### Association of breathing effort with survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114qTc3T]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Study Population

Between December 2020 and November 2022, 142 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 31 were enrolled in the study (Fig. E2). Five patients were excluded from the analysis because of poor-quality of recordings, leaving 26 patients for the final analysis, comprising 19 ICU survivors and seven ICU nonsurvivors. A total of 1,485,405 respiratory cycles following the initiation of respiratory effort were analyzed. The number of cycles analyzed per patient did not differ significantly between groups (mean of 54,069 cycles per patient in ICU survivors vs. 65,442 cycles per patient in ICU nonsurvivors; p = 0.651).

The clinical characteristics of study groups at baseline are presented in Table 1. Although no significant differences were observed in demographics, comorbidities, or severity at admission between the two groups, nonsurvivors tended to exhibit more severely impaired lung mechanics and oxygenation (Table 1).

TABLE 1.
Demographics, Baseline Characteristics, and Respiratory Characteristics 24 Hours After Invasive Mechanical Ventilation Initiation

Assisted Spontaneous Ventilation Period

Throughout the entire duration of mechanical ventilation, survivors and nonsurvivors began to resume spontaneous breathing after a median of 9 days (IQR, 4–21 d) for survivors vs. 11 days (IQR, 1–24 d) for nonsurvivors (p = 0.975). Both groups spend most of their total ventilation time in spontaneous breathing, with survivors and nonsurvivors spending a median of 75% and 89%, respectively, of the total duration compared with passive ventilation (p = 0.821) (Fig. E3). Table 2 presents the respiratory characteristics at the time of spontaneous breathing resumption (day 0). No differences were observed in mechanical ventilation parameters, respiratory mechanics, or gas exchange. However, F 2 was set higher for nonsurvivors compared with survivors (median [IQR], 0.50 [0.40–0.50] vs. 0.40 [0.35–0.40]; p = 0.041).

### The mortality cost of carbon [^116Aqjsi]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Like the SCC, the MCC is useful for determining the social impact of new marginal activities or projects that produce greenhouse emissions, or, equivalently, the benefit from forgoing these activities. In the central estimate, we find that the 2020 MCC is 2.26 × 10⁻⁴ lives per metric ton as shown in Table 1, with the low (< 10th percentile) to high (> 90th percentile) estimate ranging from −1.71 × 10⁻⁴ to 6.78 × 10⁻⁴ (see the "Methods" section for more details on the uncertainty in the mortality estimate). This implies that reducing (increasing) emissions by 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2020 saves 226 lives (causes 226 excess deaths) in expectation from 2020 to 2100 in the baseline emissions scenario. One million metric tons is roughly equal to the average annual emissions of 35 commercial airliners, 216,000 passenger vehicles, and 115,000 homes in the United States. The MCC implies that removing (adding) a year's worth of carbon dioxide emissions from an average coal-fired powerplant in the United States in 2020 saves 904 lives (causes 904 excess deaths) in expectation from 2020 to 2100 (refs.).

### Associations between fresh gas flow and duration of anesthetic on the maximum potential benefit of anesthetic gas capture in operating rooms and in postanesthesia care units to capture waste anesthetic gas [^114gSiVu]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sevoflurane and desflurane are halogenated hydrocarbons with global warming potential. We examined the maximum potential benefit assuming 100% efficiency of waste gas capture technology used in operating rooms and recovery locations.

Methods

We performed computer simulations of adult patients using the default settings of the Gas Man software program, including the desflurane vaporizer setting of 9% and the sevoflurane vaporizer setting of 3.7%. We performed 21 simulations with desflurane and 21 simulations with sevoflurane, the count of 21 = 1 simulation with 0-hour maintenance + (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 hours of maintenance) × (0.5, 1, 2, or 4 L per minute fresh gas flow during maintenance).

Results

(1) A completely efficient gas capture system could recover a substantive amount of agent even when the case is managed with low flows. All simulations had at least 22 mL agent recovered per case, considerably greater than the 12 mL that we considered the minimum volume of economic and environmental importance. (2) All 42 simulations had at least 73% recovery of the total agent administered, considerably greater than the median 52% recovery measured during an experimental study with one gas capture technology and desflurane. (3) The maximum percentage desflurane (or sevoflurane) that could be captured decreased substantively with progressively longer duration anesthetics for low-flow anesthetics but not for higher-flow anesthetics. However, for all 8 combinations of drug and liters per minute simulated, there was a substantively greater recovery in milliliters of agent for longer duration anesthetics. In other words, if gas capture could be near perfectly efficient, it would have greater utility per case for longer duration anesthetics. (4) Even using a 100% efficient gas capture process, at most 6 mL liquid desflurane or 3 mL sevoflurane per case would be exhaled during the patient's stay in the postanesthesia care unit. Therefore, the volume of agent exhaled during the first 1 hour postoperatively is not a substantial amount from an environmental and economic perspective to warrant consideration of agent capture by having all these patients in the postanesthesia care unit, or equivalent locations, using the specialized anesthetic gas scavenging masks with access to the hospital scavenging system at each bed.

Conclusions

Simulations with Gas Man show a strong rationale based on agent uptake and distribution for using volatile anesthetic agent capture in operating rooms if the technology can be highly efficient at volatile agent recovery.

### The atlas of unburnable oil for supply-side climate policies [^115ai1Wc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The discrepancy between the carbon budget and the CO 2 emissions embedded in global fossil fuel resources has profound implications for the future of global energy consumptionand has prompted a discussion on 'unburnable fuels' (or 'unextractable') and the associated risk of stranded assets. There is currently a surge in interest by academics and policy-makers on supply-side climate policies to limit fossil fuel production (e.g. extraction taxes, fossil fuel subsidy removal, moratoria or quotas on extraction, tradable production allowances, and restrictions on the access to credit) –. Several countries have unilaterally started various types of (partial) moratoria. Social movements have been targeting specific fossil fuel extraction or infrastructural projects intending to eliminate them altogether. Proposals have been made for a non-proliferation fossil fuel treatyand the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, the first global coalition of governments committing to the managed phase-out of oil and gas production, has been established. Initiatives and campaigns at the intersection between academia and activism, such as Leave It in the Ground (LINGO) and Oil Change International, have promoted further awareness of supply side climate policies. Finally, the International Energy Agency has acknowledged that a rapid decline of investment in fossil fuel extraction is needed and that several existing projects will have to be retired before they reach the end of their 'technical lifetime'.

### Decarbonization will lead to more equitable air quality in California [^115czjcF]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Air quality and health co-benefits

Figure 1 presents the economy wide costs, GHG emissions, and energy distribution for the two mitigation scenarios as reported in Aas et al. Figure 1a shows a lower incremental cost for the building electrification scenario ($10.6 billion 2018$) relative to the truck electrification scenario ($15.8 billion 2018$). By 2050, GHG emissions will be reduced by 88% for transportation, 78% for industry and agriculture, and 90% for buildings in the building electrification scenario, and by 92% for transportation, 79% for industry and agriculture, and 67% for buildings in the truck electrification scenario (see Fig. 1b). More energy is delivered in the form of electricity in both scenarios, but it increases from 7% in 2018 to 40% in the truck electrification scenario and to 52% in the building electrification scenario, whereas gaseous fuels reach 44 and 31% of energy use in these scenarios, respectively (Fig. 1c). Meanwhile, energy from petroleum decreases from 43% to < 5% 2018–2050 in both scenarios, and renewable sources increase dramatically from 6% to > 23%, with bioenergy increasing from 2.5 to 17%.

### Measured greenhouse gas budgets challenge emission savings from palm-oil biodiesel [^111LgzsB]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Crude palm oil production in LCA

After the FFBs were harvested in the mature plantation, the young plantation did not produce fruits yet, they were transported to the palm-oil mill located in Bunut, Sumatra (~25 km from the plantation). The mill was launched in 1996 and processes ~232,000 Mg FFB annually. The FFBs first go through a sterilization process. Then the fruits are separated from the FFBs, leaving empty fruit bunches (EFBs). The EFBs are mixed with the palm oil cake (pulp left after extracting the oil from the kernel), and are applied in the plantation as natural fertilizers, thus returning the C to the soil. Before the milling process, the fruits enter in a digester and oil is obtained together with palm kernel meal. To produce one kg of CPO, 5.18 kg of FFB are needed. The energy required in the whole process is provided by a boiler fuelled with the fibres and shells. CO 2 emissions from this combustion were calculated taking into account the water content and C content of each part. Fibres and shells have 40 and 35% water content and 47.2 and 52.4% C content, respectively.

During the production process, waste-washing water with high organic content, also referred to as palm-oil milling effluent (POME), is generated. In the waste water treatment process POME undergoes anaerobic degradation processes in a closed system, during which CH 4 is produced, which is recovered. Hypothetically, the CH 4 could be used to generate electricity the surplus of which could be sold to the national grid, as it is currently being encouraged by the Indonesian government. However, due to the lack of adequate electricity infrastructure in the study region, this is still not a common practice (< 10% of Indonesian mills treat their POME using biogas technology), and therefore we did not consider this alternative in our study. Instead, we consider that the biogas was burned, thus being released to the atmosphere as CO 2 emissions. If the CH 4 were to be directly released into the atmosphere without burning, or POME would be stored in open lagoons, where large amounts of CH 4 are produced, emissions from palm-oil biodiesel would increase considerably due to the high GWP of CH 4 (25 times higher than that of CO 2).

### Trends in greenhouse gas emissions from volatile anaesthetics in 41 countries: 2013–2023 [^116x4Jm2]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In recent decades, numerous calls have been made to reduce the climate impact of health systems, which have been calculated to contribute approximately to 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. With over 300 million patients undergoing general anaesthesia every year, anaesthesia practices impact greenhouse gas emissions directly, particularly because of the use and environmental emission of inhalational anaesthetics, and indirectly, for example through energy use, supply chain activities and waste management. This underscores the urgent need for the anaesthetic community to work towards more environmentally friendly clinical practices.

Particularly in Europe, professional societies of anaesthesia have recognised the contribution of their members to the climate crisis, resulting in statements and recommendations. There has been growing concern about the use of desflurane, a halogenated anaesthetic agent that is metabolised minimally by the human body and almost entirely released into the atmosphere. This agent has a global warming potential over 100 years (GWP 100) of 2540. This metric quantifies the relative impact of a gas on climate change in comparison to an equal mass of carbon dioxide over a 100‐year timescale. While there is an ongoing discussion on whether using global warming potential is the best way for assessing the climate impact of volatile anaesthetic agents, in particular because of their shorter atmospheric lifetime compared with other gases such as carbon dioxide, this approach is currently largely accepted at the international level.

### Drivers of the US CO ₂ emissions 1997–2013 [^116WC6Yr]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the United States decreased by ∼11% between 2007 and 2013, from 6,023 to 5,377Mt. This decline has been widely attributed to a shift from the use of coal to natural gas in US electricity production. However, the factors driving the decline have not been quantitatively evaluated; the role of natural gas in the decline therefore remains speculative. Here we analyse the factors affecting US emissions from 1997 to 2013. Before 2007, rising emissions were primarily driven by economic growth. After 2007, decreasing emissions were largely a result of economic recession with changes in fuel mix (for example, substitution of natural gas for coal) playing a comparatively minor role. Energy-climate policies may, therefore, be necessary to lock-in the recent emissions reductions and drive further decarbonization of the energy system as the US economy recovers and grows.

### State-led climate action can cut emissions at near-federal costs but favors different technologies [^111sdsCz]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In the absence of comprehensive federal greenhouse gas mitigation policy, state-led strategies may play a pivotal role, particularly following the 2024 United States presidential election. Using a detailed energy system optimization model, we examine the outcomes of 23 climate-minded states pursuing net-zero emissions targets compared to a federal carbon cap achieving equivalent CO 2 -eq reductions. Here we show that state-led decarbonization results in distinct technology choices, a 0.7% increase in system costs, and nationwide emissions reduction of 46% - substantial, but insufficient for ambitious climate goals. This pathway relies more on electrification, with 952 terawatt-hours more generation in 2050, reallocating 17.2% of emissions to the power sector. Some regions favor solar, wind, and storage, while direct air capture emerges as critical, particularly in California and the Northeast. Inter-regional trading supports and complicates mitigation efforts, underscoring the need for careful policy design. Overall, our findings highlight how state-led and federal decarbonization approaches can yield differing energy portfolios to achieve similar emissions reductions.

### The negligible role of carbon offsetting in corporate climate strategies [^116akUyh]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Costs of purchasing carbon credits for voluntary emission offsetting relative to companies' capital expenditure (CAPEX) during the reported year.

Minimum estimates (blue) are based on the lowest reported carbon credit price among companies in the sample (easyJet) for 2022, and maximum estimates (red) are based on data from Ecosystem Marketplace (2023). Reported CAPEX shares (green) indicate that companies reported total spending for carbon credits in 2022. The figure includes the 15 companies with the highest share of funds spent on carbon credits relative to their CAPEX.

Similarly, European companies face much higher costs under compliance Emission Trading Schemes (ETS) - such as EU-ETS, UK-ETS, and Switzerland-ETS - compared to their spending on carbon credits (see Fig. 3). However, there is substantial variation between sectors. For example, easyJet, despite being an outlier in carbon credit spending, spent 9.9 times more money on compliance emission trading than on voluntary emission offsetting. In the oil and gas sector, Eni had to allocate ~33.1 times more to compliance emission trading, while Shell only spent ~6.7 times more. An exception to this trend is the BMW Group, which spent more on voluntary offsetting - 2.3 times their compliance emission trading costs - since they could cover their emissions with excess allowances from past years.

### Upward revision of global fossil fuel methane emissions based on isotope database [^116mb4Gd]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Methane has the second-largest global radiative forcing impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gases after carbon dioxide, but our understanding of the global atmospheric methane budget is incomplete. The global fossil fuel industry (production and usage of natural gas, oil and coal) is thought to contribute 15 to 22 per cent of methane emissions to the total atmospheric methane budget. However, questions remain regarding methane emission trends as a result of fossil fuel industrial activity and the contribution to total methane emissions of sources from the fossil fuel industry and from natural geological seepage, which are often co-located. Here we re-evaluate the global methane budget and the contribution of the fossil fuel industry to methane emissions based on long-term global methane and methane carbon isotope records. We compile the largest isotopic methane source signature database so far, including fossil fuel, microbial and biomass-burning methane emission sources. We find that total fossil fuel methane emissions (fossil fuel industry plus natural geological seepage) are not increasing over time, but are 60 to 110 per cent greater than current estimates owing to large revisions in isotope source signatures. We show that this is consistent with the observed global latitudinal methane gradient. After accounting for natural geological methane seepage, we find that methane emissions from natural gas, oil and coal production and their usage are 20 to 60 per cent greater than inventories. Our findings imply a greater potential for the fossil fuel industry to mitigate anthropogenic climate forcing, but we also find that methane emissions from natural gas as a fraction of production have declined from approximately 8 per cent to approximately 2 per cent over the past three decades.

### Effect of different CPAP levels on ultrasound-assessed lung aeration and gas exchange in neonates [^114Pufna]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Our work has strengths and limitations. The main strength resides in the real-world nature of the study, which has been nested within the framework of routine clinical practice. Thus, the study deems variables that may not be considered in experimental settings or with other designs. Given the ease of use of lung ultrasound and its increasingly widespread application, our results can be easily reproduced in other centres. Conversely, the same study design entails some main limitations. First, there is no randomization or blinding: this was unavoidable since quantitative lung ultrasound is included in our clinical management, and it would have been unethical doing otherwise. Thus, the study was pragmatically performed during routine care; to obtain a blinding a different study design would have been needed. As consequences: (1) we cannot exclude that the eLUS improvement would be due to the total time elapsed on CPAP rather than to the incremental CPAP level, and (2) physicians could see the pressure level and the vital parameters during ultrasound scans since it is impossible to conceal patient conditions. Nonetheless, previous studies have demonstrated equally optimal inter-observer agreement for lung ultrasound interpretation, irrespective of blindness. Second, we recruited a relatively small convenience sample size, as a formal calculation was unfeasible but our choice seems justified in light of previous studies. Third, we used a relatively short wash-out as this was embedded in our routine clinical practice, whereas a longer time could have allowed to detect more differences. However, the wash-out time was similar to that used in the unique preliminary study available in this area and findings obtained during alveolar recruitment in intubated neonates. Also, wash-out was equal to the time spent under each CPAP level before performing any measurement. Another limitation is that the hysteresis was demonstrated in a small subgroup of TTN patients. Nonetheless, the procedure was not entirely (i.e. inflation and deflation) realized in patients who did not show a relevant improvement when CPAP was increased and, given the pragmatic nature of the study, when the clinical workload did not allow it. However, the detection of hysteresis is an ancillary finding that is consistent with data obtained in animal models. Gas exchange was monitored with non-invasive devices, which is accepted by international consensus, while the use of arterial lines and repeated blood gas analyses would be unethical in these patients. Our data have been produced with variable flow CPAP and cannot be generalised to patients assisted with other types of CPAP. Finally, the RDS cohort consisted of relatively mature neonates and data may not be directly applicable to extremely preterm neonates.

### Limited emission reductions from fuel subsidy removal except in energy-exporting regions [^114q8coz]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Hopes are high that removing fossil fuel subsidies could help to mitigate climate change by discouraging inefficient energy consumption and levelling the playing field for renewable energy. In September 2016, the G20 countries re-affirmed their 2009 commitment (at the G20 Leaders' Summit) to phase out fossil fuel subsidies and many national governments are using today's low oil prices as an opportunity to do so. In practical terms, this means abandoning policies that decrease the price of fossil fuels and electricity generated from fossil fuels to below normal market prices. However, whether the removal of subsidies, even if implemented worldwide, would have a large impact on climate change mitigation has not been systematically explored. Here we show that removing fossil fuel subsidies would have an unexpectedly small impact on global energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions and would not increase renewable energy use by 2030. Subsidy removal would reduce the carbon price necessary to stabilize greenhouse gas concentration at 550 parts per million by only 2–12 per cent under low oil prices. Removing subsidies in most regions would deliver smaller emission reductions than the Paris Agreement (2015) climate pledges and in some regions global subsidy removal may actually lead to an increase in emissions, owing to either coal replacing subsidized oil and natural gas or natural-gas use shifting from subsidizing, energy-exporting regions to non-subsidizing, importing regions. Our results show that subsidy removal would result in the largest CO 2 emission reductions in high-income oil- and gas-exporting regions, where the reductions would exceed the climate pledges of these regions and where subsidy removal would affect fewer people living below the poverty line than in lower-income regions.

### Clinical, operative, and economic outcomes of the point-of-care blood gases in the nephrology department of a third-level hospital [^111y4fdq]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Context —

Point-of-care testing allows rapid analysis and short turnaround times. To the best of our knowledge, the present study assesses, for the first time, clinical, operative, and economic outcomes of point-of-care blood gas analysis in a nephrology department.

Objective —

To evaluate the impact after implementing blood gas analysis in the nephrology department, considering clinical (differences in blood gas analysis results, critical results), operative (turnaround time, elapsed time between consecutive blood gas analysis, preanalytical errors), and economic (total cost per process) outcomes.

Design —

A total amount of 3195 venous blood gas analyses from 688 patients of the nephrology department before and after point-of-care blood gas analyzer installation were included. Blood gas analysis results obtained by ABL90 FLEX PLUS were acquired from the laboratory information system. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 software.

Results —

During the point-of-care testing period, there was an increase in blood glucose levels and a decrease in pCO2, lactate, and sodium as well as fewer critical values (especially glucose and lactate). The turnaround time and the mean elapsed time were shorter. By the beginning of this period, the number of preanalytical errors increased; however, no statistically significant differences were found during year-long monitoring. Although there was an increase in the total number of blood gas analysis requests, the total cost per process decreased.

Conclusions —

The implementation of a point-of-care blood gas analysis in a nephrology department has a positive impact on clinical, operative, and economic terms of patient care.

### Measured greenhouse gas budgets challenge emission savings from palm-oil biodiesel [^1178Zary]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In our improved LCA, we assumed that POME went through an anaerobic degradation process in a closed system, and that the CH 4 produced was recovered and burned. This assumption led to emissions of 1.8 gCO 2 eq. MJ −1 for POME, 3% of the total LCA emissions (Fig. 3). Depending on the system at the oil palm mill, these emissions could be substantially lower or higher. Theoretically, the CH 4 combustion could be used to produce electricity which could be fed into local grids, thus potentially reducing POME-related emissions from palm-oil biodiesel. On the other hand, many Indonesian mills still dump POME in open lagoons, leading to large CH 4 losses to the atmosphere; this results in a ninefold increase in POME-related emissions to 16.5 gCO 2 eq. MJ −1 and would lead to substantial increases in the emissions from the business-as-usual scenario. Effective POME management is therefore a possible strategy to mitigate GHG emissions from palm-oil biodiesel.

Greenhouse gas emissions from palm-oil biodiesel from first-rotation cycle plantations are too high to lead to any emission savings, even with the implementation of optimized management scenarios (Fig. 2). However, looking ahead, our analysis shows that there is potential for emission savings for second rotation cycle plantations and for plantations established on degraded lands. Our alternative scenarios point to options for relatively quickly to implement, management-based increases in GHG emission savings, e.g. increases in rotation cycles and the use of earlier-yielding oil palm varieties. As our study was focused on GHG balance and LCA and did not cover other indicators of sustainability, the results should be interpreted in the context of further ecological, social and economic indicators of sustainable palm-oil production when designing and implementing management directives and policy on palm-oil biodiesel.

### Trends in greenhouse gas emissions from volatile anaesthetics in 41 countries: 2013–2023 [^113ce6cD]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Volatile capture systems have been proposed as a possible solution to prevent the release of volatile anaesthetic agents into the environment. However, clinical studies suggest that the efficiency of these systems is inadequate to prevent an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the use of desflurane. Therefore, this approach is currently not considered as a viable alternative to the reduction of volatile anaesthetic agents use, particularly given the uncertain environmental footprint of the entire process and the current regulatory prohibition on reusing recaptured medication.

Our study has several limitations. First, in our calculations we considered only the greenhouse gas emissions arising from the atmospheric release of volatile anaesthetic agents. In fact, emissions occur during the whole life‐cycle of a halogenated anaesthetic drug (as for any other pharmaceutical), including the production, packaging, transport, stockage and dismissal stages. However, the vast majority of emissions occur during clinical use due to the direct atmospheric release of unmetabolised gases. Thus, we expect the consequent underestimate in our results to be small. Moreover, it is unlikely that our approach could have substantially biased the time trends that we observed. Second, we were able to include in our analysis only a limited number of countries, with a clear over‐representation of high‐income ones (online Supporting Information Table S1). Indeed, data on sales of volatile anaesthetic agents in South America, Africa and some Asian countries (e.g. India) were either incomplete or unavailable. As desflurane is more expensive than other volatile anaesthetic agents, it is reasonable to expect that most of its use occurs in the (mostly high‐income) countries that we considered. Conversely, we also found that several medium‐income countries (e.g. China and the Russian Federation) increased their use substantially in the last few years. Thus, expanding future research beyond high‐income countries is warranted. Third, is that our analysis was restricted to the use of volatile anaesthetic agents and we did not consider the contribution of nitrous oxide, which is responsible for a substantial proportion of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of anaesthetics, and the highest proportion in some systems. This was because reliable consumption data for nitrous oxide are currently unavailable in most countries. Despite its use decreasing over time, nitrous oxide remains readily available in operating theatres worldwide via pipeline systems. Recent studies suggest that direct atmospheric emissions of nitrous oxide are not only a result of operating theatre use but, more critically, come from continuous leaks in the pipeline infrastructure and poor stock management, which lead to a substantial mismatch between procurement and clinical use, and often contribute a much larger volume than that used for clinical purposes. Furthermore, monitoring nitrous oxide use is complicated by its widespread application for analgesia outside of anaesthesia settings, including in labour suites, dental practices and pre‐hospital care environments. Therefore, it is of high priority to improve a thorough quantification of nitrous oxide usage and to implement educational and policy measures aimed at reducing its waste.

### Invasive group A streptococcal disease in pregnant women and young children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114PjDUG]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Background

The incidence of invasive disease caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) has increased in multiple countries in the past 15 years. However, despite these reports, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic reviews and combined estimates of the incidence of invasive GAS have been done in key high-risk groups. To address this, we estimated the incidence of invasive GAS disease, including death and disability outcomes, among two high-risk groups-namely, pregnant women and children younger than 5 years.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analyses on invasive GAS outcomes, including incidence, case fatality risks, and neurodevelopmental impairment risk, among pregnant women, neonates (younger than 28 days), infants (younger than 1 year), and children (younger than 5 years) worldwide and by income region. We searched several databases for articles published from Jan 1, 2000, to June 3, 2020, for publications that reported invasive GAS outcomes, and we sought unpublished data from an investigator group of collaborators. We included studies with data on invasive GAS cases, defined as laboratory isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes from any normally sterile site, or isolation of S pyogenes from a non-sterile site in a patient with necrotising fasciitis or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. For inclusion in pooled incidence estimates, studies had to report a population denominator, and for inclusion in pooled estimates of case fatality risk, studies had to report aggregate data on the outcome of interest and the total number of cases included as a denominator. We excluded studies focusing on groups at very high risk (eg, only preterm infants). We assessed heterogeneity with I 2.

Findings

Of the 950 published articles and 29 unpublished datasets identified, 20 studies (seven unpublished; 3829 cases of invasive GAS) from 12 countries provided sufficient data to be included in pooled estimates of outcomes. We did not identify studies reporting invasive GAS incidence among pregnant women in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) nor any reporting neurodevelopmental impairment after invasive GAS in LMICs. In nine studies from high-income countries (HICs) that reported invasive GAS in pregnancy and the post-partum period, invasive GAS incidence was 0.12 per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 0.11 to 0.14; I² = 100%). Invasive GAS incidence was 0.04 per 1000 livebirths (0.03 to 0.05; I² = 100%; 11 studies) for neonates, 0.13 per 1000 livebirths (0.10 to 0.16; I² = 100%; ten studies) for infants, and 0.09 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 0.07 to 0.10; I² = 100%; nine studies) for children worldwide; 0.12 per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 0.00 to 0.24; I² = 100%; three studies) in neonates, 0.33 per 1000 livebirths (-0.22 to 0.88; I² = 100%; two studies) in infants, and 0.22 per 1000 person-years (0.13 to 0.31; I² = 100%; two studies) in children in LMICs; and 0.02 per 1000 livebirths (0.00 to 0.03; I² = 100%; eight studies) in neonates, 0.08 per 1000 livebirths (0.05 to 0.11; I² = 100%; eight studies) in infants, and 0.05 per 1000 person-years (0.03 to 0.06; I² = 100%; seven studies) in children for HICs. Case fatality risks were high, particularly among neonates in LMICs (61% [95% CI 33 to 89]; I² = 54%; two studies).

Interpretation

We found a substantial burden of invasive GAS among young children. In LMICs, little data were available for neonates and children and no data were available for pregnant women. Incidences of invasive GAS are likely to be underestimates, particularly in LMICs, due to low GAS surveillance. It is essential to improve available data to inform development of prevention and management strategies for invasive GAS.

### US oil and gas system emissions from nearly one million aerial site measurements [^112Y76tR]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

As airborne methane surveys of oil and gas systems continue to discover large emissions that are missing from official estimates 1–4, the true scope of methane emissions from energy production has yet to be quantified. We integrate approximately one million aerial site measurements into regional emissions inventories for six regions in the USA, comprising 52% of onshore oil and 29% of gas production over 15aerial campaigns. We construct complete emissions distributions for each, employing empirically grounded simulations to estimate small emissions. Total estimated emissions range from 0.75% (95% confidence interval (CI)0.65%, 0.84%) of covered natural gas production in a high-productivity, gas-rich region to 9.63% (95% CI 9.04%, 10.39%) in a rapidly expanding, oil-focused region. The six-region weighted average is 2.95% (95% CI 2.79%, 3.14%), or roughly three times the national government inventory estimate 5. Only 0.05–1.66% of well sites contribute the majority (50–79%) of well site emissions in 11 out of 15surveys. Ancillary midstream facilities, including pipelines, contribute 18–57% of estimated regional emissions, similarly concentrated in a small number of point sources. Together, the emissions quantified here represent an annual loss of roughly US$1billion in commercial gas value and a US$9.3billion annual social cost 6. Repeated, comprehensive, regional remote-sensing surveys offer a path to detect these low-frequency, high-consequence emissions for rapid mitigation, incorporation into official emissions inventories and a clear-eyed assessment of the most effective emission-finding technologies for a given region.

### Direct regeneration of degraded lithium-ion battery cathodes with a multifunctional organic lithium salt [^112JgwSB]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are also important considerations in developing a sustainable recycling system. The total energy consumption of pyro- and hydro-processes are respectively 12.14 and 19.57 MJ kg −1 cell (Supplementary Fig. 29a). The material and energy use is mainly attributed to the high-temperature smelting in pyro-process. In the hydro-process, 89.5% of energy consumption comes from strong acid leaching and metal extraction/precipitation steps. As comparison, only 3.16 MJ kg −1 cell is required for direct process. The total GHG emissions are respectively 1.96, 1.49, and 0.59 kg kg −1 cell for pyro-, hydro-, and direct recovery (Supplementary Fig. 29b). The above results show the advantages in environmental protection and energy conservation of direct recovery process due to the reduced material consumption and simplified operation procedures. Three different battery recycling technologies have been compared and the conclusions are summarized in Fig. 5g. The direct route has a significant advantage due to the high value of the final products, especially the restored LFP cathode material. The direct route is also superior in operation simplicity, avoiding the complex disposal procedures –. The direct route is therefore feasible for the future recycling industry.

However, some challenges still need to be overcome before this method finds large-scale use. First, it may be still a challenge to restore highly degraded cathodes by solid direct regeneration. Second, although our economic analysis provides a feasible reference, additional factors need to be considered in the real world, including the collection and classification of spent batteries, and the impact of transportation. Third, a general recovery technology is urgently needed for different cathode materials with different degrees of degradation to satisfy the practical criteria on a large scale. Although there are challenges involved in using the technique on a large scale, we believe with an improvement in the recycling system of spent LIBs, advanced direct recycling technologies will have a great benefit.

### Greenhouse gases: low methane leakage from gas pipelines [^116D51sC]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Using natural gas for fuel releases less carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced than burning oil or coal, but its production and transport are accompanied by emissions of methane, which is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide in the short term. This calls into question whether climate forcing could be reduced by switching from coal and oil to natural gas. We have made measurements in Russia along the world's largest gas-transport system and find that methane leakage is in the region of 1.4%, which is considerably less than expected and comparable to that from systems in the United States. Our calculations indicate that using natural gas in preference to other fossil fuels could be useful in the short term for mitigating climate change.

### The atlas of unburnable oil for supply-side climate policies [^114SpyxD]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The selection of the resources that need to stay under the ground vis-à-vis those that can be extracted is a crucial step on the way to imagining and constructing an effective international system to leave a share of existing global fossil fuel resources unextracted. The allocation of the remaining fossil fuels that can be extracted is a morally and politically contentious issuethat is entwined with the issue of compensation. In fact, (partial) compensation could be considered a condition for the political feasibility of any multilateral international agreement to keep fossil fuels unextractedand the pathway to an agreement could include intermediary steps to strengthen international norms against fossil fuelsand club arrangements to pave the way to the agreement. When it comes to the principles that can inform the distribution of fossil fuels that cannot be extracted, the global North (developed countries) has historically contributed the most to accumulated greenhouse gas emissions generating an ecological debtand fossil fuel rents could contribute towards the global South's (developing countries) right to development. Previous studies suggest, based on ethical considerations (philosophical principles of justice and fairness), that developed countries are those who should leave their fossil fuels underground, whereas studies based on economic efficiency suggest that those resources whose extraction generates lower rents (because of relatively higher extraction, transportation and transformation costs, or lower economic value of the resources) should be left untapped –. In this paper, we take a different approach and use the socio-environmental impacts of fossil fuel extraction in different locations to suggest alternative distributions of unburnable fossil fuels.

### SAGES guidelines for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) [^1139xVsn]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

SAGES guidelines — division of the short gastric vessels during surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) — report comparative outcomes showing small or uncertain benefits and harms. There was 1% less dysphagia with division compared to no division (CI 11.1% fewer to 13.7% more). From two RCTs with 151 patients, there was 5.8% less PPI use (at 10-20-year follow-up) in division patients (CI 13.8% fewer to 10.1% more). Symptom control from a single RCT with 10-year follow-up and 82 patients showed a difference 13.2% greater control with division (3.1% fewer to 32.5% more). Harms included complications, defined as Clavien-Dindo score ≥ 3, from four RCTs with follow-up ranging from 6 months to 1 year and a total of 327 patients, demonstrating 1.8% more complications in patients with short gastric division (CI 0.7% fewer to 10.5% more), and gas bloat where two RCTs with 10-20-year follow-up and 151 total patients demonstrated 21.8% more patients with gas bloat (CI from 12.2% fewer to 85.6% more). The panel expressed concern for a possible early learning-curve effect and noted pyloroplasty or gastrostomy may decrease gas bloat, but the certainty and degree of this effect is unknown. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated as very low. For those trained to do either division or no division, both options would be feasible based on training; feasibility varies by anatomy, and division may be necessary where a tension free wrap is not otherwise possible. The panelists agreed that the evidence provided does not favor either division or no division of the short gastric vessels.

### Decarbonization will lead to more equitable air quality in California [^113qhvBx]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Mitigation cost analysis

The mitigation costs for each scenario are taken from Aas et al.and were estimated by E3 using the California PATHWAYS model. PATHWAYS is an energy and infrastructure model that can be used to assess the cost and GHG emissions of California's energy demand and supply decisions designed to achieve long-term climate targets. PATHWAYS is used extensively in California to develop and assess economy-wide scenarios meeting climate policy targets using differing combinations of mitigation measures. Given the focus on decarbonizing natural gas, a detailed technoeconomic assessment for each truck electrification pathway considered was conducted including costs (energy, capital, and feedstock) and resource potential as described in Appendix E of the referenced reportand used to update PATHWAYS for this work. The economy wide costs estimated by PATHWAYS represent a total resource cost that includes all direct energy system costs within the California economy resulting from fuel consumption and from capital costs from energy infrastructure associated with purchase of building appliances or vehicles, as well as incremental energy efficiency or fuel-switching capital costs. To calculate mitigation cost for each census tract, it is assumed that costs to each individual are equally distributed across the California population. The mitigation cost for each census tract is then estimated by calculating the sum of individual costs within each census tract.

### Electricity generation and health [^1135XFPt]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

The provision of electricity has been a great benefit to society, particularly in health terms, but it also carries health costs. Comparison of different forms of commercial power generation by use of the fuel cycle methods developed in European studies shows the health burdens to be greatest for power stations that most pollute outdoor air (those based on lignite, coal, and oil). The health burdens are appreciably smaller for generation from natural gas, and lower still for nuclear power. This same ranking also applies in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions and thus, potentially, to long-term health, social, and economic effects arising from climate change. Nuclear power remains controversial, however, because of public concern about storage of nuclear waste, the potential for catastrophic accident or terrorist attack, and the diversion of fissionable material for weapons production. Health risks are smaller for nuclear fusion, but commercial exploitation will not be achieved in time to help the crucial near-term reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. The negative effects on health of electricity generation from renewable sources have not been assessed as fully as those from conventional sources, but for solar, wind, and wave power, such effects seem to be small; those of biofuels depend on the type of fuel and the mode of combustion. Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage is increasingly being considered for reduction of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel plants, but the health effects associated with this technology are largely unquantified and probably mixed: efficiency losses mean greater consumption of the primary fuel and accompanying increases in some waste products. This paper reviews the state of knowledge regarding the health effects of different methods of generating electricity.

### Methane emissions from US low production oil and natural gas well sites [^112jjsae]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Our estimate for total CH 4 emissions from active onshore low production O&G well sites in 2019 is 4 Tg (1 s.f.), with a 95% confidence interval (CI) on the mean of 3–6 Tg (Fig. 4a). The mean estimate is 54% (95% CI: 37–75%) of the 7.6 Tg for total O&G CH 4 emissions from all O&G production sites based on Alvarez et al. which we consider the best current measurement-based estimate of national-scale CH 4 emissions from all US O&G production sites. Our measurement-based estimate for all US low production well sites is roughly 50% more than the total CH 4 emissions from the entire Permian Basin (2.7 Tg), one of the world's largest O&G producing regions. Additionally, the 4 Tg of low production well site CH 4 emissions is > 10% greater than the US EPA's estimate of ~3.4 Tg for all US O&G production site CH 4 emissions in 2019. These CH 4 emissions are equivalent to CH 4 loss rates of 13% (95% CI: 8–17%) relative to CH 4 production in 2019, assuming 80% CH 4 content in produced natural gas. This CH 4 loss rate is a factor of 6–12 times higher than the mean CH 4 loss rate of 1.5% for all O&G well sites based on Alvarez et al.(Fig. 4a).

### Diverse decarbonization pathways under near cost-optimal futures [^115j4r46]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In the near cost-optimal decarbonization pathways examined in this paper, there is a notable trend toward widespread adoption of specific technologies such as solar and wind power, grid-connected energy storage, and electrification across various sectors, including industry, transportation, residential, and commercial sectors. These options are consistently chosen for achieving net-zero CO 2 outcomes. Our pathways also consistently show that eliminating coal power without CCS and substantial reductions in petroleum use are required for near cost-optimal decarbonization. Initiating planning now for a just and orderly transition away from these industries, considering the needs of affected communities, is imperative.

A broad range of outcomes is possible for emerging energy technologies that could enable decarbonization, such as hydrogen, DAC, CCS, and synthetic fuels. Currently, these options are either minimally deployed or not commercially available. In the near cost-optimal decarbonization pathways explored in this work, their deployment varies from trivial to pivotal, posing challenges for long-term planning. To enable their scaled deployment by mid-century, continued research and development, supportive policies, and early deployment requirements are needed. Widespread deployment of carbon management technologies must overcome many challenges, including biomass resource availability, CO 2 storage costs, and the development of supporting infrastructure such as CO 2 pipelines. Furthermore, the availability of these novel technologies will have substantial implications for natural gas consumption in a decarbonized energy system. Natural gas consumption could remain near current levels in pathways where carbon management technologies are widely deployed. By contrast, pathways in which carbon management technologies are more restricted, natural gas consumption is nearly zero by 2050. The chosen pathway has significant implications for gas system infrastructure, including pipeline utilization, maintenance, and potential expansion or decommissioning. Planning must consider these factors to ensure a successful transition towards decarbonization.

### Decarbonization will lead to more equitable air quality in California [^1139vsHN]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Total mitigation costs in 2018 dollars for each scenario were calculated from economy-wide annual net costs relative to the reference scenario by Aas et al. Dividing the total mitigation cost of each scenario by the projected population in 2050 (i.e. per capita costs assuming each California resident pays an equal share of the costs), we estimate the implicit cost per life saved in each census tract. Figure 4c compares cumulative mitigation costs against cumulative population in 2050, with a valuation of statistical life (VSL) of $9.70 million (2018$) also plotted for comparison (Roman and Robinson, 2016). In most census tracts, the mitigation cost per life saved is less — and sometimes much less — than the VSL (See also Table 1). Statewide, applying the VSL of $9.70 million per life, the economic value of deaths avoided in the building electrification and truck electrification scenarios in 2050 is $59 billion and $51 billion, respectively, which less costs translate to net total social-economic benefits of $49 billion and $35 billion, respectively.

### Carbon footprint of the RSNA annual meeting [^117Dht3Y]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the airplane travel-related carbon footprint of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) annual meeting, the associated health burden, and the costs to offset these greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. compensation of emissions by funding an equivalent CO 2 saving elsewhere).

Methods

The RSNA's website was used to determine the reported country of origin of attendees to the 2017 meeting that took place in Chicago from November 26 to December 1. It was assumed that attendees had traveled from the airport nearest to the largest city in their country or state to Chicago's O'Hare international airport. The total amount of air travel-related CO 2 -equivalent emission (based on round-trip economy class travel), the imposed health burden in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in the global population, the total CO 2 offsets costs, and the CO 2 offsets costs per DALY were calculated.

Results

The calculated airplane travel-related CO 2 -equivalent emissions of 11,223 attendees from the United States and 10,684 attendees from other countries were 7,067,618 kg and 32,438,420 kg, totaling 39,506,038 kg. This caused an estimated 51.4–79.0 DALYs. The calculated amount of Total CO 2 offset costs were calculated to be $474,072, which corresponds to $6,001–9,223 per DALY averted.

Conclusions

The airplane travel-related carbon footprint of the RSNA annual meeting and the associated disease burden are relevant, and potential attendees and organizers should take measures to overcome this undesired side effect. Offsetting this carbon footprint is cost-effective and this initiative should be taken by the radiological community.

### Catalytic production of low-carbon footprint sustainable natural gas [^114rRNBy]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Natural gas, one of the global primary energy sources, could be used as fuel for generating electricity, heating, and powering transportation, and also as raw materials to manufacture hydrogen and ammonia –. CH 4 (70–90%) and a small percentage of C2–C4 hydrocarbons constitute primarily of its composition. Biogenic and thermogenic processes are the two widely accepted mechanisms of natural gas genesis. No matter generated in which way, several essential conditions for natural gas formation are organic molecules, suitable temperature and atmosphere, a long time of million years and sometimes water is also needed. Abundant and accessible biomass is believed to be the only renewable carbon resource known and a promising alternative to fossil fuels for the production of fuel, and chemicals –. Owing to the rapid growth of gas demand and violent fluctuation of price, utilization of renewable biomass resource to produce synthetic natural gas has attracted great attention.

Anaerobic digestion of plant and animal wastes could produce marsh gas which is primarily composed of CH 4 (50–70%) and CO 2 (30–50%). Thermochemical methods have also been developed for the production of biomass fuel gas. The pyrolysis/gasification process, one of the widely used techniques for raw biomass conversion, is usually operated at 600–1000 °C and produces a gas mixture mainly containing CO, CO 2, H 2, and CH 4 –. And the total content of hydrocarbons is generally less than 10%. Coupling the catalytic hydrogenation process with biomass gasification would increase the yield of hydrocarbons. The final gas products of the two-step process are composed by 55–75% of CH 4 and a fairly higher number of CO 2 (15–25%) compared to commercial natural gas. The sub- or supercritical water gasification process is another way for gas production which is usually conducted under the operating conditions of 300–600 °C. The content of CO 2 in gas products is comparable with or even higher than that of CH 4. Overall, the gas produced by all of the above methods could not satisfy the composition requirements of pipeline natural gas. Besides, the remained solid residues after the reaction need to be removed and the separation units would increase energy consumption and operating costs. Therefore, it still remains a challenge for the efficient transformation of biomass to commercial natural gas.

Eighty percent of US oil and natural gas (O&G) production sites are low production well sites, with average site-level production ≤ 15 barrels of oil equivalent per day and producing only 6% of the nation's O&G output in 2019. Here, we integrate national site-level O&G production data and previously reported site-level CH 4 measurement data (n = 240) and find that low production well sites are a disproportionately large source of US O&G well site CH 4 emissions, emitting more than 4 (95% confidence interval: 3 — 6) teragrams, 50% more than the total CH 4 emissions from the Permian Basin, one of the world's largest O&G producing regions. We estimate low production well sites represent roughly half (37 — 75%) of all O&G well site CH 4 emissions, and a production-normalized CH 4 loss rate of more than 10% — a factor of 6 — 12 times higher than the mean CH 4 loss rate of 1.5% for all O&G well sites in the US. Our work suggests that achieving significant reductions in O&G CH 4 emissions will require mitigation of emissions from low production well sites.

### Warm-hot baryons comprise 5–10 per cent of filaments in the cosmic web [^1162LcnW]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Observations of the cosmic microwave background indicate that baryons account for 5 per cent of the Universe's total energy content. In the local Universe, the census of all observed baryons falls short of this estimate by a factor of two. Cosmological simulations indicate that the missing baryons have not condensed into virialized haloes, but reside throughout the filaments of the cosmic web (where matter density is larger than average) as a low-density plasma at temperatures of 10⁵–10⁷ kelvin, known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium. There have been previous claims of the detection of warm-hot baryons along the line of sight to distant blazars and of hot gas between interacting clusters. These observations were, however, unable to trace the large-scale filamentary structure, or to estimate the total amount of warm-hot baryons in a representative volume of the Universe. Here we report X-ray observations of filamentary structures of gas at 10(7) kelvin associated with the galaxy cluster Abell 2744. Previous observations of this cluster were unable to resolve and remove coincidental X-ray point sources. After subtracting these, we find hot gas structures that are coherent over scales of 8 megaparsecs. The filaments coincide with over-densities of galaxies and dark matter, with 5–10 per cent of their mass in baryonic gas. This gas has been heated up by the cluster's gravitational pull and is now feeding its core. Our findings strengthen evidence for a picture of the Universe in which a large fraction of the missing baryons reside in the filaments of the cosmic web.

### Diverse decarbonization pathways under near cost-optimal futures [^114ihUV6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In this study, we introduce an application and design of MGA, applied to a comprehensive U.S. energy system model to assess near cost-optimal net-zero CO 2 futures. In the context of this study, near-cost-optimal net-zero CO 2 futures refer to pathways to achieve net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2050 that are close to the lowest possible system cost. These pathways allow for consideration of factors that may be desirable to include but difficult to explicitly model. The model endogenizes technology adoption, allowing for an extensive exploration of technology choices across diverse decarbonization pathways. By incorporating explicit descriptions of the transportation, buildings, power, and industrial sectors, the model accounts for the complex interactions between the major energy sectors. Furthermore, our work extends beyond previous studies in that it accounts for path dependencies resulting from past investments in energy system infrastructure, providing insights into the dynamics of the energy system in later years of the simulations. These features of the modeling effort enable us to better address the questions: What are the characteristics of a wide range of near cost-optimal pathways that achieve a net-zero energy system in the United States? Are there common themes amongst these pathways, including favored and disfavored technologies, from which we can extract robust insights? Are there correlated decisions in technology adoption that may be particularly informative for policy-making? Through our modeling, we find several consistent trends across the near cost-optimal pathways, including the rapid expansion of solar and wind power generation, substantial reductions in petroleum use, near elimination of coal combustion, and increased end-use electrification. We also observed varying levels of deployment for natural gas, hydrogen, direct air capture of CO 2, and synthetic fuels, with important correlations in adoption across some technologies.

### Closing the methane gap in US oil and natural gas production emissions inventories [^115pW1rk]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In this work, our contributions are threefold. First, we construct a bottom-up, O&NG production-segment CH 4 emissions estimation tool based on the most comprehensive public database of component-level activity and emissions measurements yet assembled. Our analysis boundary is the O&NG production segment which includes all active, onshore well pads and tank batteries (excluding inactive and offshore wells) and ends prior to centralized gathering and processing facilities (Supplementary Fig. 1). We focus on the production segment given its significant emissions (~58% of total supply chain CH 4 emissions in Alvarez et al.) and the large difference between site-level estimates and the GHGI(~70% of difference between Alvarez et al.and the GHGI, Supplementary Fig. 2). Our approach differs from the GHGI in that it applies a bootstrap resampling statistical approach to allow for inclusion of infrequent, large emitters, thus robustly addressing the issue of super-emitters. Second, we use this tool to produce an inventory of US O&NG production segment CH 4 emissions and compare this with the GHGI and previous site-level results. Here, we show that much of the divergence between different methods at different scales vanishes when we apply our improved dataset and statistical approaches. As mentioned earlier, site-level synthesis studies have been validated against even larger-scale top-down studies, so improved alignment between the national results of our component-level method and previous site-level synthesis results suggests much better agreement with top-down results. Third, to isolate specific sources of disagreement between the GHGI and other studies, we reconstruct the GHGI emission factors beginning with the underlying datasets and uncover some possible sources of disagreement between inventory methods and top-down studies. Based on these results, we suggest a strategy for improving the accuracy of the GHGI, and likewise any country using a similar approach in reporting O&NG CH 4 emissions to the UNFCCC. We acknowledge that the results of our study required extrapolating relatively small sample sizes to the level of the US. Certain sources, especially tanks, are currently poorly characterized, and this prevents us from generating region-specific emission factor estimates. However, when evaluating our results, we must be clear that the baseline we are comparing to is not a world with perfect information about CH 4 emissions. It is the current GHGI, which is even more data limited.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^113i5hDR]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Radon-resistant construction — components and costs for passive systems are outlined: Inclusion of radon-resistant techniques in initial construction costs approximately $350 to $500. A passive radon-resistant system has five major parts — a layer of gas-permeable material under the foundation; the foundation (usually 4 inches of gravel); plastic sheeting over the foundation with all openings in the concrete foundation floor sealed and caulked; a gas-tight, 3- or 4-inch vent pipe running from under the foundation through the house to the roof; and a roughed-in electrical junction box for the future installation of a fan, if needed. These features create a physical barrier to radon entry, and the vent pipe redirects the flow of air under the foundation, preventing radon from seeping into the house.

### A cost comparison of various hourly-reliable and net-zero hydrogen production pathways in the United States [^111Yrq6N]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

See Figure S. 23 of the SI to examine how the next-decade results shown in Fig. 3 compare to those for current and mid-century timeframes. LCOH trends seen in Fig. 3 remain consistent for current and mid-century results but with differing magnitudes due to the level of technology evolution.

Net-zero, hourly-reliable hydrogen production cost comparison

Figure 4 compares the electricity-based and fossil-based LCOH results with the following assumptions: next-decade technology costs, location-specific energy attributes, net-zero emissions, and hourly delivery reliability. The LCOH is composed of three parts: the cost of the hydrogen production facility and operations, the cost of removing life-cycle feedstock and direct facility emissions (excluding emissions from natural gas leakage), and the cost of removing upstream natural gas leakage. These last two costs are treated as separate categories to provide insights into the importance of natural gas leakage on hydrogen production emissions mitigation. With these considerations, Fig. 4 shows that electricity-based hydrogen production that uses a combination of energy storage, solar PV, and grid electricity can be at cost-parity, if not lower cost, than all fossil-based alternatives when accounting for emission removal costs. This takeaway is true regardless of location and, in Texas, the PV/Storage/Grid* (same as Hourly*) case would even be viable if there was no natural gas leakage in the fossil-based cases. The fossil-based production pathways become especially uneconomic from a net-zero perspective when upstream natural gas leakage exceeds 4%. In our baseline fossil-based pathways, CO 2 removal costs for mitigating 4% natural gas leakage can contribute up to $2.55/kg to the net-zero emission LCOH, more than doubling the LCOH when no cost for removing residual emissions is included. This assumes a 20-year global warming potential (GWP) timeframe is used for natural gas, but the CO 2 removal cost for 4% natural gas leakage is still relatively high ($0.84/kg–$0.90/kg) using a 100-year GWP timeframe (see Fig. 4). This point on the emission intensity of natural gas leakage has been highlighted in other studies as well. However, if cost penalties for emissions are left out, fossil-based pathways remain lower-cost or near cost-parity with electricity-based alternatives considered in this study.

### Assessing strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of the annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology [^1112kimA]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Greenhouse gas emissions associated with medical conferences have been associated with climate change, and the effects of climate change have been associated with an increased incidence of ophthalmic diseases. Identifying practical strategies associated with reducing these emissions may be warranted.

Objective

To assess greenhouse gas emissions associated with in-person and virtual meetings of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and to conduct mitigation analyses to suggest strategies to reduce future emissions.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Quality improvement study in which attendee and conference data were used to estimate emissions from in-person (October 12 to October 15, 2019, San Francisco, California) and virtual (November 13 to November 15, 2020) AAO annual meetings for 35 104 attendees. The data were also used to perform mitigation analyses to assess whether meeting format alterations could be used to reduce future emissions. Data were analyzed from December 21, 2021, to April 18, 2022.

Exposures

Attendance at a selected meeting. Total attendance was 23 190 participants in 2019 and 11 914 participants in 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Greenhouse gas emissions produced by the in-person meeting were estimated by calculating the equivalent metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) associated with attendee transportation, attendee accommodations, and the conference venue. Emissions produced by the virtual meeting were estimated by calculating the equivalent metric tons of CO2 associated with attendees' computer use, network data transfer, and video-conferencing server use. Mitigation analyses simulated the association of changing the meeting location and format with reductions in emissions.

Results

In this analysis, the 2019 in-person meeting produced 39 910 metric tons of CO2 (1.73 metric tons of CO2 per capita), and the 2020 virtual meeting produced 38.6 metric tons of CO2 (0.003 metric tons of CO2 per capita). Mitigation analyses showed that holding a single in-person meeting in Chicago, Illinois, rather than San Francisco, California, could be associated with transportation-related emissions reductions of 19% (emissions for the San Francisco meeting, 38 993 metric tons of CO2; for the Chicago meeting, 31 616 metric tons of CO2). Holding multiple in-person meetings in separate regions could be associated with transportation-related emissions reductions of as much as 38% (emissions for the San Francisco meeting, 38 993 metric tons of CO2; for multiple meeting scenario 2, 24 165 metric tons of CO2).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that the AAO's 2019 in-person meeting was associated with substantially higher greenhouse gas emissions compared with the 2020 virtual meeting, primarily due to transportation-related emissions. Increasing the proportion of virtual participants, holding the meeting in locations chosen to minimize transportation-related emissions, or offering multiple regional meeting locations may reduce the carbon footprint of future meetings.

### Methane emissions from US low production oil and natural gas well sites [^113UTMeK]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Furthermore, a key characteristic of measurement-based O&G site-level CH 4 emissions is the heavy-tailed distributions, where a small fraction of sites is responsible for a disproportionately large fraction of total CH 4 emissions. While the skewness in the distributions of O&G site-level CH 4 emissions and production characteristics are well known, their effect on the national distribution of aggregate CH 4 emissions among low- and high-productivity O&G production sites has received little scrutiny and is much more uncertain.

We define a well site's total O&G production in units of barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), a single metric representing the site's combined oil (barrels produced) and gas (1 boe = 6 thousand cubic feet, Mcf)production averaged over the well site's total production days in the year. We focus on the low production well site category, where each site has a combined O&G production rate averaged over the year of ≤ 15 boed. We then use available O&G production data from proprietary sourcesto assess the regional distribution, O&G production characteristics, and operator profiles for low production sites. Using these data in combination with data on low production well site CH 4 emissions previously collected from a diversity of regions across the United States, we generate a new national estimate of their total CH 4 emissions and assess the significance of these emissions relative to CH 4 emissions from all US O&G production sites. This assessment carries significant policy implications for the effective mitigation of US O&G CH 4 emissions.

### Comparison of total-breath and single-breath diffusing capacity in healthy volunteers and COPD patients [^115iaYiQ]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The measurement of single-breath diffusing capacity (Dlco(SB)) assumes that diffusing capacity per liter of alveolar volume (Dlco/VA) determined in a 750-mL gas sample represents the diffusing capacity (Dlco) of the entire lung. Fast-responding gas analyzers provide the opportunity to verify this assumption because of the possibility to measure CO and CH(4) fractions continuously throughout the entire expiration. Continuous gas sampling provides more information per measurement, but this information cannot be expressed in the traditional parameters. Our goals were to find new parameters to express the extra information of the continuous gas sampling, and to compare these new parameters with the traditional parameters.

Methods

We compared a new method to determine Dlco with the traditional method in 62 healthy volunteers and 26 COPD patients. Traditionally, Dlco(SB) is determined by multiplying Dlco/VA with alveolar volume, both calculated from gas concentrations in a 750-mL gas sample. The new method calculates total-breath Dlco (Dlco(TB)) by integration of Dlco/VA against exhaled volume.

Results

In healthy volunteers, Dlco/VA shows a slight upward slope during exhalation, while in COPD patients Dlco/VA shows a horizontal line. Total-breath total lung capacity (TLC) is larger than single-breath TLC both in healthy volunteers and in COPD patients, leading to a Dlco(TB) that is significantly larger than Dlco(SB) in both groups (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The assumption that a 750-mL gas sample represents the entire lung seems to be correct for Dlco/VA but not for the CH(4) fraction in case of ventilation inhomogeneity.

### Energy efficiency to reduce residential electricity and natural gas use under climate change [^113ti8jM]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Climate change could significantly affect consumer demand for energy in buildings, as changing temperatures may alter heating and cooling loads. Warming climates could also lead to the increased adoption and use of cooling technologies in buildings. We assess residential electricity and natural gas demand in Los Angeles, California under multiple climate change projections and investigate the potential for energy efficiency to offset increased demand. We calibrate residential energy use against metered data, accounting for differences in building materials and appliances. Under temperature increases, we find that without policy intervention, residential electricity demand could increase by as much as 41–87% between 2020 and 2060. However, aggressive policies aimed at upgrading heating/cooling systems and appliances could result in electricity use increases as low as 28%, potentially avoiding the installation of new generation capacity. We therefore recommend aggressive energy efficiency, in combination with low-carbon generation sources, to offset projected increases in residential energy demand.

### Methane emissions from US low production oil and natural gas well sites [^114XUKkc]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Eighty percent of US oil and natural gas (O&G) production sites are low production well sites, with average site-level production ≤ 15 barrels of oil equivalent per day and producing only 6% of the nation's O&G output in 2019. Here, we integrate national site-level O&G production data and previously reported site-level CH 4 measurement data (n = 240) and find that low production well sites are a disproportionately large source of US O&G well site CH 4 emissions, emitting more than 4 (95% confidence interval: 3–6) teragrams, 50% more than the total CH 4 emissions from the Permian Basin, one of the world's largest O&G producing regions. We estimate low production well sites represent roughly half (37–75%) of all O&G well site CH 4 emissions, and a production-normalized CH 4 loss rate of more than 10%-a factor of 6–12 times higher than the mean CH 4 loss rate of 1.5% for all O&G well sites in the US. Our work suggests that achieving significant reductions in O&G CH 4 emissions will require mitigation of emissions from low production well sites.

### Closing the methane gap in US oil and natural gas production emissions inventories [^116dsAh5]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Figure 4b compares the fraction of components emitting (the ratio of emitting components to all components counted), while Fig. 4c shows component counts (number of components counted per piece of equipment). These have offsetting effects, where component-level emission factors and component counts contribute to higher emissions in our study versus the GHGI, and fraction of components emitting contributing to lower emissions in our study. The resulting total emissions per well (Fig. 4d) are the product of these factors, summed across all components.

Similar results are found across all equipment categories compared to the GHGI. In general, in our dataset, component-level emission factors are higher (5× to 46× comparing our emission factors for connectors, valves, and open-ended lines across all GHGI categories, see Supplementary Fig. 22–30), the fraction of components emitting is lower (1× to 0.06×), and the number of components per piece of equipment is generally, but not always, higher (0.5x to 20x comparing our emission factors for wells, separators, and meters across all GHGI categories). Considering the decomposition presented here, along with the rest in the Supplementary Information (plus some discussion of smaller factors not described here), we can explain much of the overall underestimation of the GHGI compared to our results for the equipment leaks source category.

One source of the difference not illustrated in Fig. 4 between our study and the GHGI is related to how equipment-level emission factors in the GHGI (for NG systems) are a region-weighted combination of Western US and Eastern US factors. Component-level emission factors in the Eastern data (e.g. Supplementary Fig. 20) are significantly smaller compared to both this study and the EPA Western US data and are derived from an even smaller sample from the 1990s (~100 quantified leaks). Since these measurements were made, NG production in the Eastern US has grown from < 5% to ~28% of total US production (Supplementary Fig. 15). It is finally worth noting that quantified emissions measurements (based on bagged measurements, and not those based on correlation equations) were included in this study's dataset. Although these measurements are small fraction (~7%) of our total dataset, the contribution is higher for specific components (Supplementary Fig. 14) emphasizing the importance of future data collection.

### Alternative trastuzumab dosing schedules are associated with reductions in health care greenhouse gas emissions [^112MicyQ]. JCO Oncology Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cancer care-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions harm human health. Many cancer drugs are administered at greater-than-necessary doses, frequencies, and durations. Alternative dosing strategies may enable reductions in cancer care GHG emissions without compromising patient outcomes.

Materials and Methods

We used streamlined life-cycle analysis in a case-control simulation to estimate the relative reductions in GHG emissions that would be expected to result from using each of three alternative dosing strategies of trastuzumab (6-month adjuvant treatment duration, once every 4-week dosing, and both) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ breast cancer. Using primary data and conversion factors from the environmental science literature, we estimated per-patient relative reduction in GHG emissions and, using SEER data, health impacts (in terms of disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs] and excess mortality per kg CO 2) on bystanders for each alternative dosing strategy.

Results

Compared with the trastuzumab dosing strategy commonly used at baseline (12-month duration of adjuvant therapy and once every 3-week dosing in all settings), adoption of both 6-month adjuvant trastuzumab and once every 4-week trastuzumab dosing would reduce GHG emissions by 4.5%, 18.7%, and 14.6% in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic settings, respectively. We estimate that US-based adoption of alternative trastuzumab dosing would reduce annual DALYs and excess lives lost due to environmental impact of US-based trastuzumab therapy for HER2+ breast cancer by 1.5 and 0.9, respectively.

Conclusion

Alternative dosing strategies may materially reduce the population health impacts of cancer care by reducing environmental impact. Regulatory decision making and health technology assessments should consider a treatment's environmental and population health impacts. Clinical trials of alternative dosing strategies are justified on the basis of environmental and population health impacts.

### Provider education and vaporizer labeling lead to reduced anesthetic agent purchasing with cost savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions [^113S2kuk]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Anesthetic agents are known greenhouse gases with hundreds to thousands of times the global warming impact compared with carbon dioxide. We sought to mitigate the negative environmental and financial impacts of our practice in the perioperative setting through multidisciplinary staff engagement and provider education on flow rate reduction and volatile agent choice. These efforts led to a 64% per case reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (163 kg in Fiscal Year 2012, compared with 58 kg in Fiscal Year 2015), as well as a cost savings estimate of $25,000 per month.

Topic 4 — Next steps for household air pollution (HAP) research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), Consensus Statement 12 — "The fuel choices that result in HAP also contribute to climate change". The page explains that "Emissions from fuel extraction (especially fossil fuels and unsustainable biomass harvesting), processing (especially charcoal production), transportation, and household use all contribute to climate change", and that "The level of emissions throughout the value chain differs across fuel types (wood, charcoal, kerosene, LPG, coal)". It further states: "Modeling studies suggest that transitioning from solid fuel use to full LPG use (as a cleaner transitional fuel) may have better health and climate impacts than business as usual (natural and incomplete transitioning to LPG from biomass) (81, 82)"; and cautions that "however, there are methodological limitations to these kinds of studies, including their limited ability to fully account for the climate change effects of extraction and use that typically accompanies LPG (83)".

### Reducing the carbon footprint of academic conferences: the example of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene [^113nkuto]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

We calculated carbon emissions associated with air travel of 4,834 participants at the 2019 annual conference of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH). Together, participants traveled a total of 27.7 million miles or 44.6 million kilometers. This equates to 58 return trips to the moon. Estimated carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions were 8,646 metric tons or the total weekly carbon footprint of approximately 9,366 average American households. These emissions contribute to climate change and thus may exacerbate many of the global diseases that conference attendees seek to combat. Options to reduce conference travel-associated emissions include 1) alternating in-person and online conferences, 2) offering a hybrid in-person/online conference, and 3) decentralizing the conference with multiple conference venues. Decentralized ASTMH conferences may allow for up to 64% reduction in travel distance and 58% reduction in CO 2 e emissions. Given the urgency of the climate crisis and the clear association between global warming and global health, ways to reduce carbon emissions should be considered.

### Energy use and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of drones for commercial package delivery [^1153NKDa]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

There are a variety of methods to allocate GHG and air pollutant emissions to local electricity use, and each has benefits and drawbacks. The regional yet interconnected architecture of the electricity system, coupled with hourly, seasonal, inter-annual variation, and long-term change in fuel use and asset composition introduces temporal and spatial uncertainty. New demand from drones would be charged by electricity generating units at the margin, rather than baseload electricity generating units. Because the GHG emissions intensity of electricity varies regionally, and for the desire to have open and replicable data inputs, we use EPA's e-GRID annual direct non-baseload GHG emissionsto present the range of emissions in each North American Reliability Corporation (NERC) region (shown in Supplementary Table 6), in each e-GRID subregion (shown in Supplementary Table 7), and for the United States average. When comparing the results, e-GRID subregions have the advantage of smaller geographic boundaries, whereas NERC regions reduce some of the uncertainty from electricity trading across a larger area. To represent the range, we estimate the emissions using both NERC regions and e-GRID subregions. For the main figures, we report the range from California (e-GRID subregion WECC California (CAMX) to the highest value in Missouri (e-GRID subregion SERC Midwest (SRMW). We note that e-GRID subregion WECC Northwest (NWPP) has about 3% less GHGs than California (resulting in similar outcomes). For completeness, we report drone GHG results for each NERC region and e-GRID subregion in Supplementary Figs. 10–13. The values are consistent with the endpoints selected for presentation in Fig. 5. As done with other emissions above, methane and nitrous oxide emissions are converted to CO 2 -equivalent with a 100-year global warming potentials (GWP) from IPCC AR5. A map of the NERC regions is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5 and a map of EPA e-GRID subregions is shown in Supplementary Fig 6. Because the fuel mix and emissions of the electricity grid is likely to evolve toward lower emissions over time, and because reduced relative natural gas prices can result in reduced electricity emissions as gas substitutes for coal in the near-term, we include a low-carbon case using 200 g/kWh. We also present the spectrum of results as GHG intensity of electricity varies from 100 to 1000 g/kWh in the sensitivity analysis. In Supplementary Fig. 9, we show average emissions factors for electricity from several selected continents and countries.

### A cost comparison of various hourly-reliable and net-zero hydrogen production pathways in the United States [^113Ah9Gh]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Hydrogen (H 2) as an energy carrier may play a role in various hard-to-abate subsectors, but to maximize emission reductions, supplied hydrogen must be reliable, low-emission, and low-cost. Here, we build a model that enables direct comparison of the cost of producing net-zero, hourly-reliable hydrogen from various pathways. To reach net-zero targets, we assume upstream and residual facility emissions are mitigated using negative emission technologies. For the United States (California, Texas, and New York), model results indicate next-decade hybrid electricity-based solutions are lower cost ($2.02-$2.88/kg) than fossil-based pathways with natural gas leakage greater than 4% ($2.73-$5.94/kg). These results also apply to regions outside of the U.S. with a similar climate and electric grid. However, when omitting the net-zero emission constraint and considering the U.S. regulatory environment, electricity-based production only achieves cost-competitiveness with fossil-based pathways if embodied emissions of electricity inputs are not counted under U.S. Tax Code Section 45V guidance.

### Methane emissions from US low production oil and natural gas well sites [^112RckgH]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We classify national low production sites into four cohorts of site-level production rates: (i) > 0–2, (ii) 2–5.4, (iii) 5.4–9.7, and (iv) 9.7–15 boed (see Methods, Supplementary Note 6 for further discussion). A majority of low production well sites (57%), 46% of active onshore US O&G well sites, produce very little O&G, ≤ 2 boed/site, with cumulative production of just 0.7% of total US O&G production, representing 12% of total O&G production from all low production sites. We refer to this subset of low production sites as ultralow production sites and discuss their significance in the following sections.

There is regional diversity in the production characteristics of low production well sites (Fig. 1), with the predominantly gas-producing Appalachian region (Region 1 in Fig. 1) being notable for its large abundance (i.e. 90%, n = 160,000) of ultralow production well sites (Fig. 1d). Among all low production well sites, these Appalachian ultralow production sites represent 29% of US low production well sites and 5.4% of total O&G production from low production sites (Fig. 1c).

The distribution for site age, defined as the mean number of years in production as of December 2019, shows little variability across regions (Fig. 1e). The mean age for the ultralow production sites is 25 years, only slightly higher than that for sites producing > 2 boed/site at 21 years. In general, about 10% of all low production well sites (n = 73,000) are ≤ 10 years old (Fig. 1e) with combined O&G production representing 20% of total production from low production well sites, indicative of average declining production with age.

### Methane emissions from US low production oil and natural gas well sites [^116nuZbz]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Mitigation of methane (CH 4) emissions, a powerful greenhouse gas with > 80× the 20-year warming potential of carbon dioxide, is widely recognized as strategically integral to the attainment of the climate-neutrality goals of Paris Agreement. In the United States, official estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicate nearly one-third (30%) of anthropogenic CH 4 emissions arise from oil and natural gas (O&G) operations. However, a large body of measurement-based studies – have consistently found higher O&G CH 4 emissions than is estimated in EPA inventories. Alvarez et al.synthesized research on US O&G CH 4 emissions in 2015 and found 13 teragrams (1 Tg = 1 million metric tons), 60% higher than the Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GHGI) estimates for 2015 as estimated in 2017; in Reporting Year 2021, EPA lowered estimated 2015 emissions making the difference 70%. Much of this discrepancy has been attributed to the O&G production sector, where measurement-based estimates are ~2× higher than the GHGI –, with recent research suggesting substantial underestimation in the GHGI attributed to fugitive emissions from well site equipment and unintentional emissions from liquids storage tanks.

The US O&G production sector is diverse and complex, with over 800,000 active onshore O&G production wells in 2019. Methane emissions at O&G production well sites — which may have one or multiple wellheads — arise from sources that are common throughout O&G operations (e.g. fugitive emissions from leaking valves and connections and vented emissions from storage tanks and pneumatic devices), in addition to nonroutine sources characterized by excessive, unintentional emissions. Measurement-based studies have generally found weak correlations of CH 4 emissions with site-specific parameters, including O&G production rates, water production, or site age. However, O&G production declines substantially over the first few years in the life of the well, such that the number of new, high-productivity wells represents a small percentage of the total number of operating wells, where older, low-productivity wells dominate. As a result, production characteristics of US O&G wells are highly skewed: > 90% of the nation's O&G production comes from ~20% of wells.

### Household air pollution interventions to improve health in low-and middle-income countries: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^116T3v3Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Household energy scale-up and practitioner engagement in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) highlight that "Consensus Statement 7: Currently, for most practitioners (governments, NGOs, international organizations), health is not the primary driver for scale-up decisions". Although evidence can open discussions, "health alone is rarely enough to motivate action related to clean household energy", partly because programs are implemented outside health ministries and "Cross-ministry interaction and programmatic decision making are often not possible, and most ministries of health in LMICs lack the resources to address household energy at scale". For investors, "the alleviation of health burden from household energy practices can help meet organizational requirements", yet "sustained support from private investors will require viable business models". The section adds "Consensus Statement 8: The largest barriers to scaling up household energy programs are affordability and availability", while noting that "No single factor determines the success of household energy programs (65), but several high-priority factors were identified".

### A cost comparison of various hourly-reliable and net-zero hydrogen production pathways in the United States [^113c724D]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Figure 5b displays a tornado diagram for input parameters from the ATR-CCS hydrogen production scenario, assuming a baseline case of 1.5% natural gas leakage under a 20-year global warming potential (GWP) estimate (85 kg CO 2 e per kg CH 4). We choose the 20-year GWP timeframe as the baseline, as opposed to the 100-year GWP timeframe (30 kg CO 2 e per kg CH 4), because of the urgency to decarbonize in the next few decades and the short-lived nature of natural gas in the atmosphere. The impact of using a 100-year GWP timeframe is still shown in Fig. 5b and is one of the more sensitive inputs. Uncertainty in the CO 2 removal cost causes the most prominent fluctuation in the LCOH for ATR-CCS production, with a variability of $3.10–$3.18/kg depending on the state. This again exemplifies the need for continued research and development into negative emissions technologies if low-cost, net-zero, and fossil-based hydrogen production is to be cost-effective. We also find that natural gas leakage rate plays a large role in the LCOH, especially over the 20-year GWP timeframe ($2.39/kg variability). This should motivate industry to prioritize best practices when handling natural gas and motivate researchers and companies to continue developing technology to rapidly detect, mitigate, and prevent methane emissions, yielding benefits for the environment, human health, and, in some cases, industrial profitability. Notably, we find that uncertainty in project life does not have a large impact on fossil-based hydrogen production cost ($0.13/kg variability). This means that if fossil-based hydrogen producers wish to build new SMR-CCS or ATR-CCS facilities to act as a bridge before electricity-based hydrogen production technologies mature, they can be confident that the project will be cost-effective even if the project lifetime is cut to 20 years.

Figure 5 only shows seven notable input parameter sensitivity results for PV/Storage/Grid* and ATR-CCS production pathways. Sensitivity results for other input parameters can be found in Sections 5 and 6 of the SI.

### Preschool multiple-breath washout testing. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^116J7UeS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Effect of inert gas diffusion across the alveolar–capillary membrane in preschool MBW — There are no data currently available to quantify the impact of inert gas diffusing across the alveolar–capillary membrane on measured MBW outcomes in preschool subjects. Although N2 is inert, in the sense that the human body does not metabolize it, it is a soluble gas, and because of the high partial pressure of the atmosphere, a large amount of N2 is stored within the body. As a result, N2 will diffuse into the alveoli when the partial pressure of N2 is lowered, as occurs during N2-based MBW using 100% O2, and this process applies to all gases to differing degrees and occurs to lesser degrees, in the opposite direction, with both SF6 and helium. The magnitude of diffusion and its effect on subsequent MBW outcomes has not been adequately described to date, beyond initial modeling efforts for N2 MBW.

### Physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and estimated insulin sensitivity and secretion in pregnant and non-pregnant women [^111rKJXq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Overweight and obesity during pregnancy raise the risk of gestational diabetes and birth complications. Lifestyle factors like physical activity may decrease these risks through beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis. Here we examined physical activity patterns and their relationships with measures of glucose homeostasis in late pregnancy compared to non-pregnant women.

Methods

Normal weight and overweight women without diabetes (N = 108; aged 25–35 years) were studied; 35 were pregnant (in gestational weeks 28–32) and 73 were non-pregnant.

Insulin sensitivity and β-cell response were estimated from an oral glucose tolerance test. Physical activity was measured during 10-days of free-living using a combined heart rate sensor and accelerometer. Total (TEE), resting (REE), and physical activity (PAEE) energy expenditure were measured using doubly-labeled water and expired gas indirect calorimetry.

Results

Total activity was associated with reduced first-phase insulin response in both pregnant (Regression r 2 = 0.11; Spearman r = -0.47; p = 0.007) and non-pregnant women (Regression r 2 = 0.11 Spearman; r = -0.36; p = 0.002). Relative to non-pregnant women, pregnant women were estimated to have secreted 67% more insulin and had 10% lower fasting glucose than non-pregnant women. Pregnant women spent 13% more time sedentary, 71% less time in moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity, had 44% lower objectively measured total activity, and 12% lower PAEE than non-pregnant women. Correlations did not differ significantly for any comparison between physical activity subcomponents and measures of insulin sensitivity or secretion.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that physical activity conveys similar benefits on glucose homeostasis in pregnant and non-pregnant women, despite differences in subcomponents of physical activity.

### Catalytic production of low-carbon footprint sustainable natural gas [^115if7b1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Natural gas is one of the foremost basic energy sources on earth. Although biological process appears as promising valorization routes to transfer biomass to sustainable methane, the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass is the major limitation for the production of mixing gas to meet the natural gas composition of pipeline transportation. Here we develop a catalytic-drive approach to directly transfer solid biomass to bio-natural gas which can be suitable for the current infrastructure. A catalyst with Ni 2 Al 3 alloy phase enables nearly complete conversion of various agricultural and forestry residues, the total carbon yield of gas products reaches up to 93% after several hours at relative low-temperature (300 degrees Celsius). And the catalyst shows powerful processing capability for the production of natural gas during thirty cycles. A low-carbon footprint is estimated by a preliminary life cycle assessment, especially for the low hydrogen pressure and non-fossil hydrogen, and technical economic analysis predicts that this process is an economically competitive production process.
