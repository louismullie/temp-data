## Question

What is low-dose naltrexone (4.5 mg) used for?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what low-dose naltrexone (LDN, 4.5 mg) is used for. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing LDN from standard-dose, FDA-labeled naltrexone. Then, I should review the off-label indications and grade the evidence by condition. Next, I will examine mechanisms of action that plausibly link dose to effect. After that, I need to assess safety, contraindications, and opioid-related risks. Finally, I should discuss dosing pragmatics, monitoring, and where the evidence is clearly negative or insufficient, before summarizing a cautious, clinically grounded take-home message [^115ahuC3] [^116Tkmub] [^116iiG7k].

> Let me first confirm the dose-context distinction so I don't conflate regulatory labeling with off-label practice; the FDA-labeled, standard oral naltrexone dose is 50 mg/day for alcohol use disorder and for relapse prevention after opioid detoxification, whereas "low-dose naltrexone" refers to approximately 1–5 mg/day (commonly 4.5 mg) used off-label and not covered by FDA approvals in the supplied documents, so I must be careful not to imply regulatory endorsement of 4.5 mg dosing for these off-label conditions [^115ahuC3] [^116Tkmub] [^116iiG7k].

> Hold on, let me verify the pharmacology being invoked for LDN because its rationale hinges on a transient receptor blockade; LDN at 4.5 mg is thought to produce brief opioid receptor antagonism that may upregulate endogenous opioid tone while also antagonizing Toll-like receptor 4 on microglia to attenuate neuroinflammation and itch, which is a different clinical proposition than the sustained receptor blockade seen with 50 mg dosing, and this mechanistic framing is recurrent across dermatologic and pain-focused reviews [^111Mgspr] [^114Diy46] [^1113Poqx].

> Next, I should review the gastrointestinal autoimmune signal, and Crohn's disease consistently appears as the most frequently cited area; an open-label pilot in active Crohn's disease using 4.5 mg nightly for 12 weeks reported high response and remission rates with improved quality of life and tolerability, but I need to stress the low-quality, uncontrolled design, and the Cochrane review subsequently concluded that evidence remains limited and calls for higher-quality randomized trials, so I shouldn't overstate efficacy here [^114NMh6k] [^1178QnkC].

> I will now examine fibromyalgia because that's where randomized evidence exists; a double-blind crossover trial reported a modest but statistically significant reduction in symptom severity with 4.5 mg daily versus placebo and improved mood, supported by earlier pilot work, and a dose-finding study suggested an ED50 around 3.9 mg and ED95 around 5.4 mg, which makes 4.5 mg a pharmacologically plausible test dose, though I should confirm that heterogeneity of response and small samples temper certainty [^114Diy46] [^116csf6N] [^1141FGv2].

> Let me consider multiple sclerosis carefully before jumping to conclusions; an 8-week, double-masked crossover study found improvements in mental health quality-of-life indices with 4.5 mg nightly, but the high dropout and data issues reduce confidence, and there was no claim of reduced relapse activity or disability change, so the signal is limited to patient-reported outcomes and needs replication [^115oxzwH].

> Next, I should review dermatology where LDN appears to have pragmatic traction; small case series and reports suggest clinical benefits in Hailey-Hailey disease with doses around 3–4.5 mg, often with rapid improvement and recurrence off drug, and broader dermatology reviews describe potential utility across pruritic and inflammatory dermatoses including lichen planus variants and hidradenitis, though the evidence base is largely uncontrolled and access often requires compounding [^111d6my5] [^116KrhCt] [^1132Q7EV] [^111Mgspr].

> Wait, I should not conflate all skin conditions; for psoriasis specifically, published evidence is limited to case reports showing reduced body surface area on 4.5 mg daily, and while mechanistic hypotheses include TLR-4 antagonism and TNF modulation, this remains hypothesis-generating rather than definitive, so I need to frame this as low-certainty signal rather than established therapy [^113qejoc] [^116AVEKw] [^114iPkDx].

> I need to check the chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis space because clinicians often ask; the corpus here consists of case reports and series suggesting improvements in fatigue, pain, or sleep at doses titrated up to 4.5 mg and sometimes higher, but with no randomized trials, so any clinical use should be explicitly off-label, individualized, and evidence-informed with careful outcome tracking and shared decision-making [^1164y8vZ] [^117Ju8bq] [^113V1HX7] [^115Zo8zj] [^111YDpkj] [^1161Z6Ku] [^116RsaQ1] [^114eeUuq].

> But wait, what if the evidence is simply negative in some neurologic settings; in high-grade glioma, a placebo-controlled RCT of 4.5 mg during chemoradiation found no benefit for quality of life or fatigue, which is an important counterexample underscoring that LDN is not broadly effective across all neuro-oncologic or fatigue syndromes [^112CQtgD].

> Next, I should review safety, and I must be careful not to overgeneralize from standard-dose data; across LDN trials and series, adverse effects are typically mild and transient, such as vivid dreams, insomnia, or headaches, while large meta-analytic safety data for oral naltrexone overall show no increase in serious adverse events versus placebo, though those analyses span a wide dose range and indications and cannot be directly equated to LDN without caution, so I should underscore both the reassuring safety signal and the dose-context caveat [^114Diy46] [^113V1HX7] [^113f7B5E] [^112Ww5B4].

> Critical Contraindications: 1. Current Opioid — hold on, I started listing without completing the context; I should double-check the label and guideline cautions to finish this correctly, because initiating any naltrexone product in someone with ongoing opioid exposure risks precipitated withdrawal and can set up later overdose vulnerability when the antagonist effect wanes, so patients must be opioid-free for an adequate interval and counseled carefully about heightened sensitivity after discontinuation, with naloxone challenge considered if dependence is uncertain [^115ahuC3] [^116Tkmub] [^111h9ukH] [^116iiG7k].

> I will now examine opioid-related interactions more closely because this is where practical harm can occur; although some preclinical and human studies of ultra-low-dose naloxone coadministered with opioids suggest analgesic potentiation or less nausea, a randomized trauma study found no meaningful reduction in opioid requirements, and in contrast a case report describes profound opioid sensitivity in a patient on LDN after a small oxycodone dose, so I need to emphasize avoiding concurrent opioid agonists with LDN in routine practice for pain conditions and to plan ahead for acute pain management contingencies [^116Wc8sm] [^113UEicx] [^112J9S5W] [^1113Poqx].

> Let me think about dosing and logistics so this is actionable; the literature commonly uses 4.5 mg nightly, with dose-finding work suggesting a response range between roughly 3–6 mg, variable interindividual benefit, and occasional sleep-related adverse effects that can be mitigated by morning dosing or slower titration, and because LDN is almost always compounded, access, cost, and quality control should be addressed up front, with added caution in severe renal impairment per product information even though LDN-specific renal data are sparse [^1141FGv2] [^111Mgspr] [^114Diy46] [^112NAvis] [^1141ynxt].

> Hold on, I should verify the net evidentiary balance by condition before summarizing; for Crohn's disease the signal is promising but low quality with formal reviews urging better RCTs, for fibromyalgia there is modest randomized evidence supporting symptom reduction at 4.5 mg, for MS the quality-of-life signal is small and methodologically limited, for dermatologic entities like Hailey-Hailey and nail lichen planus case-level data and specialty reviews support cautious trials, for psoriasis the data are anecdotal, for ME/CFS evidence is limited to case reports, and for high-grade glioma the best data are negative, so any clinical use should be framed as off-label with explicit uncertainty and outcome monitoring [^1178QnkC] [^114Diy46] [^115oxzwH] [^111Mgspr] [^113qejoc] [^1164y8vZ] [^112CQtgD].

> Finally, I need to ensure the broader addiction-treatment context is not confused with LDN; standard-dose oral or extended-release naltrexone is guideline-supported for alcohol use disorder and is an option after opioid detoxification for OUD, but these data do not apply to 4.5 mg dosing, so I should clearly separate the approved addiction indications from LDN's off-label anti-inflammatory and analgesic applications to avoid misinterpretation in shared decision-making [^116vLf6i] [^116t6QHX] [^117LwsHF] [^112H9JZw].

Low-dose naltrexone (4.5 mg) is **used off-label** for chronic pain (fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome) [^114Diy46], autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis) [^114NMh6k] [^115oxzwH], and dermatologic diseases (Hailey-Hailey, lichen planus, psoriasis) [^111d6my5] [^114cnkvk] [^114iPkDx] [^111Mgspr]. Evidence is **limited** [^112d2eGi], comprising small RCTs, case series, and reviews that report improvements in pain, fatigue, mood, and pruritus [^116csf6N] [^111Mgspr]. LDN is **generally well tolerated**, with mild, transient side effects (insomnia, vivid dreams, headaches, GI upset) and no significant liver toxicity at low doses [^114NMh6k] [^113f7B5E]. It is not FDA-approved for these uses, and concurrent opioids should be avoided due to potential withdrawal or reduced analgesia [^115ahuC3] [^116Tkmub].

## Clinical conditions treated with low-dose naltrexone (4.5 mg)

### Chronic pain conditions

- **Fibromyalgia**: Small RCTs and pilot studies [^114Diy46] show reduced pain, fatigue, and improved mood/quality of life with 4.5 mg nightly [^116csf6N].

- **Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)**: Case reports/series suggest reduced pain and improved function [^1114AH9y] [^115D8d6a].

- **Chronic low back pain**: Case reports indicate benefit [^112Y1oMP], likely via central sensitization and microglial modulation [^114Diy46].

---

### Autoimmune and inflammatory conditions

- **Crohn's disease**: Small trials and reviews report clinical response/remission [^114NMh6k] and improved quality of life [^1178QnkC].

- **Multiple sclerosis (MS)**: Pilot studies [^115oxzwH] suggest improved mental health quality of life and reduced fatigue.

- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Retrospective data suggest reduced use of other medications and improved symptoms [^114Diy46] [^112d2eGi].

---

### Dermatologic conditions

- **Hailey-Hailey disease**: Case series show significant lesion healing and symptom improvement [^111d6my5] [^116KrhCt].

- **Lichen planus**: Case series report reduced inflammation and symptom relief [^114cnkvk].

- **Psoriasis**: Case reports describe reduced lesion severity and pruritus [^114iPkDx] [^113qejoc].

---

### Other conditions

Case reports suggest **reduced fatigue** and improved function in chronic fatigue syndrome [^114eeUuq] [^1164w2xv]. A small proof-of-concept trial suggests potential benefit as **augmentation in major depressive disorder** [^112MP3rS].

---

## Mechanisms of action

Low-dose naltrexone is thought to act through **opioid receptor modulation**, with transient blockade increasing endogenous opioids such as β-endorphin, which may improve mood and analgesia [^111Mgspr]. It may also inhibit microglia via **TLR4 antagonism** [^114Diy46], reducing neuroinflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokines relevant to centralized pain and autoimmune disease [^117T55zg]. Additionally, it may produce **immune modulation**, with reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), supporting its use in inflammatory and autoimmune conditions [^114Mok4x].

## Safety and tolerability

LDN is **generally well tolerated**, with mild, transient side effects such as insomnia, vivid dreams, headaches, and gastrointestinal upset [^113f7B5E] [^116csf6N] [^111d6my5]. Studies at low doses report no significant liver toxicity or serious adverse events [^114NMh6k] [^113f7B5E]. Concurrent opioid use should be avoided due to the risk of precipitated withdrawal or reduced analgesia.

---

## Regulatory status

LDN is **not FDA-approved** for these indications; its use is off-label and guided by limited evidence and clinical judgment [^111Mgspr].

---

Low-dose naltrexone (4.5 mg) is **used off-label** for chronic pain, autoimmune and inflammatory, and dermatologic conditions, supported by limited evidence from small trials and case series [^1147b9eR]. It is **generally well tolerated**, but concurrent opioid use should be avoided [^115ahuC3].

## References

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^115ahuC3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids, or an exacerbation of a preexisting subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting naltrexone hydrochloride treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids.

- **Switching from buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naloxone, or methadone**: There are no systematically collected data that specifically address the switch from buprenorphine or methadone to naltrexone hydrochloride. However, a review of postmarketing case reports has indicated that some patients may experience severe manifestations of precipitated withdrawal when being switched from opioid agonist therapy to opioid antagonist therapy. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as 2 weeks. Healthcare providers should be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications.

- **Treatment of alcoholism**: A dose of 50 mg once daily is recommended for most patients. The placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride as an adjunctive treatment of alcoholism used a dose regimen of 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks. Other dose regimens or durations of therapy were not evaluated in these trials.

### Treatment of Hailey-Hailey disease with low-dose naltrexone [^111d6my5]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Hailey-Hailey disease is a severe genetic blistering disease of intertriginous skin locations that can lead to poor quality of life and increased morbidities. Multiple therapies are available with inconsistent outcomes and potentially severe adverse effects.

- **Objective**: To determine whether low-dose naltrexone is an effective treatment for Hailey-Hailey disease.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This study was a case series performed at a dermatology outpatient clinic involving 3 patients with severe Hailey-Hailey disease recalcitrant to at least 4 therapies.

- **Interventions**: Low-dose naltrexone, 3 mg nightly, titrated to 4.5 mg nightly in 2 patients.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Reduction in the size of lesions as well as subjective improvement of symptoms.

- **Results**: All 3 patients noted significant healing of erosions and plaques starting from the peripheral aspect within 1 to 2 weeks of treatment, and clinical resolution of lesions within 2 months. Discontinuation of low-dose naltrexone resulted in flaring of symptoms, which cleared within 2 to 3 days on rechallenge with low-dose naltrexone.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: We present herein 3 cases of patients with severe Hailey-Hailey disease treated with low-dose naltrexone who achieved clinical resolution of symptoms. The success of these cases suggests low-dose naltrexone as a novel therapy for Hailey-Hailey disease. The possible mechanism may involve low-dose naltrexone influencing opioid or toll-like receptor signaling to improve calcium mobilization and improve keratinocyte differentiation and wound healing.

### Low-dose naltrexone therapy improves active Crohn's disease [^114NMh6k]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous opioids and opioid antagonists have been shown to play a role in the healing and repair of tissues. In an open-labeled pilot prospective trial, the safety and efficacy of low-dose naltrexone (LDN), an opioid antagonist, were tested in patients with active Crohn's disease.

- **Methods**: Eligible subjects with histologically and endoscopically confirmed active Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) score of 220–450 were enrolled in a study using 4.5 mg naltrexone/day. Infliximab was not allowed for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to study initiation. Other therapy for Crohn's disease that was at a stable dose for 4 weeks prior to enrollment was continued at the same doses. Patients completed the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) and the short-form (SF-36) quality of life surveys, and CDAI scores were assessed pretreatment, every 4 weeks on therapy, and 4 weeks after completion of the study drug. The drug was administered by mouth each evening for a 12-week period.

- **Results**: Seventeen patients with a mean CDAI score of 356 ± 27 were enrolled. CDAI scores decreased significantly (P = 0.01) with LDN, and remained lower than baseline 4 weeks after completing therapy. Eighty-nine percent of patients exhibited a response to therapy and 67% achieved remission (P < 0.001). Improvement was recorded in both quality of life surveys with LDN compared with baseline. No laboratory abnormalities were noted. The most common side effect was sleep disturbances, occurring in seven patients.

- **Conclusions**: LDN therapy appears effective and safe in subjects with active Crohn's disease.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: a scoping review [^114Diy46]. Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Subsequently, Younger completed a larger follow-up trial, a double-blind crossover RCT, in which 31 women with FM were evaluated. This trial consisted of a 4-week placebo period and a 12-week LDN (4.5 mg daily) period with a crossover after each treatment arm. In agreement with the pilot study, 12 weeks of LDN reduced symptoms compared with placebo (28.8% vs. 18%, P = .016), and the LDN group saw a statistically significant improvement in mood (P = .039) compared with placebo. Successful response to treatment was defined as a significant reduction in self-reported pain severity and fatigue (defined as a reduction of > 30% for each category). This was reported in 32% of the LDN treatment arm vs. 11% of the placebo group (P = .05). In this study, the side effects of LDN included more frequent headaches and vivid dreams compared with placebo (P < .05).

Taking this further, in a single-blind crossover study in 8 women with FM, Parkitny et al. reported that FM was associated with increased release of various interleukins, proinflammatory cytokines, and growth factors. Participants were to have their blood drawn twice weekly to evaluate circulating cytokine levels. In addition, daily pain and general symptom severity scores (0–100) were captured. After 10 weeks of 4.5 mg LDN daily, there was a 15% reduction in FM-related pain severity and an 18% reduction in other symptoms, which corresponded to decreased circulating levels of cytokines known to promote allodynia and hyperalgesia.

Separately, Jackson et al. reported on a prospective cohort study involving 21 patients with FM. After 7 weeks of treatment…

### Low-dose naltrexone use in biopsy-proven lichen planus of the nails [^114cnkvk]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Nail lichen planus has the potential to cause permanent destruction of the nail unit and remains challenging to treat. Studies suggest that low-dose naltrexone is a safe and potentially effective treatment for other dermatologic conditions, including lichen planopilaris.

- **Objective**: To assess the effectiveness of low-dose naltrexone in treating nail lichen planus.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This case series evaluates 7 adult patients with biopsy-proven nail lichen planus who were treated with low-dose naltrexone (3 mg per day) at the University of Miami dermatologic clinics from November 2022 to December 2023. The data were analyzed in March 2024. Patients were treated for at least 2 months and had in-person follow-up evaluation while receiving treatment.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main outcome was posttreatment clinical nail lichen planus severity index, which was scored as clear, mild, moderate, or severe. Patients were evaluated for oral and cutaneous disease during the course of treatment. Tolerance and adverse events were noted.

- **Results**: A total of 7 patients (mean [range] age, 60 [38–77] years; 3 female individuals) were included. All but 1 patient had been previously treated and did not respond to at least 1 prior treatment (median [range], 2.5 [0–4.0] treatments). Treatment duration ranged from 2 to 11 months. Clinical response was observed in 4 of 7 patients, with an overall 35% reduction in nail lichen planus severity index. Two patients with severe disease achieved a reduction to mild severity. None of the patients had to discontinue the treatment.

### Enhanced buprenorphine analgesia with the addition of ultra-low-dose naloxone in healthy subjects [^116Wc8sm]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Animal studies have demonstrated that co-administration of an ultra-low-dose opioid antagonist with an opioid agonist may result in enhanced analgesia. Investigation of this effect in humans has been limited and produced inconsistent findings, with previous reports suggesting that dose ratio may be critical to analgesic potentiation. The aim of the investigation was to determine whether buprenorphine analgesia could be enhanced with the addition of ultra-low-dose naloxone among healthy volunteers, using a range of dose ratios. Tolerance to cold pressor pain was significantly greater with the combination of buprenorphine and naloxone compared to buprenorphine alone, and this effect was dose ratio dependent. Importantly, this enhanced analgesia occurred without an increase in adverse effects; indeed, at some ratios, respiratory depression was attenuated. These findings demonstrate that the addition of ultra-low-dose naloxone can enhance the analgesic effect of buprenorphine in humans without an increase in side effects.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: a scoping review [^1113Poqx]. Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Multiple reviews have been published that allude to the direct benefits of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) on chronic pain, quality of life, sleep, and anxiety. However, several secondary effects of LDN are less studied but mentioned in the literature. One of the important synergies associated with LDN is its potential to improve a patient's response to opioid medications. Preclinical mouse studies have reported increased antinociceptive potency of morphine in mice that received LDN compared to controls.

In contrast, there was no significant difference in trauma patients who received both morphine and LDN, as shown in the study by Farahmand et al. Although this is interesting, it is often reported that patients for whom LDN is being considered should not be taking opioid agonists. In general, opioids are not recommended for treating chronic pain, especially fibromyalgia (FM) and other centralized pain syndromes, due to the prevalence of and concern about opioid-induced hyperalgesia. More controlled studies are required to support or refute these synergistic effects. However, if these secondary attributes are found reputable, they could potentially improve utility, acceptance, and funding. Given the positive and encouraging findings from the body of literature presented in this review, along with the ongoing off-label use of LDN, further high-quality studies would be beneficial to improve recognition, standardization, and expanded usage.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^1164y8vZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis are chronic multisystem disorders characterized by profound fatigue and post-exertional malaise, with multiple other symptoms varying among individuals. These symptoms include widespread pain, immune dysfunction, and autonomic and neurocognitive symptoms. The annual incidence is around 15–26 per 100,000 persons, with a prevalence between 0.2% and 0.4%, depending on the exact definition used and the country of study. The level of disability is greater than for most other chronic illnesses, and full recovery is rare. Much is unknown about the illness, and even the names ascribed to it are controversial.

There is a systematic lack of funding for research and specialist services for people with these conditions. Despite specialists, particularly in the United States, using a range of drugs in treatment, very few of these have been subjected to clinical trials. The outcomes of the few trials that have been conducted have often been inconclusive. Reasons for failure to reach conclusions include difficulties in clinical trial design, such as short trial durations and small sample sizes, a lack of a single best clinical case definition, and the absence of a straightforward diagnostic marker. Additionally, there are difficulties in measuring outcomes, such as the inability to measure fatigue objectively. Many of these issues are associated with poor funding opportunities.

Naltrexone is a safe synthetic anti-opioid with widespread action at opioid and non-opioid receptors. It is currently licensed for the treatment of alcoholism and opioid addiction at 50 mg. At lower doses, 3–4.5 mg, it appears to work as an immu

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116Tkmub]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings**:

	- **Vulnerability to opioid overdose**:
		After opioid detoxification, patients are likely to have reduced tolerance to opioids. As the blockade of exogenous opioids provided by naltrexone hydrochloride wanes and eventually dissipates completely, patients who have been treated with naltrexone hydrochloride may respond to lower doses of opioids than previously used, similar to shortly after completing detoxification. This could result in potentially life-threatening opioid intoxication, such as respiratory compromise, arrest, or circulatory collapse, if the patient uses previously tolerated doses of opioids. Cases of opioid overdose with fatal outcomes have been reported in patients after discontinuing treatment.

		Patients should be alerted that they may be more sensitive to opioids, even at lower doses, after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to them of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose. (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients).

	- **Overcoming the opioid blockade**:
		There is also the possibility that a patient treated with naltrexone hydrochloride could overcome the opioid blockade effect of the drug. Although naltrexone hydrochloride is a potent antagonist, the blockade produced by it is surmountable. The plasma concentration of exogenous opioids attained immediately following their acute administration may be sufficient to overcome the competitive receptor blockade. This poses a potential risk to individuals who attempt to test the blockade.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: a scoping review [^111HuhSF]. Pain Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Variables were tabulated, including study design, number of human subjects, follow-up duration, clinical outcomes, and adverse effects. For systematic and narrative review articles, information was assessed as previously described. Relevant additional data were summarized and reported. If no new information was provided, the studies were noted in the counts only. The Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) criteria were used as a guide for this review to improve standardization.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^117LwsHF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend planning and monitoring the transition from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine. Recognize that transitioning from an antagonist (naltrexone) to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complicated than transitioning from a full or partial agonist to an antagonist. This is because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment, and thus, no possibility of precipitated withdrawal.

Start methadone or buprenorphine with initial low doses, as patients being transitioned from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have a physical dependence on opioids. Do not make the transition until a significant amount of naltrexone is no longer in the patient's system, which is about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: a scoping review [^112Y1oMP]. Pain Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Low back pain

We found one systematic review analysis, two narrative reviews, and one case report discussing low-dose naltrexone (LDN) and lower back pain. The pathophysiology behind how LDN could be a therapeutic option for chronic low back pain is likely related to its effect on central sensitization and neural glial modulation, as central sensitization has been identified as highly relevant in patients with chronic low back pain.

Ghai et al. described a case report involving a 35-year-old male with nonspecific axial low back pain that had been present for more than two years. His average pain severity Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score was 10 out of 10, and his Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (MODQ) score was 70%. After multiple conservative strategies, including medications and interventional pain injections, had failed, the patient was started on 2 mg of LDN, uptitrated to 4 mg daily. At two weeks after LDN initiation, his pain severity was reduced by 30% to 40%. At four weeks, his pain severity VAS score decreased to 3.5, and his MODQ score reduced to 35.5%. In addition, after LDN treatment, he was able to resume a part-time job. LDN was discontinued after six weeks of treatment. At six months' follow-up, he reported minimal pain and was working full-time. No adverse events were reported.

### Pilot trial of low-dose naltrexone and quality of life in multiple sclerosis [^115oxzwH]. Annals of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 4.5 mg nightly naltrexone on the quality of life of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

This single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluated the efficacy of 8 weeks of treatment with 4.5 mg nightly naltrexone (low-dose naltrexone, LDN) on the self-reported quality of life of MS patients. Eighty subjects with clinically definite MS were enrolled, and 60 subjects completed the trial. Ten withdrew before completing the first trial period: 8 for personal reasons, 1 for a non-MS-related adverse event, and 1 for perceived benefit. Database management errors occurred in 4 other subjects, and quality of life surveys were incomplete in 6 subjects for unknown reasons. The high rate of subject dropout and data management errors substantially reduced the trial's statistical power.

LDN was well tolerated, and serious adverse events did not occur. LDN was associated with significant improvement on the following mental health quality of life measures: a 3.3-point improvement on the Mental Component Summary score of the Short Form-36 General Health Survey (p = 0.04), a 6-point improvement on the Mental Health Inventory (p < 0.01), a 1.6-point improvement on the Pain Effects Scale (p = 0.04), and a 2.4-point improvement on the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (p = 0.05).

LDN significantly improved mental health quality of life indices, indicating that further studies with LDN in MS are warranted.

### Treatment of psoriasis vulgaris using low-dose naltrexone [^113qejoc]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common, immune-mediated skin disease affecting 3.1% of the US population. Psoriasis negatively impacts health-related quality of life and is associated with multiple physical and mental health comorbidities, in addition to symptoms such as pain, itching, and bleeding. Psoriasis also imparts a substantial burden on the national economy, including high healthcare resource use and direct and indirect costs, and contributes to work impairment, presenteeism, and employment status changes because of symptoms.

A variety of treatments have been developed over the last several decades for the treatment of psoriasis. Exogenous therapies include topical corticosteroids, vitamin D derivatives, retinoids, and ultraviolet (UV) therapy. Systemic therapies include disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, such as methotrexate or cyclosporine, and biologic medications such as adalimumab, ustekinumab, and secukinumab. Unfortunately, although psoriasis treatments are becoming increasingly safe and efficacious, they may not always be successful, affordable, or tolerable.

Naltrexone, a μ-opioid receptor antagonist commonly used for opioid overdose, is typically well tolerated with minimal side effects, and does not have the potential for abuse or physical dependence. Low-dose naltrexone has not yet been formally studied in the treatment of psoriasis; however, it may have anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties because of its blockade of macrophage-released tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In this report, we present the successful treatment of moderate plaque psoriasis.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1175mSjp]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend not using oral naltrexone for the treatment of OUD, except under very limited circumstances due to poor medication adherence. Its use should be reserved for patients able to comply with special techniques to enhance their adherence, such as observed dosing. It is recognized that extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces, but does not eliminate, issues with medication adherence.

### Low dose naltrexone in dermatology [^112Li2kh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) has been successfully studied as an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory therapy in a wide range of conditions, including Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia, major depressive disorder, cancer, chronic regional pain syndrome, Charcot-Marie-Tooth, and multiple sclerosis. Recently, off-label LDN has been shown to improve dermatologic conditions such as systemic sclerosis, Hailey-Hailey Disease, lichen planopilaris, and guttate psoriasis. In this article, we examine the existing evidence for the use of LDN in skin disease and discuss its potential application in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD).

### Reduction of alcohol drinking in young adults by naltrexone: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of efficacy and safety [^117NioHV]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, may facilitate the reduction in drinking among young adults. This study compared the efficacy and safety of naltrexone administered daily, in addition to targeted dosing, with a placebo to reduce drinking in young adults who engage in heavy drinking.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in an outpatient research center from March 2008 to January 2012. Participants were aged 18–25 years and reported four or more heavy drinking days in the prior four weeks. Interventions included naltrexone 25 mg daily plus 25 mg targeted (at most daily) in anticipation of drinking (n = 61) or daily/targeted placebo (n = 67). All participants received a personalized feedback session and brief counseling every other week. The primary outcomes were the percent of heavy drinking days and percent days abstinent over the 8-week treatment period. Secondary outcomes included the number of drinks per drinking day and the percentage of days with estimated blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels ≥ 0.08 g/dL.

Of 140 randomized patients, 128 began treatment, comprising the evaluable sample. During treatment, the percent of heavy drinking days (naltrexone: mean = 21.60, SD = 16.05; placebo: mean = 22.90, SD = 13.20) (P = .58) and percent days abstinent (naltrexone: mean = 56.60, SD = 22.52; placebo: mean = 62.50, SD = 15.75) (P = .39) did not differ by group. However, naltrexone significantly reduced the number of drinks per drinking day (naltrexone: mean = 4.90, SD = 2.28; placebo: mean = 5.90, SD = 2.51) (P = .009) and the percentage of drinking days with estimated BAC ≥ 0.08 g/dL.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: a scoping review [^115D8d6a]. Pain Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

With regard to the use of LDN for the treatment of chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), 2 systematic reviews, 4 narrative reviews, and 3 case reports were identified. CRPS is a complex pain condition encompassing both neuropathic and nociplastic pathophysiology. It includes a variety of pain and sympathetically mediated symptoms arising after peripheral injury not related to specific damage to the nervous system (CRPS type I, previously referred to as reflex sympathetic dystrophy) or arising from a specific peripheral nerve injury (CRPS type II, previously referred to as causalgia).

The initial insult engages peripheral nervous system and central nervous system (CNS) sensitization processes that have been shown to drive the autonomic and vasomotor symptoms and allodynia/hyperalgesia. In CRPS, CNS sensitization has been reported to depend on glial activation and a subsequent increase in proinflammatory cytokine release. As previously stated, the increased activation of microglial cells leads to a proinflammatory state, with the secretion of pro-nociceptive neurotrophic factors resulting in enhanced excitatory and diminished inhibitory signaling within the CNS nociceptive networks, ultimately causing hyperalgesia and allodynia. Along these lines, postmortem immunohistochemical analysis of the spinal cord of a patient with CRPS has demonstrated upregulation of microglial TLR4 receptors, as well as overactivation of microglial cells within the CNS of patients with longstanding CRPS, specifically in the dorsal horn at the original level of injury.

### Randomized, proof-of-concept trial of low dose naltrexone for patients with breakthrough symptoms of major depressive disorder on antidepressants [^112MP3rS]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Given the proposed dopaminergic mechanism of low-dose naltrexone (LDN), we examined its efficacy as augmentation for depressive breakthrough on pro-dopaminergic antidepressant regimens. The study involved 12 adults (67% female, mean age = 45 ± 12) with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) on dopaminergic antidepressant regimens (stimulants, dopamine agonists, bupropion [≥ 300mg/day], aripiprazole [≤ 2.5mg/day], or sertraline [≥ 150mg/day]). Participants were randomized to naltrexone 1mg b.i.d. (n = 6) or placebo (n = 6) augmentation for 3 weeks.

All subjects completed the trial.

- **Results**: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) scores (primary outcome measure) decreased from 21.2 ± 2.0 to 11.7 ± 7.7 for LDN, from 23.7 ± 2.3 to 17.8 ± 5.9 for placebo (Cohen's d = 0.62; p = 0.3 between treatment groups). HAM-D-28 scores decreased from 26.2 ± 4.0 to 12.0 ± 9.8 for LDN, from 26.3 ± 2.6 to 19.8 ± 6.6 for placebo (d = 1.15; p = 0.097). Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-10 item) scores decreased from 30.4 ± 4.9 to 12.2 ± 8.4 for LDN, from 30.7 ± 4.3 to 22.8 ± 8.5 for placebo (d = 1.45; p = 0.035). MADRS-15 item scores decreased from 36.6 ± 6.2 to 13.2 ± 8.8 for LDN, from 36.7 ± 4.2 to 26.0 ± 10.0 for placebo (d = 1.49; p = 0.035). Clinical Global Improvement Scale-Severity (CGI-S) scores decreased from 4.3 ± 0.5 to 3.0 ± 1.1 for LDN, from 4.3 ± 0.5 to 4.0 ± 0.6 for placebo (d = 1.22; p = 0.064).

- **Limitations**: Small study; restrictions on allowed antidepressants.

In conclusion, LDN augmentation showed some benefit for MDD relapse on dopaminergic agents, but confirmation in larger studies is needed.

### Low-dose naltrexone use for patients with chronic regional pain syndrome: A systematic literature review [^1114AH9y]. Pain Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome is a rare neuropathic disorder that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States annually. Treatments often focus on pain management and frequently fail to relieve symptoms of pain and dystonia in patients.

The goal of this systematic qualitative review is to evaluate the evidence for the use of low-dose naltrexone in the treatment of chronic pain syndromes. This is achieved through a systematic review.

PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for articles containing the keywords "low-dose naltrexone" AND ("pain" OR "chronic pain" OR "fibromyalgia" OR "complex regional pain syndrome" OR "neuropathic pain" OR "nociceptive pain") between 1950 and July 17, 2020. A total of 30 publications were systematically reviewed. The exclusion criteria were articles unavailable in English, those that focused on acute pain only, and studies evaluating only animal models. Case studies were included for the purposes of our qualitative review.

Out of 29 articles, we reviewed 11 prospective studies, 10 case studies, 3 systematic reviews, 2 retrospective studies, 2 simulation models, and one combination study. These articles focused on chronic pain syndromes as well as painful rheumatologic and neurological disorders. We found that low-dose naltrexone treatment was positively associated with symptom relief in patients experiencing chronic pain, dystonia, and sleep disturbances.

### Low-dose naltrexone for the treatment of fibromyalgia: Investigation of dose-response relationships [^1141FGv2]. Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

This study explores dose-response relationships when treating fibromyalgia with low-dose naltrexone.

- **Design**: A single-blinded clinical trial was carried out using the "up-and-down" method.

- **Subjects**: Subjects included women with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia aged 18–60 years who had been referred to treatment at a public pain clinic at a Danish university hospital.

- **Methods**: The test doses ranged from 0.75 to 6 mg, with a dosing interval of 0.75 mg. The method was sequential and allowed for predicting the dose effective in 50% (ED50) and 95% (ED95) of the subjects when the dose had shifted direction 10 times, and six pairs of "up-and-down" data were available.

- **Results**: A total of 27 subjects were included in the study; two subjects were withdrawn. After inclusion of 25 evaluable subjects, the dose estimates were calculated as 3.88 mg for ED50 and 5.40 mg for ED95. As a secondary outcome, the effects on 10 common fibromyalgia symptoms were evaluated. A high interindividual variation was observed, both in the symptom presentation at baseline and in which symptoms were reduced by low-dose naltrexone.

- **Conclusions**: This study is the first to explore dose-response relationships in the treatment of fibromyalgia with low-dose naltrexone. Future placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials are needed. According to our findings, 4.5 mg, which has previously been used, seems to be a relevant test dose. We recommend that future studies include additional nonpain fibromyalgia symptoms as outcome measures.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^117Ju8bq]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A previously healthy white female living in the United States developed a sudden onset of ill health at the age of 29 in 1989. Her symptoms included profound fatigue and weakness, flu-like symptoms, post-exertional malaise, cognitive impairment, nausea, widespread pain, and sleep disturbance. Possible precipitating factors were a viral infection, early pregnancy, and exposure to ticks within six weeks of the onset. She was diagnosed with chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome by a neurologist after two years of ill health, and this diagnosis, and/or myalgic encephalomyelitis, has been reconfirmed several times since.

Over the subsequent years, she continued to experience symptoms of post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion, as defined in the International Consensus Criteria for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (2011). She also dealt with pain, periodic muscle weakness, flu-like symptoms, orthostatic intolerance, and unrefreshing sleep despite consulting many specialists.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: A scoping review [^117T55zg]. Pain Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

At low doses, naltrexone (LDN) has been shown to modulate inflammation through the interruption of microglial cell activation within the central nervous system. One of the most likely contributors to centralized pain is changes in microglial cell processing. Therefore, it has been postulated that LDN can be used to manage patients with pain resulting from central sensitization due to this relationship. This scoping review aims to synthesize the relevant study data for LDN as a novel treatment strategy for various centralized pain conditions.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar, guided by the Scale for Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) criteria.

Forty-seven studies related to centralized pain conditions were identified. Many of the studies were case reports/series and narrative reviews, but a few randomized control trials have been conducted. Overall, the body of evidence revealed improvement in patient-reported pain severity and in outcomes related to hyperalgesia, physical function, quality of life, and sleep. Variability in dosing paradigms and the time to patient response was present in the reviewed studies.

Evidence synthesized for this scoping review supports the ongoing use of LDN for the treatment of refractory pain in various centralized chronic pain conditions. Upon review of the currently available published studies, it is apparent that further high-quality, well-powered randomized control trials need to be conducted to establish efficacy.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^115Zo8zj]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

These case studies are presented in the hope they will lead to randomized clinical studies defining the role and dose of naltrexone in treating people with chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis compared with usual care or placebo. However, as naltrexone is out of patent, funding for such studies is problematic, despite the drug itself being relatively cheap. Most large studies are funded by large pharmaceutical companies, and there is no incentive for them to continue research of drugs once they are off-patent. We intend to replicate the approach of pharmaceutical companies by designing any clinical studies with licensing requirements in mind and will seek advice from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to this end.

- **Patient's perspective**:
	- **Sentence case**: Learning points. Naltrexone at low dose may work as an immune modulator, and small-scale clinical trials in a range of conditions including fibromyalgia, Gulf War Illness, and Crohn's disease have shown efficacy and low toxicity.
	- Although no clinical trials have been carried out, anecdotal web reports and these three case studies suggest low-dose naltrexone may be helpful in at least some patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis.
	- Clinical trials of off-patent drugs are difficult to fund. The lack of mechanisms for funding and licensing such drugs is a political issue which needs urgently addressing to save healthcare systems from ever-escalating drug costs.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^113V1HX7]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Internet reports suggest side effects can be troublesome initially, particularly increased fatigue and headaches. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in people with fibromyalgia found no difference in tolerability between low-dose naltrexone (LDN) and placebo but an increased frequency of vivid dreams and headaches. Recent work in Norway has found that individuals may experience fewer side effects if starting naltrexone at 6 mg, even if the final dose taken is lower than this (personal communication, Brian Haviland 2018).

Not everyone with chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis responds to naltrexone, although the exact proportion or the characteristics of those who do respond are not known. The three cases described here, compiled by three patients taking the drug, are typical of the range of responses in those who do respond, from a partial response through to life-changing differences. We recognize we had similar rapid onsets of illness, prolonged illnesses with limitation of life and curtailment of careers over many years, and similar immune hyper-reactivity to external stimuli. Despite these similarities, it is not known whether we are describing particular characteristics that would make response to LDN more likely. The first and third case studies described reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively, which therefore might originate from reduced neuroinflammation.

### Does adding low doses of oral naltrexone to morphine alter the subsequent opioid requirements and side effects in trauma patients [^113UEicx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). High credibility.

The present study aims to assess the influence of ultra-low doses of opioid antagonists on the analgesic properties of opioids and their side effects.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind controlled trial, the influence of the combination of ultra-low-dose naltrexone and morphine on the total opioid requirement and the frequency of the subsequent side effects was compared with that of morphine alone (augmented with placebo) in patients with trauma in the upper or lower extremities.

- **Results**: Although the morphine and naltrexone group required 0.04 mg more opioids during the study period, there was no significant difference between the opioid requirements of the two groups. Nausea was less frequently reported in patients receiving morphine and naltrexone.

- **Conclusion**: The combination of ultra-low-dose naltrexone and morphine in extremity trauma does not affect the overall opioid requirements; however, it lowers the risk of nausea.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^1164w2xv]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is used as an off-label treatment in low doses for several chronic immune-modulated disorders in many countries. Although only small-scale clinical trials have been performed, these suggest efficacy in several diseases, including Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia, and Gulf War Illness. Despite numerous internet reports of response to low-dose naltrexone (LDN), no clinical trials exist in people with chronic fatigue syndrome. This condition is characterized by chronic profound fatigue, postexertional malaise, pain, and autonomic and neurocognitive disturbances. This series of three case reports compiled by people with long-term ill-health due to chronic fatigue syndrome shows the range of responses they observed when taking LDN, from life-changing to a reduction in some symptoms only. Treatment doses ranged from 4 to 12 mg. Clinical trials may be warranted to explore the potential use of naltrexone in people with these debilitating illnesses, which currently have no licensed treatments available.

### Treatment of psoriasis vulgaris using low-dose naltrexone [^116AVEKw]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is primarily a dendritic and T-cell–mediated immunologic disease characterized by elevated intralesional levels of T-helper cells, interleukins, dendritic cells, and TNF. Consequently, many new therapies have emerged over the last few decades, notably immune-modulating biologics such as ustekinumab, etanercept, and infliximab. However, not all patients benefit from or can tolerate these medications, leading to experimentation with unconventional anti-inflammatory drugs like low-dose naltrexone.

Low-dose naltrexone (less than 5 mg/day, or approximately one-tenth the dose used for substance use disorders) acts as an antagonist to both μ-opioid receptors and non-opioid Toll-like receptors located on macrophages. These effects combine to provide both pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory properties by paradoxically increasing endogenous opioid release — thus boosting β-endorphin levels — and by mitigating the pro-inflammatory cascade instigated by macrophage-induced TNF activation. Supporting these findings, two recent case series recognize low-dose naltrexone as an effective treatment for lichen planopilaris and Hailey-Hailey disease. Furthermore, low-dose naltrexone has been successfully employed in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, and fibromyalgia, and it is associated with reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other markers of immunodysregulation following treatment.

In our patient, low-dose naltrexone significantly reduced the affected body surface area (BSA) from 10% to 1% over six months, with continued remission at the time of writing.

### No change in the consumption of thyroid hormones after starting low dose naltrexone (LDN): A quasi-experimental before-after study [^111njAqs]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Low dose naltrexone (LDN) is reported to have beneficial effects in several autoimmune diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine whether starting LDN was followed by changes in the dispensing of thyroid hormones to patients with hypothyroidism.

- **Methods**: We performed a quasi-experimental before-after study based on the Norwegian Prescription Database. Study participants were identified by using reimbursement codes for hypothyroidism. Cumulative dispensed Defined Daily Doses and the number of users of triiodothyronine (T3) and levothyroxine (LT4) one year before and after the first LDN prescription were compared in three groups based on LDN exposure.

- **Results**: We identified 898 patients that met the inclusion criteria. There was no association between starting LDN and the subsequent dispensing of thyroid hormones. If anything, there was a tendency towards increasing LT4 consumption with increasing LDN exposure.

- **Conclusion**: The results of this study do not support claims of efficacy of LDN in hypothyroidism.

### Adapting treatment length to opioid-dependent individuals' needs and preferences: A 2-year follow-up to a 1-year study of extended-release naltrexone [^114M7H3C]. Addiction (2020). Low credibility.

Opioid craving scores remained low during the study, with mean scores of 9 and > 9.5, respectively, on a scale ranging from 0 to 10.

When asked why they wanted to discontinue the XR-NTX treatment before 104 weeks, 29 participants stated that they felt strong enough to stay abstinent without XR-NTX, four expressed a desire to get high, three reported being tired of treatment, and five were reported as dropouts. There is missing data on the last nine participants.

XR-NTX was well tolerated, and only five participants reported transient adverse events such as sleep disturbance, gastrointestinal discomfort, and different types of infections. None of the adverse events were considered serious or related to the study medication, and none led to discontinuation of the study.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Ww5B4]. BMC Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Naltrexone is a pure opioid antagonist with activity at multiple opioid and non-opioid human receptors. Its licensed uses include aiding in the prevention of relapse in alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and opioid addiction after withdrawal, and, in combination with bupropion, for obesity. These conditions represent major global health problems, with rising rates of disability and death occurring in many countries. Despite concern about the impact of these diseases and the need for treatment, naltrexone is currently underutilized across most countries, particularly for AUDs.

At normal or higher doses (≥ 50 mg), naltrexone is also used off-label for several addictions and impulse control disorders that currently have no licensed drug treatments. These include amphetamine and cocaine addiction, impulse control disorders, eating disorders, and autism spectrum disorders.

Following experimental findings that low doses of naltrexone result in tumor growth suppression and immune modulation, it is increasingly used at doses of around 4.5 mg, known as low dose naltrexone (LDN). Small-scale clinical trials of LDN have been conducted in conditions such as Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, and HIV infection, where the evidence has shown efficacy and/or low toxicity. Other conditions for which LDN is used, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis), complex regional pain syndrome, and autoimmune disorders, are still awaiting randomized clinical trials (RCTs). LDN is now licensed as an adjunct in HIV infection for over-the-counter sales.

### Low-dose naltrexone treatment of familial benign pemphigus (Hailey-Hailey disease) [^116KrhCt]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Familial benign pemphigus, or Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD), is a rare and debilitating genetic dermatosis characterized by chronic vesicles, erosions, and maceration in flexural areas. Despite the reported therapeutic modalities, such as topical and systemic corticosteroids, systemic immunomodulators, topical and systemic retinoids, and laser treatments, HHD can still be markedly difficult to control.

- **Objective**: To assess low-dose naltrexone hydrochloride in the treatment of recalcitrant HHD.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: In this case series, 3 patients with biopsy-proven recalcitrant HHD were evaluated in the outpatient dermatology clinic at the Cleveland Clinic. Each patient was treated with low-dose naltrexone hydrochloride at a dosage of 1.5 to 3.0 mg per day. No laboratory monitoring was necessary. Clinical response (healing of erosions, improvement in erythema, and alleviation of pain), adverse effects, and subjective quality of life were monitored throughout the treatment. The study dates were January 2016 to January 2017.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Objective clinical response as assessed by the treating dermatologist, subjective quality of life as reported by the patient, and recorded adverse effects were monitored throughout the treatment at intervals of 2 to 3 months.

- **Results**: The 3 patients included a woman in her 40s and 2 men in their 60s. Each patient exhibited at least an 80% improvement in the extent of the disease, with one patient demonstrating 90% clearance. All 3 patients had substantial improvement in quality of life.

### Buprenorphine, pain, and opioid use in patients taking high-dose long-term opioids: A randomized clinical trial [^116UfMhn]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Guidelines recommend dose reduction or discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy when harm outweighs benefit, but strategies to help patients do so are limited.

- **Objective**: To test optionally switching to buprenorphine as a strategy for improving pain and reducing opioids among patients prescribed high-dose, full agonist long-term opioid therapy.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: In this pragmatic, multisite, 12-month randomized clinical trial with masked outcome assessment, patients treated at Veterans Affairs primary care clinics were recruited from October 2017 to March 2021, with follow-up completed in June 2022. Eligible patients had moderate to severe chronic pain despite high-dose opioid therapy (≥ 70 mg/d for at least 3 months). Patients were randomized to having the option to switch to buprenorphine or not having the option to switch.

- **Interventions**: The buprenorphine option was discussed with eligible patients as part of a larger trial of collaborative pain care interventions. Those who switched had structured follow-up to optimize dosing and address adverse effects.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the Brief Pain Inventory total score at 12 months. The main secondary outcome was the opioid dose in morphine milligram equivalents at 12 months.

- **Results**: Of 207 included participants, 185 (89.4%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 60.9 (10.2) years. A total of 104 were randomized to the buprenorphine option and 103 to the no buprenorphine option. In the buprenorphine option arm, 27 participants (26.0%) switched. Over 12 months, the mean (SD) results…

### Low-dose naltrexone: A novel treatment for Hailey-Hailey disease [^1132Q7EV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Hailey-Hailey disease, also known as chronic benign familial pemphigus, is a rare inherited dermatosis typically characterized by erosions at intertriginous sites, which are often preceded by minor trauma or stress. We report a case of treatment-resistant Hailey-Hailey disease that had failed to respond to topical and oral steroids, prophylactic aciclovir, doxycycline, and systemic therapies, including dapsone, acitretin, and ciclosporin. Low-dose naltrexone at 4.5 mg once daily was commenced following an incidental benefit observed in this patient's similarly affected sister. The clinical and psychological response at the time of writing has been considerable.

### Efficacy and tolerability of long-acting injectable naltrexone for alcohol dependence: a randomized controlled trial [^114aQX4V]. JAMA (2005). High credibility.

Alcohol dependence is a common disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of alcohol dependence; however, adherence to daily oral pharmacotherapy can be problematic, and clinical acceptance and utility of oral naltrexone have been limited.

- **Objective**: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of a long-acting intramuscular formulation of naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol-dependent patients.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between February 2002 and September 2003 at 24 US public hospitals, private and Veterans Administration clinics, and tertiary care medical centers. Of the 899 individuals screened, 627 who were diagnosed as actively drinking alcohol-dependent adults were randomized to receive treatment, and 624 received at least one injection.

- **Intervention**: An intramuscular injection of 380 mg of long-acting naltrexone (n = 205) or 190 mg of long-acting naltrexone (n = 210) or a matching volume of placebo (n = 209) was administered monthly, combined with 12 sessions of low-intensity psychosocial intervention.

- **Main outcome measure**: The event rate of heavy drinking days in the intent-to-treat population.

- **Results**: Compared with placebo, 380 mg of long-acting naltrexone resulted in a 25% decrease in the event rate of heavy drinking days (P = .02) and 190 mg of naltrexone resulted in a 17% decrease (P = .07). Sex and pretreatment abstinence each showed significant interaction.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^1161Z6Ku]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

In 2018, when the patient was 37 years old, he began taking low-dose naltrexone (LDN), initially at a dosage of 1 mg/day, which was gradually increased to 4.5 mg. He continues this regimen without experiencing any side effects upon starting the medication.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^116RsaQ1]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Outcome and follow-up: Case 2

Although pain and sleep issues continue, these are at a lower level than prior to starting naltrexone. Her sleep journal prior to starting LDN showed she awoke every 90 minutes through the night. Monitoring after starting LDN shows that although she may not sleep through, she does not have repeated awakenings. She no longer requires acupuncture for symptomatic pain relief. However, her functional level did not improve with LDN.

Now aged 59, she also continues with other symptoms of myalgic encephalomyelitis, including postexertional neuroimmune exhaustion, periodic muscle weakness, orthostatic intolerance, symptomatic sinus tachycardia, urticarial rashes, and susceptibility to bacterial infections. Due to these, she takes ivabradine 2.5 mg two times per day and cetirizine 10 mg/day. Despite these continuing symptoms, she feels LDN is of sufficient benefit to continue long-term.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116iiG7k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

It is recommended that the prescribing physician convey the following information to patients being treated with naltrexone hydrochloride:

You have been prescribed naltrexone hydrochloride as part of the comprehensive treatment for your alcoholism or drug dependence. It is advised to carry identification to alert medical personnel to the fact that you are on this medication. A naltrexone hydrochloride medication card may be obtained from your physician for this purpose. Carrying the identification card will help ensure that you receive adequate treatment in an emergency. If you require medical treatment, inform the treating physician that you are receiving naltrexone hydrochloride therapy. You should take naltrexone hydrochloride as directed by your physician.

- **Be aware of opioid sensitivity**: Advise patients that if they previously used opioids, they may be more sensitive to lower doses and at risk of accidental overdose should they use opioids after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued or temporarily interrupted. Inform family members and those closest to the patient of this increased sensitivity and risk of overdose.

- **Understanding the effects of opioid blockage**: Inform patients that because naltrexone hydrochloride can block the effects of opioids, they will not perceive any effect if they attempt to self-administer heroin or any other opioid drug in small doses while on naltrexone hydrochloride. Emphasize that administering large doses of heroin or any other opioid in an attempt to bypass the blockade can be extremely dangerous.

### Low dose naltrexone for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^1178QnkC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is a transmural, relapsing inflammatory condition afflicting the digestive tract. Opioid signaling, long known to affect secretion and motility in the gut, has been implicated in the inflammatory cascade of Crohn's disease. Low dose naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, has garnered interest as a potential therapy.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low dose naltrexone for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.

- **Search methods**: A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register was performed from inception to January 15, 2018, to identify relevant studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterology conferences, including Digestive Disease Week and United European Gastroenterology Week, and reference lists from retrieved articles were also screened.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of low dose naltrexone (LDN) for the treatment of active Crohn's disease were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3.5). The primary outcome was induction of clinical remission defined by a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of < 150 or a Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) of < 10. Secondary outcomes included clinical response (70- or 100-point decrease in CDAI from baseline), endoscopic remission or response, quality of life, and adverse events as defined by the included studies. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes.

### Low-dose naltrexone for treatment of dermatologic conditions: A clinical review [^111Mgspr]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Naltrexone is a long-acting opioid receptor antagonist that may be compounded at lower doses (1–5 mg) to treat inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) transiently blocks the opioid receptor, resulting in increased ligand and receptor expression, favoring κ over μ receptors and decreasing inflammatory mediators and itch. Additionally, LDN antagonizes non-opioid receptors, including the pro-inflammatory Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4).

Altogether, the anti-inflammatory properties of LDN have supported its use in dermatologic conditions, including Hailey-Hailey disease, Darier disease, pruritus, lichen planus, psoriasis, dermatomyositis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and body-focused repetitive behaviors. LDN has demonstrated efficacy in treating these dermatologic conditions with improvement in disease severity, body surface area involvement, and associated symptoms. However, clinical response may vary based on initial disease presentation. There is also evidence supporting LDN in combination with other anti-inflammatory agents.

Fewer side effects have been reported with LDN compared to standard naltrexone doses, though larger studies are required to optimize dosage and management. LDN is frequently compounded by a pharmacy, which may pose barriers to access. In this clinical review, we describe updated and practical uses of LDN in inflammatory dermatologic conditions, associated side effects, cost barriers, and comparisons to standard naltrexone doses.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^111YDpkj]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Given the widespread use of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) in many countries and the numerous internet reports, it is somewhat surprising that this is the first medical series of case reports on its effect in people with chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis. The mechanism of action for naltrexone at low doses in this disease group is unknown. It is possibly due to the rebound of endorphins following short-term suppression or to direct action suppressing inflammation induced by microglia. There have been no formal dosing studies of naltrexone at low doses in any disorder. Therefore, although the dose of 3–4.5 mg is established in clinical practice, some practitioners use 9 mg or higher in chronic fatigue syndrome. Causality and dosing need further study.

All case reports are limited by their lack of controlling for confounding factors and possible placebo responses. Such factors can only be adequately controlled for within a randomized double-blind clinical trial. In a recent placebo-controlled, double-blind multicentre trial of rituximab in chronic fatigue syndrome, the placebo response rate was 35%. Alternative explanations for improvements in these cases could also be due to fluctuations in the underlying disease, which can appear as temporary improvements, and occasionally, the disease improves spontaneously. However, all three subjects had tried alternative treatments without the long-term effects that LDN has produced, which in cases 2 and 3 were specific to particular symptoms.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116kJrKc]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

- **Trial flow**: The electronic searches identified 7,873 citations, along with an additional 995 records from clinical trials websites (821), systematic reviews (157), and references in other papers (17). After removing duplicate references, this was reduced to 4,738 records. Of these, 4,390 were excluded based on abstracts. Full-text articles were obtained for 348 citations, from which 96 citations were excluded, and 163 were subsidiary papers. Thus, 89 primary studies were identified (Additional file 2). The numbers identified at each stage, from initial searching to quantitative analyses, and the reasons for excluding studies, are provided in a PRISMA 2009 flow diagram (Fig. 1).

	- Fig. 1 shows the PRISMA 2009 flow diagram. WHO stands for the World Health Organization; EudraCT is the European Clinical Trials Database.

- **Characteristics of included studies**: Eighty-nine studies (11,194 participants) met the review criteria, including those published after 1 January 2001. Three studies were excluded because they only provided total participant numbers, leaving 86 studies (10,957 participants) for potential data extraction and analysis. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of included studies by broad categories, while Additional file 3: Table S1 provides the details of each study. The target dose of naltrexone ranged from 3 mg to 250 mg. The most frequent conditions studied were alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in 36 studies. In a further 21 studies, including those on HIV infection, psychiatric disorders, and addictions such as smoking, participants had a dual diagnosis.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113gY86S]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

There was no significant difference between naltrexone and placebo in the meta-analysis of the risk ratio (RR) of withdrawals (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93–1.05, I² = 8%). However, an increased risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (AEs) was observed (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06–1.67, I² = 0%).

- **Subgroup and sensitivity analyses**: In pre-specified subgroup analyses of the risk ratio (RR) of serious adverse events (SAEs), no differences were found in results for different doses or for different disease groups/conditions. Due to the limited number of studies with dosages of 15 weeks duration, results showed (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.69–1.34, I² = 0%). Sensitivity analysis of the studies with a low risk of bias (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.61–1.54, I² = 0%) indicated no difference in risk compared to studies with a higher risk of bias (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61–1.05, I² = 0%).

The forest plot (Fig. 3) illustrates the subgroup analysis by dose of the risk ratio (RR) of serious adverse events in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing naltrexone with placebo. Data in parentheses show the mean or range of participants' age and the percentage of male or female participants. Note that double zero studies, which reported zero events in each treatment group, are excluded.

### Naltrexone in the treatment of alcohol dependence [^115XCXjv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Although naltrexone, an opiate-receptor antagonist, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of alcohol dependence, its efficacy is uncertain.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of naltrexone as an adjunct to standardized psychosocial treatment. We randomly assigned 627 veterans (almost all men) with chronic, severe alcohol dependence to 12 months of naltrexone (50 mg once daily), 3 months of naltrexone followed by 9 months of placebo, or 12 months of placebo. All patients were offered individual counseling and programs to improve their compliance with study medication and were encouraged to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

- **Results**: There were 209 patients in each group; all had been sober for at least five days before randomization. At 13 weeks, we found no significant difference in the number of days to relapse between patients in the two naltrexone groups (mean, 72.3 days) and the placebo group (mean, 62.4 days; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between groups, -3.0 to 22.8). At 52 weeks, there were no significant differences among the three groups in the percentage of days on which drinking occurred and the number of drinks per drinking day.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings do not support the use of naltrexone for the treatment of men with chronic, severe alcohol dependence.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113f7B5E]. BMC Medicine (2019). High credibility.

This meta-analysis of 89 RCTs based on 11,194 participants showed no evidence of an increased risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring for naltrexone compared to placebo. These findings were consistent across trials with varying duration, dosages, and index conditions, suggesting that naltrexone is safe to use across a wide variety of licensed and non-licensed indications. We found that adverse events (AEs) such as dizziness, nausea, and vomiting are potentially more common for naltrexone compared to placebo. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because data reporting for AEs was poor (fewer than 21 studies contributed to the AE analyses).

- **Strengths and limitations**: There were several strengths of this review. One was the size, which was sufficiently large in both the number of participants and the number of studies that it would have enabled the detection of specific harms due to a drug. Papanikolaou and Ioannidis calculated the sample size of a systematic review needed to detect a rare event (0.25%) occurring in about 1% of subjects as 4,000 subjects (80% power and α = 0.05), and this systematic review contained over 10,000 subjects from 89 studies. In addition, this review included a broad range of studies from different countries, settings, and disease groups, including patients with multiple morbidities or addictions. These latter complex scenarios more closely reflect clinical practice than the usual restrictive entry criteria of clinical trials. Hence, the relative effect size found is likely to be generalisable.

### Effects of low-dose naltrexone on quality of life in high-grade glioma patients: a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trial [^112CQtgD]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) experience a diminished quality of life (QOL) and increased fatigue both at diagnosis and throughout the disease course. Naltrexone, an orally semisynthetic opiate antagonist, is FDA-approved for treating heroin and alcohol addiction. Interestingly, low-dose naltrexone (LDN) has been observed to improve QOL and lower fatigue in other neurological illnesses, such as multiple sclerosis. LDN is believed to function as a partial agonist, leading to shifts in neurochemicals that reduce fatigue. Based on this, we sought to study whether LDN impacts QOL and fatigue in patients with HGG.

In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we randomized 110 HGG patients to receive either placebo (N = 56) or LDN at a dose of 4.5 mg orally at night (N = 54). Subjects began LDN or placebo on day 1 of combined radiation and temozolomide therapy, continuing for 16 weeks. We assessed changes from baseline in patient-reported outcomes of QOL (using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain) and fatigue (using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue).

Demographics were as follows: WHO grade IV (85%), male (56%), KPS 90–100 (51%), grossly resected (55%), with a mean age of 56 years. Changes in QOL and fatigue between baseline and post-chemotherapy and radiation therapy were not significantly different between patients receiving LDN and those receiving placebo. The adverse event profiles for LDN and placebo were similar, attributed to the concomitant use of temozolomide.

In conclusion, LDN has no effect on QOL and fatigue in HGG patients during concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: a scoping review [^1147b9eR]. Pain Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

LDN is a novel therapeutic treatment option for patients with centralized chronic pain. Numerous small case reports and a few higher-quality trials support the use of LDN in chronic pain. Despite this, LDN is still used off-label for many chronic pain conditions. It is imperative that higher-quality, well-designed, and controlled studies be conducted to expand and potentiate the application of LDN and its utility profile, as well as help with standardization of treatment regimens. Even though such studies are much needed, LDN still offers promising results in the clinical management of refractory symptoms in patients with these chronic centralized pain conditions.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^111h9ukH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment should be initiated with an initial dose of 25 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride. If no withdrawal signs occur, the patient may be started on 50 mg a day thereafter. A dose of 50 mg once a day will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids. As with many non-agonist treatments for addiction, naltrexone hydrochloride is of proven value only when given as part of a comprehensive plan of management that includes measures to ensure the patient takes the medication.

- **Naloxone challenge test**: Clinicians are reminded that there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful if there is any question of occult opioid dependence. If signs of opioid withdrawal are still observed following a naloxone challenge, treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride should not be attempted. The naloxone challenge can be repeated in 24 hours.

	- The naloxone challenge test should not be performed in a patient showing clinical signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal, or in a patient whose urine contains opioids. The naloxone challenge test may be administered by either the intravenous or subcutaneous routes.

	- **Intravenous**: Inject 0.2 mg naloxone. Observe for 30 seconds for signs or symptoms of withdrawal. If no evidence of withdrawal, inject 0.6 mg of naloxone. Observe for an additional 20 minutes.

### No change in the consumption of thyroid hormones after starting low dose naltrexone (LDN): a quasi-experimental before-after study [^1141K3U3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The opioid antagonist naltrexone in low doses (typically < 5 mg/day) is being used off-label against several autoimmune diseases. In a recent review, the authors claim that low dose naltrexone (LDN) has beneficial immunomodulatory effects by acting on the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) or as a direct immunomodulating agent, by elevating endogenous opioids, or by affecting cytokine production.

A few small randomized clinical trials show promising results in inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and chronic pain conditions. Although no studies in thyroid disease have been published, LDN has been proposed as an alternative add-on to regular hypothyroid therapy. Some patients report astounding improvements, and there are patients and doctors who claim that LDN may be beneficial in autoimmune thyroid disease, but definitive evidence is lacking.

Decades of high-dose naltrexone in the treatment of opioid and alcohol addiction indicate that LDN has an excellent safety profile, and with increasing awareness among patients, it is highly likely that endocrinologists will increasingly have requests to prescribe LDN.

In 2013, the number of users of LDN in Norway increased from almost zero to 0.3% of the population within a few months following a TV documentary. This surge in LDN use could be considered a natural experiment that makes quasi-experimental pharmacoepidemiological studies possible. We seized the opportunity to examine whether there were changes in the dispensing of thyroid hormones in selected patients following the initiation of LDN therapy.

### Low-dose naltrexone as treatment for epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa-associated refractory pruritus [^114Mok4x]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is an alternative therapy that has gained increased use in dermatology. Opioid receptors, particularly the μ-opioid receptor, are found throughout the skin, affecting various aspects of cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Naltrexone exerts a dual effect through blockade of morphine-induced itch via the μ-opioid receptor, while also reducing inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 6, and nitric oxide. Prior studies have demonstrated that naltrexone yields symptomatic improvement of pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, systemic sclerosis, lichen planopilaris, benign chronic pemphigus (Hailey-Hailey disease), and even nondermatologic conditions including cholestasis.

Dosing of naltrexone bears implications for the treatment of pruritus due to modulation of endogenous opioid signaling. One prior report documented naltrexone use in EBP, although a high dose (50 mg by mouth daily) was prescribed. High-dose naltrexone results in continuous receptor binding, carrying the adverse risks of abdominal cramps, vomiting, and dizziness. Low doses of naltrexone (1–5 mg) bind opioid receptors intermittently, increasing expression of both ligands and receptors to restore neuroepidermal homeostasis. Therefore, intermittent binding of low-dose naltrexone may potentiate its efficacy in reducing pruritus, as seen in our patient.

While the exact mechanism of pruritus in EBP remains unknown and more detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations are needed, our patient's response to treatment suggests significant therapeutic potential.

### Managing acute pain in patients taking medication for opioid use disorder: A rapid review [^115W5DiG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Managing acute pain in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) who are on medications like methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone can be complicated. This complexity arises from patients' higher baseline pain sensitivity and the need for higher opioid doses to achieve effective pain relief. This review aims to evaluate the benefits and harms of acute pain management strategies for patients on OUD medications and whether strategies vary by OUD medication type or cause of acute pain.

---

### Methods

We systematically searched multiple bibliographic sources until April 2020. One reviewer used prespecified criteria to assess articles for inclusion, extract data, rate study quality, and grade our confidence in the body of evidence, all with a second reviewer checking.

---

### Results

We identified 12 observational studies, among which 3 had control groups and 9 did not. Two of the studies with control groups suggest that continuing buprenorphine and methadone in OUD patients after surgery may reduce the need for additional opioids and that ineffective pain management in patients taking methadone can result in disengagement in care. A third controlled study found that patients taking OUD medications may need higher doses of additional opioids for pain control, but it provided insufficient detail to apply results to clinical practice. The only case study examining naltrexone reported that postoperative pain was managed using tramadol. We have low confidence in these findings as no studies directly addressed our question by comparing pain management strategies, and few provided adequate descriptions of the dosage, timing, or rationale for clinical application.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: a scoping review [^112d2eGi]. Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

With the assistance of a professional librarian, a comprehensive literature review was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar, with publication dates ranging from January 1, 2000, to February 1, 2022. Article eligibility and inclusion criteria were limited to publications in the English language and studies pertaining to human subjects. Exclusion criteria included studies focusing on the use of full-dose naltrexone or the use of naltrexone for alcohol and opioid abuse, obesity, dermatological conditions, or other nonpainful disease processes (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Hailey-Hailey disease, opioid-induced constipation, and chronic fatigue). Studies involving cancer- or chemotherapy-induced neuropathy or pain were also excluded. All other studies reporting on patients using LDN for chronic pain were included. Keywords, Medical Subject Headings, and EMTREE subject headings were used to search for the concepts of LDN and chronic pain. Keywords included "low dose naltrexone" and "chronic pain", "complex regional pain syndrome", "inflammatory bowel disease", "fibromyalgia", "low back pain", "rheumatoid arthritis", "neuropathy", and "migraines".

All search results were screened for eligibility and inclusion, starting with an initial title review, followed by an abstract and full-text review.

### Dose escalation of naltrexone to reduce stress responses associated with opioid antagonist induction: A double-blind randomized trial [^114LsKVT]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). High credibility.

To describe the role of opioid antagonist induction in reducing stress response and withdrawal symptoms, the complexity of naltrexone induction is limiting broader applicability of opioid antagonist-assisted abstinence. The aim of this clinical trial was to assess the stress response to two low-dose naltrexone induction protocols under minimal oral sedation.

- **Design**: Double-blind randomized controlled trial.
- **Setting**: Open setting in-patient unit.
- **Participants**: Adults with opioid use disorder and at least a year-long history of opioid use.
- **Intervention protocol**: Patients received either a single 12.5 mg naltrexone oral dose (SI group) or escalating dosage regimen starting from 50 μg up to a cumulative dose of 12.5 mg (ED group).
- **Main outcome measure**: Differences in cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations 1 hour after the start of naltrexone induction.

In all, 124 patients were enrolled, and 68 remained in the trial at the point of randomization — 33 in the SI group and 35 in the ED group. Eight patients were excluded from the final analysis. Plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations were significantly higher in the SI group; mean difference between groups was 313 nmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI] 182–444, P < 0.001) and 36.9 pg/mL (95% CI 12.3–61.4, P = 0.004), respectively.

- **Secondary outcomes**: SI patients experienced significant increases in plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations, and withdrawal scores. In the ED group, these measures remained at or below baseline throughout the 24-hour period from the start of naltrexone induction.

Conclusions from the study indicate that naltrexone induction protocols have a measurable impact on stress response and withdrawal symptoms associated with opioid antagonist-assisted abstinence.

### Potential drug interaction with opioid agonist in the setting of chronic low-dose opioid antagonist use [^112J9S5W]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) has been evaluated in several small studies for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. It is thought to work through modulation of inflammatory mediators and upregulation of endogenous opioid receptors, which may hypersensitize patients to exogenous opioids. Drug-drug interaction screening tools, built into electronic health records and other services, identify the interaction as a risk of opioid withdrawal rather than hypersensitivity. We present a case of a drug-drug interaction in a patient who was receiving LDN for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The patient received a single dose of oxycodone 5 mg, resulting in obtundation unresponsive to painful stimuli, necessitating the administration of naloxone boluses and infusion, along with admission to the intensive care unit for one night. The patient responded well to naloxone therapy and was discharged in satisfactory condition.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^114eeUuq]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

- **Outcome and follow-up**: Now aged 63, 30 years after the initial meningitis, she currently has a normal quality of life with no signs of ill health, although energy levels can reduce slightly during infections, prolonged overexertion, or excessive mental effort. Such reductions can be delayed up to 48 hours after the initial overstimulation, suggestive of continuing mild post-exertional malaise. Symptoms such as poor sleep and excessive pain are absent.

Up until starting low-dose naltrexone (LDN), she was in receipt of the UK Government's benefits of Disability Living Allowance at the higher rate for mobility (requiring the person to have severe walking difficulties) and middle rate for care (requiring frequent help during the day). These payments were reduced and then finally stopped 3 years after starting LDN when it was clear she was stable, well, and could walk, and more recently, cycle, without problems. Prior to starting LDN, her intellectual and cognitive functioning was very limited. These abilities have returned apart from continuing cognitive impairments due to the meningitis.

### Treatment of psoriasis vulgaris using low-dose naltrexone [^114iPkDx]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 60-year-old white woman presented to the clinic with a history of moderate, generalized plaque psoriasis covering 10% of her body surface area (BSA). Her medical history was significant for mild osteoarthritis, but she did not have a history of active joint pains or swelling. She was not taking any medications and had no known drug allergies. On physical examination, the patient had well-demarcated, scaly, erythematous plaques covering 10% of her BSA. The patient reported symptoms of pruritus but no pain.

The patient did not have private drug coverage and did not qualify for a government-supported drug plan. In the past, she had some success with narrow-band UVB phototherapy (NBUVB). We subsequently treated her 3 times per week for 3 to 6 months on 2 different occasions. The treatment course of NBUVB was supplemented with clobetasol ointment applied to lesions on the arms, body, and legs. After a change in scheduling and the inability to attend NBUVB treatments, coupled with concerns about the long-term use of high-potency steroids, the patient wanted to try a systemic therapy. After researching low-dose naltrexone as a potential therapy for psoriasis, the patient suggested this treatment. After discussing the risks and benefits, the patient began low-dose naltrexone, 4.5 mg daily. Naltrexone is supplied as 50-mg tablets; therefore, the patient had to procure 4.5-mg tablets compounded by a specialty pharmacy. The patient's psoriatic lesions were significantly improved at 3 months, and the affected BSA had decreased from 10% to 1% after 6 months of treatment.

### Fibromyalgia symptoms are reduced by low-dose naltrexone: a pilot study [^116csf6N]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain and sensitivity to mechanical stimulation. In this pilot clinical trial, researchers tested the effectiveness of low-dose naltrexone in treating fibromyalgia symptoms.

- **Design**: Participants completed a single-blind, crossover trial with the following timeline: baseline (2 weeks), placebo (2 weeks), drug (8 weeks), and washout (2 weeks).

- **Patients**: The study included ten women who met the criteria for fibromyalgia and were not taking opioid medication.

- **Interventions**: Naltrexone, known for antagonizing opioid receptors on neurons, also inhibits microglia activity in the central nervous system. At low doses (4.5 mg), it may inhibit microglia activity and reverse central and peripheral inflammation.

- **Outcome measures**: Participants completed daily reports of symptom severity using a handheld computer. Additionally, every two weeks, participants visited the laboratory for tests on mechanical, heat, and cold pain sensitivity.

- **Results**: Low-dose naltrexone reduced fibromyalgia symptoms in the entire cohort, with a greater than 30% reduction of symptoms over placebo. Laboratory visits showed improved mechanical and heat pain thresholds due to the drug. Side effects such as insomnia and vivid dreams were rare and described as minor and transient. Baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted over 80% of the variance in drug response. Individuals with higher sedimentation rates, indicating general inflammatory processes, experienced the greatest reduction in symptoms.
