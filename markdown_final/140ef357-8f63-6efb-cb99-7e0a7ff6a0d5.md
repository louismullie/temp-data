## Question

Bloody stool on pradaxa

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage bloody stool in a patient taking Pradaxa (dabigatran). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and stabilization. Then, I should verify the likely etiologies and how dabigatran alters risk. Next, I will review what labs and imaging are actually useful. After that, I need to check guideline-based management, including when to reverse and when to scope. Finally, I will consider special populations, resumption of anticoagulation, and patient counseling, making sure each step aligns with high-quality guidance and labeling.

> Let me first confirm the clinical priority: any bright red or maroon blood per rectum while on dabigatran warrants urgent evaluation because dabigatran increases bleeding risk and can unmask or worsen lower GI sources; I need to ensure hemodynamic stability immediately and start resuscitation if unstable, since mortality rises in older adults and those with comorbidities [^13d47ce0] [^f29733b9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the source; I should verify whether this is true lower GI bleeding versus an upper source masquerading as hematochezia, because up to about 15% of presumed LGIB can be from the upper tract, and brisk UGIB can present with red stools rather than melena, so I need to keep both possibilities in mind while I stabilize and plan diagnostics [^13d47ce0].

> Next, I should review the medication context carefully: confirm dabigatran dose, timing of last dose, renal function, and concomitant agents that increase bleeding risk such as NSAIDs, antiplatelets, or P-gp inhibitors, because renal impairment prolongs dabigatran half-life and increases exposure, and drug interactions can elevate levels; I need to check creatinine clearance and consider that in severe renal dysfunction the half-life can extend beyond 24 hours, which changes reversal decisions and timing of resumption [^e8c45237] [^b6767123] [^33a1e411].

> I will now examine the likely etiologies; dabigatran-associated GI bleeding spans diverticular bleeding, angiodysplasia, ischemic colitis, hemorrhoids, and NSAID-induced ulcers, and importantly, dabigatran increases GI bleeding risk compared with warfarin in RE-LY, with any GI bleed around 6.6% vs 4.2% and major GI bleed around 1.5% vs 1.0% per year, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion for both common and occult sources [^f29733b9] [^9e4c10b5].

> Wait, let me verify the laboratory approach because standard coagulation tests can mislead; PT and INR are insensitive for dabigatran, whereas aPTT may be prolonged but can also be normal at therapeutic levels, so a normal aPTT helps exclude clinically significant drug effect, and if available, dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time can quantify effect; in life-threatening bleeding, I should not delay care waiting for esoteric assays, but I should use them to guide reversal decisions when time allows [^33a1e411] [^81db447f].

> Next, I should review imaging and endoscopic strategy; in unstable patients, CT angiography can localize active extravasation and guide angiographic therapy, while colonoscopy within 24 hours after stabilization improves diagnostic yield and enables therapy; I need to ensure adequate bowel prep in elective settings and coordinate timing with anticoagulant interruption, balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks in shared decision-making with cardiology or neurology [^6792dbdc] [^8965c4f6].

> Now, I need to check guideline-based medical management; for most patients, holding dabigatran and supportive care suffice given its 12–17 hour half-life, but I should reverse if there is life-threatening bleeding that fails to respond to initial resuscitation and drug cessation, using idarucizumab 5 g IV if the last dose was within 24 hours; I should confirm that ACG/CAG suggests against routine idarucizumab in hospitalized GI bleeding due to limited outcome benefit and cost, reserving it for select severe cases, whereas BSG/ESGE supports considering targeted reversal in hemodynamically unstable DOAC patients, so I must individualize based on severity and trajectory [^89553c9a] [^d1e38440] [^75278b28] [^e28d883d].

> But wait, what if idarucizumab is not available or contraindicated; I should consider hemodialysis in severe renal failure or overdose scenarios because dabigatran is dialyzable, acknowledging that clinical data are limited and redistribution can occur after dialysis; I need to ensure nephrology involvement early if this route is chosen [^1e383c76] [^4e870c53].

> I should double-check the role of PCC and other non-specific agents; evidence for 4-factor PCC in dabigatran-associated GI bleeding is limited and inconsistent, with some cohorts showing no clear benefit and potential harm, so routine PCC is not recommended, though selective use may be considered in life-threatening bleeding when idarucizumab is unavailable, and I must document the rationale if I proceed off-label [^675d729c] [^d1e38440].

> Let me consider special populations; in the elderly, bleeding risk is higher and renal function is often reduced, so I should use lower thresholds for reversal and closer monitoring; in pediatrics, idarucizumab has no established pediatric data, so I should involve pediatric hematology and consider activated charcoal if ingestion was recent, while avoiding use in eGFR< 50 mL/min/1.73 m² where data are lacking [^f29733b9] [^95fa7966] [^dde074d8].

> Next, I should review when and how to resume anticoagulation; for most patients with resolved LGIB and controlled source, restarting dabigatran within about 7 days is reasonable, but I need to coordinate with the treating cardiologist or neurologist to balance thrombotic risk against rebleeding, and in high thrombotic risk scenarios, bridging with LMWH may be considered if dabigatran is held longer, though evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized [^839b153d] [^8965c4f6].

> I need to ensure patient counseling is explicit; patients should stop dabigatran immediately if they see red or black stools and seek urgent care, and I should review bleeding precautions, drug interactions, and renal function monitoring at follow-up, reinforcing that dabigatran increases bleeding risk and that timely evaluation prevents complications [^7581d1ff] [^a87215c8].

> In summary, I should stabilize first, then tailor diagnostics to suspected source, hold dabigatran in most cases, and reserve idarucizumab for life-threatening bleeding that does not respond to initial measures, documenting the rationale and coordinating multidisciplinary care for resumption planning; this approach aligns with contemporary guidelines and labeling while acknowledging evidence gaps that require clinical judgment [^89553c9a] [^75278b28] [^79d59346].

Bloody stool while taking Pradaxa (dabigatran) is a **major bleeding risk** [^f29733b9] and requires **immediate medical attention** [^7581d1ff]. Dabigatran increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding [^9e4c10b5], including severe or fatal events, especially in patients with renal impairment, older age, or concomitant NSAIDs/antiplatelets [^e8c45237]. Stop dabigatran and seek emergency care if you see red or black, tarry stools [^7581d1ff]; idarucizumab is available to rapidly reverse dabigatran in life-threatening bleeding [^79d59346] [^5575b79b]. Routine use of reversal agents is not recommended for non-life-threatening GI bleeding [^d1e38440]; management is supportive, with endoscopy as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of bloody stool on pradaxa

Bloody stool (hematochezia or melena) while taking Pradaxa is a **serious adverse event** indicating significant gastrointestinal bleeding [^f29733b9]. This is a known risk with dabigatran, as highlighted in the FDA boxed warning and clinical trials [^de2ca8f1] [^f29733b9].

---

## Incidence and risk factors

- **Incidence**: Clinical trials (e.g. RE-LY) show a higher rate of gastrointestinal bleeding with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily versus warfarin (6.6% vs 4.2% per year) [^f29733b9].
- **Risk factors**: Renal impairment, older age, concomitant NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, and prior GI bleeding increase risk [^e8c45237] [^79d59346].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Patients may present with **bright red blood per rectum (hematochezia)** or black, tarry stools (melena), depending on the bleeding site and severity [^13d47ce0]. Immediate evaluation includes hemodynamic assessment, laboratory tests (CBC, renal function, coagulation parameters), and identification of the bleeding source — typically via upper or lower endoscopy [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### General measures

General measures include **immediate cessation of dabigatran** and supportive care with fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion as needed, and correction of coagulopathy [^79d59346]. Endoscopic evaluation is indicated to identify and treat the bleeding source [^notfound].

---

### Reversal of anticoagulation

- **Idarucizumab**: A specific reversal agent for dabigatran, indicated for life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding [^79d59346] [^5575b79b]. It provides rapid, complete, and sustained reversal of dabigatran's anticoagulant effect [^5575b79b].
- **Hemodialysis**: Considered in cases of severe renal impairment or overdose, though clinical experience is limited [^1e383c76] [^4e870c53].
- **Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC)**: May be considered if idarucizumab is unavailable or contraindicated, but evidence is limited [^675d729c].

---

### Endoscopic management

Endoscopic therapy (e.g. injection, clipping, thermal coagulation) is **effective for controlling GI bleeding** and is recommended when a bleeding source is identified [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures and patient counseling

- **Patient counseling**: Patients should be informed about bleeding signs (red or black stools, easy bruising, excessive bleeding) and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if these occur [^7581d1ff] [^a87215c8].
- **Renal function monitoring**: Regular renal function assessment is essential, with dose adjustments or discontinuation if renal impairment develops [^e8c45237] [^dd154387].
- **Medication review**: Avoid concomitant NSAIDs and antiplatelet agents when possible, and review all medications for interactions [^e8c45237] [^7581d1ff].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

The prognosis depends on bleeding severity, comorbidities, and timeliness of intervention. Most patients recover with appropriate management, but **severe or recurrent bleeding** can lead to significant morbidity and mortality [^13d47ce0].

---

Bloody stool while taking Pradaxa is a **serious bleeding event** that requires immediate medical attention. Management includes stopping dabigatran, supportive care, and targeted reversal with idarucizumab when indicated [^79d59346]. Patient education and renal monitoring are key to prevention and early detection [^7581d1ff].

### What is the role of hemodialysis for dabigatran-associated major bleeding? [^4fa71939]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

A 70-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation who is being anticoagulated with dabigatran etexilate presents to the emergency room with melena. He reports taking his most recent dose of dabigatran more than 2 hours ago. On examination, he is hypotensive and tachycardic, and he continues to have melanotic stools. Laboratory testing reveals a calculated creatinine clearance of 15 mL/min, a prothrombin time of 16.5 seconds (reference range: 11.8-15.2 seconds), an international normalized ratio of 1.2 (reference range: 0.9-1.2), and an activated partial thromboplastin time of 50 seconds (reference range: 22.2-33.0 seconds). You are asked by the emergency medicine physician whether hemodialysis should be considered to decrease the patient's plasma dabigatran level.

Treatment of VTE in Pediatric Patients

The safety of PRADAXA in the treatment of VTE in pediatric patients was studied in one phase III trial (DIVERSITY). The DIVERSITY study was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group trial comparing PRADAXA with standard of care – SOC (vitamin K antagonists, low molecular weight heparin, or fondaparinux). There were 266 pediatric patients who received study treatment, 176 patients treated with PRADAXA and 90 patients treated with SOC. Patients on PRADAXA received age- and weight-adjusted dosages of an age-appropriate formulation of PRADAXA (capsules, pellets, or oral solution) twice daily.

Patients had a median age of 14 years (range: 0-17 years), 92% were white, and half the patients were male (50%). Following at least 5 days of parenteral anticoagulant therapy, the median duration of treatment with PRADAXA was 85 days (range: 1-105). Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 50 mL/min/1.73m2were excluded from the trial.

Bleeding

Data on adjudicated major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding and minor bleeding events, for the PRADAXA group and the SOC group in the DIVERSITY study, are reported in Table 9. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to first major bleeding event.

Site-specific bleeding rates were comparable between the two arms, with the exception of the rate of any gastrointestinal bleeds (5.7% in PRADAXA arm vs 1.8% in SOC arm).

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions for patients on PRADAXA and SOC was 32% and 12%, respectively, with the following occurring in ≥ 5% of patients taking PRADAXA: dyspepsia (including term gastro-esophageal reflux disease, gastric pH decreased and esophagitis) in 9% (vs 2%), upper abdominal pain in 5% (vs 1%), vomiting in 8% (vs 2%), nausea 5% (vs 4%), and diarrhea 5% (vs 1%).

10 OVERDOSAGE

Accidental overdose may lead to hemorrhagic complications. In the event of hemorrhagic complications, initiate appropriate clinical support, discontinue treatment with PRADAXA, and investigate the source of bleeding. A specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) is available for adult patients.

Dabigatran is primarily eliminated by the kidneys with a low plasma protein binding of approximately 35%. Hemodialysis can remove dabigatran; however, data supporting this approach are limited. Using a high-flux dialyzer, blood flow rate of 200 mL/min, and dialysate flow rate of 700 mL/min, approximately 49% of total dabigatran can be cleared from plasma over 4 hours. At the same dialysate flow rate, approximately 57% can be cleared using a dialyzer blood flow rate of 300 mL/min, with no appreciable increase in clearance observed at higher blood flow rates. Upon cessation of hemodialysis, a redistribution effect of approximately 7% to 15% is seen. The effect of dialysis on dabigatran's plasma concentration would be expected to vary based on patient specific characteristics. Measurement of aPTT or ECT may help guide therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including PRADAXA, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. If PRADAXA Capsules is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant and restart PRADAXA Capsules as soon as medically appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.6, 2.7, 2.8)].

5.2 Risk of Bleeding

PRADAXA increases the risk of bleeding and can cause significant and, sometimes, fatal bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss (e.g., a drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit or hypotension). Discontinue PRADAXA Capsules in patients with active pathological bleeding [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Risk factors for bleeding include the concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anti-platelet agents, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs). PRADAXA's anticoagulant activity and half-life are increased in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect

In adults, a specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) for PRADAXA is available when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed:

For emergency surgery/urgent procedures
In life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding

In pediatric patients, the efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established.

Hemodialysis can remove dabigatran; however the clinical experience supporting the use of hemodialysis as a treatment for bleeding is limited [see Overdosage (10)] . Prothrombin complex concentrates, or recombinant Factor VIIa may be considered but their use has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran. Consider administration of platelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long-acting antiplatelet drugs have been used.

2.8 Discontinuation for Surgery and Other Interventions

If possible, discontinue PRADAXA Capsules in adults 1 to 2 days (CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min) or 3 to 5 days (CrCl < 50 mL/min) before invasive or surgical procedures because of the increased risk of bleeding. Consider longer times for patients undergoing major surgery, spinal puncture, or placement of a spinal or epidural catheter or port, in whom complete hemostasis may be required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

For pediatric patients, discontinue PRADAXA Capsules 24 hours before an elective surgery (eGFR > 80 mL/min/1.73 m2) or 2 days before an elective surgery (eGFR 50-80 mL/min/1.73 m2). Pediatric patients with an eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73 m2have not been studied, avoid use of PRADAXA Capsules in these patients.

If surgery cannot be delayed, there is an increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)] . Use a specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) in case of emergency surgery or urgent procedures when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed in adults. Efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Refer to the idarucizumab prescribing information for additional information. Restart PRADAXA Capsules as soon as medically appropriate.

Treatment of VTE in Pediatric Patients

The safety of PRADAXA in the treatment of VTE in pediatric patients was studied in one phase III trial (DIVERSITY). The DIVERSITY study was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group trial comparing PRADAXA with standard of care – SOC (vitamin K antagonists, low molecular weight heparin, or fondaparinux). There were 266 pediatric patients who received study treatment, 176 patients treated with PRADAXA and 90 patients treated with SOC. Patients on PRADAXA received age- and weight-adjusted dosages of an age-appropriate formulation of PRADAXA (capsules, pellets, or oral solution) twice daily.

Patients had a median age of 14 years (range: 0-17 years), 92% were white, and half the patients were male (50%). Following at least 5 days of parenteral anticoagulant therapy, the median duration of treatment with PRADAXA was 85 days (range: 1-105). Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2were excluded from the trial.

Bleeding

Data on adjudicated major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding, and minor bleeding events for the PRADAXA group and the SOC group in the DIVERSITY study are reported in Table 3. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to first major bleeding event.

Site-specific bleeding rates were comparable between the two arms, with the exception of the rate of any gastrointestinal bleeds (5.7% in PRADAXA arm vs 1.8% in SOC arm).

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions for patients on PRADAXA and SOC was 32% and 12%, respectively, with the following occurring in ≥ 5% of patients taking PRADAXA: dyspepsia (including term gastro-esophageal reflux disease, gastric pH decreased and esophagitis) in 9% (vs 2%), upper abdominal pain in 5% (vs 1%), vomiting in 8% (vs 2%), nausea 5% (vs 4%), and diarrhea 5% (vs 1%).

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Instruct patients to call their healthcare provider if they experience any signs or symptoms of dyspepsia or gastritis:

Dyspepsia (upset stomach), burning, or nausea
Abdominal pain or discomfort
Epigastric discomfort, GERD (gastric indigestion)

[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]

Invasive or Surgical Procedures

Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider that they are taking PRADAXA before any invasive procedure (including dental procedures) is scheduled [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)] .

Concomitant Medications

Ask patients to list all prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or dietary supplements they are taking or plan to take so their healthcare provider knows about other treatments that may affect bleeding risk (e.g., aspirin or NSAIDs) or dabigatran exposure (e.g., dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.5)] .

Prosthetic Heart Valves

Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they will have or have had surgery to place a prosthetic heart valve [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] .

Allergic Reactions

Advise adult patients and caregivers that some adults taking PRADAXA have developed symptoms of an allergic reaction. Advise adult patients or caregivers to inform their healthcare provider if they or their child develop symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as hives, rash, or itching. Advise adult patients or caregivers to seek emergency medical attention if they or their child develop chest pain or tightness, swelling of the face or tongue, trouble breathing or wheezing, or feeling dizzy or faint.

Pregnancy

Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with PRADAXA Capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] .

5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including PRADAXA, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. If PRADAXA Oral Pellets are discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant and restart PRADAXA Oral Pellets as soon as medically appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.5, 2.6, 2.7)].

5.2 Risk of Bleeding

PRADAXA increases the risk of bleeding and can cause significant and, sometimes, fatal bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss (e.g., a drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit or hypotension). Discontinue PRADAXA Oral Pellets in patients with active pathological bleeding [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Risk factors for bleeding include the concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anti-platelet agents, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs). PRADAXA's anticoagulant activity and half-life are increased in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect

Hemodialysis can remove dabigatran; however the clinical experience supporting the use of hemodialysis as a treatment for bleeding is limited [see Overdosage (10)] . Prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant Factor VIIa may be considered but their use has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran. Consider administration of platelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long-acting antiplatelet drugs have been used.

In adults, a specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) for PRADAXA is available when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed. In pediatric patients, the efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established.

Metabolism

After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is converted to dabigatran. The cleavage of the dabigatran etexilate by esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis to the active principal dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction. Dabigatran is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of CYP450 enzymes. Dabigatran is subject to conjugation, forming pharmacologically active acyl glucuronides. Four positional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, and 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, and each accounts for less than 10% of total dabigatran in plasma.

Specific Populations

Pediatric Patients

The pharmacokinetics of dabigatran was characterized in two clinical studies (DIVERSITY and Study 2) following multiple doses in pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years old. In pediatric patients taking age- and weight-adjusted dosages of PRADAXA Capsules (aged 8-18 years), the observed geometric mean steady-state trough concentration was 97.9 ng/mL (63.7 to 151 ng/mL, 10thto 90thpercentile) compared to the steady-state geometric mean trough concentration of 59.7 ng/mL (26.3 to 146 ng/mL, 10thto 90thpercentile) observed in adult patients with DVT/PE.

Renal Impairment

An open, parallel-group, single-center study compared dabigatran pharmacokinetics in healthy adult subjects and adult patients with mild to moderate renal impairment receiving a single dose of PRADAXA Capsules 150 mg. Exposure to dabigatran increases with severity of renal function impairment (Table 10). Similar findings were observed in the RE-LY, RE-COVER and RE-NOVATE II trials.

Hepatic Impairment

Administration of PRADAXA Capsules in adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed a large inter-subject variability, but no evidence of a consistent change in exposure or pharmacodynamics.

RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies compared PRADAXA Capsules 150 mg twice daily and warfarin for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Patients received 5-10 days of an approved parenteral anticoagulant therapy followed by 6 months, with mean exposure of 164 days, of oral only treatment; warfarin was overlapped with parenteral therapy. Table 4 shows the number of patients experiencing bleeding events in the pooled analysis of RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies during the full treatment including parenteral and oral only treatment periods after randomization.

The rate of any gastrointestinal bleeds in patients receiving PRADAXA Capsules 150 mg in the full treatment period was 3.1% (2.4% on warfarin).

The RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE studies provided safety information on the use of PRADAXA Capsules for the reduction in the risk of recurrence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

RE-MEDY was an active-controlled study (warfarin) in which 1,430 patients received PRADAXA Capsules 150 mg twice daily following 3 to 12 months of oral anticoagulant regimen. Patients in the treatment studies who rolled over into the RE-MEDY study had a combined treatment duration of up to more than 3 years, with mean exposure of 473 days. Table 5 shows the number of patients experiencing bleeding events in the study.

In the RE-MEDY study, the rate of any gastrointestinal bleeds in patients receiving PRADAXA Capsules 150 mg was 3.1% (2.2% on warfarin).

RE-SONATE was a placebo-controlled study in which 684 patients received PRADAXA Capsules 150 mg twice daily following 6 to 18 months of oral anticoagulant regimen. Patients in the treatment studies who rolled over into the RE-SONATE study had combined treatment duration up to 9 months, with mean exposure of 165 days. Table 6 shows the number of patients experiencing bleeding events in the study.

In the RE-SONATE study, the rate of any gastrointestinal bleeds in patients receiving PRADAXA Capsules 150 mg was 0.7% (0.3% on placebo).

### Aspirin-containing antacid medicines can cause bleeding (...) [^617aafa1]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

The next time you reach for a nonprescription drug to treat your upset stomach or heartburn, consider whether you should use one of the many antacids that don’t have aspirin. Why. Aspirin-containing medicines to treat heartburn, sour stomach, acid indigestion or upset stomach can cause stomach or intestinal bleeding, especially in some people, warns the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. Aspirin is commonly used to reduce pain and fever. It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that can increase the risk of bleeding, including in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. “We’re focusing on bleeding risk specifically with antacid-aspirin products used to treat upset stomach or heartburn. We’re not telling people to stop taking aspirin altogether, ” says Karen Murry, M. D. , Deputy Director of the Office of Nonprescription Drugs at the FDA. Cases of bleeding are rare.

When the FDA reviewed its Adverse Event Reporting System database, it found new cases of serious bleeding caused by aspirin-containing antacid products despite an agency warning in 2009 about such a risk. Some of those patients required a blood transfusion. “Take a close look at the Drug Facts label. If the product has aspirin, consider choosing something else for your stomach symptoms, ” Murry says. “Unless people read the Drug Facts label when they’re looking for stomach symptom relief, they might not even think about the possibility that a stomach medicine could contain aspirin. ”.
- Are 60 or older.
- Have a history of stomach ulcers or bleeding problems.
- Take drugs that reduce the ability of your blood to clot.
- Take steroid medicine, such as prednisone, to reduce inflammation.
- Take other medicines containing NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen or naproxen.
- Drink three or more alcoholic drinks every day.

Warning signs of stomach or intestinal bleeding include feeling faint, vomiting blood, passing black or bloody stools, or having abdominal pain. Those are signs that you should consult a health care professional right away. What if you’ve been taking these products for a long time. “Some people may have been taking aspirin-containing antacid products frequently for a long time. Apart from the bleeding risk, it’s not normal to have frequent or chronic upset stomach or heartburn. You should talk to a health care professional if that’s happening, ” Murry says.

Clinical Myocardial Infarction Events

In the active-controlled VTE studies, a higher rate of clinical myocardial infarction was reported in patients who received PRADAXA Capsules [20 (0.66 per 100 patient-years)] than in those who received warfarin [5 (0.17 per 100 patient-years)]. In the placebo-controlled study, a similar rate of nonfatal and fatal clinical myocardial infarction was reported in patients who received PRADAXA Capsules [1 (0.32 per 100 patient-years)] and in those who received placebo [1 (0.34 per 100 patient-years)].

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

In the four pivotal studies, patients on PRADAXA Capsules 150 mg had a similar incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions (24.7% vs 22.7% on warfarin). Dyspepsia (including abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort) occurred in patients on PRADAXA Capsules 7.5% vs 5.5% on warfarin, and gastritis-like symptoms (including gastritis, GERD, esophagitis, erosive gastritis and gastric hemorrhage) occurred at 3.0% vs 1.7%, respectively.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

In the 4 pivotal studies, drug hypersensitivity (including urticaria, rash, and pruritus), allergic edema, anaphylactic reaction, and anaphylactic shock were reported in 0.1% of patients receiving PRADAXA Capsules.

2.5 Administration

Dabigatran etexilate capsules should be swallowed whole. Dabigatran etexilate capsules should be taken with a full glass of water. Breaking, chewing, or emptying the contents of the capsule can result in increased exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 

If a dose of dabigatran etexilate capsule is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day; the missed dose should be skipped if it cannot be taken at least 6 hours before the next scheduled dose. The dose of dabigatran etexilate capsules should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.

Consider administration with food if gastrointestinal distress occurs with dabigatran etexilate capsules.

2.6 Converting from or to Warfarin

When converting patients from warfarin therapy to dabigatran etexilate capsules, discontinue warfarin and start dabigatran etexilate capsules when the INR is below 2.0.

When converting from dabigatran etexilate capsules to warfarin, adjust the starting time of warfarin as follows:

Adults 

• For CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min, start warfarin 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate capsules.

• For CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min, start warfarin 2 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate capsules.

• For CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min, start warfarin 1 day before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate capsules.

• For CrCl < 15 mL/min, no recommendations can be made.

Because dabigatran etexilate capsules can increase INR, the INR will better reflect warfarin’s effect only after dabigatran etexilate capsules has been stopped for at least 2 days [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Pediatric use information is approved for Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Pradaxa (dabigatran etexilate) capsules. However, due to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.

2.7 Discontinuation for Surgery and Other Interventions

If possible, discontinue PRADAXA Oral Pellets before invasive or surgical procedures because of the increased risk of bleeding. For pediatric patients, PRADAXA Oral Pellets should be stopped 24 hours before an elective surgery (eGFR > 80 mL/min/1.73 m2) or 2 days before an elective surgery (eGFR 50-80 mL/min/1.73 m2). Pediatric patients with an eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2have not been studied, avoid use of PRADAXA Oral Pellets in these patients.

Consider longer times for patients undergoing major surgery, spinal puncture, or placement of a spinal or epidural catheter or port, in whom complete hemostasis may be required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

If surgery cannot be delayed, there is an increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)] . In adults, a specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) is available in case of emergency surgery or urgent procedures when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed. Efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Refer to the idarucizumab prescribing information for additional information. Restart PRADAXA Oral Pellets as soon as medically appropriate.

### Hemorrhagic gastritis with dabigatran in a patient with renal insufficiency [^c7cf8bb8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Dabigatran etexilate is the first oral direct thrombin inhibitor approved in the United States. Unlike warfarin, dabigatran has no known antidote. Providers should be aware of patients that may be at risk for dabigatran coagulopathies and recognize potential treatment options.

Objective

To report a case of hemorrhagic gastritis in a patient with chronic renal insufficiency recently initiated on dabigatran etexilate.

Case Summary

An 85-year-old white man with a known history of hypertension and stage III chronic kidney disease presented to the Emergency Department complaining of dark stools, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain. The patient recently started dabigatran 150mg twice daily for new-onset atrial fibrillation. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy identified non-specific gastritis with hemorrhage. It was determined to be probable using the Naranjo Probability Scale that gastrointestinal hemorrhaging was a result of dabigatran therapy. Fresh frozen plasma was used to reverse the dabigatran-induced coagulopathy.

Conclusion

This case highlights the challenges that providers may face when dealing with life-threatening bleeding in patients receiving dabigatran.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^3713e007]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Target-specific oral anticoagulants—evidence for acute gastrointestinal bleeding indicates increased bleeding risk and limited guidance on management, with a meta-analysis reporting an odds ratio for overall bleeding of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.07–1.97) and no direct evidence to guide management in acute GI bleeding. A reversal agent for dabigatran (idarucizumab) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, reversal agents for other non-vitamin K antagonists are in development, and these antidotes may increase the risk of thrombosis; therefore, a multidisciplinary approach involving hematology, cardiology/neurology, and gastroenterology is necessary when managing patients on anticoagulant medications, particularly if newer target-specific oral agents are involved to optimally balance ongoing bleeding and thromboembolic risks.

### Should dabigatran replace warfarin for stroke prevention in AF? [^31e5d16c]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2011). Low credibility.

Dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa - Boehringer Ingelheim) is an oral anticoagulant that has been licensed in the EU since 2008 for thromboprophylaxis in adults following a hip or knee joint replacement. The marketing authorisation for the drug in the EU has recently been extended to include the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). In theory, dabigatran could offer an advantage to patients who need anticoagulation because, unlike warfarin, its dose does not need to be individually adjusted and its effects do not require regular monitoring through blood sampling. Here we review the evidence for dabigatran in this new indication and consider its place in the management of patients with AF.

### Warfarin and newer agents: what the oral surgeon needs to know [^2038323b]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The new direct oral anticoagulants-dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban- have predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and are alternatives to warfarin. However, many surgeons are wary of these drugs, as there is limited evidence on how to manage bleeding in patients taking them, and only recently has a specific antidote been developed to reverse their anticoagulant effect. Management of the newer agents requires careful adherence to primary measures of bleeding care, knowledge of their mechanism of action, and familiarity with the unapproved and untested reversal strategies that may be required in patients with life-threatening bleeding.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 Adult Trials 

 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation 

The RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant Therapy) study provided safety information on the use of two doses of dabigatran etexilate capsules and warfarin [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The numbers of patients and their exposures are described in Table 2. Limited information is presented on the 110 mg dosing arm because this dose is not approved.

 Table 2  Summary of Treatment Exposure in RE-LY

Drug Discontinuation in RE-LY 

The rates of adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were 21% for dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg and 16% for warfarin. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate capsules were bleeding and gastrointestinal events (i.e., dyspepsia, nausea, upper abdominal pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and diarrhea).

 Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] 

Table 3 shows the number of adjudicated major bleeding events during the treatment period in the RE-LY study, with the bleeding rate per 100 subject-years (%). Major bleeding is defined as bleeding accompanied by one or more of the following: a decrease in hemoglobin of ≥2 g/dL, a transfusion of ≥2 units of packed red blood cells, bleeding at a critical site or with a fatal outcome. Intracranial hemorrhage included intracerebral (hemorrhagic stroke), subarachnoid, and subdural bleeds.

2.1 Important Dosage Information

Dabigatran etexilate is available in different dosage forms and not all dosage forms are approved for the same indications and age groups. In addition, there are differences between the dosage forms with respect to dosing due to differences in bioavailability. Do not substitute different dosage forms (for example, capsules) for oral pellets on a milligram-to-milligram basis and do not combine more than one dosage form to achieve the total dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

2.2 Recommended PRADAXA Oral Pellets Dosage for Pediatric Patients

PRADAXA Oral Pellets can be used in pediatric patients aged 3 months to less than 12 years as soon as they are able to swallow soft food. For the treatment of VTE in pediatric patients, treatment should be initiated following treatment with a parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days. For reduction in risk of recurrence of VTE, treatment should be initiated following previous treatment.

The recommended dosage of PRADAXA Oral Pellets is based on the patient's age and actual weight as shown in the tables below. PRADAXA Oral Pellets is administered twice daily. Adjust the dosage according to age and actual weight as treatment progresses.

Evaluation of the extent of anticoagulation in pediatric patients on PRADAXA Oral Pellets may be accomplished using dTT or ECT, and not INR [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] .

2.3 Dosage Adjustments

Pediatric Patients with Renal Impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of treatment with PRADAXA Oral Pellets. Periodically assess renal function as clinically indicated (i.e., more frequently in clinical situations that may be associated with a decline in renal function) and adjust therapy accordingly. Discontinue PRADAXA Oral Pellets in patients who develop acute renal failure while on PRADAXA Oral Pellets and consider alternative anticoagulant therapy.

Prior to the initiation of treatment with PRADAXA Oral Pellets, estimate the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Schwartz formula, eGFR (Schwartz) = (0.413 × height in cm) / serum creatinine in mg/dL.

Due to lack of data in pediatric patients with an eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2and the risk of increased exposure, avoid use of PRADAXA Oral Pellets in these patients. Treat patients with an eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m2with the dosage according to Tables 1 and 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] .

Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

Table 3 shows the number of adjudicated major bleeding events during the treatment period in the RE-LY study, with the bleeding rate per 100 subject-years (%). Major bleeding is defined as bleeding accompanied by one or more of the following: a decrease in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL, a transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells, bleeding at a critical site or with a fatal outcome. Intracranial hemorrhage included intracerebral (hemorrhagic stroke), subarachnoid, and subdural bleeds.

There was a higher rate of any gastrointestinal bleeds in patients receiving PRADAXA Capsules 150 mg than in patients receiving warfarin (6.6% vs 4.2%, respectively).

The risk of major bleeds was similar with PRADAXA Capsules 150 mg and warfarin across major subgroups defined by baseline characteristics (see Figure 1), with the exception of age, where there was a trend toward a higher incidence of major bleeding on PRADAXA Capsules (hazard ratio 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0 to 1.5) for patients ≥ 75 years of age.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Patients on PRADAXA Capsules 150 mg had an increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions (35% vs 24% on warfarin). These were commonly dyspepsia (including abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort) and gastritis-like symptoms (including GERD, esophagitis, erosive gastritis, gastric hemorrhage, hemorrhagic gastritis, hemorrhagic erosive gastritis, and gastrointestinal ulcer).

Hypersensitivity Reactions

In the RE-LY study, drug hypersensitivity (including urticaria, rash, and pruritus), allergic edema, anaphylactic reaction, and anaphylactic shock were reported in < 0.1% of patients receiving PRADAXA Capsules.

### Rectal bleeding and hemostatic disorders induced by dabigatran etexilate in 2 elderly patients [^6d7d12fd]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To report rectal bleeding associated with hemostatic disorders in 2 elderly patients treated with dabigatran etexilate.

Case Summary

A 79-year-old woman (weight, 69 kg) was hospitalized in a gastroenterology unit for severe rectal bleeding. She had been treated for 2 months with dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily for chronic atrial fibrillation. On admission, her creatinine clearance (CrCl) was 20.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2), prothrombin time (PT) less than 10% (reference range 70-130%), and international normalized ratio (INR) 14.5 (venous blood). Eleven days after admission, hematologic and renal function were normalized and rectal bleeding stopped. An 84-year-old man (weight, 71 kg) was admitted for rectal bleeding with acute renal failure and dehydration that began while he was treated with dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily for atrial fibrillation. On admission, CrCl was 33.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2), PT 13%, and INR 7.53 (venous blood). Dabigatran etexilate was stopped on admission. At the end of the hospitalization, CrCl was 66.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2), PT 54%, and INR 1.53. In both cases, an objective causality assessment revealed that those adverse reactions were probably related to dabigatran etexilate.

Discussion

In these 2 cases of rectal bleeding during dabigatran etexilate therapy, coagulation monitoring showed elevated PT and INR; neither patient had been exposed to vitamin K antagonists. These cases indicate the importance of PT and INR monitoring when using dabigatran etexilate, mainly in patients with a high risk of overdose, such as elderly patients or those with renal function impairment.

Conclusions

It is critical to identify and subsequently manage dabigatran etexilate toxicity because there is no specific antidote to reverse the drug's anticoagulant effects.

### Dabigatran, intracranial hemorrhage, and the neurosurgeon [^3950b06b]. Neurosurgical Focus (2013). Low credibility.

Dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) is a novel oral anticoagulant that has gained FDA approval for the prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. In randomized trials, the incidence of hemorrhagic events has been demonstrated to be lower in patients treated with dabigatran compared with the traditional anticoagulant warfarin. However, dabigatran does not have reliable laboratory tests to measure levels of anticoagulation and there is no pharmacological antidote. These drawbacks are challenging in the setting of intracerebral hemorrhage. In this article, the authors provide background information on dabigatran, review the existing anecdotal experiences with treating intracerebral hemorrhage related to dabigatran therapy, present a case study of intracranial hemorrhage in a patient being treated with dabigatran, and suggest clinical management strategies. The development of reversal agents is urgently needed given the growing number of patients treated with this medication.

Direct oral anticoagulants

Dabigatran is a thrombin inhibitor, whereas rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban are factor Xa inhibitors. Unlike warfarin, DOACs have relatively short half-lives, which may be prolonged in renal failure. For minor AUGIB, it is usually sufficient to withhold DOAC therapy and allow the effect to dissipate; severe AUGIB is challenging and advice should be sought from a haematologist. In the case of life-threatening haemorrhage, idarucizumab has been developed as an antidote for dabigatran,and andexanet for the antifactor Xa inhibitors.

Dabigatran (a novel oral anticoagulant)—pharmacokinetics, laboratory interpretation, and periprocedural considerations indicate it reaches maximum effect 1.25 to 3 hours after ingestion with a half-life of 12 to 14 hours, partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time can be normal in spite of circulating therapeutic levels whereas a normal activated partial thromboplastin time effectively rules out a clinically significant circulating drug level, and timing of discontinuation before an endoscopic procedure is dictated by creatinine clearance because 80% of excretion occurs via the kidneys.

Aripazine (PER977) is under evaluation and binds to UFH and LMWH, factor Xa inhibitors (including edoxaban, rivaroxaban, apixaban) and dabigatran; animal and pharmacodynamic studies showed reversal of edoxaban to 10% of baseline within 10 minutes of delivery. Andexanet alfa has been studied in a phase II trial and shows promise by decreasing anti-Xa activity and reducing plasma concentrations of free apixaban in healthy volunteers.

Anticoagulant therapy

The burden

Anticoagulants are commonly used to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, and hypercoagulable conditions. These drugs are increasingly prescribed worldwide, mostly because of the rising prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation. About 2% of the population in developed countries receives long-term anticoagulation, reaching 8-10% in elderly patients. After decades during which vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the only oral anticoagulation option, the spectrum of oral anticoagulants has been recently broadened by the introduction of new oral anticoagulants, also named direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), as they directly inhibit either thrombin (dabigatran, Pradaxa®, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany) or the activated coagulation factor X (rivaroxaban, Xarelto®, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany; apixaban, Eliquis®, Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY, USA; edoxaban, Lixiana®, Daiichi-Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan). DOACs offer several benefits over VKAs. They are prescribed at fixed doses and their anticoagulant effect is more predictable than that of warfarin, obviating the need for routine coagulation monitoring. Moreover, the rapid onset of anticoagulation (within 1-4 h) and the short half-life of DOACs (9-17 h) make initiation and interruption of therapy considerably easier than with VKAs. The individual DOACs have different pharmacologic properties, and the knowledge of these differences is important in clinical practice (Table 1).

Table 1 
Pharmacodynamic characteristics of novel oral anticoagulants

Management of anticoagulants is a common clinical problem for gastroenterologists. Annually, 10% of patients taking anticoagulants require temporary discontinuation of therapy for surgical or other invasive elective procedures, in many cases represented by gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Furthermore, major GI bleeding represents a serious complication of anticoagulant therapy, with an occurrence ranging approximately from 1-4% per year and a case fatality rate up to 10%. Among patients presenting with acute upper and lower GI bleeding, up to 15% and 32%, respectively take anticoagulants.

The periendoscopic management of patients receiving anticoagulants, for either urgent or elective procedures, is challenging, as the thrombotic and bleeding risks may vary depending on individual circumstances. Practice guidelines from the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) [-] and the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), recently updated, may assist the physician in the decision-making process.

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Following Hip Replacement Surgery

PRADAXA Capsules was studied in 5,476 patients, randomized and treated in two double-blind, active-controlled non-inferiority trials (RE-NOVATE and RE-NOVATE II). The demographic characteristics were similar across the two studies and between the treatment groups within these studies. Approximately 45.3% of the treated patients were male, with a mean age of 63.2 years. The majority of the patients were white (96.1%), 3.6% were Asian, and 0.3% were black with a mean CrCl of 92 mL/min.

Bleeding events for the RE-NOVATE and RE-NOVATE II studies were classified as major bleeding events if at least one of the following criteria applied: fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ (intraocular, intracranial, intraspinal or retroperitoneal bleeding), bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 2.0 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) or more, or leading to transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or red cells, requiring treatment cessation or leading to re-operation.

The RE-NOVATE study compared PRADAXA Capsules 75 mg taken orally 1-4 hours after surgery followed by 150 mg once daily, PRADAXA Capsules 110 mg taken orally 1-4 hours after surgery followed by 220 mg once daily and subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily initiated the evening before surgery for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients who had undergone hip replacement surgery. The RE-NOVATE II study compared PRADAXA Capsules 110 mg taken orally 1-4 hours after surgery followed by 220 mg once daily and subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily initiated the evening before surgery for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients who had undergone hip replacement surgery. In the RE-NOVATE and RE-NOVATE II studies, patients received 28-35 days of PRADAXA Capsules or enoxaparin with median exposure of 33 days. Tables 7 and 8 show the number of patients experiencing bleeding events in the analysis of RE-NOVATE and RE-NOVATE II.

In the two studies, the rate of major gastrointestinal bleeds in patients receiving PRADAXA Capsules and enoxaparin was the same (0.1%) and for any gastrointestinal bleeds was 1.4% for PRADAXA Capsules 220 mg and 0.9% for enoxaparin.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adult Trials

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation

The RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant Therapy) study provided safety information on the use of two doses of dabigatran etexilate capsules and warfarin [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . The numbers of patients and their exposures are described in Table 2. Limited information is presented on the 110 mg dosing arm because this dose is not approved.

Table 2: Summary of Treatment Exposure in RE-LY

Drug Discontinuation in RE-LY

The rates of adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were 21% for dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg and 16% for warfarin. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate capsules were bleeding and gastrointestinal events (i.e., dyspepsia, nausea, upper abdominal pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and diarrhea).

Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

Table 3 shows the number of adjudicated major bleeding events during the treatment period in the RE-LY study, with the bleeding rate per 100 subject-years (%). Major bleeding is defined as bleeding accompanied by one or more of the following: a decrease in hemoglobin of ≥2 g/dL, a transfusion of ≥2 units of packed red blood cells, bleeding at a critical site or with a fatal outcome. Intracranial hemorrhage included intracerebral (hemorrhagic stroke), subarachnoid, and subdural bleeds.

### The acute management of haemorrhage, surgery and overdose in patients receiving dabigatran [^5869d5bb]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

In England and Wales, The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence,and in Scotland the Scottish Medicines Consortium,have recently recommended the anticoagulant, dabigatran, to be considered as an option for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial fibrillation. As prescriptions for dabigatran increase, clinicians will need to be prepared to deal with complications such as bleeding (spontaneous and trauma-related) as well as patients who require semi-urgent or urgent surgery.

The recently published 9th American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guidelinesstate that ‘there is insufficient clinical experience to firmly guide the management of major bleeding, suspected overdose, urgently needed surgery, or urgent invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in patients who are taking this new drug’. These comments offer little solace or guidance to a clinician faced with having to manage one of the above described scenarios. This paper aims to provide practical advice to clinicians on the laboratory investigation and acute management of patients presenting while anticoagulated with dabigatran.

Acute LGIB—anticoagulant reversal and antifibrinolytics: Although most patients with LGIB on vitamin K antagonists are unlikely to require reversal, we suggest reversal of patients who present with a life-threatening LGIB and have an INR substantially exceeding the therapeutic range; for patients on vitamin K antagonists to prevent thromboembolism, 4-factor PCC is preferred to FFP because of the rapidity of INR reduction (Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients on direct oral anticoagulants, we suggest reversal in the setting of a life-threatening LGIB that does not respond to initial resuscitation and cessation of the anticoagulant alone, and targeted reversal agents (idarucizumab for dabigatran and andexanet alfa for apixaban and rivaroxaban) should be used when available if the direct oral anticoagulant has been taken within the past 24 hr (Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). We recommend against administration of antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid in LGIB (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Age adjusted dosing

In age adjusted dosing, patients initially below the age of 80 years start on the 150 mg dose of dabigatran, and those aged 80 or above start on the 110 mg dose. If a person reaches 80 and is still continuing with the 150 mg dose, he or she is then switched to the 110 mg dose. We modelled this regimen in two different ways. Our primary method used the results of a post hoc subgroup analysis,which subdivided people by age. The secondary method used the event rates from the full trial for patients taking either dose.

### Hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade associated with dabigatran use [^a7f211f9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe 2 cases of hemopericardium following treatment with dabigatran.

Case Summaries

A 70-year-old male with a history of dabigatran use presented with cough, fatigue, and bloody stools. The patient had a large hyperdense pericardial effusion caused by accumulation of bloody fluid, leading to hypotension and shock. Approximately 1000 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was drained from the pericardial space. A 77-year-old female was admitted for treatment of pneumonia and atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran was initiated and, after 6 doses, the patient developed abdominal pain, respiratory distress, and shock. She was diagnosed with pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis procedures removed a cumulative total of 2000 mL of bloody fluid.

Discussion

Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor approved for the reduction of stroke and systemic embolism risk in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. In December 2011, the Food and Drug Administration released a statement describing serious bleeding events associated with dabigatran use. According to the Naranjo scale, the cases presented here had probable associations between hemopericardium and dabigatran. While there is no known literature supporting this relationship, there are documented cases of warfarin-induced hemopericardium.

Conclusions

These case reports highlight the potential for dabigatran to cause hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade. Additional reports may better elucidate (or characterize) the risk of dabigatran-induced hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade.

### Dabigatran: review of pharmacology and management of bleeding complications of this novel oral anticoagulant [^a24441da]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Dabigatran (Pradaxa) is a competitive direct thrombin inhibitor approved by the US FDA for prevention of embolic stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran has a pharmacokinetic profile that produces predictable anticoagulation responses, does not undergo CYP 450 metabolism, has few drug-drug and drug-food interactions, and does not require frequent laboratory monitoring of clotting parameters. Clinicians are rapidly prescribing this agent as a replacement for warfarin therapy. However, no therapeutic agent has been accepted to reliably reverse the hemorrhagic complications of dabigatran. As of yet, there is no solid evidence to guide management of bleeding complications; management should start with local control of bleeding when possible and transfusion of pRBCs if needed. Transfusion of FFP would not be expected to help control bleeding. Limited and mixed data exist for transfusion of factor VIIa and prothrombin complex concentrates; these therapies should be considered as well as dialysis, which will increase elimination in patients with life-threatening or closed-space bleeding due to dabigatran. We present an article that reviews the pharmacokinetics, clinical trial literature, and consensus guidelines regarding this novel oral anticoagulant.

### Spontaneous splenic hemorrhage after initiation of dabigatran (pradaxa) for atrial fibrillation [^e3712db0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Ridgefield, CT) is an oral anticoagulant that produces a reliable, dose-dependent anticoagulant effect without the need for routine laboratory monitoring. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor, acting like other members in its class (bivalirudin, argatroban) to impede the clotting process through selective and reversible binding with both free and clot-bound thrombin. Dabigatran anticoagulates rapidly: plasma levels peak 2 hours after absorption, with a half-life that ranges between 12 and 17 hours. Dabigatran was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in October 2010 after it compared favorably with warfarin in a large clinical trial studying its efficacy in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Currently, there is no laboratory test on the market by which a physician can quantify the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran, nor is there any antidote to reverse a life-threatening bleed should it occur. We present a case of a patient with splenic hemorrhagic soon after initiation of dabigatran.

### Management of anticoagulation in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding [^26a68004]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding represents the most common adverse event associated with the use of oral anticoagulant therapy. Due to increasing prescription of anticoagulants worldwide, gastroenterologists are more and more called to deal with bleeding patients taking these medications. Their management is challenging because several issues have to be taken into account, such as the severity of bleeding, the intensity of anticoagulation, the patient's thrombotic risk and endoscopy findings. The recent introduction into the marketplace of new direct oral anticoagulants, for whom specific reversal agents are still lacking, further contributes to make the decision-making process even more demanding. Available evidence on this topic is limited and practice guidelines by gastroenterology societies only marginally address key issues for clinicians, including when and how to reverse coagulopathy, the optimal timing of endoscopy and when and how to resume anticoagulation thereafter. The present paper reviews the evidence in the literature and provides practical algorithms to support clinicians in the management of patients on anticoagulants who present with acute gastrointestinal bleeding.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^675d729c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions.

The only published study presents a serious risk of bias because it lacks a control group. Indirectness of the outcomes is also a significant concern because data on patients with GI bleeding are limited, with missing information concerning specific management. Additional methodological limitations include very serious imprecision as event rates are low and the use of surrogate laboratory rather than clinical outcomes. Notably, the cost of using the drug is high (up to $49,500 at high-dose regimen, with the low-dose regimen costing half as much). Accordingly, the panel could not recommend the routine use of andexanet alfa in patients with GI bleeding. This intervention could be considered in the setting of life-threatening GI bleeding in hospitalized patients who have taken apixaban or rivaroxaban within the past 24 hours.

Reversal of DOACs with PCC.

7. For patients on direct oral anticoagulants who are hospitalized or under observation with acute GI bleeding, we suggest against prothrombin complex concentrate administration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

Summary of evidence.

The literature search identified only 2 cohort studies with comparator arms (no PCC), both of which have limitations. Schulman et al. examined the reversal of dabigatran-associated major bleeding with activated prothrombin concentrate in a small prospective cohort study (N = 14). Among the 5 patients with GI bleeding compared with matched patients (N = 28) from 5 Phase III trials, the “effectiveness” rating was assessed at 24 hours by the treating physicians for GI bleeding. The effectiveness was considered good in 4 patients and moderate in 1, which was not statistically different from the comparator group. Smythe et al. reported that among 28 patients with GI bleeding on dabigatran, 2 received 4-factor PCC, and both (100%) died within 30 days. However, the mortality results were not adjusted for confounding, and the comparator group's death rate is unknown. Several systematic reviews (–) have reported mainly on low-quality, single-arm cohort studies.

Conclusions.

Given the uncertainty of the available evidence, the panel felt they could not recommend routine use of PCC for patients with GI bleeding who have taken DOACs. However, selective use may be clinically justifiable in some patients who have taken DOACs within the past 24 hours with a life-threatening GI bleed.

### Emergency management of bleeding associated with old and new oral anticoagulants [^c8acdf40]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

As major prescribers of oral anticoagulants, cardiologists must be familiar with strategies to manage bleeding, the principal complication associated with all anticoagulants, and to reverse anticoagulant effects in acute-care settings. The purpose of this manuscript is to review currently available information regarding dabigatran and rivaroxaban, the 2 novel oral anticoagulants approved to date in the United States. Further, we suggest reasonable interventions for the clinician faced with a patient who suffers a major bleeding event while receiving one of these agents. Data sources were peer-reviewed publications, US Food and Drug Administration documents in the public domain, and approved US prescribing information for dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto). Strategies for management of bleeding and reversal of anticoagulant effects from warfarin include vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, and prothrombin complex concentrates. For rivaroxaban and dabigatran, appropriate therapies include support and observation, which are likely to be effective for the majority of patients because of the short half-lives of these agents. In severe life-threatening hemorrhage, clotting-factor substitutes may be appropriate in certain situations. Validated protocols specific to each agent remain to be developed.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^814902db]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

DOAC reversal—Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) in patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is addressed as follows: we suggest reversal for the small subset of patients who present with a life-threatening LGIB that does not respond to initial resuscitation and cessation of the anticoagulant alone, and for patients requiring reversal, targeted reversal agents (idarucizumab for dabigatran and andexanet alfa for apixaban and rivaroxaban) should be used when available if the DOAC has been taken within the past 24 hours (Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Evidence cited includes idarucizumab data in RE-VERSE AD where 68.7% of evaluable patients experienced a bleeding cessation within 24 hours, after a median duration of 2.4 hours, with 43 of the 137 patients having a LGIB, and andexanet alfa use in GIB showed in-hospital mortality of 10% compared with 4% with FFP or PCC reversal. At present, there is no role for PCC in reversal of factor Xa inhibitors; in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 case series of 340 patients receiving PCC for DOAC reversal, the pooled proportion of effective hemostasis achieved was 69%.

### Novel anticoagulants: bleeding risk and management strategies [^a701cbea]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To quantify the novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC)-related gastrointestinal bleeding, summarize the management strategies and highlight the knowledge gaps.

Recent Findings

Dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban differ from warfarin with their fixed oral dose and no requirement for routine monitoring. Patients at highest risk of thromboembolism benefit most from NOACs; however, there is a clinically significant risk for NOAC-related gastrointestinal bleeding. The management of NOACs in the acute and elective setting differs from that used with warfarin.

Summary

The magnitude of gastrointestinal risk is still unclear because of paucity of literature. Current risk-stratification models are incomplete and cannot be used solely to predict future risk. The periendoscopic management requires an understanding of drug half-life, metabolism and patient's ability to excrete the agent. Acute bleeding management relies on fluid resuscitation to promote renal excretion of active metabolite, withholding the doses and timely management of endoscopic stigmata. The administration of coagulation factors (fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant activated FVII) is more successful in reversing the activity of the upstream inhibitors of coagulation (rivaroxaban and apixaban) than dabigatran which is a direct thrombin inhibitor.

### Dabigatran etexilate mesylate (Pradaxa) [^05bf7f29]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

The limited available data on PRADAXA use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine drug-associated risks for adverse developmental outcomes. There are risks to the mother associated with untreated venous thromboembolism in pregnancy and a risk of hemorrhage in the mother and fetus associated with the use of anticoagulants (see Clinical Considerations) . In pregnant rats treated from implantation until weaning, dabigatran increased the number of dead offspring and caused excess vaginal/uterine bleeding close to parturition at an exposure 2.6 times the human exposure. At a similar exposure, dabigatran decreased the number of implantations when rats were treated prior to mating and up to implantation (gestation Day 6). Dabigatran administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis up to exposures 8 and 13 times the human exposure, respectively, did not induce major malformations. However, the incidence of delayed or irregular ossification of fetal skull bones and vertebrae was increased in the rat (see Data) .

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Pregnancy confers an increased risk for thromboembolism that is higher for women with underlying thromboembolic disease and certain high-risk pregnancy conditions. Published data describe that women with a previous history of venous thrombosis are at high risk for recurrence during pregnancy.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reaction

Use of anticoagulants, including PRADAXA, may increase the risk of bleeding in the fetus and neonate. Monitor neonates for bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Labor or delivery

All patients receiving anticoagulants, including pregnant women, are at risk for bleeding. PRADAXA use during labor or delivery in women who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia may result in epidural or spinal hematomas. Consider discontinuation or use of shorter acting anticoagulant as delivery approaches [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)] .

Case Summary

A 73-year-old woman, who had received apixaban for therapeutic anticoagulation, presented with hypotension and hematochezia. After resuscitation, diagnostic colonoscopy revealed multiple polyps and old blood within the colonic lumen, but no active bleeding (Fig. 1). Nasogastric lavage and subsequent EGD were unremarkable. During her hospitalization, she was admitted to the intensive care unit with worsening anemia, hypotension, and hematochezia. CT angiogram showed extravasation at the transverse colon (Fig. 1). Formal angiogram was unable to localize the source of bleeding, despite provocation. Given the localization on CT angiography and the patient's clinical deterioration, she underwent hand-assisted segmental transverse colectomy. Surgical pathology was notable for multiple adenomas without dysplasia. The patient had no further episodes of GI bleeding after resection.

### Direct oral anticoagulants and digestive bleeding: therapeutic management and preventive measures [^8f016d07]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) was an important step forward in the management of atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). The DOACs, anti-IIa for dabigatran and anti-Xa for rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban, all have a rapid onset of action and a short half life. There is no need for routine hemostasis testing for treatment monitoring of a DOAC. Compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), DOACs may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (relative risk 1.25). Withholding the DOAC treatment, evaluating the time of the last intake and estimating the patient's renal function are the first steps in the management of gastrointestinal bleeding. For patients without impaired renal function, achieving low coagulation takes around 24 h after the last intake of a DOAC. The use of DOAC antagonists will be helpful in controlling bleeding in the most severe and urgent situations. Idarucizumab is available for clinical use for dabigatran and andexanet is currently being reviewed by drug agencies for rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. It is important to assess the bleeding risk associated with the planned procedure, and the patient's renal function before withholding DOAC therapy for a scheduled intervention. It is mandatory to strengthen the local hemostasis strategies in DOAC-treated patients undergoing a therapeutic endoscopic procedure. Resuming or not resuming anticoagulation with a DOAC after bleeding or a risky procedure depends on the thrombotic and bleeding risk as well as the procedure involved. This discussion should always involve the cardiologist and decisions should be taken by a pluridisciplinary team.

### The new oral anticoagulants: practical management for patients attending for endoscopic procedures [^a936faf0]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Guidelines published by the British Society of Gastroenterology have standardised the care of patients attending for endoscopy procedures, taking aspirin, clopidogrel and warfarin. Two new oral anticoagulant drugs, Rivaroxaban and Dabigatran, are licensed and National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) approved for use in the UK. Unlike warfarin, these drugs do not require regular monitoring, and are at least as effective in preventing stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. As such, they are likely to become popular among patients and clinicians alike. This paper summarises the practical management of patients taking these drugs attending for endoscopic procedures.

Direct thrombin inhibitor reversal.

5. For patients on dabigatran who are hospitalized or under observation with acute GI bleeding, we suggest against the administration of idarucizumab (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

Summary of evidence.

The available evidence addressing this recommendation included 1 cohort study that compared idarucizumab with no treatment and 2 additional cohort studies without a comparator. Singh et al. performed a retrospective cohort study in the United States that included patients hospitalized for dabigatran-associated major nontraumatic GI bleeding or intracranial bleeding. Among those with GI bleeding (159 who received idarucizumab vs 1124 who did not), nonsignificant differences in mortality (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 0.51–3.45) and venous thromboembolism (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.08–1.58) were observed. In the Reversal Effects of Idarucizumab on Active Dabigatran study, Pollack et al. examined patients on dabigatran with multiple causes of acute bleeding, including GI (45.5%) and other patients on dabigatran about to undergo an urgent surgery or procedure. The reversal of dabigatran anticoagulant effect (before and up to 24 hours after the administration of idarucizumab) was assessed by dabigatran-specific coagulation function tests (dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time), and the reduction in the concentration of unbound dabigatran, both indirect measures of the outcome of interest. In a subgroup analysis of 137 patients with GI bleeding, Van der Wall et al. reported 30-day mortality and thrombotic event rates of 11.1% and 3.6%, respectively, among patients receiving idarucizumab.

Conclusions.

Given the limited evidence of benefit and the high cost of idarucizumab, the panel felt it could not recommend routine use of idarucizumab for patients with GI bleeding who have taken dabigatran. However, selective use may be appropriate in patients with a life-threatening GI bleed who have taken dabigatran within the past 24 hours.

Introduction

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been used for almost a decade as an alternative to vitamin K agonists (VKAs) in preventing stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), and for management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) with similar or higher efficacy and decrease in overall bleeding risk. DOACs have a common rapid onset of action, between 30 min and 4 h, and are administered in a fixed dose without the need for drug monitoring or dose adjustment except for renal impairment.Nowadays DOACs represent an important part of new oral anticoagulant drug prescriptions with growing cardiovascular indications. If the patient is eligible, prescription of a DOAC is now recommended in preference to a VKA in the NVAF setting, and is an option in very specific cases of valvular AF. They might also be used as a maintenance antithrombotic strategy after ST-elevation myocardial infarction in patients with low bleeding risk.Dabigatran (a direct thrombin inhibitor), rivaroxaban and apixaban (direct factor Xa inhibitors) are currently the main DOACs used in Europe.

### Idarucizumab for the treatment of hemorrhage and dabigatran reversal in patients requiring urgent surgery or procedures [^7b7a379e]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Idarucizumab is a specific antagonist for dabigatran etexilate (DE). The recent market authorization of idarucizumab in Europe and the USA may reassure prescribers of DE, as it can increase the safety of the emergency management of patients taking this anticoagulant. However, idarucizumab use should be limited to specific indications to avoid unnecessary risks to patients and costs to healthcare systems. Areas covered: The authors provide an overview of idarucizumab development and its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The results of the clinical phase III trial RE-VERSE AD and a review of recent case reports of idarucizumab use in emergency contexts are also discussed. Expert opinion: Although idarucizumab has shown clear efficacy in reversing dabigatran-induced coagulopathy, its overall effects on patient outcome have not been proven. Information regarding the clinical context in which patients on DE are admitted for emergency treatment, and accurate laboratory tests of dabigatran plasma level during reversal may inform selection and help with the follow-up of patients who may benefit from idarucizumab. Idarucizumab should be integrated into protocol for the emergency management of patients on DE. Furthermore, the benefit of idarucizumab in specific indications such as acute ischemic stroke should be investigated.

### Updates in the perioperative and emergency management of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [^a1fd2122]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants: new challenges

Direct thrombin inhibitors, dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa®, Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma GmbH, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany), and direct factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban (Xarelto®, Johnson and Johnson/Bayer HealthCare AG, Leverkusen, Germany) and apixaban (Eliquis®, Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer, Uxbridge, UK), are non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) increasingly used in the treatment of venous thromboembolism, prevention of cerebrovascular embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, and thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. Although the advantages of these new agents include rapid onset (2 to 4 hours) of action, in addition to a predictable anticoagulant effect without monitoring requirements, different clinical conditions can impair their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Despite published management perspectives, strategies are not yet clearly defined for perioperative management in patients treated with NOACs.

Severe LGIB on anticoagulants—narrative guidance states that although most patients can likely be managed by withholding the anticoagulant drug, patients who are having severe hematochezia with signs of hemodynamic compromise may benefit from reversal agents before endoscopic intervention, and that data on the use of reversal agents (such as PCC and targeted reversal agents) compared with withholding the drug alone are needed to determine the appropriate role for these drugs.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^81db447f]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is used for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism. As OAC use is so widespread, emergency physicians are likely to encounter patients on anticoagulant therapy in the emergency department (ED) on a regular basis, either for the same reasons as the population in general or as a result of the increased bleeding risk that OAC use entails.

The vitamin K antagonist warfarin has been the standard OAC for several decades, but recently, the newer agents dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban and apixaban (collectively, novel OACs, non-vitamin K OACs, or simply ‘NOACs’) have become available for long-term use. Protocols for assessing and managing warfarin-treated patients in the ED are well established and include international normalised ratio (INR) testing, which helps guide patient management. However, the INR does not give an accurate evaluation of coagulation status with NOACs, and alternative tests are therefore needed for use in emergency settings. This paper discusses what information the INR provides for a patient taking warfarin and which coagulation tests can guide the physician when treating patients on one of the NOACs, as well as other differences in emergency anticoagulation management.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^13d47ce0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding epidemiology and definitions—acute overt lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) accounts for ~20% of all cases of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, usually leads to hospital admission with invasive diagnostic evaluations, and consumes significant medical resources. Although most patients with acute LGIB stop bleeding spontaneously and have favorable outcomes, morbidity and mortality are increased in older patients and those with comorbid medical conditions. An individual with acute LGIB classically presents with the sudden onset of hematochezia (maroon or red blood passed per rectum), although in rare cases patients with bleeding from the cecum/right colon can present with melena (black, tarry stools), and hematochezia can be seen in patients with brisk upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Approximately 15% of patients with presumed LGIB are ultimately found to have an upper GI source for their bleeding, and for the purposes of this guideline, we define LGIB as the onset of hematochezia originating from either the colon or the rectum.

Unlike VKAs, DOACs are characterized by a relatively short half-lives, so that their anticoagulant activity usually rapidly wanes-off over 12–24 hours. Consequently, most cases of major GI haemorrhage can be managed by withholding the drug and waiting for the anticoagulant effects to resolve. In hemodynamically unstable patients, acute reversal of anticoagulation may be required. Vitamin K, FFP, and protamine administration are ineffective. Idarucizumab, a humanized antibody fragment that neutralizes the effect of dabigatran, is now currently available as first-line reversal agent in dabigatran patients presenting with life-threatening/ uncontrolled bleeding. Idarucizumab reverses dabigatran-related coagulopathy rapidly (within a few minutes) and persistently (for about 24 hours) in more than 98 % of the patients, with a low thrombotic complication rate (6 % at 90 days). Andexanet alfa, an inactive form of factor-Xa (FXa) that neutralizes circulating FXa inhibitors, has recently been approved as an antidote to apixaban and rivaroxaban in patients with life threatening haemorrhage, but its clinical use is hindered by its limited availability, the prohibitive cost, and safety concern about possible procoagulant effect. 4-factor PCC at fixed dose (2000 IU) may represent an alternative to andexanet alpha, with lower thromboembolic risk, but uncertain efficacy.

### Gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients on anticoagulant therapy and antiplatelet agents [^969c64e7]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Currently, a specific antidote is available only for dabigatran (idarucizumab), although specific antidotes for the other drugs (andexanet alpha, aripazine) are expected to be available soon. Idarucizumab (Praxbind®, Boehringer Ingelheim) is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran, neutralizes its activity with an affinity that is 350-fold higher than thrombin, and it is able to completely reverse its anticoagulant effect within minutes. This drug is now approved in both US and Europe for use in case of life-threatening, uncontrolled bleeding or prior to emergency surgery.

The use of non-specific pro-hemostatic agents, including activated and non-activated PCCs and recombinant factor VIIa, may be considered for life-threatening bleedings associated with direct factor Xa inhibitors until specific antidotes become available. However, supportive clinical data are limited to healthy human volunteers, animal models and in vitro studies, and a few anecdotal accounts. No study has assessed their clinical efficacy and safety in patients with active bleeding.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^3e4e160c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

We conducted systematic reviews of predefined clinical questions and used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach to develop recommendations for the periendoscopic management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs during acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the elective endoscopic setting. The following recommendations target patients presenting with acute GI bleeding: For patients on warfarin, we suggest against giving fresh frozen plasma or vitamin K; if needed, we suggest prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) compared with fresh frozen plasma administration; for patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), we suggest against PCC administration; if on dabigatran, we suggest against the administration of idarucizumab, and if on rivaroxaban or apixaban, we suggest against andexanet alfa administration; for patients on antiplatelet agents, we suggest against platelet transfusions; and for patients on cardiac acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for secondary prevention, we suggest against holding it, but if the ASA has been interrupted, we suggest resumption on the day hemostasis is endoscopically confirmed. The following recommendations target patients in the elective (planned) endoscopy setting: For patients on warfarin, we suggest continuation as opposed to temporary interruption (1–7 days), but if it is held for procedures with high risk of GI bleeding, we suggest against bridging anticoagulation unless the patient has a mechanical heart valve; for patients on DOACs, we suggest temporarily interrupting rather than continuing these; for patients on dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention, we suggest temporary interruption of the P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor while continuing ASA; and if on cardiac ASA monotherapy for secondary prevention, we suggest against its interruption. Evidence was insufficient in the following settings to permit recommendations. With acute GI bleeding in patients on warfarin, we could not recommend for or against PCC administration when compared with placebo. In the elective periprocedural endoscopy setting, we could not recommend for or against temporary interruption of the P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor for patients on a single P2Y 12 inhibiting agent. We were also unable to make a recommendation regarding same-day resumption of the drug vs 1–7 days after the procedure among patients prescribed anticoagulants (warfarin or DOACs) or P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor drugs because of insufficient evidence.
