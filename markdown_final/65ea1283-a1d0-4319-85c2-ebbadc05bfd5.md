## Question

What is the prognosis for NF1?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognosis for neurofibromatosis type 1, including life expectancy, causes of death, cancer risk, morbidity and quality of life, prognostic modifiers, the impact of surveillance, and emerging therapies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how prognosis is framed across mortality, morbidity, and quality of life. Then, I should quantify baseline life expectancy and verify whether newer cohorts are narrowing the gap. Next, I will identify the leading drivers of premature mortality, quantify lifetime cancer risk and age-specific patterns, assess morbidity domains with functional impact, examine genetic and clinical modifiers that stratify risk, review surveillance guidance and therapeutic advances that might alter outcomes, and finally synthesize a balanced prognosis statement with uncertainties and caveats anchored to guideline-level sources.

> Let me first confirm the scope so I do not miss key domains. Prognosis in NF1 must encompass mortality and life expectancy, morbidity from benign and malignant tumors as well as vascular, skeletal, neurologic, and cognitive complications, and the lived experience of uncertainty, pain, and psychosocial burden that shapes quality of life across decades. Hold on, I should verify that consensus sources explicitly frame prognosis this way; ACMG and multidisciplinary reviews emphasize malignancy and cardiovascular disease as major mortality drivers and advocate lifelong, team-based care because the disease touches multiple organ systems and psychosocial health [^117RQtMP] [^114di333] [^115q44ax].

> Now, baseline life expectancy. I need to check whether the commonly cited 8–15 year reduction remains valid in contemporary cohorts. The ACMG resource and ERN Genturis consensus both report an average reduction of approximately 8–15 years, primarily due to malignancy and cardiovascular causes. Wait, let me verify whether regional cohorts suggest narrowing; a UK population–based study observed a median survival of 71.5 years, roughly an 8-year decrement versus local comparators, whereas U.S. death-certificate analyses show mean and median ages at death around 54.4 and 59 years, reflecting ascertainment and certification biases. I should double-check the implication: newer, well-ascertained cohorts suggest some improvement, but a substantial survival gap persists and varies by setting [^117RQtMP] [^115q44ax] [^115q44ax] [^115gzZ8o].

> Next, I should review the primary causes of premature death to avoid overgeneralizing. Malignant neoplasms dominate, with especially high standardized mortality in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and central nervous system tumors in Finnish registry data, and vascular disease is overrepresented among NF1 decedents under age 30 in U.S. analyses. Hold on, I should verify adult cardiovascular risk beyond age 30; a Finnish cohort shows worse post–myocardial infarction survival in NF1, suggesting excess vulnerability even when event incidence is only modestly elevated. In pediatrics, symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas portend higher mortality than in children without symptomatic PNFs, underscoring that internal tumor burden meaningfully modifies risk profiles [^1112auLr] [^115gzZ8o] [^115HEDNn] [^113Qf1en].

> I need to quantify lifetime cancer risk and age distribution so counseling is concrete. Let me confirm the key figures; pooled registry analyses estimate an overall lifetime cancer risk near 60% with a median age of cancer diagnosis around 39 years, and strikingly elevated standardized incidence ratios in childhood that converge toward population baselines with age. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniform risk across sexes and ages; the excess varies by tumor type, age, and sex, so individual risk stratification requires attention to phenotype and age-specific patterns [^1112auLr] [^115q44ax].

> I will now examine tumor-specific risks that drive prognosis. I should confirm the MPNST risk range and typical age at diagnosis; consensus guidelines estimate an 8–16% lifetime risk with most cases arising between ages 20 and 40 and often from pre-existing plexiform neurofibromas, and adults also face NF1-associated high-grade gliomas outside the optic pathway. But wait, what about breast cancer in young women with NF1; multiple cohorts show markedly increased risk under age 40 with worse survival, higher stage at detection without screening, and higher HER2 positivity, arguing for age-appropriate intensified surveillance. I need to ensure I mention treatment-related risk; NF1 cancer survivors exposed to radiotherapy have higher rates of subsequent neoplasms, so radiotherapy should be used judiciously and with informed consent regarding long-term risk [^116znBr6] [^113T5J4J] [^114G7nUA] [^1112auLr] [^112ho33s] [^111PDNpf] [^114vKymi] [^112TMREF].

> Let me consider morbidity and functional impact beyond mortality, because these shape day-to-day prognosis. Plexiform neurofibromas occur in roughly 40–60% of individuals when whole-body MRI is used, leading to neurologic deficits, disfigurement, orthopedic deformities, and airway compromise; in children, symptomatic PNFs correlate with additional tumors, higher surgical needs, and higher mortality, and less extensive resections predict earlier reoperation and higher recurrence in certain locations. I should also confirm non-tumor morbidity that meaningfully affects outcomes: learning and attention difficulties are common, skeletal dysplasia and scoliosis can be functionally significant, moyamoya and other vasculopathies can cause stroke in youth, and pulmonary cystic disease can lead to recurrent pneumothorax with nontrivial case fatality. Finally, I need to check the quality-of-life literature; adults consistently report cosmetic burden, pain, uncertainty, and psychosocial stress as major drivers of impaired well-being, which should be incorporated into prognostic counseling and supportive care plans [^112QEmhz] [^113Qf1en] [^1151E6Q6] [^1158D9tg] [^113wdqje] [^1121z5sg] [^114Re6Hz].

> Now, prognostic modifiers and identification of high-risk subgroups. I should confirm genetic modifiers first; NF1 microdeletion status tracks with earlier onset, heavier tumor burden, and substantially higher MPNST risk, warranting closer surveillance. Hold on, I almost cited missense versus truncating variants for mortality from an NF2 study; that would be a mistake if generalized to NF1, and while genotype–phenotype correlations in NF1 exist, robust NF1-specific mortality stratification by variant class remains limited and heterogeneous. Next, I will examine clinical modifiers; deep head and neck PNFs involving cranial nerve ganglia have higher malignant transformation risk and faster transformation, and prior radiotherapy in NF1 cancer survivors increases subsequent neoplasm risk, both of which should intensify follow-up. Hmm, wait a minute, what about care setting; a specialty-center mortality advantage is well documented in NF2 and plausibly relevant to NF1 given disease complexity, but I should be explicit that the HR 0.34 derives from NF2 data and is being cautiously extrapolated to NF1 multidisciplinary care models rather than asserted as NF1-specific evidence. Finally, sex differences in cancer incidence have been reported in smaller historical NF1 cohorts, but I need to emphasize wide confidence intervals and potential ascertainment bias when using these for individual risk prediction [^113A3jER] [^1124tN5Z] [^112TMREF] [^117MzixM] [^115kfu2Q].

> Next, I should review surveillance strategies and emerging therapies that can modify outcomes. Let me verify guideline recommendations; ERN Genturis advises symptom-driven evaluation for rapid growth, new pain, or neurological change in PN/ANNUBP, with regional MRI and FDG-PET to triage for biopsy or resection, and recommends brain and whole-body MRI at the transition from childhood to adulthood to assess internal tumor burden and screen for occult lesions in selected contexts. I need to ensure I mention therapeutics; MEK inhibitors are now FDA-approved for inoperable symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas and can shrink or stabilize tumors, sometimes facilitating surgery or reducing morbidity, while complete surgical resection with wide margins remains the standard for MPNST and early diagnosis is critical to resectability. Hold on, let's not overstate radiotherapy; given elevated subsequent neoplasm risk and glioma-related late effects in NF1, radiotherapy should be reserved for well-justified indications with careful long-term planning, and clinical trial participation is encouraged as targeted strategies evolve [^115q44ax] [^112QEmhz] [^116znBr6] [^1148EW8X] [^116p5TLi] [^111M5a9u] [^112TMREF] [^114G7nUA].

> I should now synthesize an overall prognosis statement and be transparent about uncertainties. Core prognosis: NF1 confers a multisystem tumor predisposition with an average 8–15 year reduction in life expectancy at the population level, though some contemporary cohorts show median survival near the early 70s, reflecting improved surveillance and care while leaving a persistent gap. Mortality is largely driven by MPNST and CNS tumors, with additional contributions from early-onset breast cancer in women and vascular disease, while the lifetime cancer risk approaches 60% with earlier median age at diagnosis than the general population. Prognosis is heterogeneous and modified by genotype such as NF1 microdeletion, internal tumor burden and location such as deep head and neck PNFs, prior radiotherapy exposures, and access to coordinated specialty care. Emerging optimism is warranted as standardized surveillance, careful risk-adapted therapy, and MEK inhibitors for inoperable PNFs gain traction, but lifelong multidisciplinary management, informed by symptom vigilance and patient-centered quality-of-life support, remains essential to narrow the survival gap and mitigate morbidity [^117RQtMP] [^115q44ax] [^1126bTkS] [^115gzZ8o] [^1112auLr] [^112ho33s] [^113A3jER] [^1124tN5Z] [^1148EW8X] [^114di333].

---

NF1 prognosis is highly variable, with a **reduced life expectancy** [^115q44ax] of about 8–15 years [^1126bTkS], largely due to malignancies and cardiovascular disease [^117RQtMP]. The **lifetime cancer risk** is ~60% [^1112auLr] [^115q44ax], with a 10–13% risk of MPNST — the main cause of early mortality. Most patients develop benign tumors and cutaneous features [^117KPCYv] that affect quality of life [^1121z5sg]; however, severe complications are unpredictable. Prognosis is **worse with NF1 microdeletions** [^113A3jER], symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas [^113Qf1en], or a high tumor burden [^112QEmhz]. Early detection, multidisciplinary care [^114di333], and targeted therapies (e.g. MEK inhibitors) [^1148EW8X] can improve outcomes; however, overall survival remains lower than in the general population [^1126bTkS].

---

## Clinical variability and disease course

NF1 shows marked **clinical variability** [^112ekFAD], even within families, which makes prognosis unpredictable [^117KPCYv]. Common features include:

- **Cutaneous manifestations**: Café-au-lait macules [^116ryUjx], axillary/inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules, and dermal neurofibromas [^112ekFAD].
- **Tumor development**: Plexiform neurofibromas [^117KPCYv], optic pathway gliomas [^112ekFAD], and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) [^1145wWgq].
- **Skeletal abnormalities**: Scoliosis [^112ekFAD], tibial dysplasia, and other bone deformities [^1151E6Q6].
- **Neurological complications**: Learning disabilities [^112ekFAD], attention deficits, seizures, and peripheral neuropathies [^117KPCYv].

The disease course is **progressive** [^112ekFAD], with new manifestations emerging over time; therefore, lifelong monitoring and management are required [^113T5J4J].

---

## Tumor-related prognosis

Tumor development **significantly influences prognosis** in NF1 [^114di333]. The most critical tumors include:

| **Tumor type** | **Lifetime risk** | **Prognostic impact** |
|-|-|-|
| Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) | 10–13% | - Poor prognosis [^1112auLr] <br/> - Major cause of reduced life expectancy |
| Optic pathway gliomas [^117KPCYv] | 15–20% | - Variable prognosis <br/> - Often indolent [^112ekFAD] but can cause vision loss |
| Plexiform neurofibromas [^112ekFAD] | 30–50% | Benign but can cause significant morbidity and disfigurement [^112QEmhz] |

---

MPNSTs are **particularly aggressive** [^1112auLr], with a five-year survival rate of approximately 20–50%, significantly contributing to reduced life expectancy in NF1 patients [^112QM41Z].

---

## Life expectancy and mortality

NF1 is associated with a **reduced life expectancy** compared with the general population [^115q44ax], with studies indicating an average reduction of 8–15 years [^1126bTkS], primarily due to malignancies (especially MPNSTs) [^115gzZ8o] and cardiovascular complications [^115HEDNn]. Median survival for NF1 patients is around 71.5 years, compared to 80 years in the general population [^1126bTkS].

---

## Factors influencing prognosis

Several factors **influence prognosis** in NF1:

- **Genetic factors**: Specific mutations, such as NF1 microdeletions [^113A3jER], are associated with more severe phenotypes and higher tumor burden.
- **Clinical factors**: Presence of symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas [^113Qf1en], optic pathway gliomas [^112ekFAD], and cardiovascular complications [^115HEDNn] worsen prognosis.
- **Environmental factors**: Exposure to radiation and certain chemotherapeutic agents increases the risk of secondary malignancies.

---

## Quality of life and psychosocial impact

NF1 significantly affects **quality of life** because of visible tumors, chronic pain, neurological complications, and psychological distress [^1121z5sg]. Patients often experience anxiety, depression, social isolation, and reduced self-esteem [^114Re6Hz], underscoring the need for comprehensive psychosocial support and counseling [^1112sdw7].

---

## Current management strategies

Management of NF1 centers on **early detection**, regular surveillance, and **multidisciplinary care** [^114di333]:

- **Regular surveillance**: Annual clinical assessments [^113T5J4J], MRI imaging, and ophthalmologic evaluations [^112ekFAD] to detect tumors and complications early.
- **Surgical interventions**: Resection of symptomatic tumors, particularly plexiform neurofibromas [^112ekFAD] and MPNSTs [^1145wWgq].
- **Pharmacological treatments**: MEK inhibitors (e.g. selumetinib) [^116p5TLi] have shown efficacy in reducing plexiform neurofibroma size and improving symptoms [^1148EW8X].
- **Genetic counseling**: Essential for family planning and understanding inheritance patterns [^115TxojY] [^113hryFx].

---

## Recent advances and future directions

Recent advances include the development of **targeted therapies** (e.g. MEK inhibitors) [^1148EW8X] and improved genetic testing methods [^113myTQa], which enhance early diagnosis and enable more personalized treatment strategies. Ongoing research aims to identify additional therapeutic targets and improve long-term outcomes for NF1 patients [^116p5TLi].

---

NF1 has a highly variable prognosis with a **reduced life expectancy** [^115q44ax] driven by malignancies and cardiovascular complications [^115HEDNn]. Prognosis is shaped by genetic, clinical, and environmental factors, and **management requires a multidisciplinary approach** [^114di333]. Recent advances in targeted therapies and genetic testing [^113myTQa] offer hope for improved outcomes.

### Pediatric plexiform neurofibromas: Impact on morbidity and mortality in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^113Qf1en]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

To characterize morbidity, mortality, and surgical outcomes in pediatric patients with symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs), we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from clinical records of surgical history and other neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-related complications. This study focused on children with PNFs seen at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center between 1997 and 2007.

A total of 154 children with NF1 and PNFs were identified. Those with symptomatic PNFs had an increased incidence of other NF1-related tumors (P < .05). Patients with NF1 and PNFs exhibited a higher mortality rate (5/154, 3.2%) compared to patients without or with asymptomatic PNFs (2/366, 0.5%; p = 0.024). The most common morbidities leading to surgeries included neurologic issues, disfigurement, orthopedic concerns, and airway complaints. A less extensive resection was associated with a shorter interval to the second surgery (P < .0019). The highest recurrence was seen in tumors located in the head, neck, and thorax (P < .001).

These findings quantify the increased risk for additional tumors and mortality associated with symptomatic PNFs. Surgical interventions were required in many cases and resulted in added morbidity in some instances. Patients with PNFs were more likely to benefit from surgery when the indications were airway compression or disfigurement.

### Distinctive cancer associations in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^1112auLr]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The study was designed to determine the risk of cancer in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) by cancer type, age, and sex, aiming for unprecedented accuracy by combining two total population-based registers.

A population-based series of patients with NF1 (N = 1,404; 19,076 person-years) was linked to incident cancers recorded in the Finnish Cancer Registry and deaths recorded in the national Population Register Centre between 1987 and 2012. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for selected cancer types. We compared survival of patients with cancer with and without NF1.

In malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and CNS tumors, which are traditionally associated with NF1, we observed SIRs of 2,056 (95% CI, 1,561 to 2,658) and 37.5 (95% CI, 30.2 to 46.0), respectively, and SMRs of 2,301 (95% CI, 1,652 to 3,122) and 30.2 (95% CI, 19.1 to 45.2), respectively. We found an unequivocally increased risk for breast cancer. Specifically, the SIR was 11.1 (95% CI, 5.56 to 19.5) for breast cancer in women with NF1 aged < 40 years; the overall SMR for breast cancer was 5.20 (95% CI, 2.38 to 9.88).

Particularly high overall SIRs were observed in patients with NF1 aged < 15 years: women had an SIR of 87.6 (95% CI, 58.6 to 125) and men had an SIR of 45.6 (95% CI, 28.4 to 68.5). The estimated lifetime cancer risk for patients with NF1 was 59.6%. The 5-year survival of patients with cancer and NF1, excluding nervous tissue cancers, was worse than comparable patients with cancers without NF1.

### Mortality in neurofibromatosis 1: In North West England: An assessment of actuarial survival in a region of the UK since 1989 [^1126bTkS]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a comparatively common autosomal dominant disorder. However, relatively few studies have assessed lifetime risk, and information about the effect of NF1 on mortality remains uncertain. NF1 patients were identified using The North West Regional Family Genetic Register, which covers the 4.1 million people living in North West England, including the regions of Greater Manchester, Cheshire, and Cumbria. Data relating to tumors and malignancies were obtained from The North West Cancer Intelligence Service. Death data for the general North West population were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. We identified 1186 individuals with NF1, of whom 1023 lived within the strict regional boundaries (constituting a region of North West England bound by The Pennines to the east and Irish Sea to the west, excluding the conurbation of Liverpool (Merseyside) and the Wirral peninsula) and 131 had died. MPNST and glioma were found to be the two most common causes of reduced life expectancy among NF1 patients. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, the median survival for NF1 patients was shown to be 71.5 years, with women living approximately 7.4 years longer than men. On average, both men and women lived approximately 8 years less than their counterparts in the general population. The reduction in life expectancy for NF1 patients was found to be much lower (8 years) than the previously estimated 15-year decrease. Limitations relating to the underreporting of NF1 on death certificates were once again highlighted and should be considered in future investigations.

### The use of MEK inhibitors in neurofibromatosis type 1-associated tumors and management of toxicities [^1148EW8X]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome affecting approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals at birth. NF1 is associated with a number of clinical manifestations, including café-au-lait macules, axillary/inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules, skeletal abnormalities, and learning disabilities. Individuals with NF1 are at risk for the development of both benign and malignant tumors throughout their lifetime, with the most common neoplasms being cutaneous neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas (PNs), and optic pathway or other low-grade gliomas.

Although some tumors in NF1 are associated with few to no symptoms, others can have a significant impact on an individual's appearance and/or function. NF1 is caused by the loss of neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 gene. Neurofibromin is a RAS-GAP protein, a negative regulator of RAS signaling. Loss of functional neurofibromin results in activation of the classic RAS-MAPK signaling cascade, cell proliferation, and subsequent tumor formation. NF1 is a classic tumor suppressor disorder, with tumor cells demonstrating biallelic loss of the functional NF1 gene. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1/MEK2) is a kinase in the RAS-MAPK pathway, which phosphorylates and activates MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase).

Overactivation of the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade has been implicated in the development of a number of malignancies; perhaps the most well known is melanoma. In melanoma, inhibition of the signaling pathway components RAF and MEK results in improved outcomes.

This practice resource is designed primarily as an educational resource for medical geneticists and other clinicians to help them provide quality medical services. Adherence to this practice resource is completely voluntary and does not necessarily assure a successful medical outcome. This practice resource should not be considered inclusive of all proper procedures and tests or exclusive of other procedures and tests that are reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. In determining the propriety of any specific procedure or test, the clinician should apply his or her own professional judgment to the specific clinical circumstances presented by the individual patient or specimen. Clinicians are encouraged to document the reasons for the use of a particular procedure or test, whether or not it conforms to this practice resource. Clinicians are also advised to take notice of the date this practice resource was adopted and to consider other medical and scientific information that becomes available after that date. It also would be prudent to consider whether intellectual property interests may restrict the performance of certain tests and other procedures.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function variant in the tumor suppressor gene NF1. It affects approximately 1 in 1,900 to 1 in 3,500 people worldwide. The disorder is associated with an 8–15-year reduction in average life expectancy in both men and women, primarily due to malignant neoplasms and cardiovascular causes.

### Elevated risk for MPNST in NF1 microdeletion patients [^113A3jER]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

An NF1 microdeletion is the most commonly reported mutation in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Individuals with an NF1 microdeletion, as a group, have more neurofibromas at a younger age than the group of all individuals with NF1. We report that NF1 microdeletion individuals also have a substantially higher lifetime risk for developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors than individuals with NF1 who do not have an NF1 microdeletion. This should be taken into account in the medical follow-up of individuals with an NF1 microdeletion.

### Breast cancer in neurofibromatosis 1: Survival and risk of contralateral breast cancer in a five country cohort study [^112ho33s]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The long-term survival of women with NF1 post–breast cancer diagnosis is extremely poor, with a 20-year (delayed entry) survival of only 37% compared with 84% in the non-NF1 familial population of a very similar age at diagnosis. Although the non-NF1 population is matched on breast cancer risk and age, it does not represent what might happen in a population with no additional screening. However, the 5-year survival of 64.9% observed among unscreened patients with NF1 is markedly worse than the 5-year net survival of 79.8–88.5% reported in the general population in the UK, Finland, Italy, Germany, and France. The poor long-term survival in women with NF1 and breast cancer may be attributed to the poor overall life expectancy in NF1, and although breast cancer deaths were relatively rare after 10 years, it is possible that breast cancer treatments may have exacerbated the known increased risks of malignancy and cardiovascular disease, especially post-irradiation.

- **Study limitations**: Tumor pathology and receptor status were not available for all women, reflecting the over 40-year period of ascertainment. No information was available on whether the tumors were detected in screening or due to symptoms. In the NF1 cohorts without additional screening, 60.0% of women were too young at cancer diagnosis to participate in the general population screening programs, which suggests that most of these cancers were symptomatic at diagnosis. The non-NF1 population of family history women was only from one country (UK); however, this was the country in which patients with NF1 had been studied.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1 families with first-degree relatives harbouring distinct pathogenic variants. Genetic counselling and familial diagnosis: what should be offered [^117XBtic]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by pathogenic variants in NF1. Recently, NF1 testing has been included as a clinical criterion for NF1 diagnosis. Additionally, preconception genetic counselling in patients with NF1 focuses on a 50% risk of transmitting the familial variant, as the risk of having a sporadic NF1 is considered the same as the general population.

- **Methods**: 829 individuals, including 583 NF1 sporadic cases and 246 patients with NF1 with documented family history, underwent genetic testing for NF1. Genotyping and segregation analysis of NF1 familial variants were determined by microsatellite analysis and NF1 sequencing.

- **Results**: The mutational analysis of NF1 in 154 families with two or more affected cases studied showed the co-occurrence of two different NF1 germline pathogenic variants in four families. The estimated mutation rate in those families was 3.89×10⁻³, which is 20 times higher than the NF1 mutation rate (~2×10⁻⁴) (p = 0.0008). Furthermore, the co-occurrence of two different NF1 germline pathogenic variants in these families was 1:39, which is 60 times the frequency of sporadic NF1 (1:2500) (p = 0.003). In all cases, the de novo NF1 pathogenic variant was present in a descendant of an affected male. In two cases, variants were detected in the inherited paternal wild-type allele.

- **Conclusions**: Our results, together with previous cases reported, suggest that the offspring of male patients with NF1 could have an increased risk of experiencing de novo NF1 pathogenic variants. This observation, if confirmed in additional cohorts, could have relevant implications for genetic counselling and familial diagnosis.

### ERN GENTURIS tumour surveillance guidelines for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^116znBr6]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

NF1 associated malignancies: malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, high-grade glioma, juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia, and breast cancer.

The typical malignant manifestations associated with NF1 include malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs), high-grade gliomas (HGGs), juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), and breast cancer. Patients with NF1 have an 8–16% lifetime risk of developing MPNSTs at any age; however, it is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20–40 years. Some individuals with NF1 have an elevated risk for MPNST development; these individuals are specified in Table 9.

Clinical assessment should include screening for the following clinical features suggestive of an MPNST: rapid tumour growth, new and persistent substantial pain, new motor deficit/weakness, sensory deficit, sphincter disturbance, swallowing or breathing difficulty, or any changes in tumour consistency. MPNSTs can metastasize widely and are associated with lower overall survival in individuals with NF1 compared to MPNSTs in the general population. Most MPNSTs develop from pre-existing plexiform neurofibromas and are difficult to differentiate from atypical nodular neurofilamentous tumours.

The combination of regional MRI and 18 FDG PET helps in identifying lesions with a high suspicion for malignancy. In some cases, guided biopsy will be needed prior to excision for a diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment for MPNSTs is complete excision with broad margins; however, chemotherapy and radiotherapy might be considered in specific situations.

High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are mainly observed in adults and arise most frequently in the cerebral hemispheres. The course of high-grade gliomas in NF1…

### A systematic review of recent and ongoing clinical trials in patients with the neurofibromatoses [^116p5TLi]. Pediatric Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

The neurofibromatoses comprise three different genetic conditions causing considerable morbidity and mortality: neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis (SWN). This review summarizes recent and ongoing clinical trials involving patients with neurofibromatoses to better understand the state of clinical trial research centered around these conditions and inform areas of need.

- **Methods**: A search was conducted using the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and clinicaltrials.gov databases. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to identify clinical trials focused on patients with NF1, NF2, or SWN completed in or after 2010 and in process as of December 31, 2021. Information was collected using standardized guidelines.

- **Results**: A total of 134 clinical trials were included, with 75 (56%) completed and 59 (44%) in process. For completed trials, 74% (n = 56) involved patients with NF1, and of those based on specific tumors (n = 26, 46%), the majority focused on plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) (n = 12, 46%). For ongoing trials, 79% (n = 47) involve patients with NF1, and of those based on specific tumors (n = 29, 61%), the majority are focused on PNs (n = 13, 45%).

- **Conclusion**: Both recent and ongoing clinical trials have primarily focused on patients with NF1 and the treatment of PNs. This research has led to the first FDA-approved drug for NF1-PN and has changed the management of these tumors, allowing for systemic therapy rather than reliance only on a surgical modality.

### ERN GENTURIS tumour surveillance guidelines for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^112QEmhz]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Plexiform neurofibromas are benign, diffuse, or nodular growing tumors of the nerve sheath, arising in approximately 40–60% of patients with NF1, depending on the use of WB-MRI to identify clinically undetectable plexiform neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas involving the eyelid, orbit, and periorbital structures are labeled orbital and periorbital plexiform neurofibromas and have an incidence of less than 10% in children with NF1. Orbital and periorbital plexiform neurofibromas frequently cause vision loss secondary to deprivational or anisometropic amblyopia as well as glaucoma. They usually lead to aesthetic disfigurement and functional impairment.

At the transition from childhood to adulthood, brain and WB-MRI is recommended to screen for possible brain tumors and to evaluate the internal plexiform neurofibroma tumor burden respectively. Surgery should be considered for symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas, and increased monitoring is recommended. For inoperable symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas in patients with NF1, MEK inhibitors may be considered. Plexiform neurofibromas are associated with an increased risk of malignant transformation to MPNSTs, and an intermediate (premalignant) stage exists between plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs, called ANNUBP. Almost half of the ANNUBPs are palpable lesions, and about 80% cause clinical symptoms. In case of a suspected ANNUBP or MPNST, primary resection is recommended if safe and feasible.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1 [^116ryUjx]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder affecting approximately 1 in 3500 people. Significant advances in understanding the pathophysiology of NF1 have been made in the last decade. While no medical therapies for NF1 are currently available, trials are ongoing to discover and test medical treatments for the various manifestations of NF1, primarily plexiform neurofibromas, learning disabilities, and optic pathway gliomas.

Mutational analysis has become available on a clinical basis and is useful for diagnostic confirmation in individuals who do not fulfill diagnostic criteria or when a prenatal diagnosis is desired. Several disorders may share overlapping features with NF1; in 2007, a disorder with cutaneous findings similar to NF1 was described. This paper addresses the dermatologist's role in diagnosis and management of NF1 and describes the variety of cutaneous and extracutaneous findings in NF1 to which the dermatologist may be exposed.

- **Learning objectives**: After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to discuss the indications and limitations of genetic testing in neurofibromatosis type 1, distinguish common and uncommon cutaneous findings, and recognize the dermatologist's role in diagnosis and management.

### Mortality in neurofibromatosis 1: An analysis using U.S. death certificates [^115gzZ8o]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

Although neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a relatively common autosomal dominant condition, information about its effect on mortality is limited. We used Multiple-Cause Mortality Files, compiled from U.S. death certificates by the National Center for Health Statistics, for 1983 through 1997. We identified 3,770 cases of presumed NF1 among 32,722,122 deaths in the United States, a frequency of 1/8,700, which is one-third to one-half the estimated prevalence.

Mean and median ages at death for persons with NF1 were 54.4 and 59 years, respectively, compared with 70.1 and 74 years in the general population. Results of proportionate mortality ratio (PMR) analyses showed that persons with NF1 were 34 times more likely (PMR = 34.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 30.8–38.0) to have a malignant connective or other soft-tissue neoplasm listed on their death certificates than were persons without NF1. Overall, persons with NF1 were 1.2 times more likely than expected (PMR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.14–1.28) to have a malignant neoplasm listed on their death certificates.

- **Younger age mortality statistics**: The PMR was 6.07 (95% CI 4.88–7.45) for persons who died at 10–19 years of age and was 4.93 (95% CI 4.14–5.82) for those who died at 20–29 years of age.
- **Vascular disease prevalence**: Vascular disease was recorded more often than expected on death certificates of persons with NF1 who died at < 30 years of age (PMR = 3.26, 95% CI 1.31–6.71 at age < 10 years; PMR = 2.68, 95% CI 1.38–4.68 at age 10–19 years; and PMR = 2.25, 95% CI 1.46–3.32 at 20–29 years) but not in older persons.

This study supports previous findings of decreased life expectancy for persons with NF1.

### ERN GENTURIS tumour surveillance guidelines for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^115q44ax]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) affects individuals from birth, predisposing them to multisystem tumour complications from a very young age. The lifetime risk of cancer in patients with NF1 is estimated to be 59.6%, compared to 30.8% in the general population. The median age of cancer diagnosis in patients with NF1 is 39 years. However, the standardized incidence ratio for cancer in children and women under 30 years with NF1 is especially high. The life expectancy of patients with NF1 is generally decreased by 8–15 years, mainly due to malignancies.

Given the potential for tumour development, long-term surveillance is of utmost importance for both children and adults and should be performed by clinicians who understand the condition and can provide lifelong care. New proposals for the care of individuals with NF1 have been developed, as there are several disease-specific issues that differ from the general approach in sporadic tumours but need to be integrated within routine care. It is important not to delay assessment for patients who are at risk of serious complications; monitoring, surveillance, and management of individuals with NF1 require a multidisciplinary approach and specific guidance adapted to the particular risks and natural history of the disease.

Patients with NF1 do not have access to the same level of care in all countries, and treatment varies across different institutions. This guideline aims to improve the quality of care by presenting information to assist healthcare professionals in tumour surveillance and management of individuals with NF1, in an attempt to provide equitable care.

### Family history does not influence stress or major coping styles in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^1164PZsm]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition that affects approximately 1 in 3000 individuals. NF1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition from an affected parent. Approximately 50% of cases are inherited, and 50% are de novo. NF1 is thought to be fully penetrant and has wide inter- and intra-family phenotypic variability. Common signs include, but are not limited to, café-au-lait macules, inguinal freckling, optic glioma, Lisch nodules, neurofibromas, long bone dysplasia, learning differences, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), and increased cancer risk. Due to the varied signs and severity, NF1 is associated with significant uncertainty. This can impact an individual's surveillance, family planning, and mental health. Existing research has demonstrated that individuals with NF1 experience higher levels of stress compared to the general population and other cohorts as assessed by the PSS.

### Health supervision for children with neurofibromatosis [^11246tt4]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 is a multisystem disorder primarily involving the skin and nervous system. Its population prevalence is 1 in 3500. The condition is usually recognized in early childhood when cutaneous manifestations become apparent. Although neurofibromatosis 1 is associated with marked clinical variability, most affected children do well in terms of growth and development. Some features of neurofibromatosis 1 are present at birth, while others are age-related abnormalities of tissue proliferation. These require periodic monitoring to address ongoing health and developmental needs and minimize the risk of serious medical complications.

This clinical report provides a review of the clinical criteria needed to establish a diagnosis, the inheritance pattern of neurofibromatosis 1, its major clinical and developmental manifestations, and guidelines for monitoring and providing intervention to maximize the growth, development, and health of an affected child.

### Nf1 heterozygosity fosters de novo tumorigenesis but impairs malignant transformation [^112apsnh]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Since NF1 patients have a 10% lifetime chance of being ultimately diagnosed with MPNST and the incidence of MPNST is very low in the general population, this leads to the general idea that NF1 patients, harboring an NF1 +/− microenvironment, are more susceptible to this cancer development. In support of this theory, NF1 patients have a worse prognosis compared to sporadic MPNST cases. However, due to its deeper anatomical location, NF1-associated MPNST is typically diagnosed at a later stage compared to non-NF1 patients, which could explain the poorer prognosis of NF1 patients with MPNST and not necessarily because of the NF1 status of the microenvironment.

The consistent experimental and clinical evidence present in this study predicts that the number of MPNST cases in NF1 patients is actually much lower due to the antagonistic role of the NF1 +/− microenvironment, considering the size and number of pNF in NF1 patients. Indeed, one of the major confounding factors in the interpretation of death certificates and cohort studies resides in the lack of data describing precursor lesions of MPNST. It is conceivable that a population with an increased chance of developing benign lesions (i.e. NF1 patients with pNF) is more prone to develop MPNST than the general population (i.e. non-NF1 patients without pNF). To delineate the contribution of NF1 heterozygosity to malignancy, one would have to evaluate the percentage of non-NF1 patients with pNF that ultimately develop MPNST. Unfortunately, most, if not all, MPNST cases, whether from NF1 or non-NF1 patients, are rare.

### Neoplasms in neurofibromatosis 1 are related to gender but not to family history of cancer [^115kfu2Q]. Genetic Epidemiology (2001). Low credibility.

The risk of malignancies among persons with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is higher than in the general population, but the excess risk has not been precisely estimated. The effects of gender and inheritance pattern on cancer risk are unclear. Therefore, we conducted a historical cohort study to determine cancer risk factors by contacting 138 Caucasian NF1 patients originally seen at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) in Houston between 1978 and 1984. A total of 304 patients of all ethnic groups were evaluated at BCM during this period. We successfully located 173 patients, 138 of whom were Caucasian.

We computed standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) using the age-, gender-, and time period-specific rates from the Connecticut Tumor Registry for 2,094 person-years of observation (median follow-up = 16 years). Eleven incident tumors were reported. Females were at a much higher risk of cancer than males (SIR = 5.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7–10.3 and SIR = 0.6; 95% CI, 0.0–3.0, respectively). We found no elevated cancer risk in unaffected first-degree relatives, regardless of whether the proband had cancer or not (SIR = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.6–1.8 and SIR = 1.0, 95% CI, 0.6–1.5, respectively). Our results suggest that malignancy in the proband is not the result of a modifying gene that has a significant impact on general cancer risk.

### International consensus statement on malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in neurofibromatosis [^1145wWgq]. Cancer Research (2002). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome in which affected individuals have a greatly increased risk of developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). These cancers are difficult to detect and have a poor prognosis. Because patients may present to specialists from widely differing disciplines, the association with NF1 is often not appreciated, and there is no cohesive pattern of care.

A multidisciplinary group of 33 clinicians and scientists with specialist knowledge in MPNST and NF1 reviewed the published and unpublished data in this field and distilled their collective experience to produce a consensus summary on MPNST in NF1. The known clinical, pathological, and genetic information on MPNST in NF1 was collated, and a database was established to record information in a uniform manner. Subgroups with a higher risk of developing MPNST were identified within the NF1 population.

The consortium formulated proposals and guidelines for clinical and pathological diagnosis, surgical management, and medical treatment of MPNST in individuals with NF1. A multidisciplinary team approach to the management of this complex disorder is advocated. Progress can be made by adopting the guidelines proposed by this consortium and by widespread dissemination of standardized information. Collaborative research should be promoted with the aim of harnessing advances in molecular genetics to develop targeted therapies for MPNST in people with NF1.

### Nf1 heterozygosity fosters de novo tumorigenesis but impairs malignant transformation [^114opVkA]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal genetic disorder. Patients with NF1 are associated with mono-allelic loss of the tumor suppressor gene NF1 in their germline, which predisposes them to develop a wide array of benign lesions. Intriguingly, recent sequencing efforts revealed that the NF1 gene is frequently mutated in multiple malignant tumors not typically associated with NF1 patients, suggesting that NF1 heterozygosity is refractory to at least some cancer types. In two orthogonal mouse models representing NF1- and non-NF1-related tumors, we discover that an Nf1 +/− microenvironment accelerates the formation of benign tumors but impairs further progression to malignancy. Analysis of benign and malignant tumors commonly associated with NF1 patients, as well as those with high NF1 gene mutation frequency, reveals an antagonistic role for NF1 heterozygosity in tumor initiation and malignant transformation and helps to reconcile the role of the NF1 gene in both NF1 and non-NF1 patient contexts.

### Diagnostic difficulties and possibilities of NF1-like syndromes in childhood [^112Xz5jW]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen's disease, is caused by heterozygous inactivating pathogenic variations in the NF1 gene. NF1 is the most frequent neurocutaneous genetic disorder, with a prevalence of 1–5 per 10,000. It is characterized by an autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance pattern with complete penetrance but very heterogeneous and age-related expressivity. Its most distinctive features affect the skin, skeletal, and nervous systems. NF1 is associated with an increased risk for benign and malignant tumors and can be identified by genetic testing or clinical diagnostic criteria.

The latter were assembled by the NIH consensus development conference in 1987 and are still in use. The recommendation states that a diagnosis of NF1 should be established if the patient fulfills at least two criteria, or it is suspected if an individual meets only one of them:

- **Café-au-lait macules (CALMs)**: ≥ 6 macules (greater than 5 mm in greatest diameter in prepubertal individuals and greater than 15 mm in greatest diameter in postpubertal individuals)
- **Neurofibromas**: ≥ 2 neurofibromas of any type or ≥ 1 plexiform neurofibroma
- **Freckling**: Freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions
- **Optic pathway glioma (OPG)**: Presence of OPG
- **Lisch nodules**: ≥ 2 Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas)
- **Distinctive osseous lesion**: Presence of sphenoid dysplasia or tibial pseudarthrosis
- **First-degree relative with NF1**: A first-degree relative (parent, sibling, offspring) with NF1 as defined by the above criteria

### Associations of clinical features in neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) [^113UDo94]. Genetic Epidemiology (2000). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant disease, exhibits extreme clinical variability. This variability greatly increases the burden for affected families and impairs our ability to understand the pathogenesis of NF1. Recognition of heterogeneity within a disease may provide important pathogenic insights; therefore, we tested clinical data from three large sets of NF1 patients for evidence that certain common features are more likely to occur in some NF1 patients than in others. Clinical information on 4,402 patients with NF1 was obtained from three independent databases.

- **Associations among probands**: We examined associations between pairs of clinical features in individual affected probands. We found associations between several pairs of features: intertriginous freckling and Lisch nodules, discrete neurofibromas and plexiform neurofibromas, discrete neurofibromas and Lisch nodules, plexiform neurofibromas and scoliosis, learning disability or mental retardation, and seizures.

- **Associations in families**: We also examined associations between the occurrence of individual features in affected relatives. We found associations between the occurrence of Lisch nodules, macrocephaly, short stature, and learning disability or mental retardation as individual features in parents and children with NF1.

Associations were summarized as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Our observations suggest that, contrary to established belief, some NF1 patients are more likely than others to develop particular manifestations of the disease. Genetic factors appear to determine the development of particular phenotypes.

### Spontaneous pneumothorax as a clinical manifestation of neurofibromatosis type 1 [^113wdqje]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Spontaneous pneumothorax is painful for patients and can be lethal in 4.6% of cases. It is, therefore, important that clinicians are attentive to the pulmonary manifestations of NF1, which are characterized by lung cysts and bullae. Identifying patients at increased risk of developing SSP is essential, as preventive surgery seems to decrease the risk of new events.

Our case involved a male who met five of the diagnostic criteria for NF1, with pulmonary manifestations including several lung cysts and bullae and at least four incidents of SSP. This should lead to consideration of NF1 as the etiology of pneumothorax incidents. The diagnosis of NF1 was confirmed by genetic testing, showing a pathogenic variant of the NF1 gene. To address a genotype–phenotype correlation between disease-causing variants of the NF1 gene and pneumothorax, genetic testing and screening for pulmonary manifestations in patients with NF1 are recommended for future clinical studies. Clinicians need to be aware that pneumothorax can be a manifestation of NF1.

- **Learning points**:
	- Spontaneous pneumothorax is a clinical presentation of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) caused by lung cysts and bullae.
	- NF1 should be considered in patients presenting with spontaneous pneumothorax.
	- It is of great importance that clinicians are attentive to pulmonary manifestations in patients diagnosed with NF1.
	- Early diagnosis of pulmonary manifestations in patients with NF1 is crucial, as surgical removal of lung cysts and bullae seems to prevent spontaneous pneumothorax.
	- An examination of genotype–phenotype correlation is recommended for future studies.

### Clinical presentation and prognostic indicators in 100 adults and children with neurofibromatosis 1 associated non-optic pathway brain gliomas [^114G7nUA]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Type 1 Neurofibromatosis (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant condition with a significant impact on the nervous system, eye, bone, and skin. NF1 is a tumor suppressor disorder characterized by benign nerve sheath tumors and a predisposition to malignancy. A lack of the NF1 gene product, neurofibromin, arising from gene mutation causes activation of the Ras pathway and unrestrained cell growth. The natural history of NF1-associated tumors differs from the general population; hence, NF1 individuals require specialist assessment and management.

Low-grade brain gliomas are a well-recognized complication of NF1 and may remain indolent over many years; however, a small number of low-grade gliomas transform into more aggressive tumor types. At present, it is not possible to predict clinically or on imaging whether a tumor will remain indolent or undergo high-grade change. Another small subset of patients may present acutely with a high-grade brain tumor without ever having had a low-grade glioma identified. A study by Guillamo et al. looked at brain gliomas in NF1 and identified that extra-optic location, tumors diagnosed in adulthood, and symptoms at diagnosis are associated with higher mortality.

Two decades ago, it was common practice to treat these low-grade tumors aggressively; however, more recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between radiotherapy and subsequent malignant transformation, endocrine sequelae, neurovascular, and cognitive difficulties. The majority of non-optic pathway gliomas in NF1 are indolent and low-grade.

### Preimplantation genetic testing for neurofibromatosis type 1: More than 20 years of clinical experience [^115XQBxA]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Low credibility.

Our study has limitations due to its retrospective design and population size. However, the population size is similar to other studies reporting on preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for a specific indication, and given the two-decade time period this study has covered, the feasibility of a larger prospective study seems very limited.

There are also several strengths to this study. We were able to include all referred couples with the indication for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) to our PGT expert center and performed an in-depth assessment of the patient files, resulting in a complete and detailed overview. Thereby, we provide valuable, disease-specific information which could aid future reproductive counseling of NF1 patients worldwide.

PGT is a successful reproductive option for preventing the birth of NF1-affected offspring. Although acknowledging the limitations of our study, we did not find a clinically or statistically significant difference with in vitro fertilization (IVF) complications in our cohort when comparing NF1-affected females to partners of affected males. Cardiac screening in women with NF1 prior to IVF treatment showed no (previously unknown) contraindications, raising the question of whether this diagnostic step is necessary.

Timely reproductive counseling is important. For several couples, PGT was not possible due to factors such as maternal age, diminished ovarian reserve, or the inability to identify an underlying genetic defect. Also, we observed a non-significant increased rate of male infertility in men affected with NF1, knowledge which could aid couples in opting for adding PGT to an already indicated IVF treatment.

### Young stroke due to vascular anomaly from neurofibromatosis type 1 [^1137Khki]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

The aetiology of stroke in younger individuals often differs from that in older adults. In nearly half of these cases, no cause is established. Every effort should be made to determine a cause, as treatment varies accordingly, and the prognosis with rehabilitation is favorable when compared to older populations. We present a case of pontine infarct in a 43-year-old man due to vascular ectasia associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. Following the stroke, the patient underwent intensive rehabilitation, resulting in a good functional outcome.

### The impact of neurofibromatosis type 1 on the health and wellbeing of Australian adults [^114Re6Hz]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2015). Low credibility.

The complications of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are widespread, unpredictable, and variable; each person's experience of this disorder is unique. However, few studies have addressed the impact of NF1 from an individual's perspective. This qualitative study aims to identify the ways in which NF1 impacts affected Australian adults. Sixty adults with NF1, with a range of disease severity and visibility, participated in a semi-structured interview about how NF1 impacted their life and health. Data were analyzed using grounded theory methodology. Results indicated that NF1 impacts affected adults in five major ways:

- **Cosmetic burden of disease**: The visible manifestations of NF1 can affect self-esteem and social interactions.
- **Learning difficulties**: Many adults with NF1 experience challenges with learning and cognitive functions.
- **Concerns about the risk of passing NF1 to offspring**: There is significant anxiety regarding the hereditary nature of the disorder.
- **Uncertain disease progression**: The unpredictable nature of NF1 progression contributes to anxiety and uncertainty.
- **Pain**: Chronic pain is a major concern affecting quality of life.

Participants identified the aspects of NF1 that bothered them most, creating a hierarchy of NF1 concerns within the cohort. Importantly, mildly affected adults shared many of the same concerns as those more severely affected. This study enhances our understanding of the impact of NF1 in adulthood and augments existing recommendations for the care of these patients.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 [^112ekFAD]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common neurocutaneous condition with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The complications are diverse, and disease expression varies, even within families. Progress in molecular biology and neuroimaging, as well as the development of mouse models, have helped to elucidate the etiology of NF1 and its clinical manifestations. Furthermore, these advances have raised the prospect of therapeutic intervention for this complex and distressing disease.

Members of the United Kingdom Neurofibromatosis Association Clinical Advisory Board collaborated to produce a consensus statement on the guidelines for the diagnosis and management of NF1. The proposals are based on published clinical studies and the pooled knowledge of experts in neurofibromatosis, with experience in providing multidisciplinary clinical and molecular services for NF1 patients. The consensus statement discusses the diagnostic criteria, major differential diagnoses, clinical manifestations, and current strategies for monitoring and managing NF1 complications.

### Clinical presentation and prognostic indicators in 100 adults and children with neurofibromatosis 1 associated non-optic pathway brain gliomas [^115P2sem]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

We have shown that tumours in the thalamus are more likely to be associated with high-grade tumours in NF1. As a result of this finding, heightened surveillance with more frequent imaging should be considered in patients with NF1 who have thalamic involvement. Individuals with tumours in the thalamus, frontal lobes, and cerebellum were more likely to require surgical intervention than patients with tumours in other anatomical locations. At the time, there are no consensus guidelines, and heightened surveillance in this subset of patients may lead to a decrease in morbidity and mortality.

Forty-two percent of patients (n = 42) underwent surgical intervention. Predictors of the requirement for surgical intervention included symptoms that necessitated cranial imaging, and thalamic, cerebellar, and frontal lesions. We identified that 64% of patients requiring intervention had surgery within 2 months, and 91% of patients who needed intervention had surgery within 5 years of tumour detection. Overall, the outcome was very favourable, with 95% survival at 5 years and 92% at 10 years. Sixty-five percent of patients were asymptomatic at follow-up. We did not find an association between the age at tumour diagnosis and the need for surgery, nor was there an association with death; however, there was a trend towards significance, which may reflect the small size of our cohort.

The majority of tumours biopsied were pilocytic astrocytomas, and only five patients (5%) in this cohort developed a high-grade glioma. Our findings are supported by three studies that reported that the majority…

### Involvement of cranial nerve ganglion as an independent risk factor for malignant transformation of head and neck plexiform neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^1124tN5Z]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are confronted with a 10% lifetime susceptibility to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). The majority of NF1-associated MPNST arise from pre-existing plexiform neurofibromas (PNF). Nevertheless, the precise subtypes of PNF susceptible to malignant transformation remain unclear.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included patients with head and neck PNF who underwent surgical treatment at Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital from June 2012 to July 2023. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess risk factors for malignant transformation. Cox proportional hazards regression evaluated the potential effects of variables on the time to malignant transformation.

- **Results**: Nineteen (4%) of the 470 PNF underwent malignant transformation. Deep/proximal PNF involving cranial nerve ganglions are significantly associated with an increased risk of malignant transformation (adjusted OR, 3.10 [1.07 to 9.00]) while the associations with tumor morphology, relationship to adjacent tissues, and demographic parameters was not significant. Ganglion involvement significantly accelerated the time to malignant transformation by 36% (HR, 7.20 [2.33 to 22.28]).

- **Discussion**: The involvement of cranial nerve ganglion is an independent risk factor for the malignant transformation of head and neck PNF. Consequently, patients with this high-risk profile require closer surveillance for malignancies and proactive management of suspicious lesions.

In neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), malignant transformation of internal plexiform neurofibromas carries a poor prognosis, in part because they are not evident clinically. In this issue, Sbidian et al. describe a novel "NF-1Score" equation that employs four easily observable traits to predict the presence of paraspinal neurofibromas. This tool can identify at-risk patients during regular screening to help reduce mortality.

### The neurofibromatoses: When less is more [^114QDZyH]. Human Molecular Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

The study of cancer predisposition syndromes presents unique opportunities to gain insights into the genetic events associated with tumor pathogenesis. Individuals with two inherited cancer syndromes, neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) and neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), develop both benign and malignant tumors. The corresponding genes mutated in these two disorders encode tumor suppressor proteins, termed neurofibromin (NF1) and merlin (NF2), which function in novel ways to regulate cell growth and differentiation. Neurofibromin inhibits cell proliferation, at least in part, by modulating mitogenic pathway signaling through inactivation of p21-ras. In contrast, merlin may act as a membrane-associated molecular switch that regulates cell-cell and cell-matrix signals transduced by cell surface receptors. Significant progress in our understanding of the genetics and biology of NF1 and NF2 has elucidated the roles of these genes in tumor initiation and progression.

### Predictors of the risk of mortality in neurofibromatosis 2 [^117MzixM]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate clinical and molecular predictors of the risk of mortality in people with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), we analyzed the mortality experience of 368 patients from 261 families in the United Kingdom NF2 registry using the Cox proportional-hazards model and the jackknife method. Age at diagnosis, intracranial meningiomas, and type of treatment center were informative predictors of the risk of mortality.

In Cox models, the relative risk of mortality increased 1.13-fold per year decrease in age at diagnosis (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.18) and was 2.51-fold greater in people with meningiomas compared with those without meningiomas (95% CI 1.38–4.57). The relative risk of mortality in patients treated at specialty centers was 0.34 compared with those treated at nonspecialty centers (95% CI 0.12–0.98).

In a separate model, the relative risk of mortality in people with constitutional NF2 missense mutations was very low compared with those with other types of mutations (nonsense or frameshift mutations, splice-site mutations, and large deletions), but the CI could not be well quantified because there was only one death among people with missense mutations.

We conclude that age at diagnosis, the strongest single predictor of the risk of mortality, is a useful index for patient counseling and clinical management, as are intracranial meningiomas. To ensure optimal care, we recommend that people with NF2 be referred to specialty treatment centers.

### Risk and prognosis of myocardial infarction in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1: Evidence of compromised survival [^115HEDNn]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the risk and prognosis of myocardial infarction in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients within a Finnish population-based cohort during the years 1987–2021.

- **Methods**: A cohort of 1,811 individuals with confirmed NF1 was compared to a control cohort of 18,006 individuals matched for sex, date of birth, and municipality. Diagnoses of myocardial infarction and potentially associated risk factors were retrieved from the Finnish Care Register for Health Care and the Causes of Death Register over the years 1987–2021.

- **Results**: We observed 42 NF1 individuals (19 women and 23 men) with myocardial infarction. The hazard ratio (HR) for all was 1.36 (95% CI 0.98–1.88); for women, it was 1.58 (95% CI 0.97–2.57), and for men, 1.24 (95% CI 0.81–1.91). The diagnoses preceding myocardial infarction in NF1 patients did not differ from controls. Disease-specific 5-year survival after hospital admission for myocardial infarction was 69.2% (95% CI 54.8–87.6) in NF1 patients and 85.0% (95% CI 81.0–89.2) in controls, corresponding to a significantly worse prognosis in the NF1 group (HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.16–4.24). NF1-related cancers and sleep apnea often occurred in association with deaths due to myocardial infarction.

- **Conclusion**: NF1 appears to be frequently associated with myocardial infarction and a subsequent significantly poor survival.

### ERN GENTURIS tumour surveillance guidelines for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^113T5J4J]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multisystem genetic disorder that predisposes individuals to the development of benign and malignant tumors. Given the oncogenic potential, long-term surveillance is important in patients with NF1. Proposals for NF1 care and its specific manifestations have been developed but lack integration within routine care. This guideline aims to assimilate available information on NF1-associated tumors, based on evidence and/or expert opinion, to assist healthcare professionals in undertaking tumor surveillance of NF1 individuals.

Guidelines were developed by a group of NF1 experts and patient representatives, conversant with the clinical care of the wide NF1 disease spectrum. A comprehensive literature review was performed on March 18th, 2020. A modified Delphi procedure was used to overcome issues of variability in recommendations for specific national healthcare settings and to address recommendations based on indirect or scarce evidence.

We defined proposals for personalized and targeted tumor management in NF1, ensuring appropriate care for those in need while reducing unnecessary intervention. We also incorporated the tumor-related psychosocial and quality of life impact of NF1. The guideline reflects the care for NF1 in Europe. They are not meant to be prescriptive and may be adjusted to locally available resources at the treating center, both within and outside EU countries.

### Breast cancer in neurofibromatosis 1: Survival and risk of contralateral breast cancer in a five country cohort study [^111PDNpf]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Tumor pathology for the cases included in the delayed entry analysis is presented. The NF1 population had lower rates of in situ disease than the screened non-NF1 group, as might be expected without mammographic screening. The invasive cancers were much less likely to be stage 1 in the NF1 cohorts without screening than in the non-NF1 group (20.5% vs. 59.3%; P < 0.0001). There was also a higher rate of HER2+ cancers at 24.1% among patients with NF1 versus 11.1% among patients without NF1 (P = 0.03). Otherwise, tumors in the NF1 and non-NF1 groups were well matched for age at diagnosis, grade, and ER status. However, of the NF1 cohorts, the more highly ascertained Manchester and Finnish populations had poorer prognosis cancers with higher proportions of HER2+, ER−, and higher stage cancers. Patients with NF1 and ER+ breast cancer had better survival following a median follow-up of 6.1 years since breast cancer, range 0.28 to 18.7 years (ER+ vs. ER−, HR 2.8 [95% CI 1.2–6.8], P = 0.022). Unscreened grade 3 cancers in women carrying NF1 gene defects had the worst 10-year survival at 44.2% (95% CI 29.3–66.9).

### Can the diagnosis of NF1 be excluded clinically? A lack of pigmentary findings in families with spinal neurofibromatosis demonstrates a limitation of clinical diagnosis [^112PfN2f]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

For all living affected individuals in this family, a diagnosis of NF1 could be made by application of the clinical consensus criteria. However, this was only possible for many of them well into adulthood due to both the paucity of pigmentary manifestations and the late onset of visible or symptomatic tumors in most individuals. What was not clinically straightforward was to exclude NF1 in at-risk individuals. This was a major source of anxiety for several family members, who were worried about risks to their offspring of this disabling condition. Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis was considered by IV:5 and his wife due to the burdensome nature of his own and his mother's (III:5) condition, but it was not available when he and his wife were starting a family. After extensive consideration within the family, his two daughters were each tested at birth for the recently identified familial mutation, c.6364+2T > G, which had been found to result in exclusion of exon 33 and a subsequent frameshift resulting in a prematurely terminated protein. They were found to be unaffected.

### Neurofibromatosis 1: Clinical review and exceptions to the rules [^114HvwTE]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder with myriad clinical manifestations. Between 1991 and 1998, 495 adults and children were diagnosed with neurofibromatosis 1 at a specialized neurogenetics clinic in Sydney, Australia. This review establishes the prevalence of the clinical manifestations of neurofibromatosis 1 in these patients and provides guidelines for assessment and management. In addition, we review in detail patients who had unusual presentations and who represent important "exceptions to the rules" of clinical practice.

### Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor: Transformation in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 2 [^115eL1uK]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma with an unfavorable prognosis and limited therapeutic options. MPNSTs can be sporadic but are often associated with neurofibromatosis (NF) 1, usually arising from preexisting neurofibromas. MPNSTs in patients with NF2 have been reported in only exceedingly rare cases, and the mechanisms underlying transformation into an MPNST have not been fully elucidated. Here, we describe the clinicopathological and genomic features of a peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST), with a primary diagnosis of a neurofibroma, as it transforms into a high-grade MPNST in the context of NF2.

### In-hospital clinical features, morbidity, and mortality of patients with neurofibromatosis 1 in France: A nationwide, population-based retrospective cohort study [^114XrFfY]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a multisystem disease that can affect nearly every organ system. The aim of our study was to describe the in-hospital population with NF1 in France. We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study using the French hospital administrative database. A total of 11,425 patients with NF1 (53.4% female, 19,080 person-years) were identified from January 2013 to December 2019.

A total of 23% of the patients had at least one diagnosis of a comorbidity or NF1-associated complication or disease, with the highest incidence in the age group of 10–15 years. Among the cohort, 2,601 (22.8%) had a diagnosis of cancer. There were 366 (3.2%) in-hospital deaths, and we observed a standardized mortality ratio of 4.14 (95% confidence interval = 3.71–4.56), with a higher standardized mortality ratio in women and in the age group of 10–15 years. The standardized incident ratio (SIR) of cancer was 10.3 (95% confidence interval = 9.6–11.1). We observed high SIR values for cancer in childhood, with a decrease toward that of the general population by age 70 years.

High SIRs were observed for NF1-associated cancers: a CNS SIR of 195.4 (95% confidence interval = 172.2–220.9) and a small intestine SIR of 102.9 (95% confidence interval = 71.7–143.2). The study provides a better understanding of the prognosis in people living with NF1.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1: A multidisciplinary approach to care [^114di333]. The Lancet Neurology (2014). High credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a relatively common inherited disorder. Patients have a high predisposition to develop both benign and malignant tumors. Although many manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 affect the nervous system, other organs and tissues can also be affected. Because of the varying features and clinical heterogeneity inherent to this disorder, patients can present to different medical and surgical specialists, and the association of clinical symptoms with neurofibromatosis type 1 might not always be appreciated.

For prompt diagnosis and to provide optimum care, clinicians must be aware of the diverse clinical features of this disorder. A multidisciplinary approach is advocated, entailing a dedicated team of specialists throughout the lifetime of the patient. As our understanding of this disorder deepens through basic laboratory and clinical investigations, swift implementation of new effective treatments becomes feasible.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1 and tumorigenesis: Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic implications [^112wB5j8]. Neurosurgical Focus (2010). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disease characterized by complex and multicellular neurofibroma tumors, and less frequently, by malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and optic nerve gliomas. Significant advances have been made in elucidating the cellular, genetic, and molecular biology involved in tumor formation in NF1.

NF1 is caused by germline mutations of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, generally resulting in decreased intracellular neurofibromin protein levels; this leads to increased cascade Ras signaling to its downstream effectors. Multiple key pathways are involved in the development of tumors in NF1, notably the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. Interestingly, recent studies demonstrate that multiple other developmental syndromes, in addition to NF1, share phenotypic features resulting from germline mutations in genes responsible for components of the Ras/MAPK pathway.

A somatic loss of the second NF1 allele, also referred to as loss of heterozygosity, in the progenitor cell (either the Schwann cell or its precursor), combined with haploinsufficiency in multiple supporting cells, is generally required for tumor formation. Importantly, a complex series of interactions with other cell types in neurofibroma tumorigenesis is mediated by abnormal expression of growth factors and their receptors, and the modification of gene expression. A key example of this process is the recruitment and involvement of the NF1(±) heterozygous mast cell.

### Moyamoya syndrome associated with neurofibromatosis type 1: Perioperative and long-term outcome after surgical revascularization [^1158D9tg]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Children with neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) can present with progressive arteriopathy of the branches of the internal carotid artery consistent with moyamoya syndrome. Clinical symptoms, radiographic evidence of ischemia, and the potential for disease progression may necessitate surgical revascularization to minimize the risk of stroke and progressive neurological deficits. This study aims to evaluate the presentation and surgical outcomes of these patients by reviewing clinical, radiographic, and angiographic data.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted of clinical and radiographic records of all children with NF1 who were diagnosed with moyamoya syndrome and underwent surgical revascularization between January 1988 and April 2012 at Boston Children's Hospital.

- **Results**: During this period, 39 patients (27 female and 12 male, ages 0.2–19.3 years) had both NF1 and moyamoya syndrome, of whom 32 underwent surgical revascularization with pial synangiosis. Of the 32 patients treated by surgical revascularization, 21 (66%) manifested ischemic symptoms and 18 (56%) had radiographic evidence of prior stroke at the time of moyamoya diagnosis. In total, 25 of 32 patients developed neurological symptoms prior to surgical intervention. Only 1 patient presented with hemorrhage. The average age at first surgery was 8.1 years (range 0.5–15.6 years). Perioperative complications in the first 7 days included stroke (n = 2), transient ischemic attack (n = 1), and infection (n = 1). Twenty-two patients had more than 6 months of follow-up, with an average clinical and radiographic assessment incomplete.

### ERN GENTURIS tumour surveillance guidelines for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^112dgKqX]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Discussion

The goal of tumour surveillance is to detect neoplasms before they become symptomatic, and for interventions to have a better chance of being curative or preventative of functional impairment. The proposed recommendations for tumour surveillance for NF1 require a coordinated multidisciplinary approach and significant patient commitment. The guidelines apply to all individuals with NF1. Where appropriate, we adapted recommendations to different age groups, individuals with different types of pathogenic variants in NF1 or to pre-existing medical history that might influence risks for a specific tumour type in NF1. Given age dependent risks, specific recommendations for children versus adults are provided in the guidelines. Furthermore, evidence for age specific recommendations is based on the underlying patient populations in existing studies, rather than on a clearly defined threshold. We used the term 'children' or 'childhood' for ages 0–16 years and 'adults' or 'adulthood' for ages of 18 and older, with a variable transition from childhood to adulthood between 16 and 18 years as applicable to local health care settings. Finally, we discuss the psychosocial support for people with NF1 during tumour surveillance and management. We tackled the issues of living with uncertainty of developing a tumour, during monitoring of a tumour or during and after treatment of a tumour.

While developing the guideline, gaps requiring further research have been identified. In general, the highly variable course of NF1 is well recognised, but detailed knowledge on the course of so

### Symptoms associated with malignancy of peripheral nerve sheath tumours: A retrospective study of 69 patients with neurofibromatosis 1 [^114ArBqG]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder with variable clinical manifestations and an unpredictable course. Plexiform neurofibromas are frequent complications of NF1, and their malignant transformation is the primary cause of mortality in adult patients with this condition.

- **Objectives**: To identify clinical factors associated with the malignant transformation of plexiform neurofibromas.

- **Methods**: Using the database from our neurofibromatosis clinic, we included in a retrospective study all patients with NF1 who had at least one peripheral nerve sheath tumour and underwent surgery or surgical biopsy. We evaluated the predictive values for malignant transformation of three clinical symptoms — pain, enlargement of mass, and neurological symptoms — in association with histological parameters.

- **Results**: Of the 69 patients studied, 48 had at least one plexiform neurofibroma, and 21 had a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour. The enlargement of the tumour had high negative and positive predictive values for malignant transformation, being 0.92 and 0.95 respectively. In multivariate analysis, tumour enlargement was independently associated with malignant transformation (odds ratio 167.8, 95% confidence interval 14.0–2012.1).

- **Conclusions**: From a practical perspective, pain, neurological deficit, and enlargement of an existing peripheral nerve sheath tumour in NF1 should prompt a deep surgical biopsy to rule out malignant transformation.

### Breast cancer in neurofibromatosis 1: Survival and risk of contralateral breast cancer in a five country cohort study [^114vKymi]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Five and 10-year all-cause survival, adjusting for those ascertained with NF1 after breast cancer diagnosis (delayed entry), was observed to be 64.9% (95% CI 54.8–76.8) and 49.8% (95% CI 39.3–63.0) among the unscreened patients with NF1. Using breast cancer–specific survival, the 10-year survival was 64.2% (95% CI 53.5–77.0%), while for the screened non-NF1 familial population, it was 91.2% (95% CI 87.3–95.2%). Kaplan–Meier analysis is shown in Fig. 2, with both the unadjusted and delayed entry curves provided. Tables 1 and 2 indicate that the more highly ascertained Manchester and Finnish populations exhibited poorer all-cause and breast cancer–specific survival. Notably, screened cases from Padova demonstrated a significantly better prognosis than the other four NF1 cohorts combined, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.18 (95% CI 0.04–0.72; P = 0.016). Most importantly, there were no breast cancer deaths in the Padova NF1 population.

The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for the genetic counseling of patients and families undergoing evaluation for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or who have received a diagnosis of NF1. These recommendations are the opinions of a multi-center working group of genetic counselors with expertise in the care of individuals with NF1. They are based on the committee's clinical experiences, a review of pertinent English-language medical articles, and reports of expert committees. These recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management, nor does the use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. They do not displace a healthcare provider's professional judgment based on the clinical circumstances of an individual patient.

### Increased risk for dementia in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^117786JM]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Of the 16 individuals with NF1 and 165 controls with dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or antidementia medication, 10 and 65 died during the follow-up, respectively. Among individuals with NF1, 5 out of 10 deaths were due to dementia or Alzheimer's disease, and these conditions were mentioned in 7 out of 10 death certificates. The corresponding numbers were 21 out of 65 (32%) and 37 out of 65 (57%) among controls.

The survival specific to dementia-related causes of death was 75% among individuals with NF1 and 89% among controls five years after the first observed dementia-related diagnosis or drug purchase. The relative rate of death caused by dementia was 2.42 (95% CI 0.90–6.47) in NF1 compared to controls with dementia or Alzheimer's disease.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1 [^117KPCYv]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2017). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a complex autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutations in the NF1 tumour suppressor gene. Nearly all individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 develop pigmentary lesions, including café-au-lait macules, skinfold freckling, and Lisch nodules, as well as dermal neurofibromas. Some individuals develop skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis, tibial pseudarthrosis, and orbital dysplasia. Brain tumours, including optic pathway gliomas and glioblastoma, peripheral nerve tumours such as spinal neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, are also observed. Additionally, learning disabilities, attention deficits, and social and behavioural problems can negatively affect quality of life.

With the identification of NF1 and the generation of accurate preclinical mouse strains that model some of these clinical features, therapies that target the underlying molecular and cellular pathophysiology for neurofibromatosis type 1 are becoming available. Although no single treatment exists, clinical management strategies include early detection of disease phenotypes for risk assessment and biologically targeted therapies. Similarly, new medical and behavioural interventions are emerging to improve the quality of life of patients.

Although considerable progress has been made in understanding this condition, numerous challenges remain. A collaborative and interdisciplinary approach is required to manage individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 and to develop effective treatments.

### Nf1 heterozygosity fosters de novo tumorigenesis but impairs malignant transformation [^112KjxwJ]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Recently, the advent of next-generation sequencing revealed a high mutation frequency for the NF1 gene in several sporadic cancers that are not typically associated with NF1 patients. In some extreme instances, such as desmoplastic melanoma, the NF1 gene is mutated in up to 90% of the cases. Strikingly, only a single case of desmoplastic melanoma has been reported so far in NF1 patients. One possible explanation could be that the NF1 +/− microenvironment is refractory to malignancy, but this contrasts with the established pro-tumorigenic role of the Nf1 +/− microenvironment in the context of neurofibromagenesis. NF1 is considered a tumor predisposition syndrome, as NF1 patients have an increased risk of developing multiple neoplasms.

This paper reconciles these discrepancies by compiling experimental and clinical evidence favoring a new framework to study the role of NF1 in tumorigenesis in both NF1 and non-NF1 contexts. Briefly, the study discovers that an Nf1 +/− microenvironment accelerates the formation of benign tumors but impairs further progression to malignancy. Analysis of benign and malignant tumors commonly associated with NF1 patients, as well as those with a high NF1 gene mutation frequency, reveals an antagonistic role for NF1 heterozygosity in tumor initiation and malignant transformation. This helps reconcile the role of the NF1 gene in both NF1 and non-NF1 patient contexts.

### Quality of life among adult patients with neurofibromatosis 1, neurofibromatosis 2 and schwannomatosis: A systematic review of the literature [^1121z5sg]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to review the literature on quality of life among adult patients with neurofibromatosis 1, neurofibromatosis 2, and schwannomatosis, and to identify the specific aspects of quality of life that were studied and reported in this population. We also set out to report predictors of quality of life. Published research reports were included if they described quality of life in this population and met methodological quality according to a list of predefined criteria.

Eight studies (7 in NF1, 1 in NF2, 0 in schwannomatosis), conducted between 2001 and 2013, met inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the eight studies was mostly high according to ratings by predefined criteria. Most studies reported that patients with NF experience decreased quality of life when compared to the general population.

Visibility and disease severity were strong predictors of skin-specific quality of life in NF1 patients. However, the majority of findings regarding predictors of quality of life were weak or inconclusive. Given the decreased quality of life in NF patients, it is important to examine more comprehensively the psychosocial factors in this population, especially in patients with NF2 and schwannomatosis. Mind-body interventions that address these domains may provide comprehensive and efficacious long-term treatment.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1: New developments in genetics and treatment [^113myTQa]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most common neurocutaneous syndrome, with a frequency of 1 in 2500 persons. Diagnosis is paramount in the pretumor stage to provide proper anticipatory guidance for a number of neoplasms, both benign and malignant. Loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 gene result in truncated and nonfunctional production of neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor protein involved in downregulating the RAS signaling pathway. New therapeutic and preventive options include tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, interferons, and radiofrequency therapy. This review summarizes recent updates in genetics, mutation analysis assays, and treatment options targeting aberrant genetic pathways. We also propose modified diagnostic criteria and provide an algorithm for surveillance of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.

### Molecular profiles of neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas: Identification of a gene expression signature of poor prognosis [^117Lo7Yz]. Clinical Cancer Research (2004). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder with a complex variety of clinical symptoms. The hallmark of NF1 is the development of heterogeneous benign neurofibromas, which may appear as dermal neurofibromas or plexiform neurofibromas. NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibromas are at risk of developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

To gain further insight into the molecular pathogenesis of plexiform neurofibromas, we employed real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays. These assays were used to quantify the mRNA expression of 349 selected genes in plexiform neurofibromas, compared with dermal neurofibromas and patient-matched malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

Thirty genes were significantly up-regulated in plexiform neurofibromas compared with dermal neurofibromas; none were down-regulated. The up-regulated genes mainly encoded transcription factors, growth factors, secreted proteins, cytokines, and their receptors, suggesting a role of paracrine and autocrine signaling defects in the genesis of plexiform neurofibromas. Additionally, we identified a gene expression profile based on MMP9, FLT4/VEGFR3, TNFRSF10B/TRAILR2, SHH, and GLI1, which differentiated plexiform neurofibromas most likely to undergo malignant transformation.

Our study identified a limited number of signaling pathways that could be involved in plexiform neurofibroma development when altered. Some of the up-regulated genes could serve as useful diagnostic or prognostic markers or form the basis of novel therapeutic strategies.

### Different de novo mutations in the NF1 gene in a family with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^113tijqD]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

The criteria for clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are not sensitive in young children. Recognition is easier when one of their parents has been diagnosed with this condition and the causal mutation is known. We present a case of a girl with isolated café-au-lait spots, whose father was diagnosed with NF1. However, both were found to carry different de novo mutations in the NF1 gene. This possibility has significant implications for the diagnostic process and genetic counseling.

### Current status of sporadic and neurofibromatosis type 1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors [^112QM41Z]. Current Oncology Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive soft tissue sarcomas that rarely occur in the general population but have a lifetime incidence of 8% to 13% in those with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Complete surgical resection is the standard treatment for MPNSTs. Unresectable MPNSTs carry a poor prognosis, and survival appears to be worse in NF1-associated tumors than in sporadic tumors. The response rate of MPNSTs to standard chemotherapeutic agents used to treat pediatric and adult soft tissue sarcomas is unknown and is currently undergoing evaluation in a multi-institutional clinical trial. With an increasing understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of MPNSTs, clinical trials with targeted agents have become available and have established that histology-specific trials in this rare malignancy are feasible. This knowledge, coupled with the availability of preclinical MPNST models, likely will accelerate the development of effective treatments for this malignancy.

### Health supervision for children with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^1151E6Q6]. Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multisystem disorder that primarily involves the skin and peripheral nervous system. Its population prevalence is approximately 1 in 3000. The condition is usually recognized in early childhood when pigmentary manifestations emerge. Although NF1 is associated with marked clinical variability, most children affected follow patterns of growth and development within the normal range. Some features of NF1 can be present at birth, but most manifestations emerge with age, necessitating periodic monitoring to address ongoing health and developmental needs and minimize the risk of serious medical complications. In this report, we provide a review of the clinical criteria needed to establish a diagnosis, the inheritance pattern of NF1, its major clinical and developmental manifestations, and guidelines for monitoring and providing intervention to maximize the health and quality of life of a child affected.

### Psychosocial features of neurofibromatosis type 1 in children and adolescents [^1112sdw7]. Journal of Child Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common neurologic condition associated with a wide variety of developmental deficits that significantly impact children and adolescents. This article aims to document the psychosocial features of NF1 and to report the interventions described to address the needs of pediatric patients with NF1.

A literature review was conducted concerning the social life, mental health, and quality of life (QOL) of children and adolescents with NF1, as well as the psychosocial interventions addressed to this population. Compared to unaffected children and adolescents of the general population, pediatric patients with NF1 have an increased risk of social difficulties, mental health disorders, behavioral and emotional problems, and diminished QOL. Only three articles describe interventions within the NF1 population to address these difficulties.

There is a need to develop and assess psychosocial interventions for patients with NF1.

### Subsequent neoplasms following a primary tumor in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^112TMREF]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Fundamental gaps in knowledge regarding the risk of subsequent neoplasms (SNs) in children with pathogenic neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) variants exposed to radiation and/or alkylator chemotherapy have limited the use of these agents.

- **Methods**: We addressed these gaps by determining the SN risk in 167 NF1-affected versus 1,541 non-NF1-affected 5-year childhood cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and 176 nonoverlapping NF1-affected individuals with primary tumors from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia exposed to radiation and/or chemotherapy. Proportional subdistribution hazards multivariable regression analysis was used to examine risk factors, adjusting for type and age at primary tumor diagnosis and therapeutic exposures.

- **Results**: In the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort, the 20-year cumulative incidence of SNs in NF1 childhood cancer survivors was 7.3%, compared with 2.9% in the non-NF1 childhood cancer survivors (P = 0.003), yielding a 2.4-fold higher risk of SN (95% CI, 1.3 to 4.3; p = 0.005) in the NF1-affected individuals. In the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia cohort, among NF1-affected individuals with a primary tumor, the risk of SNs was 2.8-fold higher in patients with irradiated NF1 (95% CI, 1.3 to 6.0; p = 0.009). In contrast, the risk of SNs was not significantly elevated after exposure to alkylating agents (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.3 to 3.0; p = 0.9).

- **Conclusion**: Children with NF1 who develop a primary tumor are at increased risk of SNs.
