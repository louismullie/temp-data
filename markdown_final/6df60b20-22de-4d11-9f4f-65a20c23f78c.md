## Question

Prolonged paralytic infusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prolonged paralytic (neuromuscular blockade) infusions in the ICU. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical scenario and the key indications for prolonged NMBA infusions. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic options and their pharmacokinetics, including organ failure considerations. Next, I will examine guideline positions and how they have evolved from 2016 to 2023. After that, I need to assess risks, monitoring requirements, and mitigation strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, time-limited protocol and special-population considerations, and close with a balanced conclusion and citations to anchor each step.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indications. Prolonged continuous NMBA infusions in the ICU are typically used to facilitate lung-protective ventilation in moderate-to-severe ARDS, to manage refractory ventilator dyssynchrony, to control intracranial or intra-abdominal hypertension, and occasionally for status asthmaticus or therapeutic hypothermia; the most evidence-rich indication remains early ARDS with PaO2/FiO2 less than 150 mmHg, though contemporary guidance has shifted toward more selective use rather than routine infusion [^111qJBGf] [^111TmEaR] [^111CYPoy].

> I need to check the pharmacologic agents and their properties. Cisatracurium is preferred for prolonged infusions due to organ-independent Hoffman elimination and minimal histamine release; vecuronium and rocuronium are aminosteroids with hepatic/renal metabolism and potential for accumulation, especially in organ dysfunction, and rocuronium may show apparent tolerance with prolonged use; succinylcholine is not used for sustained blockade because of its short duration and phase II block risk with repeated dosing [^114pQjWT] [^114pytAx] [^112CsSvK] [^115oVaeJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about duration; I should verify what constitutes "prolonged". The pivotal ARDS trials used 48-hour cisatracurium infusions, and FDA labeling for cisatracurium supports ICU infusions up to 6 days with relatively rapid recovery upon discontinuation; in contrast, rocuronium and vecuronium infusions beyond 48 hours are associated with prolonged paralysis and ICU-acquired weakness, particularly in multi-organ failure, so "prolonged" beyond 48 hours should be exceptional and tightly justified [^111vvzuS] [^114haNP5] [^113EKDdZ].

> Next, I should review the historical guideline stance. The 2016 SCCM guideline suggested early continuous NMBA for ARDS with PaO2/FiO2 less than 150 mmHg based on three French trials showing reduced mortality and barotrauma without increased ICU-acquired weakness; however, the ROSE trial in 2019 found no mortality benefit and highlighted harms from deep sedation, prompting more selective use and preference for intermittent boluses when possible [^111jN932] [^111CYPoy] [^111TmEaR].

> Wait, let me verify the most current guidance. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends intermittent boluses over continuous infusion for sepsis-induced moderate-to-severe ARDS, and the 2023 ESICM guideline advises against routine continuous NMBA infusion for moderate-to-severe ARDS, emphasizing insufficient evidence for mortality benefit and the risks of deep sedation and immobility; this represents a clear shift from 2016 toward judicious, indication-driven use rather than routine infusion [^111vvzuS] [^117YB3mV] [^111TmEaR].

> I will now examine the major risks of prolonged NMBA therapy. Prolonged paralysis and ICU-acquired weakness are the most consequential, with higher risk for aminosteroids and in multi-organ failure; deep sedation required during paralysis increases delirium and may worsen long-term neurocognitive outcomes; pressure injuries, DVT, and corneal abrasions are additional concerns that require preventive protocols during infusions [^113EKDdZ] [^114BdiCA] [^111Ue4Zp].

> Let me consider monitoring, because I need to ensure we are not overdosing paralysis. Quantitative peripheral nerve stimulator monitoring at the adductor pollicis with a target of one to two twitches or a TOF count of 1–2 is recommended; relying on TOF alone without quantitative assessment is discouraged for continuous infusions; sedation adequacy should be monitored with BIS or EEG surrogates when available, and eye care must be scheduled to prevent corneal injury during paralysis [^115NooqP] [^114BdiCA] [^111Ue4Zp].

> But wait, what if the patient has organ dysfunction or is on interacting drugs. I should double-check for potentiating factors: renal or hepatic failure, acidosis, hypothermia, hypermagnesemia, and concomitant sedatives or antibiotics can prolong NMBA effect; aminoglycosides and magnesium can potentiate blockade, and rocuronium may require dose reductions with volatile anesthetics; in renal failure, cisatracurium's Hoffman elimination is advantageous, whereas vecuronium and rocuronium are more prone to accumulation [^114pQjWT] [^112hWJ7H] [^113EKDdZ].

> Next, I should review mitigation strategies to minimize harm. Use the lowest effective dose titrated to quantitative targets, prefer cisatracurium when feasible, limit continuous infusion to 48 hours when possible, and transition to intermittent boluses as soon as clinically acceptable; implement daily sedation interruption alongside paralysis assessment, early enteral nutrition without holding for paralysis, DVT prophylaxis, and a structured physiotherapy program once paralysis is weaned to reduce atrophy and weakness [^111vvzuS] [^111FeTHQ] [^111NBATm].

> Let me synthesize a practical protocol, and I should confirm each element against guidance. For ARDS with PaO2/FiO2 less than 150 mmHg, consider a 48-hour cisatracurium infusion started early if dyssynchrony persists despite deep sedation and proning, titrating to 1–2 twitches with quantitative monitoring; reassess need daily and transition to intermittent boluses or discontinuation if improving; for other indications, reserve continuous infusion for refractory cases and prefer boluses when feasible; document indication, duration, monitoring, and weaning plan each day [^111jN932] [^111vvzuS] [^115NooqP].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations. In pregnancy, avoid long-term NMBA infusions when possible and prefer cisatracurium or rocuronium if needed; in pediatrics, use minimal effective sedation and avoid routine paralysis, reserving NMBAs for specific indications with careful monitoring; in obesity, be mindful of altered pharmacokinetics and the need for quantitative monitoring to avoid under- or overdosing [^116n1HZq] [^1117s6xL] [^116upXSR].

> I need to ensure reversal and discontinuation are safe. For cisatracurium, spontaneous recovery is usually within 50–60 minutes after stopping; for rocuronium or vecuronium, consider sugammadex for rapid, reliable reversal when needed, recognizing that recent sugammadex exposure can alter rocuronium re-onset and that quantitative monitoring should guide dosing; extubation should occur only after quantitative confirmation of adequate neuromuscular recovery to avoid residual paralysis and respiratory complications [^114haNP5] [^115fEN7E] [^112U8tTg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that continuous NMBA clearly improves mortality in ARDS; I should correct that. The ACURASYS-era data suggested mortality benefit with early 48-hour cisatracurium, but ROSE did not replicate this, and contemporary guidelines emphasize selective use rather than routine infusion; therefore, any decision to continue beyond 48 hours should be exceptional, indication-specific, and accompanied by daily re-evaluation of net clinical benefit versus harm [^111TmEaR] [^111vvzuS] [^117YB3mV].

> In conclusion, prolonged NMBA infusions beyond 48 hours should be the exception, not the rule; when used, they require a strict, indication-driven protocol with cisatracurium preferred, quantitative monitoring, daily reassessment, and aggressive mitigation of harms including early mobility, eye care, DVT prophylaxis, and nutrition; current evidence and guidelines support intermittent boluses over continuous infusion whenever feasible, especially in sepsis-induced ARDS, to balance potential benefits in oxygenation and synchrony against the risks of weakness, sedation-related complications, and prolonged ventilation [^111vvzuS] [^117YB3mV] [^111NBATm].

Prolonged paralytic infusion refers to **continuous neuromuscular blockade beyond 48 hours** in critically ill patients, most often to facilitate lung-protective ventilation in ARDS [^111jN932] or to manage refractory ventilator dyssynchrony [^111TmEaR]. The main risks are **ICU-acquired weakness** [^1125uktn], prolonged paralysis, and delayed recovery, especially with aminosteroids (e.g. vecuronium, rocuronium) [^115cce9z] or in renal/hepatic dysfunction [^115Pbcm6]. Use the lowest effective dose, monitor with **quantitative TOF** [^115fEN7E], and limit duration to ≤ 48 hours when possible; prefer cisatracurium for longer needs due to organ-independent clearance [^114haNP5]. If prolonged blockade occurs, stop the infusion, correct contributing factors, and consider sugammadex for rocuronium/vecuronium reversal [^115fEN7E]; provide eye care, DVT prophylaxis, and early mobilization to reduce complications [^117AfyMr] [^111NBATm].

## Indications for prolonged paralytic infusion

Prolonged paralytic infusion is **indicated in specific clinical scenarios**, including:

- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: Early continuous NMBA infusion (particularly cisatracurium) [^111C6egA] for 48 hours in moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 150) [^111CYPoy] improves oxygenation, reduces barotrauma [^111C6egA], and may reduce mortality [^111CYPoy].

- **Refractory ventilator dyssynchrony**: Persistent patient-ventilator asynchrony despite optimal sedation and ventilator adjustments may necessitate prolonged NMBA infusion [^114BdiCA].

- **Status asthmaticus**: Prolonged NMBA infusion may be required in severe, refractory cases to facilitate mechanical ventilation and reduce dynamic hyperinflation [^111qJBGf].

- **Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP)**: Short-term paralysis may be used to manage elevated ICP, although prolonged infusion is generally avoided due to the risk of ICU-acquired weakness [^1171smiG].

---

## Risks and complications associated with prolonged paralytic infusion

Prolonged paralytic infusion carries **significant risks and complications**, including:

- **ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW)**: Prolonged NMBA exposure, particularly with aminosteroidal agents (e.g. vecuronium, rocuronium), significantly increases the risk of ICU-AW, characterized by prolonged muscle weakness, delayed ventilator weaning, and impaired functional recovery [^113EKDdZ] [^115Pbcm6].

- **Prolonged paralysis and delayed recovery**: Accumulation of NMBA metabolites, particularly in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, can result in prolonged paralysis and delayed neuromuscular recovery [^1125uktn] [^113EKDdZ].

- **Respiratory complications**: Prolonged paralysis increases the risk of respiratory complications, including atelectasis, pneumonia, and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation [^111pdyNw].

- **Neurological complications**: Prolonged NMBA infusion has been associated with critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and myopathy, further complicating recovery and rehabilitation [^1125uktn].

- **Medication errors**: Paralysis can lead to catastrophic outcomes if dosing errors occur, emphasizing the need for meticulous monitoring and safety protocols [^114Lndpm].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

To **mitigate risks** associated with prolonged paralytic infusion, the following monitoring and management strategies are recommended:

- **Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring**: Use quantitative train-of-four (TOF) monitoring to titrate NMBA dosing to the lowest effective level, aiming for 1–2 twitches or a TOF ratio of 0.1–0.2 [^114haNP5].

- **Regular assessment of neuromuscular function**: Daily assessment of neuromuscular function and documentation of recovery progress is essential to identify prolonged paralysis early and adjust therapy accordingly [^notfound].

- **Sedation and analgesia**: Ensure adequate sedation and analgesia during NMBA infusion to prevent awareness and discomfort, as NMBAs do not provide analgesia or sedation [^112CsSvK] [^1117s6xL].

- **Limit duration of infusion**: Whenever possible, limit the duration of NMBA infusion to ≤ 48 hours to minimize the risk of ICU-AW and other complications [^notfound].

- **Use of benzylisoquinolinium agents**: Prefer cisatracurium for prolonged infusions due to its organ-independent clearance (Hofmann elimination) and lower risk of accumulation and prolonged paralysis [^114haNP5].

- **Reversal agents**: Sugammadex can rapidly reverse rocuronium and vecuronium-induced blockade, facilitating faster recovery and reducing the risk of prolonged paralysis [^115fEN7E].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines provide the following **recommendations** regarding prolonged paralytic infusion:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) | - Consider early continuous NMBA infusion (cisatracurium) for 48 hours in moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 150) [^115XCaUw] <br/> - Limit duration of infusion and monitor neuromuscular function regularly [^112CsSvK] |
| Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) | - Prefer intermittent NMBA boluses over continuous infusion in sepsis-induced moderate-to-severe ARDS [^111vvzuS] <br/> - Ensure adequate sedation and analgesia during NMBA use |
| European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) | - Insufficient evidence to recommend routine continuous NMBA infusion for moderate-to-severe ARDS [^117YB3mV] <br/> - Use only when clearly indicated and monitor closely [^notfound] |

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Prolonged paralytic infusion is associated with **mixed clinical outcomes**. Potential benefits include improved oxygenation, reduced barotrauma, and facilitation of lung-protective ventilation in ARDS [^111C6egA], whereas significant risks include ICU-AW, prolonged mechanical ventilation, delayed recovery, and increased healthcare costs. The overall prognosis depends on the **underlying clinical condition**, duration of infusion, and adherence to monitoring and safety protocols [^114BdiCA].

---

Prolonged paralytic infusion is a critical care intervention with **significant benefits and risks**. It is indicated for specific clinical scenarios, such as ARDS and refractory ventilator dyssynchrony, but carries risks of ICU-AW, prolonged paralysis, and respiratory complications. Adherence to clinical guidelines, careful monitoring, and use of strategies to minimize risks are essential for optimal patient outcomes.

Multivariate analyses

A two-way ANOVA confirmed that both Ringer's lactate ≥ 2 L and complications prolonged the period of paralytic ileus and food intolerance, while only complications prolonged the length of hospital stay (Table 4).

Table 4

NS = not statistically significant.

For example, no complications and Ringer's lactate < 2 L had a mean period of paralytic ileus of 2.9 (1.1) days, and ≥ 2 L was associated with 3.5 (0.9) days. The corresponding time periods for patients with complications were 3.6 (1.3) and 4.4 (1.3) days, respectively (Figure 1 A). The effect of Ringer's lactate and complications on the food intolerance time was somewhat greater, amounting to about 2 days each (Figure 1 B). No independent effect on PACU time was found.

(C) The length of hospital stay increased with the number of complications (ANOVA P < 0.002). Data are the mean, and the error bars are the standard deviation. The number of patients in each group is indicated in red.

In contrast, the infusion of ≥ 1 L of starch reduced the time period of food intolerance by 2 days (P < 0.005) when simultaneously considering the effect of surgical complications (P < 0.014; two-way ANOVA).

When testing all three factors simultaneously, only Ringer's lactate ≥ 2 L and complications prolonged the period of food intolerance (both P < 0.02), while the alleviating effect of ≥ 1 L of starch did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.17).

### Ringer's lactate, but not hydroxyethyl starch, prolongs the food intolerance time after major abdominal surgery; an open-labelled clinical trial [^1172ZXXz]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Infusion of ≥ 2 L of Ringer's lactate prolonged food intolerance time by 2 days, while infusion of ≥ 1 L of hydroxyethyl starch did not have this effect. Beyond the GI recovery, the fluid volumes used did not correlate with the number of postoperative complications, such as infection and bleeding. However, patients who developed complications had a prolonged period of paralytic ileus and food intolerance that was clearly additive to the effect of ≥ 2 L of Ringer's lactate.

We hoped to disclose differences in outcome depending on the sequence of infusing these fluids, but found no such effects. Starch given as the first infusion after induction of general anaesthesia yielded virtually identical outcome measures, regardless of whether starch was continued or switched to Ringer's lactate, or when dehydration had been prevented by slowly infusing 500 mL of Ringer's lactate in the early morning before surgery (Table 1).

Only when using Ringer's lactate for both the first and second fluid infusion was there a significant prolongation of the time required for overcoming the surgery-induced paralytic ileus and food intolerance. However, the prolongation actually became apparent in all patient groups when the amount of infused Ringer's lactate was 2 L. In fact, the ROC curve revealed a clear trend toward a prolongation of the food intolerance time in response to as little as ≥ 1.25 L of Ringer's lactate (Figure 2 A).

Hydroxyethyl starch maintained urinary excretion as well as, or even better than, Ringer's lactate during these lengthy (mean 4 hrs) laparoscopic surgeries, which is probably due to an improvement of the renal perfusion. Our recordings of central haemodynamics provided no good explanation for this finding. Changes in serum creatinine levels were minimal and did not correlate with the amount of infused starch, which has been an issue. Starch also seemed to reduce the duration of paralytic ileus (Figure 2 A). However, the multivariate analysis suggested that most of this effect could be explained by a need for a smaller volume of Ringer's lactate when a large amount of starch was infused.

### Critical care pharmacist attitudes and perceptions of neuromuscular blocker infusions in ARDS [^115qgZ1u]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Current critical care pharmacist (CCP) practices and perceptions related to neuromuscular infusion (NMBI) use for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) maybe different with the COVID-19 pandemic and the publication of 2020 NMBI practice guidelines.

Objective

To evaluate CCP practices and perceptions regarding NMBI use for patients with moderate-severe ARDS.

Methods

We developed, tested, and electronically administered a questionnaire (7 parent-, 42 sub-questions) to 409 American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) Critical Care Practice and Research Network members in 12 geographically diverse states. The questionnaire focused on adults with moderate-severe ARDS (PaO 2 :FiO 2 < 150) whose causes of dyssynchrony were addressed. Two reminders were sent at 10-day intervals.

Results

Respondents [131/409 (32%)] primarily worked in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) 102 (78%). Compared to COVID-negative(-) ARDS patients, COVID positive(+) ARDS patients were twice as likely to receive a NMBI (34 ± 18 vs.16 ± 17%; P < 0.01). Respondents somewhat/strongly agreed a NMBI should be reserved until after trials of deep sedation (112, 86%) or proning (92, 81%) and that NMBI reduced barotrauma (88, 67%), dyssynchrony (87, 66%), and plateau pressure (79, 60%). Few respondents somewhat/strongly agreed that a NMBI should be initiated at ARDS onset (23, 18%) or that NMBI reduced 90-day mortality (12, 10%). Only 2/14 potential NMBI risks [paralysis awareness (101, 82%) and prolonged muscle weakness (84, 68%)] were frequently reported to be of high/very high concern. Multiple NMBI titration targets were assessed as very/extremely important including arterial pH (109, 88%), dyssynchrony (107, 86%), and PaO 2: FiO 2 ratio (82, 66%). Train-of-four (55, 44%) and BIS monitoring (36, 29%) were deemed less important. Preferred NMBI discontinuation criteria included absence of dysschrony (84, 69%) and use ≥ 48 hour (72, 59%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Current critical care pharmacists believe NMBI for ARDS patients are best reserved until after trials of deep sedation or proning; unique considerations exist in COVID+ patients. Our results should be considered when ICU NMBI protocols are being developed and bedside decisions regarding NMBI use in ARDS are being formulated.

Long-Term Use in ICU

In the intensive care unit, long-term use of neuromuscular blocking drugs to facilitate mechanical ventilation may be associated with prolonged paralysis and/or skeletal muscle weakness, that may be first noted during attempts to wean such patients from the ventilator. Typically, such patients receive other drugs such as broad spectrum antibiotics, narcotics and/or steroids and may have electrolyte imbalance and diseases which lead to electrolyte imbalance, hypoxic episodes of varying duration, acid-base imbalance and extreme debilitation, any of which may enhance the actions of a neuromuscular blocking agent. Additionally, patients immobilized for extended periods frequently develop symptoms consistent with disuse muscle atrophy. The recovery picture may vary from regaining movement and strength in all muscles to initial recovery of movement of the facial and small muscles of the extremities then to the remaining muscles. In rare cases recovery may be over an extended period of time and may even, on occasion, involve rehabilitation. Therefore, when there is a need for long term mechanical ventilation, the benefits-to-risk ratio of neuromuscular blockade must be considered.

Continuous infusion or intermittent bolus dosing to support mechanical ventilation has not been studied sufficiently to support dosage recommendations. IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, APPROPRIATE MONITORING, WITH THE USE OF A PERIPHERAL NERVE STIMULATOR TO ASSESS THE DEGREE OF NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE IS RECOMMENDED TO HELP PRECLUDE POSSIBLE PROLONGATION OF THE BLOCKADE. WHENEVER THE USE OF VECURONIUM OR ANY NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING AGENT IS CONTEMPLATED IN THE ICU, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT NEUROMUSCULAR TRANSMISSION BE MONITORED CONTINUOUSLY DURING ADMINISTRATION AND RECOVERY WITH THE HELP OF A NERVE STIMULATOR. ADDITIONAL DOSES OF VECURONIUM OR ANY OTHER NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING AGENT SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN BEFORE THERE IS A DEFINITE RESPONSE TO T1OR TO THE FIRST TWITCH. IF NO RESPONSE IS ELICITED, INFUSION ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED UNTIL A RESPONSE RETURNS.

Severe Obesity or Neuromuscular Disease

Patients with severe obesity or neuromuscular disease may pose airway and/or ventilatory problems requiring special care before, during and after the use of neuromuscular blocking agents such as vecuronium.

Malignant Hyperthermia

Many drugs used in anesthetic practice are suspected of being capable of triggering a potentially fatal hypermetabolism of skeletal muscle known as malignant hyperthermia. There are insufficient data derived from screening in susceptible animals (swine) to establish whether or not vecuronium is capable of triggering hyperthermia.

CNS

Vecuronium has no known effect on consciousness, the pain threshold or cerebration. Administration must be accompanied by adequate anesthesia or sedation.

### Vecuronium bromide [^114Lndpm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

VECURONIUM SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED IN CAREFULLY ADJUSTED DOSAGE BY OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF EXPERIENCED CLINICIANS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH ITS ACTIONS AND THE POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS THAT MIGHT OCCUR FOLLOWING ITS USE. THE DRUG SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED UNLESS FACILITIES FOR INTUBATION, ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION, OXYGEN THERAPY, AND REVERSAL AGENTS ARE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE. THE CLINICIAN MUST BE PREPARED TO ASSIST OR CONTROL RESPIRATION. TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF PROLONGED NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE AND OTHER POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS THAT MIGHT OCCUR FOLLOWING LONG-TERM USE IN THE ICU, VECURONIUM OR ANY OTHER NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING AGENT SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED IN CAREFULLY ADJUSTED DOSES BY OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF EXPERIENCED CLINICIANS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH ITS ACTIONS AND WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH APPROPRIATE PERIPHERAL NERVE STIMULATOR MUSCLE MONITORING TECHNIQUES (see PRECAUTIONS - Long-Term Use in ICU).

In patients who are known to have myasthenia gravis or the myasthenic (Eaton-Lambert) syndrome, small doses of vecuronium may have profound effects. In such patients, a peripheral nerve stimulator and use of a small test dose may be of value in monitoring the response to administration of muscle relaxants.

Anaphylaxis

Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including vecuronium bromide, have been reported. These reactions have in some cases been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those individuals who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs.

Risk of Death due to
Medication Errors

Administration of vecuronium bromide for injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated.

### Neuromuscular blockade in the 21st century management of the critically ill patient [^1171smiG]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Neuromuscular blockings agents (NMBAs) have a controversial role in the ventilatory and medical management of critical illness. The clinical concern surrounding NMBA-induced complications stems from evidence presented in the 2002 clinical practice guidelines, but new evidence from subsequent randomized trials and studies provides a more optimistic outlook about the application of NMBAs in the ICU. Furthermore, changes in the delivery of critical care, such as protocolized care pathways, minimizing or interrupting sedation, increased monitoring techniques, and overall improvements in reducing immobility, have created a modern, 21st century ICU environment whereby NMBAs may be administered safely. In this article we start with a review of the mechanism of action, side effects, and pharmacology of commonly used NMBAs. We then address the rationale for NMBA use for an expanding number of indications (endotracheal intubation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, status asthmaticus, increased intracranial and intra-abdominal pressure, and therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest), with an emphasis on NMBA use in facilitating lung-protective ventilation for respiratory failure. We end with an appraisal over the importance of monitoring depth of paralysis and the concerns of complications, such as prolonged skeletal muscle weakness. In the context of adequate sedation and analgesia, monitored NMBA use (continuous or bolus administration) can be considered for the small number of clinical indications in critically ill patients for which evidence currently exists.

Domain 8: Neuromuscular blocking agents

Question 8.1: Does the routine use of a continuous infusion of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS not due to COVID-19 or moderate-to-severe ARDS due to COVID-19 reduce mortality?

Background

The administration of NMBA to mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS reduces the work of breathing and patient–ventilator asynchronyand may affect outcome. However, prolonged use of NMBA is also associated with neuromuscular weakness and requires deep sedation, which itself can result in adverse outcomes. More than a decade ago, the ACURASYS trial reported that the early administration of a 48-h infusion of NMBA in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 150 mmHg with PEEP ≥ 5) resulted in lower mortality than a strategy of deep sedation without routine NMBA use, after an adjusted analysis. Three other smaller trials with similar inclusion criteria and treatment protocols showed benefit with routine NMBA use. However, ICU practices have evolved since these trials, with emphasis on lighter sedation and earlier return to spontaneous breathing.

In the recent ROSE trial, which randomized patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS to a 48h continuous infusion of NMBA with concomitant deep sedation (intervention group) or to a usual-care approach without routine neuromuscular blockade and with lighter sedation targets (control group), there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days. There has been an increased use of NMBA infusions in patients with COVID-19 ARDS who are mechanically ventilated, most commonly to abolish vigorous spontaneous efforts and decrease the generation of high transpulmonary pressures that could aggravate self-inflicted lung injury or asynchronies. However, randomized trials on NMBA use in patients with COVID-19 are lacking. Given that the ROSE trial excluded a significant number of patients already receiving NMBA, the benefit of early continuous NMBA remains unclear.

### Ringer's lactate, but not hydroxyethyl starch, prolongs the food intolerance time after major abdominal surgery; an open-labelled clinical trial [^113Pywb6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The infusion of large amounts of Ringer's lactate prolongs the functional gastrointestinal recovery time and increases the number of complications after open abdominal surgery. We performed an open-labelled clinical trial to determine whether hydroxyethyl starch or Ringer's lactate exerts these adverse effects when the surgery is performed by laparoscopy.

Methods

Eighty-eight patients scheduled for major abdominal cancer surgery (83% by laparoscopy) received a first-line fluid treatment with 9 ml/kg of either 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (Voluven) or Ringer's lactate, just after induction of anaesthesia; this was followed by a second-line infusion with 12 ml/kg of either starch or Ringer's lactate over 1 hour. Further therapy was managed at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist. Outcome data consisted of postoperative gastrointestinal recovery time, complications and length of hospital stay.

Results

The order of the infusions had no impact on the outcome. Both the administration of ≥ 2 L of Ringer's lactate and the development of a surgical complication were associated with a longer time period of paralytic ileus and food intolerance (two-way ANOVA, P < 0.02), but only surgical complications prolonged the length of hospital stay (P < 0.001). The independent effect of Ringer's lactate and complications of food intolerance time amounted to 2 days each. The infusion of ≥ 1 L of hydroxyethyl starch did not adversely affect gastrointestinal recovery.

Conclusions

### Ringer's lactate, but not hydroxyethyl starch, prolongs the food intolerance time after major abdominal surgery; an open-labelled clinical trial [^117Di7as]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Fluid therapy

No fluid was infused during the induction of general anaesthesia. Each patient was allocated to one of four fluid programs consisting of a first-line bolus infusion initiated about 10 min after tracheal intubation, and a second-line continuous infusion initiated when surgery started.

GROUP 1. Bolus with starch, continuous with starch.

GROUP 2. Preloading with Ringer's lactate, bolus with starch, continuous with Ringer's lactate.

GROUP 3. Bolus with starch, continuous with Ringer's lactate.

GROUP 4. Bolus with Ringer's, continuous with Ringer's lactate.

The patients were not allocated to the four fluid programs individually but allocated in blocks of 25–30. They reflect the beliefs, based on previous work, that the order of the infusion may affect fluid retention and consequently outcome and that preoperative dehydration can increase the number of postoperative complications.

Bolus infusions

Three bolus infusions of either 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (Voluven®; Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany) or Ringer's lactate. Each of the boluses were given in the volume of 3 ml/kg over 7 min via an infusion pump (IEC 601–1; Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL).

Continuous infusions

When surgery was about to begin, a continuous infusion of either starch or Ringer's lactate was given via an infusion pump at a rate of 12 ml/kg over 1 hour.

Further fluid therapy was given at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist, but the volumes were recorded.

To prevent preoperative dehydration, 30 patients in the starch + Ringer group (GROUP 2) also received preloading with 500 mL of Ringer's lactate as a slow drip over 2 h, beginning 3 h before the induction of anaesthesia.

Outcome measures

The outcome measures included the time period spent in the postoperative care unit (PACU), time period of paralytic ileus, time to tolerance of oral food, length of hospital stay and postoperative complications. The complications were taken from the medical records from the in-hospital period and interpreted according to the definitions used in the current worldwide International Surgical Outcomes Study (ISOS, see). We considered postoperative complications to include anastomotic leak, surgical site infection, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary oedema, sepsis, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, vomiting, severe pain, pulmonary embolism, stroke, postoperative haemorrhage, acute kidney injury and re-operation.

### Ringer's lactate, but not hydroxyethyl starch, prolongs the food intolerance time after major abdominal surgery; an open-labelled clinical trial [^112c3Ewe]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The infusion of large amounts of Ringer's lactate prolongs the functional gastrointestinal recovery time and increases the number of complications after open abdominal surgery. We performed an open-labelled clinical trial to determine whether hydroxyethyl starch or Ringer's lactate exerts these adverse effects when the surgery is performed by laparoscopy.

Methods

Eighty-eight patients scheduled for major abdominal cancer surgery (83% by laparoscopy) received a first-line fluid treatment with 9 ml/kg of either 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (Voluven) or Ringer's lactate, just after induction of anaesthesia; this was followed by a second-line infusion with 12 ml/kg of either starch or Ringer's lactate over 1 hour. Further therapy was managed at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist. Outcome data consisted of postoperative gastrointestinal recovery time, complications and length of hospital stay.

Results

The order of the infusions had no impact on the outcome. Both the administration of ≥ 2 L of Ringer's lactate and the development of a surgical complication were associated with a longer time period of paralytic ileus and food intolerance (two-way ANOVA, P < 0.02), but only surgical complications prolonged the length of hospital stay (P < 0.001). The independent effect of Ringer's lactate and complications of food intolerance time amounted to 2 days each. The infusion of ≥ 1 L of hydroxyethyl starch did not adversely affect gastrointestinal recovery.

Conclusions

Ringer's lactate, but not hydroxyethyl starch, prolonged the gastrointestinal recovery time in patients undergoing laparoscopic cancer surgery. Surgical complications prolonged the hospital stay.

### Extravascular injection of neuromuscular blocking drugs: a systematic review of current evidence and management [^117LagQx]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Extravasation of NMBDs is a potentially dangerous complication that requires adequate anaesthetic management. Current literature consists of articles with heterogeneous data. The available literature suggests that extravasation of NMBDs can result in a neuromuscular block with delayed onset and prolonged and unpredictable duration. Currently, no guidelines exist on how to approach an accidental subcutaneous administration of NMBDs. Therefore, we suggest a clinical pathway that can be used after extravasation of NMBDs. This pathway includes observation with thorough monitoring, the potential need for prolonged sedation and ventilation and a suggested method to reverse the neuromuscular block.

### Preparing for the unexpected: special considerations and complications after sugammadex administration [^115UK6HX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

As the international use of sugammadex continues to expand, new scenarios will arise that challenge clinicians, and a thorough understanding of the properties, advantages and limitations of this drug are of paramount importance. Similarly important for good clinical care and patient safety, clinicians must remember that the reversal dose of sugammadex should always be calculated based on the degree of neuromuscular recovery obtained with neuromuscular monitoring (ideally, objective neuromuscular monitoring). By doing so, the use of sugammadex eliminates recurrence and/or residual paralysis after neuromuscular reversal. Appropriate dosing of sugammadex also broadens the range of clinical options when reliable and rapid re-induction of neuromuscular blockade is needed. Even in special situations (e.g. hypermagnesemia, hypothermia), sugammadex has an advantage as a neuromuscular reversal agent compared with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Although hypersensitivity to sugammadex is unpredictable, such rare events typically occur within minutes of administration and should be detected and treated successfully by the vigilant clinician.

### Veno-venous ECMO: a synopsis of nine key potential challenges, considerations, and controversies [^114AwFtr]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Challenge eight: neuromuscular blocking agents

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) have been controversial in regards to their efficacy in treating ARDS. Due to lack of evidence on a large scale, no clear recommendations exist regarding the use of NMBAs in ARDS. However, some studies suggest that anesthesia and paralysis cause a ventilation/perfusion mismatch and impair gas exchange.

Recent developments assert that the hypoxemia in ARDS reaches its worst levels in the first 48 hours. The traditional view on NMBA use in the critical care setting is largely negative, with a number of potential complications associated with this therapeutic modality. In a study of 56 patients with ARDS, improved oxygenation was seen in patients randomized to NMBAs in the first 48 hours while receiving volume assist control with a tidal volume of 6–8 ml/kg. Another similar study reported that early NMBA use may contribute to modulation of the pro- inflammatory response. Additionally, a third study of 340 patients where cis-atracurium was administered in the first 48 hours of development of ARDS found that the NMBAs improved the adjusted 90-day survival and increased time off of the ventilator without increasing muscle weakness. Neto et al. performed a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of studies conducted between 1966 and 2012, and the three above-mentioned studies were the only acceptable, high-quality trials performed. The authors concluded, based on these three studies, that that the use of NMBAs in the early stages of ARDS leads to an improved outcome. Nonetheless, further trials may need to be performed to solidify such a conclusion. The general sedation of the VV ECMO patient is beyond the scope of this synopsis, but sedation of the patient requires forethought and constant reevaluation. Never forget to sedate a patient in which a NMBA is used. As indicated, the above suppositions related to NMBAs were not directly related to ECMO, but difficulty in oxygenating an ECMO patient should at least lead to the consideration of pharmacologic paralysis.

### An evaluation of continuous infusion rocuronium for sustained neuromuscular blockade in critically ill adults [^113EKDdZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent medication shortages of the neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) cisatracurium have forced the prescribing of aminosteroidal agents such as rocuronium. There are limited data on the use and dosing of continuous infusion (CI) rocuronium in critically ill patients outside of the operating room.

Objective

We sought to describe the use of CI rocuronium for sustained neuromuscular blockade in intensive care unit (ICU) patients by characterizing the dosing, utilization, and safety profile in patients with multiple organ failure (MOF) and non-MOF.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of patients in mixed ICUs from 2 tertiary medical centers who received CI rocuronium between January 2018 and July 2019.

Results

A total of 46 unique rocuronium infusions were utilized for 40 patients during the evaluation period. Of these, 37% had MOF, and 41% had at least 1 organ fail during the rocuronium infusion. The median starting and maximum dose was 8 µg/kg/min. Overall, 64% of train of 4 (TOF) measurements were a TOF 0 (T0) or TOF 1 (T1), with a higher percentage of T0 or T1 in the MOF group compared with the non-MOF group (75% vs 50%). The median time to recovery was more than twice as long for the MOF compared with the non-MOF group (10 vs 4.6 hours). ICU-acquired weakness was diagnosed in 27% of survivors.

Conclusion and Relevance

In ICU patients with MOF, continuous rocuronium infusions were associated with deep levels of paralysis and prolonged recovery times. If neuromuscular blockade is required for critically ill patients, alternative strategies could be considered.

### Lidocaine combined with magnesium sulfate preserved hemodynamic stability during general anesthesia without prolonging neuromuscular blockade: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^116umnNX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anesthetic additive drugs, such as lidocaine and magnesium sulfate (MS), have become increasingly utilized, either alone or in combination, in general anesthesia for postoperative pain reduction, achievement of reduced and more balanced anesthetic doses, hemodynamic stabilization, and improvement of surgical conditions. Opioid-sparing or opioid-free anesthesia is a relatively new strategy that is increasingly being used in daily anesthesia practice. A combination of lidocaine and magnesium sulfate in a multimodal opioid-sparing or even opioid-free anesthetic approach may reduce or eliminate the use of opioids in the perioperative period. Drugs such as lidocaine and magnesium sulfate are frequently used in combination with neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs), the latter of which may contribute to residual neuromuscular blockade (NMB). It is a well-known and ongoing problem that NMBAs have the inherent risk of residual paralysis, even when used alone. Furthermore, residual paralysis is most likely associated with postoperative pulmonary complications, which has also been well known for many years but has still not been resolved.

Magnesium sulfate infusion administered before anesthesia has been found to increase the speed of onset of a rocuronium-, cisatracurium- or vecuronium-induced NMB without necessarily enhancing its duration. Furthermore, magnesium sulfate infusion re-establishes a clinically relevant degree of muscle paralysis in patients who have recovered from paralysis and causes a significant, prolonged NMB when induced by a single dose of the neuromuscular-blocking drug rocuronium.

The effects of lidocaine on NMB are still under debate. Previous studies have shown that local anesthetics, such as lidocaine, interact with NMBAs. More recent studies evaluating the clinical effects of lidocaine, at lower dosages, on the NMBAs cisatracurium and rocuronium have demonstrated no changes in the recovery of NMB characteristics or speed of onset.

Considering the growing perioperative clinical applications of both lidocaine and magnesium sulfate, the possibility of using these drugs in combination increases. A combination of these drugs may not only be beneficial for surgical patients regarding opioid-sparing effects but may also influence NMB characteristics and promote changes in hemodynamic parameters. The main objective was to evaluate whether the use of additional lidocaine could influence the NMB enhancement. Thus, this study's primary endpoint was the time at which spontaneous recovery of a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of 90% was achieved (complete duration). The secondary endpoints were other NMB characteristics (onset time, duration 25, duration 95) and hemodynamic parameters.

### The safety of continuous infusion propofol in mechanically ventilated adults with coronavirus disease 2019 [^115agAt5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Respiratory failure from COVID-19 is often severe and protracted; patients requiring mechanical ventilation often require prolonged, deep sedation to optimize oxygenation and ventilation and facilitate ventilator synchrony. In the general critical care population, guidelines recommend use of nonbenzodiazepine sedatives, such as propofol or dexmedetomidine, as first-line remedies to improve short-term outcomes. However, patients with COVID-19 often require high doses of sedative medications for prolonged periods, and propofol is integral to achieving these goals.

Propofol, an anesthetic agent formulated in a 10% lipid emulsion, has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Possible adverse effects of propofol administration include respiratory depression, hypotension, hypertriglyceridemia, and propofol-related infusion syndrome (PRIS). Hypertriglyceridemia, in turn, can be associated with acute pancreatitis, which can be severe. The risk of acute pancreatitis is increased with triglyceride concentrations > 500 mg/dL, and the risk is significantly higher with triglyceride concentrations > 1000 mg/dL. As a result, many clinicians monitor triglyceride concentrations every 2 to 3 days during prolonged infusion and may switch to an alternative sedative agent if the concentration exceeds 400 to 500 mg/dL. These alternative agents are typically benzodiazepines, which have been associated with worse outcomes, such as increased delirium, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and longer ICU and hospital lengths of stay. PRIS is a rare, potentially devastating complication associated with prolonged high doses (> 83 µµg/kg/min for > 48 hours), and has a reported mortality rate ranging from 18% to 48%. - Clinical features of PRIS may include refractory bradycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis, hyperlipidemia, acute kidney injury, or acute fatty liver. Finally, there is a potential risk of hypertriglyceridemia from propofol use in patients who develop secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), a macrophage activation syndrome that, similar to COVID-19, can be associated with cytokine storm. Patients with sHLH may have elevated triglyceride concentrations at baseline.

The objective of this study was to assess the safety of continuous infusion propofol in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients with COVID-19. We examined the incidences of hypertriglyceridemia, acute pancreatitis, PRIS, and propofol reduction or discontinuation caused by adverse effects. We hypothesized that hypertriglyceridemia is more prevalent among these patients and occurs at lower cumulative doses of the drug.

### Preparing for the unexpected: special considerations and complications after sugammadex administration [^112U8tTg]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Sugammadex, a modified gamma-cyclodextrin, has changed clinical practice of neuromuscular reversal dramatically. With the introduction of this selective relaxant binding agent, rapid and reliable neuromuscular reversal from any depth of block became possible. Sugammadex can reverse neuromuscular blockade without the muscarinic side effects typically associated with the administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, what remained unchanged is the incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade. It is known that sugammadex cannot always prevent its occurrence, if appropriate dosing is not chosen based on the level of neuromuscular paralysis prior to administration determined by objective neuromuscular monitoring. Alternatively, excessive doses of sugammadex administered in an attempt to ensure full and sustained reversal may affect the effectiveness of rocuronium in case of immediate reoperation or reintubation. In such emergent scenarios that require onset of rapid and reliable neuromuscular blockade, the summary of product characteristics (package insert) recommends using benzylisoquinolinium neuromuscular blocking agents or a depolarizing agent. However, if rapid intubation is required, succinylcholine has a significant number of side effects, and benzylisoquinolinium agents may not have the rapid onset required. Therefore, prior administration of sugammadex introduces a new set of potential problems that require new solutions. This novel reversal agent thus presents new challenges and anesthesiologists must familiarize themselves with specific issues with its use (e.g., bleeding risk, hypermagnesemia, hypothermia). This review will address sugammadex administration in such special clinical situations.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^116n1HZq]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Pregnant patients — continuous neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) infusions: We make no recommendation on the use of NMBAs in pregnant patients (insufficient evidence). Cisatracurium and rocuronium are the only NMBAs that are listed as pregnancy category B drugs, and in the ICU the use of category C drugs should be avoided because category B drugs are available. All NMBAs or their metabolites, with the exception of cisatracurium, cross the placental barrier, and there are no double-blind, randomized, controlled trials comparing NMBAs in pregnant critically ill patients. Critically ill obstetrical patients have increased risk of death from respiratory failure (OR of 1.9 for mortality) and a fetal loss rate of 34–52%, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) alone is associated with a 12% rate of fetal loss; delay in ICU care has an OR of 2.3 for maternal mortality in obstetrical patients. Similar to succinylcholine, pancuronium, atracurium, and vecuronium all cross the placenta and are pregnancy class C; their use should be avoided for long-term infusion, especially in the first trimester. Vecuronium, atracurium, and rocuronium do not have a prolonged clinical effect in the pregnant or postpartum patient, cisatracurium has a shorter duration of effect in the immediate postpartum patient than in the nonpregnant patient, and atracurium is associated with much higher levels of laudanosine than cisatracurium.

### Effect of administration sequence of induction agents on first-attempt failure during emergency intubation: a Bayesian analysis of a prospective cohort [^114K7YzQ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Tracheal intubation in the emergency department (ED) is a common yet high‐risk procedure, with a first‐attempt failure rate of 15% to 20% and a hypoxemia rate (SpO 2 < 90%) of 10% to 12%. Rapid‐sequence intubation (RSI), utilizing a near‐simultaneous combination of a sedative and a neuromuscular blockade agent (NMBA, also known as a paralytic), reduces these risks compared to either sedative‐only induction or no induction. Prior research has compared different sedatives and paralytics, but the effect of the sequence in which these drugs are administered — sedative‐first versus paralytic‐first — remains underexplored. Notably, no consensus exists in international guidelines regarding the preferred sequence, leading to considerable variation in clinical practice; for instance, some high‐performing institutions in the United States administer the paralytic first more than 50% of time, compared to less than 10% in France.

Sedatives like etomidate and ketamine, at doses commonly used in RSI, have a shorter time to peak clinical effect than most paralytics, suggesting a potential advantage for the sedative‐first strategy by minimizing the risk of paralysis while the patient is awake. However, recent data show no significant increase in awareness of paralysis with a paralytic‐first approach. Conversely, administering the paralytic first may align the peak clinical effects of the sedative and paralytic agents more closely. This may reduce the duration of apnea caused by the sedative that can occur before the patient is optimized for laryngoscopy and intubation (i.e. paralyzed). Aligning the onset of action may decrease the overall procedure time and risk of peri‐procedure hypoxemia — a principle studied in the operating room setting, but not yet confirmed in the ED context. This study aims to address this gap by assessing the effects of drug sequence order on first attempt failure, peri‐intubation hypoxemia, and complications of emergency tracheal intubation.

### Prolonged paralysis following mivacurium administration in a pediatric patient with previously undiagnosed pseudocholinesterase deficiency: a case report [^112b7kT2]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In this case, the patient's PChE deficiency was evident despite the fact that the conventionally measured cholinesterase activity showed only a mild reduction, which typically does not lead to any noticeable clinical effects. This observation highlights that a preoperative screening protocol based solely on conventional cholinesterase measurements would not have reliably predicted the risk of prolonged paralysis, as such slight reductions are generally not considered clinically impactful. Consequently, implementing a widespread preoperative screening protocol specifically for pseudocholinesterase deficiency in pediatric patients would likely be inefficient and resource-intensive unless there were specific reasons or risk factors indicating a higher likelihood of this deficiency.

The rate of intraoperative awareness in pediatric anesthesia seems to be higher than in adult anesthesia. Undetected prolonged neuromuscular block can also lead to intraoperative awareness. Being conscious during surgery is a traumatic event that can lead to chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. Therefore, every effort should be made to prevent intraoperative awareness. A three-month follow-up was conducted to evaluate the potential development of post-traumatic stress disorder or other psychosocial sequelae of the brief awareness episode. The results indicated the absence of any abnormalities. The growing preference for outpatient treatment in European medicine will, in the future, result in an increase in the number of minor surgical procedures being performed on an outpatient basis. In the context of postoperative care, anesthesiologic monitoring of patients assumes particular relevance. It is not uncommon for day clinics to lack the necessary resources to provide prolonged postoperative monitoring and, if required, ventilation. This is undoubtedly attributable to deficiencies in infrastructure and staffing. In conclusion, it can be stated that all medical professionals involved in the treatment of pediatric patients requiring general anesthesia are informed about the potential adverse effects of anesthesia and also discuss the possibility of postoperative ventilation with the families.

Conclusion for practice

The residual neuromuscular block after mivacurium/succinylcholine is a well-known effect in patients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency.
If not recognized by the anesthesiologist, this may cause complications such as awareness and residual paralysis leading to hypoxia.
To prevent this, the anesthesiologist should perform quantitative neuromuscular monitoring, for example through a train-of-four measurement on every patient who has received neuromuscular blocking agents before tracheal extubation.
A pseudocholinesterase deficiency may remain asymptomatic for decades, often only being identified when patients undergo anesthesia and receive a neuromuscular blocking agent that depends on pseudocholinesterase for its metabolism.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^111CYPoy]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) neuromuscular blockade (NMBA) in adults — key findings include that pooling results across trials showed that a 48-hour cisatracurium infusion consistently reduced the risk of death at 28 days and at hospital discharge, reduced barotrauma, and did not increase intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness; assuming a baseline mortality rate of 45% for ARDS patients, eight patients would have to be treated with a 48-hour cisatracurium infusion to save one additional life. In a subsequent study, 24 of 48 patients with ARDS and sepsis received vecuronium and 24 were assigned to control, and compared with the control group, the vecuronium group had decreased mortality. In the largest trial reported to date, an additional bolus of study drug was administered when plateau airway pressure exceeded 32 cm H2O, and current evidence might be extrapolated to support the use of NMBA therapy in adults with ARDS whenever plateau airway pressures exceed 30–35 cm H2O. Neuromuscular blockade has been linked to increased risk of ICU-acquired weakness, which is cited as a deterrent to use in ARDS.

Propofol infusion syndrome

PRIS is a rare but potentially fatal complication characterized by severe metabolic acidosis and cardiocirculatory shock. Risk factors for PRIS include high propofol dosage (> 4 mg/kg/h), prolonged utilization (> 48 h), neurologic or neurosurgical diseases, young age, catecholamine or glucocorticoid administration, inadequate dietary carbohydrates and subclinical mitochondrial disease. In addition, therapeutic hypothermia may precipitate PRIS in patients on 'safe' doses of propofol by reducing its hepatic metabolism and increasing plasma levels.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115Pbcm6]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

A prominent criticism of this literature has been the relative lack of caregiver blinding, even in the largest and most recent trial, which was placebo controlled. In this trial, bedside clinicians confirmed the adequacy of deep sedation (defined as no response on glabellar tap) before initiating a high-dose infusion of either cisatracurium besylate or an identical-appearing placebo. Thereafter, clinicians did not monitor the depth of paralysis with peripheral nerve stimulation; rather, they monitored airway pressures and, when plateau pressures exceeded 32 cm H 2 O (for more than 10 minutes, and despite increased sedation) in either group, an open-label intravenous bolus of cisatracurium was administered. We believe that the majority of patients with severe ARDS who have no response to glabellar tap are unlikely to initiate spontaneous breaths, and, for that majority of patients, caregivers remained blinded. In the application of this protocol outside a research setting, monitoring the depth of paralysis with peripheral nerve stimulation would serve to prevent unnecessarily high dosing of cisatracurium besylate and, accordingly, possibly reduce any adverse effects.

The possibility of a link between neuromuscular blockade and risk of ICU-acquired weakness poses a strong deterrent to NMBA therapy in current management of adult ARDS. The strongest clinical research supporting this association includes four retrospective studies (n = 481) in the management of severe asthma. These studies were confounded by concurrent, high-dose glucocorticosteroid therapy. In contrast, slightly less than one half of the patients in this review received corticosteroid therapy during the study infusion of cisatracurium besylate, at lower doses than those administered for acute asthma. Moreover, the observational studies in asthma generally lacked systematic screening for ICU-acquired weakness. Common conclusions from the asthma literature are that (a) prolonged quadriparesis may be related to the dose and duration of neuromuscular blockade, (b) particularly in the settings of coexistent renal or hepatic dysfunction, and (c) a class effect may exist (although the data are inconsistent) with amino steroid NMBAs (for example, pancuronium, vecuronium) posing a higher risk of ICU-acquired weakness than benzylisoquinolones (for example, atracurium, cisatracurium).

### The propofol infusion syndrome: more puzzling evidence on a complex and poorly characterized disorder [^112FnXz4]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

The propofol infusion syndrome is a potentially devastating cardiovascular and metabolic derangement that has been described in both pediatric and adult patients sedated with propofol. Despite a large number of case reports that have appeared in the literature since 1992, the precise clinical features and pathophysiology of this disorder remain uncertain. Historically, the syndrome has been characterized by the occurrence of lactic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and circulatory collapse after several days of high-dose propofol infusion. The affected patients were typically young and critically ill, and the reported mortality was high. More recently, a number of atypical cases have been reported with favorable outcomes. These occurred after short-term or lower-dose infusions in noncritically ill patients in whom generally only a subset of the classical syndrome features was observed. It remains unclear whether these reports reflect true propofol infusion syndrome detected at an earlier and more salvageable stage, or mere associations with the use of sedative agents in general. Without better information on the true incidence of the propofol infusion syndrome, clinical guidelines on the safe use of this drug remain unsupported by good evidence.

### Prolonged paralysis following mivacurium administration in a pediatric patient with previously undiagnosed pseudocholinesterase deficiency: a case report [^114DzAVe]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

We present a case of prolonged muscle relaxation after a single dose of mivacurium in a 24-month-old child. Even though the problems associated with succinylcholine and mivacurium have been known for decades, their incidence in pediatric anesthesia is very rare. Although persistent neuromuscular block due to PChE deficiency is a rare side effect of administration of mivacurium or succinylcholine, it could result in a condition that is clinically challenging to diagnose and can be potentially lethal.

Patients with PChE deficiency exhibit a high degree of sensitivity to mivacurium and succinylcholine. Consequently, prolonged post-anesthetic apnea can occur, which may ultimately lead to death after administration of these drugs. The results of a recent study indicate that a genetically determined PChE deficiency is a significant contributing factor in the occurrence of prolonged neuromuscular block following mivacurium administration. In fact, the study revealed that PChE deficiency was present in 80% of patients who experienced an adverse event. The genetics of PChE were first described by Kallow and Genest and are widely regarded as the foundation of pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics research. At present, in excess of 60 genetic variants are known. It is postulated that genetically inherited deficits are autosomal and recessive in character and can occur as a result of mutations. Additionally, numerous non-genetic factors can contribute to diminished PChE activity, including malnutrition, renal disease, hepatic disease, neoplastic processes, thermal injury, hypothyroidism and burns. Additionally, certain medications, including oral contraceptives, clindamycin, insecticides, and metoclopramide, have been linked to PChE deficiency. PChE deficiency is frequently not identified until after general anesthesia has been administered, when breathing is paralyzed for an extended period of time following the administration of mivacurium. There is no causal treatment for PChE deficiency, but some approaches are available, for example, the administration of human cholinesterase, neostigmine or fresh frozen plasma, however, these therapies can also be associated with possible side effects and complications. Therefore, from the authors' point of view, the primary goal of treatment is to provide ventilation and maintenance of sedation/amnesia until the drug has been cleared from the neurosynaptic cleft and neuromuscular function has been restored.

### Remifentanil vs. alfentanil infusion in non-paralysed patients: a randomized, double-blind study [^115BbwWG]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Remifentanil has a short duration of action and constant elimination, which allow administration of high doses, without prolonging recovery. Remifentanil has been compared to alfentanil, as part of a total intravenous anaesthetic technique, where remifentanil provided better anaesthetic conditions than alfentanil, without adverse effect on recovery. However, these results were obtained during anaesthesia involving neuromuscular blockade, which may mask both signs of insufficient anaesthesia and side-effects such as muscle rigidity. The aim of this study was to compare remifentanil with alfentanil for anaesthesia without neuromuscular blockade.

Methods

We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, four-centre study to compare remifentanil infusion 15 microg kg(-1) h(-1) and alfentanil infusion 60 microg kg(-1) h(-1), using a total intravenous technique for non-paralysed patients, and the laryngeal mask airway for airway management. We enrolled 192 patients, 18–65 yr of age with ASA I-II, undergoing minor surgery. The primary endpoint was the number of patients having pre-defined responses to surgical stimulation. A number of secondary criteria was evaluated to assess undesirable properties of the procedures.

Results

In the alfentanil group, 85% of patients responded to surgical stimulation, vs. 35% in the remifentanil group (P < 0.0001). No difference was found in recovery data, or in any other parameter than those related to insufficient anaesthesia.

Conclusions

The remifentanil-based technique provided significantly better anaesthetic conditions than the alfentanil-based technique in the setting of this study, without causing any significant adverse effects.

### Approach to neuromuscular disorders in the intensive care unit [^1125uktn]. Neurocritical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Neuromuscular disorders increasingly are recognized as a complication in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and represent a common cause of prolonged ventilator dependency. The distinct syndromes of critical illness myopathy, prolonged neuromuscular blockade, and critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) may arise as a consequence of sepsis, multi-organ failure, and exposure to various medications — notably, intravenous corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents — but the pathophysiology of these disorders remains poorly understood. More than one syndrome may occur simultaneously, and the distinctions may be difficult in a particular patient, but a specific diagnosis usually can be established after careful clinical, electrodiagnostic, and, when necessary, histological evaluation. For example, asthmatics requiring treatment with corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents may develop an acute myopathy characterized by generalized weakness, preserved eye movements, elevated creatine kinase levels, and myopathic motor units on electromyography (EMG). Muscle biopsy demonstrates distinctive features of thick (myosin) filament loss on ultrastructural studies. Conversely, those with a prolonged ICU course that is complicated by episodes of sepsis with failure to wean from the ventilator, distal or generalized flaccid limb weakness, and areflexia probably have CIP. EMG in these patients demonstrates reduced or absent motor and sensory potentials with neurogenic motor units. Prolonged neuromuscular blockade most commonly occurs in patients with renal failure who have received prolonged infusions of neuromuscular blockers. There is severe flaccid, areflexic paralysis with normal sensation, facial weakness, and ophthalmoparesis that persists for days or weeks after the neuromuscular blockers have been discontinued. Repetitive nerve stimulation shows a decrement of the compound muscle action potential and, in most cases, establishes a disorder of neuromuscular transmission. With the recent epidemic of West Nile virus infection, a clinical syndrome of acute flaccid paralysis with several features indistinguishable from poliomyelitis has emerged. This article critically examines the clinical, electrophysiological, and pathological features of these and other acute neuromuscular syndromes that arise in the context of ICU care and summarizes the current understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of these disorders.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111C6egA]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Randomized trials investigating neuromuscular blocking agents in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been inconclusive about effects on mortality, which is very high in this population. Uncertainty also exists about the associated risk of ICU-acquired weakness.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched the Cochrane (Central) database, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ACP Journal Club, and clinical trial registries for randomized trials investigating survival effects of neuromuscular blocking agents in adults with ARDS. Two independent reviewers abstracted data and assessed methodologic quality. Primary study investigators provided additional unpublished data.

Results

Three trials (431 patients; 20 centers; all from the same research group in France) met inclusion criteria for this review. All trials assessed 48-hour infusions of cisatracurium besylate. Short-term infusion of cisatracurium besylate was associated with lower hospital mortality (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.91; P = 0.005; I2 = 0). This finding was robust on sensitivity analyses. Neuromuscular blockade was also associated with lower risk of barotrauma (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.90; P = 0.02; I2 = 0), but had no effect on the duration of mechanical ventilation among survivors (MD, 0.25 days; 95% CI, 5.48 to 5.99; P = 0.93; I2 = 49%), or the risk of ICU-acquired weakness (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.41; P = 0.57; I2 = 0). Primary studies lacked protracted measurements of weakness.

Conclusions

Short-term infusion of cisatracurium besylate reduces hospital mortality and barotrauma and does not appear to increase ICU-acquired weakness for critically ill adults with ARDS.

### Lung-protective ventilation in the management of congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^117Jv5Hs]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Consistency of conditions was the principal mechanism proposed by the authors of a trial that demonstrated improved outcomes with up to 48 hours of paralysis early in ARDS. Likewise, a trial in adults with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure found that titrating a cis-atracurium infusion to achieve partial neuromuscular blockade always succeeded in meeting lung-protective ventilation targets while allowing some spontaneous respiratory effort, even when other measures were insufficient. It is important to acknowledge, however, that the utility of paralysis as part of a lung-protective approach in adults may also be due, at least in part, to a reduction in the power of inspiratory efforts made by the patient. The compliant neonatal chest wall seems to mitigate overdistention injury in analogous situations such as laryngospasm as a complication of general anesthesia, perhaps reducing any potential benefit from paralysis.

In addition to providing stable and possibly lung-protective pulmonary mechanics, pharmacological paralysis during the preoperative period may reduce gaseous distention of intrathoracic bowel — distention that can further hamper ventilation and that, on rare occasions, may even cause hemodynamic compromise. Despite these potential benefits, all current consensus guidelines for managing CDHwarn against routine deep sedation and paralysis without any mention of context — delivery room, preoperative stabilization period, or postoperative recovery. The limited evidence for this merits closer inspection.

Terui and colleagues retrospectively reviewed their experience using 'fetal stabilization' (FS), which they hoped would reduce PHT in newborns with CDH. To achieve FS, midazolam and fentanyl were administered to the mother during cesarean section such that the babies were delivered in a sedated state. Despite similar pulmonary pressures, the oxygenation index evaluated shortly after initial stabilization was slightly higher (worse) in FS newborns than in non-FS controls. Unfortunately, the authors do not specify whether higher ventilation pressures were permitted in the FS group to counter the sedation-induced loss of FRC. Additional work on the FS approach was abandoned by these authors based on these findings.

### Etomidate [^115Tb2T5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Intravenous etomidate should be administered only by persons trained in the administration of general anesthetics and in the management of complications encountered during the conduct of general anesthesia.

Because of the hazards of prolonged suppression of endogenous cortisol and aldosterone production, this formulation is not intended for administration by prolonged infusion.

Pediatric Neurotoxicity:

Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans (see PRECAUTIONS /Pregnancy, Pediatric Use, ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND/OR TOXICOLOG Y).

Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.

Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.

### The use of neuromuscular blocking agents in the ICU: where are we now? [^111qJBGf]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Intensivists use neuromuscular blocking agents for a variety of clinical conditions, including for emergency intubation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, status asthmaticus, elevated intracranial pressure, elevated intra-abdominal pressure, and therapeutic hypothermia after ventricular fibrillation-associated cardiac arrest. The continued creation and use of evidence-based guidelines and protocols could ensure that neuromuscular blocking agents are used and monitored appropriately. A collaborative multidisciplinary approach coupled with constant review of the pharmacology, dosing, drug interactions, and monitoring techniques may reduce the adverse events associated with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents.

### Preparing for the unexpected: special considerations and complications after sugammadex administration [^1145tM8Y]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Planned re-establishment of neuromuscular blockade after sugammadex administration

There are three options to re-establish neuromuscular blockade after sugammadex administration: re-administration of rocuronium; use of benzylisoquinolinium NMBAs, and use of succinylcholine.

Sugammadex itself is not metabolized, and most of it will be excreted in urine unchanged. The rate of clearance of sugammadex is similar to the glomerular filtration rate, and its elimination half-life is approximately 100 min. Therefore, when rocuronium is administered soon after neuromuscular reversal with sugammadex, unbound (free) sugammadex molecules left in the circulation have the potential to bind to the administered rocuronium. In such a scenario, re-onset time of rocuronium might be prolonged and duration of action might be shortened. However, re-administration of rocuronium following sugammadex reversal has the advantage that it can still be antagonized by another dose of sugammadex when recovery of function is needed. Cammu et al. reported that re-onset of neuromuscular blockade took longer (mean 3.09 min, range 1.92–4.72 min), especially when rocuronium was administered < 25 min after sugammadex reversal, even after a larger than recommended dose (1.2 mg/kg). In a clinical study, the recommended dose (0.6 mg/kg) of rocuronium re-established neuromuscular blockade within 3 min when it was administered > 3 h after sugammadex reversal (Fig. 1). Since re-onset time of rocuronium after sugammadex administration is unpredictable, 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium or more should be used when reliable and rapid induction of neuromuscular blockade is needed. In clinical settings where rapid induction of neuromuscular blockade is not absolutely necessary and if more than 3 h have passed after the initial sugammadex administration, utilizing rocuronium at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg becomes an additional option to re-establish neuromuscular blockade.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^114pytAx]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) — effects outside the neuromuscular junction and histamine release — have predominantly cardiac effects due to histamine release and ganglionic or muscarinic stimulation; pancuronium and atracurium have the greatest potential to cause adverse cardiac effects, though all NMBAs may do so. All NMBAs potentially react with muscarinic receptors, and pancuronium's muscarinic actions produce tachycardia; tachycardia is the most significant manifestation, while bronchoconstriction is not reported with any frequency. Regarding histamine release, it is predominantly observed with atracurium; pancuronium causes minimal amounts, cisatracurium releases virtually none, rocuronium-associated reports have not been confirmed even with high doses, and hypotension and flushing have been reported after vecuronium with histamine release not observed; histamine release is associated with large doses and rapid administration and is less likely with ICU dosing.

### Phlebitis as a consequence of peripheral intravenous administration of cisatracurium besylate in critically ill patients [^111rwZJw]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

This case report series describes 3 cases of cisatracurium besylate associated phlebitis after an infusion period of 14–20hours. No similar cases have been reported in the literature. Association of phlebitis with another neuromuscular blocking agent, atracurium, has been described in the literature. The acidity of atracurium is thought to be the main cause. It is recommended that atracurium is administered only via central venous catheters when indicated to infuse over prolonged periods of time due to the acidity. Cisatracurium is a stereoisomer of atracurium and as such has the same molecular weight. Although cisatracurium also has a similar acidity as atracurium, a recommendation concerning infusion via a central venous catheter is lacking. We suggest prolonged administration of cisatracurium besylate only via centrally placed venous catheters or if not possible to careful monitor relevant peripheral intravenous sites to diminish the risks of phlebitis and associated complications or other cutaneous reactions.

### Development and potential clinical impairment of ultra-short-acting neuromuscular blocking agents [^111RQcdH]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Developing a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent that, like succinylcholine, has a rapid onset and a short duration of effect remains a goal of ongoing research. While rocuronium fills a portion of this need, the large doses required for rapid intubation render it a much longer-acting neuromuscular blocking agent. Postoperative residual neuromuscular block (NMB) is an increasingly recognized complication of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. This occurs because of dosing choices for neuromuscular blocking agents and anticholinesterases as well as insensitivity of typically used monitors of depth of NMB. While antagonism of NMB is necessary with partial recovery, it is unnecessary with more complete recovery. Even when monitoring with an accelerograph, reversal of NMB is complicated. In addition to the pharmacodynamics of the individual neuromuscular blocking agents, factors such as timing of anticholinesterase administration, dose of anticholinesterase, concomitant medications, electrolyte abnormalities, and hepatic or renal disease can influence the degree of reversal. Sugammadex works differently than anticholinesterases and, when administered in appropriate doses, can reverse even profound block induced with vecuronium or rocuronium. Two new fumarate neuromuscular blocking agents have a rapid onset of effect and can be reversed at any time by administration of cysteine, which could significantly reduce the risk of postoperative residual NMB.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^1124eMLn]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Patients with myasthenia gravis receiving neuromuscular blocking agents — dosing, monitoring, and interactions: We recommend that a reduced dose of an NMBA be used for patients with myasthenia gravis and that the dose should be based on PNS with TOF monitoring (good practice statement), and we make no recommendation on which muscle group should be monitored in patients with myasthenia gravis undergoing treatment with NMBAs (insufficient evidence). Sensitivity to NMBAs varies greatly among patients with myasthenia, and individual assessment is necessary; patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors are at risk for experiencing prolonged neuromuscular blockade due to prolonged inactivation of succinylcholine, pyridostigmine inhibits the metabolism of mivacurium and therefore delays recovery, and discontinuing the cholinesterase inhibitor on the day of surgery increases the risk of respiratory distress.

### Neuromuscular blocking agents in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117MNRAd]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, results of this review suggest that a 48-hour continuous infusion of cisatracurium besylate for patients with severe ARDS reduces 28-day, ICU, and hospital mortality, as well as barotrauma, without increasing the risk of ICU-acquired weakness. Although these findings were derived from a single group of investigators at multiple centers across France, further international multicenter trials maybe warranted to confirm the generalizability of these findings. Meanwhile, many clinicians have adopted NMBA therapy into their routine management of adult ARDS. Given that mortality is the critical outcome of interest in this setting, our findings provide new support for a short-term infusion of cisatracurium besylate for critically ill adults with severe ARDS.

### Neuromuscular blockade and skeletal muscle weakness in critically ill patients: time to rethink the evidence? [^114XkiGA]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Neuromuscular blocking agents are commonly used in critical care. However, concern after observational reports of a causal relationship with skeletal muscle dysfunction and intensive care-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) has resulted in a cautionary and conservative approach to their use. This integrative review, interpreted in the context of our current understanding of the pathophysiology of ICU-AW and integrated into our current conceptual framework of clinical practice, challenges the established clinical view of an adverse relationship between the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and skeletal muscle weakness. In addition to discussing data, this review identifies potential confounders and alternative etiological factors responsible for ICU-AW and provides evidence that neuromuscular blocking agents may not be a major cause of weakness in a 21st century critical care setting.

2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Intravenous Use in Adults

For Short Surgical Procedures

The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg ANECTINE given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose will vary among patients and may be from 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block) [see Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis (5.8), Overdose (10), and Pharmacodynamics (12.2)]. A 5 to 10 mg test dose may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

For Long Surgical Procedures

Continuous Intravenous Infusion

The dose of ANECTINE administered by intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. The average rate for an adult range between 2.5 and 4.3 mg per minute.

### Prolonged paralysis following mivacurium administration in a pediatric patient with previously undiagnosed pseudocholinesterase deficiency: a case report [^113W2543]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In accordance with the clinic's internal guidelines, the patient was given premedication with 0.5 mg/kg body weight of midazolam orally before surgery. Venous access was successfully established, and standard anesthesia monitoring and preoxygenation were carried out in accordance with current international standards. General anesthesia was induced with propofol at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight and alfentanil at a dose of 20 µg/kg body weight. A total dose of 2 mg of mivacurium was administered intravenously for the purpose of achieving neuromuscular block. Following a three-minute interval, the oral tracheal intubation was completed without incident, resulting in a "first-pass success". Anesthesia maintenance was achieved with sevoflurane by inhalation at an age-adapted minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) between 0.8 and 1. Monitoring consisted of non-invasive arterial blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry, and continuous end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement. The surgery lasted a total of 20 min, after which the child did not exhibit any signs of awakening following the discontinuation of sevoflurane. To identify potential medication errors, a comprehensive review of all medications was conducted, and no evidence of an overdose was found. Consequently, the child was observed to be apneic and unresponsive. The patient exhibited clear clinical signs of stress, including elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and profuse sweating. A peripheral nerve stimulator did not trigger any neuromuscular responses. Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring was not used in this case. The patient was able to breathe with adequate frequency under ventilator-assisted mode and full pressure support, which failed each time spontaneous breathing trial was conducted. This strongly suggests the effects of a muscle relaxant. No evidence of hypoxemia or other causes were identified at any point during the observation period, as measured by peripheral arterial saturation levels. Consequently, sedation with propofol was reintroduced and maintained at a dosage of 4 mg/kg/hr. We hypothesized a possible muscle relaxant overdose or an inability of the metabolism thereof, and therefore decided to transfer the sedated, intubated and ventilated patient to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). A re-assessment was conducted in the PICU, with all potential differential diagnoses taken into account. A hematological examination, routine whole blood cell counts, coagulation studies, electrolyte estimates, and pseudocholinesterase levels were sent to a specialized laboratory for further analysis. Subsequently, the child was transferred to a spontaneous ventilation mode and, following the clinical full recovery of the musculoskeletal system, was extubated without incident. Consequently, the child regained consciousness approximately four hours after the surgical procedure. The subsequent course of hospitalization was unremarkable, and the child made a full recovery without short-term complications. The child was discharged the following day in a state of optimal health. A few days after the child was discharged, the results of the specialized laboratory tests arrived. Table 1; Fig. 1 show the detailed values and genotypes:

### Infusion of intrathecal baclofen for acute withdrawal. technical note [^1118uy8T]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Acute baclofen withdrawal syndrome is a life-threatening situation that demands early recognition and urgent treatment. The current therapy of choice for this syndrome is administration of intravenous benzodiazepines, propofol, and chemical paralytic drugs until the intrathecal system can be restored. The authors present a novel technique for administering baclofen intrathecally using a lumbar drain and a standard patient-controlled analgesia pump (in continuous infusion mode). In one case, this method was used to wean the patient from high-dose intrathecal baclofen treatment. In a second case, this method was used as a temporizing measure until the indwelling pump system could be repaired. In both cases, the patients recovered to their neurological baseline level, and lasting consequences of serious withdrawal were avoided.

### Intermediate acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and risk of postoperative respiratory complications: prospective propensity score matched cohort study [^111pdyNw]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Possible biological explanations

A growing body of evidence from volunteer studies and outcome studies suggests that adverse respiratory effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents are probably due to their lingering effects after surgery. Residual neuromuscular blockade increases the vulnerability of the respiratory system in such a way that adverse subclinical signs and symptoms occur. Residual neuromuscular blockade also increases the incidence of adverse respiratory events in the post-anesthesia care unit, such as jaw thrust requirement, and increases the length of stay in the unit, even after use of intermediate acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. Researchers found that residual paralysis was present in 45% of the cases on arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit up to two hours after use of a single dose of an intermediate acting muscle relaxant. On the basis of our data we speculate that lingering effects of neuromuscular blocking agents increase the risk of respiratory vulnerable patients to develop a respiratory compromise, leading to unplanned admission to an intensive care unit. In accordance, in our study the risk of severe respiratory complications was higher in patients undergoing short (< 2 hours) surgical procedures, where the time between use of neuromuscular blocking agents to facilitate intubation and extubation may not have been long enough. Most of the patients undergoing surgical procedures in our study were reintubated for pulmonary edema, pneumonia, atelectasis, and aspiration. Based on this information, we conclude that it is possible that residual paralysis on the first day after surgery may be a contributing factor to reintubation on a subsequent day. Partial paralysis affects the ability to protect the airway during swallowing and should thereby increase the propensity to aspirate or develop pneumonia. The proposed mechanism of pulmonary edema may be negative pressure pulmonary edema; paralytics can induce an upper airway obstruction in the absence of respiratory pump muscle dysfunction.

Expert opinion on clinical application

When considering the RCTs, it is important to underscore that Vt was reduced when airway pressure limits (as specified by protocols for the intervention and control arms of each individual trial) were reached. It is also very important to highlight that the Vt used in the control arms can no longer be considered as "conventional", and that no further trials have been conducted in this area for well over a decade. Moreover, it is unlikely that other RCTs will be conducted in the future given a general lack of equipoise in the field regarding this question. At present, the current approach to support patients with ARDS includes limiting Vt to 4–8 mL/kg PBW and maintaining plateau airway pressure (Pplat) < 30 cmH 2 O. Although some investigators use the terms IBW and PBW interchangeably, Vt should be measured and adjusted using PBW.

Similarly, it is unlikely that an RCT of low Vt ventilation in COVID-19 related ARDS will be conducted. Although patients with COVID-19 were not included in the RCTs which form the basis of these recommendations, there is biological plausibility for the use of low Vt ventilation in these patients since the underlying respiratory system mechanics are similar, and the physiologic mechanisms that underpin the use of low Vt ventilation in non-COVID-19 ARDS are similar. However, the rate of serious and prolonged multidimensional disability, particularly in patients with COVID-19, may be important and may be further exacerbated by the need for prolonged deep sedation with or without paralysis.

WARNINGS

INTRAVENOUS AMIDATE SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED ONLY BY PERSONS TRAINED IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF GENERAL ANESTHETICS AND IN THE MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS ENCOUNTERED DURING THE CONDUCT OF GENERAL ANESTHESIA.

BECAUSE OF THE HAZARDS OF PROLONGED SUPPRESSION OF ENDOGENOUS CORTISOL AND ALDOSTERONE PRODUCTION, THIS FORMULATION IS NOT INTENDED FOR ADMINISTRATION BY PROLONGED INFUSION.

Pediatric Neurotoxicity

Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans (see PRECAUTIONS /Pregnancy, Pediatric Use, ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND/OR TOXICOLOGY).

Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.

Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.

### Peri-operative management of neuromuscular blockade: a guideline from the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care [^115fEN7E]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent data indicated a high incidence of inappropriate management of neuromuscular block, with a high rate of residual paralysis and relaxant-associated postoperative complications. These data are alarming in that the available neuromuscular monitoring, as well as myorelaxants and their antagonists basically allow well tolerated management of neuromuscular blockade. In this first European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) guideline on peri-operative management of neuromuscular block, we aim to present aggregated and evidence-based recommendations to assist clinicians provide best medical care and ensure patient safety. We identified three main clinical questions: Are myorelaxants necessary to facilitate tracheal intubation in adults? Does the intensity of neuromuscular blockade influence a patient's outcome in abdominal surgery? What are the strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of residual paralysis? On the basis of this, PICO (patient, intervention, comparator, outcome) questions were derived that guided a structured literature search. A stepwise approach was used to reduce the number of trials of the initial research (n = 24000) to the finally relevant clinical studies (n = 88). GRADE methodology (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used for formulating the recommendations based on the findings of the included studies in conjunction with their methodological quality. A two-step Delphi process was used to determine the agreement of the panel members with the recommendations: R1 We recommend using a muscle relaxant to facilitate tracheal intubation (1A). R2 We recommend the use of muscle relaxants to reduce pharyngeal and/or laryngeal injury following endotracheal intubation (1C). R3 We recommend the use of a fast-acting muscle relaxant for rapid sequence induction intubation (RSII) such as succinylcholine 1mg kg -1 or rocuronium 0.9 to 1.2mg kg -1 (1B). R4 We recommend deepening neuromuscular blockade if surgical conditions need to be improved (1B). R5 There is insufficient evidence to recommend deep neuromuscular blockade in general to reduce postoperative pain or decrease the incidence of peri-operative complications. (2C). R6 We recommend the use of ulnar nerve stimulation and quantitative neuromuscular monitoring at the adductor pollicis muscle to exclude residual paralysis (1B). R7 We recommend using sugammadex to antagonise deep, moderate and shallow neuromuscular blockade induced by aminosteroidal agents (rocuronium, vecuronium) (1A). R8 We recommend advanced spontaneous recovery (i.e. TOF ratio > 0.2) before starting neostigmine-based reversal and to continue quantitative monitoring of neuromuscular blockade until a TOF ratio of more than 0.9 has been attained.

### Prolonged residual paralysis after a single intubating dose of rocuronium [^111RXaon]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

It is often argued that neuromuscular monitoring is unnecessary when only one dose of an intermediate-acting neuromuscular blocking agent is given. This case report documents that it may take more than 3.5 h before it is possible to antagonize a block caused by a normal dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg kg(-1)). Possible causes of the extremely prolonged duration of action are discussed, as is the importance of quantitative neuromuscular monitoring.

### Rocuronium [^112CsSvK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Need for Adequate Anesthesia

Rocuronium bromide has no known effect on consciousness, pain threshold, or cerebration. Therefore, its administration must be accompanied by adequate anesthesia or sedation.

5.5 Residual Paralysis

In order to prevent complications resulting from residual paralysis, it is recommended to extubate only after the patient has recovered sufficiently from neuromuscular block. Geriatric patients (65 years or older) may be at increased risk for residual neuromuscular block. Other factors which could cause residual paralysis after extubation in the post-operative phase (such as drug interactions or patient condition) should also be considered. If not used as part of standard clinical practice the use of a reversal agent should be considered, especially in those cases where residual paralysis is more likely to occur.

5.6 Long-Term Use in an Intensive Care Unit

Rocuronium bromide has not been studied for long-term use in the intensive care unit (ICU). As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs, apparent tolerance to rocuronium bromide may develop during chronic administration in the ICU. While the mechanism for development of this resistance is not known, receptor up-regulation may be a contributing factor. It is strongly recommended that neuromuscular transmission be monitored continuously during administration and recovery with the help of a nerve stimulator. Additional doses of rocuronium bromide or any other neuromuscular blocking agent should not be given until there is a definite response (one twitch of the train-of-four) to nerve stimulation. Prolonged paralysis and/or skeletal muscle weakness may be noted during initial attempts to wean from the ventilator patients who have chronically received neuromuscular blocking drugs in the ICU.

Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric ICU neuromuscular blockade — sedation and analgesia management: We suggest that sedation and analgesia should be adequate to prevent awareness prior to and throughout NMBA use (conditional, low-level evidence). Adequacy of analgesia and sedation cannot be assessed clinically during NMBA use, and the occurrence rate of accidental awareness during general anesthesia in children is one in 135 by direct questioning and one in 51,500 when determined by spontaneous reporting, with the majority of spontaneously reported cases involving unrelieved pain. The Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference stated that patients with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome should receive minimal yet effective targeted sedation and that NMBAs should be used only when sedation alone is inadequate to achieve effective MV, and the standard of practice for sedation and analgesia provision during NMBAs administration should be to avoid the potential of awareness; the use of NMBAs in a "bolus only" manner or scheduled discontinuation of continuous infusions, if clinically appropriate, permits both assessment of the adequacy of analgesia and sedation and the need for ongoing paralysis.

### Enhanced recovery after bariatric surgery: an Italian consensus statement [^113nWWqL]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular blockade

Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is suggested at the induction of general anesthesia to facilitate airway management and subsequent pulmonary ventilation. Deep compared to moderate NMB optimizes the surgical field view, reduces procedural complications in laparoscopic surgery, and is associated with less postoperative pain. Sugammadex compared to cholinesterase inhibitors provides a more rapid and predictable recovery of rocuronium-induced NMB and is associated with less pain and PONV in the postoperative period and faster discharge to the surgical ward. Quantitative monitoring and complete recovery of the neuromuscular function at the end of surgery are highly recommended.

Protective ventilation

Protective mechanical lung ventilation should be preferred for obese patients undergoing general anesthesia for bariatric surgery because it is associated with reduced postoperative respiratory complications, LOS, and mortality in both non-obese and obese surgical patients.

Slow abdominal insufflation with a maximum intra-abdominal pressure of less than 15 mmHg is advised, when possible, during laparoscopy to favor mechanical lung ventilation. This strategy, combined with limiting surgical time, is associated with a reduction in the risk of postoperative respiratory complications.

Goal-directed fluid therapy

Proper perioperative fluid management avoiding overhydration helps to minimize the risk of PONV, postoperative complications, and prolonged LOS. A goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) has been suggested as an adequate strategy to reduce these risks, even in bariatric surgery. In bariatric surgery, excessive fluid should be avoided, and GDFT should be considered a useful strategy. A GDFT guided by noninvasive indices, such as the Pleth Variability Index, may be a more acceptable monitoring option to GDFT based on invasive methods and, consequently, more widely used in bariatric surgery, even in the ERABS context. Postoperative fluid infusions should be discontinued as soon as possible, with preference given to the enteral route. Intraoperative hypotension (mean arterial pressure of ≤ 65 mmHg), even for a few minutes, is a predictor of renal and myocardial damage. It should thus be avoided or promptly treated in the perioperative period.

### Loperamide hydrochloride [^113kuaBN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Management

Consider loperamide as a possible cause of cardiac arrhythmias in patients who may have a history of opioid abuse or recent ingestion of unknown drugs and in the differential diagnosis of unstable arrhythmias, prolonged QTc or QRS intervals, and Torsades de Pointes.

If loperamide-induced cardiac toxicity is suspected, promptly discontinue the drug and initiate therapy to manage and prevent cardiac arrhythmias and serious outcomes.

In many cases of loperamide overdosage, anti-arrhythmic medications (e.g., magnesium sulfate) were ineffective in resolving the arrhythmias and preventing further episodes of Torsades de Pointes. Electrical cardioversion and overdrive pacing, and isoproterenol continuous infusion were reported to manage QTc prolongation in the setting of overdose.

Laboratory Testing

Loperamide serum concentrations are not widely available or clinically useful to guide patient management.

CNS and Respiratory Depression

Symptoms

Cases of loperamide overdose (including relative overdose due to hepatic dysfunction), may cause opioid toxic effects including CNS depression (e.g., altered mental status, stupor, coordination disorders, somnolence, miosis, muscular hypertonia, respiratory depression), hypotension, urinary retention, and paralytic ileus. Pediatric patients may be more sensitive to CNS effects, including respiratory depression, than adults.

### Enoxaparin sodium [^115mW4Wf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Increased Risk of Hemorrhage

Cases of epidural or spinal hemorrhage and subsequent hematomas have been reported with the use of enoxaparin sodium and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture procedures, resulting in long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of these events is higher with the use of postoperative indwelling epidural catheters, with the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs, with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal surgery or spinal deformity [see Boxed Warning, Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7)].

To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of enoxaparin sodium [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin sodium is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.

Placement or removal of a catheter should be delayed for at least 12 hours after administration of lower doses (30 mg once or twice daily or 40 mg once daily) of enoxaparin sodium and at least 24 hours after the administration of higher doses (0.75 mg/kg twice daily, 1 mg/kg twice daily, or 1.5 mg/kg once daily) of enoxaparin sodium. Anti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial hematoma will be avoided. Patients receiving the 0.75 mg/kg twice-daily dose or the 1 mg/kg twice-daily dose should not receive the second enoxaparin sodium dose in the twice-daily regimen to allow a longer delay before catheter placement or removal. Likewise, although a specific recommendation for timing of a subsequent enoxaparin sodium dose after catheter removal cannot be made, consider delaying this next dose for at least four hours, based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both the risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. For patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/minute, additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin sodium is more prolonged; consider doubling the timing of removal of a catheter, at least 24 hours for the lower prescribed dose of enoxaparin sodium (30 mg once daily) and at least 48 hours for the higher dose (1 mg/kg/day) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Preparing for the unexpected: special considerations and complications after sugammadex administration [^115f3mFp]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Hypermagnesemia and hypothermia

Magnesium administration is used in a variety of perioperative settings including the treatment of torsades de pointes, as a tocolytic in the parturient, as an anticonvulsant in women with preeclampsia and eclampsia, and for facilitating endotracheal intubation by accelerating the onset of NMBA. In addition to decreasing the release of acetylcholine by inhibiting voltage-dependent calcium channels, high plasma levels of this cation also diminish the depolarizing action of acetylcholine at the motor end-plate. Magnesium has also been shown to delay the reversal of vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade by neostigmine and may result in re-occurrence of neuromuscular blockade.

With the significant impact of magnesium on neuromuscular blockade and subsequent reversal with acetylcholinesterase inhibition, its effect on reversal with sugammadex has been questioned. Animal models demonstrate mixed results when investigating whether raising plasma magnesium levels impacts the dose of sugammadex needed to reverse neuromuscular blockade. Aside from one observational study that suggested patients may need sugammadex doses exceeding 14 mg/kg in the presence of a magnesium infusion for the treatment of HELLP syndrome, the remaining literature suggests that reversal with standard doses of sugammadex is not prolonged in patients receiving clinically-relevant doses of intravenous magnesium. While utilizing magnesium infusions in an effort to blunt the cardiac response to airway management, Carron et al. described using a standard dose of sugammadex to reverse moderate neuromuscular blockade in a morbidly obese patient. Complete reversal was noted within 60 s of administration. Two randomized controlled trials have also demonstrated no prolongation in the recovery time from moderate and deep levels of neuromuscular blockade using standard doses of sugammadex in patients receiving magnesium boluses. Filho et al. randomly assigned 73 patients to receive either magnesium sulphate (40 mg/kg) or saline and found no difference in reversal time between the two groups following sugammadex administration. In a similar study, Czarnetzki et al. randomized 32 patients to receive magnesium sulfate (60 mg/kg) or placebo. The average time for reversal of moderate neuromuscular blockade was again not significantly different between the two groups. While the available clinical trials are discordant with animal models and do not suggest magnesium delays neuromuscular blockade reversal by sugammadex, close monitoring (preferably, using objective means) and cautious clinical judgment are still prudent as clinicians gain experience with this reversal agent.

### Rocuronium [^112hWJ7H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Use by Continuous Infusion

Infusion at an initial rate of 10 to 12 mcg/kg/min of rocuronium bromide should be initiated only after early evidence of spontaneous recovery from an intubating dose. Due to rapid redistribution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] and the associated rapid spontaneous recovery, initiation of the infusion after substantial return of neuromuscular function (more than 10% of control T1), may necessitate additional bolus doses to maintain adequate block for surgery.

Upon reaching the desired level of neuromuscular block, the infusion of rocuronium bromide must be individualized for each patient. The rate of administration should be adjusted according to the patient's twitch response as monitored with the use of a peripheral nerve stimulator. In clinical trials, infusion rates have ranged from 4 to 16 mcg/kg/min.

Inhalation anesthetics, particularly enflurane and isoflurane, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. In the presence of steady-state concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane, it may be necessary to reduce the rate of infusion by 30 to 50%, at 45 to 60 minutes after the intubating dose.

Spontaneous recovery and reversal of neuromuscular blockade following discontinuation of rocuronium bromide infusion may be expected to proceed at rates comparable to that following comparable total doses administered by repetitive bolus injections [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### An assessment of the practice of neuromuscular blockade and the association between its prophylactic use and outcomes among postoperative pediatric cardiac patients [^111k8u4M]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The authors investigated the management of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) for pediatric patients after cardiac surgery, and compared the outcomes of patients who received prophylactic NMBA (pNMBA) infusions and patients without pNMBA infusions.

Design

A retrospective cohort study.

Setting

At a tertiary teaching hospital.

Participants

Patients younger than 18, with congenital heart disease, who underwent cardiac surgery.

Interventions

Commencement of NMBA infusion in the first 2 hours after surgery MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary endpoint was a composite of one or more of the following major adverse events (MAEs) that occurred within 7 days after surgery: death from any cause, a circulatory collapse that needed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The secondary endpoints included the total duration of mechanical ventilation for the first 30 days after surgery. A total of 566 patients were included in this study. The MAEs occurred in 13 patients (2.3%). An NMBA was commenced within 2 hours after surgery in 207 patients (36.6%). There were significant differences in the incidence of postoperative MAEs between the pNMBA group and the non-pNMBA group (5.3% v 0.6%; p < 0.001). In multivariate regression models, pNMBA infusion was not significantly associated with the incidence of MAEs (odds ratio: 1.79, 95% CI: 0.23–13.93, p = 0.58), but was significantly associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation by 3.85 days (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Postoperative prophylactic neuromuscular blockade after cardiac surgery can be associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, but has no association with MAEs among pediatric patients with congenital heart disease.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^114pQjWT]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) — mechanism and patient factors — include the depolarizing agent succinylcholine, which is an agonist at nicotinic receptors producing fasciculations followed by paralysis, with a duration of effect of only 3 to 5 minutes and therefore used for short procedures; it is not used for prolonged blockade in the ICU. Nondepolarizing NMBAs are competitive antagonists at nicotinic receptors and include benzylisoquinolinium and aminosteroid compounds that are ionized, water-soluble at physiologic pH. Many drugs and conditions increase the potency of nondepolarizing NMBAs, potency is inversely related to speed of onset, patients with myasthenia gravis are especially sensitive, and burn injuries confer resistance due to up-regulation of nicotinic receptors on the sarcolemma.

### The syndrome of irreversible acidosis after prolonged propofol infusion [^1117h88T]. Neurocritical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Propofol infusion syndrome is described in the pediatric literature as metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and bradycardia that results in death. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is thought to be activation of the systemic inflammatory response, which culminates in acidosis and muscle necrosis.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective chart review of three patients in the Neurological Critical Care Units at Hahnemann and Massachusetts General Hospitals between October 2001 and September 2004.

Results

Patient 1: A 27-year-old woman had seizures secondary to hemorrhage from an arteriovenous malformation. Propofol coma was induced for sedation. After initiation of propofol, she developed a metabolic acidosis, hypotension, and bradycardia and expired. Patient 2: A 64-year-old man presented in status epilepticus. After prolonged propofol administration, he developed metabolic acidosis, hypotension, and rhabdomyolysis and expired. Patient 3: A 24-year-old woman presented in status epilepticus secondary to encephalitis. Propofol was added for seizure control. She developed hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and bradyarrhythmias. Despite transvenous pacing, she expired.

Conclusion

These data show an association between extended propofol use and metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and death in adults, as well as children. Risk factors for propofol infusion syndrome in adults include lean body mass index, high dose, and administration of more than 24-hour duration. Creatine phosphokinase, lactic acid levels, electrolytes, and arterial blood gases should be monitored frequently. Both bacterial and fungal cultures should be obtained. If this syndrome is suspected, hemodialysis should be considered. In fatal cases, autopsy should include electron microscopy of cardiac and skeletal muscle to look for mitochondrial dysfunction. Further study is warranted.

### The standard of care of patients with ARDS: ventilatory settings and rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia [^115XCaUw]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Supportive therapies

Neuromuscular blockade

In ARDS patients with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio lower than 150 mmHg early treatment with continuous infusion of cisatracurium for 48 h reduces 90-day mortality and barotrauma and increases the number of ventilator-free days and the number of days outside the ICU without increasing the risk of ICU-acquired weakness. The precise mechanism resulting in improved outcomes is not clear. In terms of lung mechanics, better synchrony may lead to more-uniform lung recruitment and improved compliance, gas exchange, and systemic oxygenation. With respect to lung inflammation, it is plausible that improved control of inspiratory volumes and pressures reduces volutrauma, while better control of expiratory volumes and pressures reduces atelectrauma; the result is less pulmonary and systemic inflammation. According to the study protocol, clinicians did not monitor the depth of paralysis with peripheral nerve stimulation, but rather when plateau pressures exceeded 32 cmH 2 O (for more than 10 min, despite increased sedation) an intravenous bolus of cisatracurium was administered. The outcome benefit for rescue therapy with neuromuscular blockade is applicable only to cisatracurium besylate and not to all neuromuscular blocking agents. Optimal dosing and monitoring strategies will need to be further studied.

### Randomised controlled trial comparing cisatracurium and vecuronium infusions in a paediatric intensive care unit [^116fJGvh]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate and compare the efficacy, infusion rate and recovery profile of vecuronium and cisatracurium continuous infusion in critically ill children requiring mechanical ventilation.

Design and Setting

Prospective, randomised, double-blind, single-centre study in critically ill children in a paediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary children's hospital.

Methods

Thirty-seven children from 3 months to 16 years old (median 4.1 year) were randomised to receive either drug; those already receiving more than 6 h of neuromuscular blocking drugs were excluded. The Train-of-Four (TOF) Watch maintained neuromuscular blockade to at least one twitch in the TOF response. Recovery time was measured from cessation of infusion until spontaneous TOF ratio recovery of 70%.

Results

The cisatracurium infusion rate in nineteen children averaged 3.9 ± 1.3 microg kg(-1) min(-1) with a median duration of 63 h (IQR 23–88). The vecuronium infusion rate in 18 children averaged mean 2.6 ± 1.3 microg kg(-1) min(-1) with a median duration of 40 h (IQR 27–72). Median time to recovery was significantly shorter with cisatracurium (52 min, 35–73) than with vecuronium (123 min, 80–480). Prolonged recovery of neuromuscular function (> 24 h) occurred in one child (6%) on vecuronium.

Conclusions

Recovery of neuromuscular function after discontinuation of neuromuscular blocking drug infusion in children is significantly faster with cisatracurium than vecuronium. Neuromuscular monitoring was not sufficient to eliminate prolonged recovery in children on vecuronium infusions.

PICO question IX — safety of prolonged infusion (PI) versus short infusion (SI) β‑lactams: We cannot recommend for or against the use of PI over SI to provide a safety advantage and reduce adverse effects of β‑lactam antibiotics. (Conditional recommendation; very low certainty of evidence). Currently, no clinical trials have demonstrated a safety advantage for PI β‑lactam antibiotics when compared to administration via SI, and across adverse events reported within 18 RCTs and 8 observational studies — including acute kidney injury, diarrhea (including Clostridioides difficile infection), phlebitis or infusion‑related infections, and transaminitis — there was no apparent difference when administration time is prolonged.

### Epidural analgesia after spinal surgery via intervertebral foramen [^115fjPZ5]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing major spinal surgery may experience significant postoperative pain. Epidural analgesia has previously been shown to be safe and effective and may confer some advantages over opioid-based postoperative analgesia. We discuss the case of a 47-yr-old female patient undergoing the prolonged anterior component of a lower thoracic/upper lumbar spine correction involving the stripping of the diaphragm from the lower thoracic spine and retraction of the left lower lobe of the lung. Despite initially planning opioid-based postoperative analgesia, a joint anaesthetic and surgical decision was made to use epidural analgesia in an attempt to avoid potential postoperative respiratory complications. Because of the surgical anatomy of the correction, the catheter was inserted via the T11 intervertebral foramen. A bolus of bupivacaine 0.25% intraoperatively with a postoperative infusion of bupivacaine 0.167% with diamorphine 0.1 mg ml(-1) provided excellent analgesia. The technique was associated with no postoperative complications.

Neuromuscular blockade

Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) improves oxygenation via several mechanisms. Paralysis decreases oxygen consumption, eliminates ventilator dyssynchrony, and improves thoracopulmonary compliance. The ACURASYS trial in 2010 demonstrated a mortality benefit with 48 h of NMB with cisatracurium in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (P/F < 150). The larger multicenter ROSE trial in 2019 found no significant mortality benefit using NMB in moderate-to-severe ARDS. However, patients already receiving NMB at the time of enrollment were excluded and it is possible that a subset of patients still benefit from NMB when deemed beneficial by clinician judgment. Additionally, in contrast to ACURASYS, the ROSE control arm received less sedation than the NMB group, which has been previously associated with improved ICU outcomes. While it is evident that NMB improves oxygenation, it is controversial whether it confers a mortality benefit.

Prolonged use of NMB increases the risk of neuromuscular weakness and muscle loss, pressure injuries, and deep vein thromboses, and requires deep sedation which can increase delirium and neurocognitive impairment and decrease ventilator-free days. When using NMB agents, train-of-four (TOF) monitoring may be used to titrate to the lowest effective dose. Deep sedation is also required during NMB and may be titrated using bispectral index (BIS) to a goal of 40 to 60.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^115AhhFd]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for reversal of neuromuscular blockade, more specifically with respect to patients with traumatic brain injury, SCCM 2016 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of neuromuscular blockade in patients with acute brain injury and raised ICP.

### Prolonged vs intermittent infusions of β-lactam antibiotics in adults with sepsis or septic shock… [^1154hLYQ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The orange area is related to an RR greater than 1. The dotted line at an RR of 1 indicates no treatment effect. The figure demonstrates that the probability that prolonged infusions of β-lactam antibiotics is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause 90-day mortality compared with intermittent infusions is more than 99%. Meaning Prolonged infusions of β-lactam antibiotics are associated with a reduced risk of death in critically ill adult patients with sepsis or septic shock compared with intermittent infusions. Importance There is uncertainty about whether prolonged infusions of β-lactam antibiotics improve clinically important outcomes in critically ill adults with sepsis or septic shock.

Conclusions and Relevance Among adults in the intensive care unit who had sepsis or septic shock, the use of prolonged β-lactam antibiotic infusions was associated with a reduced risk of 90-day mortality compared with intermittent infusions. The current evidence presents a high degree of certainty for clinicians to consider prolonged infusions as a standard of care in the management of sepsis and septic shock. Randomized clinical trials that recruited critically ill adult participants with sepsis or septic shock and compared the administration of prolonged infusions with intermittent infusions of 1 or more β-lactam antibiotics were included. Conventional and current definitions of sepsis and septic shock at participant recruitment were accepted.

18–21 Prolonged infusion was defined as either an extended infusion or a continuous infusion. Using a bayesian random-effects model with vague priors, the pooled estimated RR for all-cause 90-day mortality for prolonged infusions of β-lactam antibiotics compared with intermittent infusions was 0. 86, with a
99. 1% posterior probability that prolonged infusions were associated with lower 90-day mortality. The primary outcome of all-cause 90-day mortality was evaluated in 7 prespecified subgroups.

### Update on vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks… [^113k5Ti4]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary What is already known about this topic. Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses can emerge and cause paralysis in areas with low population poliovirus immunity. Since 2017, large cVDPV type 2 outbreaks have occurred, primarily in Africa. Abstract Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses can emerge and lead to outbreaks of paralytic polio as well as asymptomatic transmission in communities with a high percentage of undervaccinated children. Using data from the World Health Organization Polio Information System and Global Polio Laboratory Network, this report describes global polio outbreaks due to cVDPVs during January 2023–June 2024 and updates previous reports. Introduction Live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine induces long-term protection against paralytic disease, and limits virus shedding in vaccinated persons with infection.

Prolonged community circulation of the vaccine strain leads to reversion to neurovirulence, seeding new emergences. Gaps in poliovirus surveillance can delay outbreak response activities and provide a longer opportunity for virus to spread. Efforts are underway to strengthen surveillance systems and improve the capacity to confirm cVDPV outbreaks by increasing the number of laboratories accredited by GPLN to perform genomic sequencing. The current GPEI target is to stop all cVDPV transmission by the end of 2026. Continued circulation of cVDPVs highlights the need for 1) increased urgency to implement prompt, high-quality SIAs upon detection of new cVDPV outbreaks and 2) enhanced efforts, such as more engagement with humanitarian nongovernmental organizations, to vaccinate children in security-compromised areas and in hard-to-reach communities.
