## Question

what if it is a burning sensation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do when the symptom is a burning sensation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic location and distribution of the burning. Then, I should verify the temporal pattern and triggers. Next, I will consider associated symptoms and risk factors. After that, I need to construct a prioritized differential diagnosis by mechanism. Then, I should outline a focused diagnostic workup. Finally, I will propose mechanism-based management and highlight red flags and follow-up needs, making sure I double-check each claim against the best available sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the importance of location and distribution, because burning is a descriptor that spans mucosal, cutaneous, and visceral territories and the anatomic pattern narrows the differential dramatically. Burning in the mouth or tongue points toward burning mouth syndrome or secondary oral causes, burning on the skin suggests neuropathic or inflammatory dermatoses, burning in the chest raises GERD or cardiac etiologies, burning in the feet implicates peripheral neuropathy, and burning in the genital or vulvar area directs me to vulvodynia or other localized pain syndromes, so I need to anchor the symptom to site before proceeding [^77dd75e1] [^1bf5519a] [^793583fc] [^db2e832a] [^7009ce3f].

> Wait, let me verify the temporal pattern next, because the diurnal variation and meal-related behavior carry diagnostic weight in several entities. In burning mouth syndrome, pain often starts mildly in the morning, escalates through the day, and peaks in the evening, with frequent taste disturbances and a paradoxical improvement during meals; in contrast, ischemic cardiac pain is typically exertional or pressure-like and not purely burning, and GERD-related burning often follows meals or recumbency, so I should explicitly ask about morning-to-evening progression, meal effects, and nocturnal symptoms before concluding a pattern [^06acc122] [^e8f14299] [^793583fc].

> I need to check associated symptoms and risk factors carefully, because they pivot the pretest probabilities. Xerostomia, dysgeusia, and anxiety or depression co-occur in burning mouth syndrome; diabetes, alcohol use, and chemotherapy increase the likelihood of peripheral neuropathy with burning; menopause and hormonal shifts are overrepresented in BMS; and Parkinson disease can manifest central or radicular burning pain, so I should screen for these comorbidities and exposures explicitly rather than assume idiopathy [^b4495f9d] [^db2e832a] [^1be1fef8] [^43bfda1a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should organize the differential by pathophysiology to avoid anchoring. Mechanistically, burning sensations arise from neuropathic injury, inflammatory or mucosal irritation, ischemia, and functional or psychophysiologic syndromes; within neuropathic pain, I must distinguish peripheral small-fiber neuropathy, focal compressive neuropathies, and central pain syndromes, because this classification guides both testing and treatment choices [^1bf5519a] [^3aa1f7f1].

> Let me consider neuropathic etiologies first, since burning is a classic neuropathic descriptor. Small-fiber neuropathy often presents with burning, allodynia, and autonomic changes such as sweating abnormalities; diabetic, alcoholic, and chemotherapy-induced neuropathies frequently include burning; trigeminal neuropathies and burning mouth syndrome reflect peripheral or central trigeminal pathway dysfunction; and central post-stroke pain or Parkinson-related pain can produce burning without peripheral sensory loss, so I should confirm distribution, sensory findings, and autonomic signs before labeling a neuropathic source [^db2e832a] [^1be1fef8] [^dd2b58e5] [^7338de5d] [^43bfda1a].

> Next, I should review inflammatory and mucosal causes, because secondary burning can be curable if the driver is treated. Oral candidiasis, lichen planus, contact allergies including nickel from dental materials, and xerostomia can all produce burning; GERD can cause retrosternal burning; and vulvar dermatoses or infections can underlie vulvar burning, so I need to examine mucosa, dentition, and skin carefully and correlate with exposures and hygiene products [^6421fd3c] [^793583fc] [^7009ce3f].

> I will now examine ischemic and vascular considerations, especially when burning is in the chest or extremities. Cardiac ischemia can present as burning chest discomfort, though pressure or tightness is more typical; peripheral arterial disease can cause burning in the feet with exertion; and complex regional pain syndrome after nerve injury produces severe burning with vasomotor and sudomotor changes, so I should confirm exertional patterns, pulse status, and autonomic skin changes before concluding a vascular mechanism [^e8f14299] [^3e4b32f9].

> But wait, what if this is a functional or psychophysiologic syndrome. Burning mouth syndrome remains a diagnosis of exclusion characterized by intraoral burning without clinical or laboratory abnormalities, with evidence of peripheral or central neuropathic mechanisms in many patients; fibromyalgia features widespread burning pain with central sensitization; and functional dyspepsia can include epigastric burning, so I should double-check for exclusion criteria and consider validated screening tools like DN4 or PainDETECT when neuropathic pain is suspected [^b4495f9d] [^09f575d3] [^e92928ac] [^1bf5519a].

> Next, I should review the focused diagnostic workup, and I need to ensure I do not over-order tests. For suspected BMS, I should exclude local and systemic causes with targeted labs such as CBC, B12, iron, glucose, thyroid function, and HbA1c, and consider salivary flow assessment; for suspected neuropathic pain, I should perform a sensory exam and consider DN4 or LANSS, with EMG/NCS if deficits are found, and consider QST or skin biopsy if small-fiber involvement is suspected; for chest burning, I should prioritize cardiac evaluation when indicated; for ocular burning, I should assess the ocular surface and consider neuropathic ocular pain tools; and for vulvar burning, I should perform a careful exam and cotton-swab mapping before labeling vulvodynia [^1bf5519a] [^899c543e] [^f05a1962] [^7009ce3f].

> I should confirm mechanism-based management principles, because treatment hinges on etiology. For confirmed BMS, topical clonazepam rinses, capsaicin desensitization, and CBT have the best evidence and should be individualized; for peripheral neuropathic pain, SNRIs like duloxetine, gabapentinoids, and TCAs are first-line; for GERD-related burning, PPI therapy and lifestyle measures are appropriate; for small-fiber neuropathy, address the cause and consider symptomatic neuropathic agents; and for functional syndromes, multidisciplinary care with education and behavioral strategies is key, so I need to match therapy to mechanism rather than default to analgesics alone [^b4495f9d] [^2b713f8d] [^793583fc] [^1ff0b278].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags and safety nets so I do not miss emergencies. New-onset burning chest discomfort warrants cardiac evaluation; rapidly progressive burning with weakness suggests Guillain-Barré or acute neuropathy; burning with severe autonomic changes or skin color/temperature shifts raises concern for CRPS; and burning with systemic toxicity such as after paraquat ingestion signals poor prognosis, so I need to escalate urgently when these features appear [^e8f14299] [^3e4b32f9] [^d1e976a5].

> Let me reconsider the initial premise to ensure internal consistency. Burning is a symptom, not a diagnosis, and its value lies in localizing the generator and suggesting a mechanism; by mapping location, chronology, associated features, and risk factors, and by applying a tiered diagnostic approach, I can usually distinguish neuropathic, inflammatory, ischemic, and functional etiologies and tailor therapy accordingly, which aligns with contemporary neuropathic pain algorithms and BMS reviews [^1bf5519a] [^b4495f9d].

A burning sensation is a **common symptom** with a broad differential, including neuropathic, inflammatory, ischemic, and functional etiologies [^1bf5519a]. Key causes include peripheral neuropathy (diabetes, chemotherapy, alcohol), burning mouth syndrome, GERD, vulvodynia, and medication side effects [^db2e832a] [^1be1fef8] [^b4495f9d] [^793583fc] [^7009ce3f] [^c108dbca]. Evaluation should be **guided by location, chronicity, and associated features**, using targeted history, exam, and labs; management is cause-specific, with neuropathic pain regimens, topical clonazepam or capsaicin for BMS, and PPIs for GERD [^1ff0b278] [^b4495f9d] [^793583fc]. Persistent or unexplained burning warrants **neurology or pain referral** to exclude serious disease and optimize symptom control [^899c543e].

## Common causes of burning sensation

Burning sensations arise from **diverse mechanisms** — neuropathic, inflammatory, ischemic, and functional — and span multiple systems:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Neuropathic | - Peripheral neuropathy (diabetes, chemotherapy, alcohol) [^db2e832a] [^1be1fef8] <br/> - Burning mouth syndrome [^b4495f9d] <br/> - Postherpetic neuralgia <br/> - Complex regional pain syndrome [^3e4b32f9] |
| Inflammatory | - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [^793583fc] <br/> - Vulvodynia [^7009ce3f] <br/> - Contact dermatitis [^6421fd3c] <br/> - Interstitial cystitis |
| Ischemic | - Peripheral arterial disease <br/> - Raynaud's phenomenon <br/> - Cardiac ischemia (angina) [^e8f14299] |
| Functional/psychogenic | - Fibromyalgia [^09f575d3] <br/> - Functional dyspepsia [^e92928ac] <br/> - Anxiety-related somatic symptoms |

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Burning sensations reflect **distinct pathophysiology**:

- **Neuropathic pain**: Spontaneous hyperactivity in nociceptive pathways, ectopic discharges, and central sensitization cause burning, allodynia, and hyperalgesia [^3aa1f7f1] [^51365ad9].
- **Inflammatory processes**: Cytokine release and tissue injury activate nociceptors, producing burning pain [^notfound].
- **Ischemia**: Tissue hypoxia and acidosis stimulate nociceptors, causing burning pain [^notfound].
- **Functional disorders**: Central sensitization and altered pain processing contribute to burning without identifiable organic disease [^09f575d3] [^e92928ac].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History**: Onset, duration, location, intensity, triggers, alleviating factors, associated symptoms (dryness, taste changes, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety/depression) [^1bf5519a].
- **Physical examination**: Focused exam of the affected area, sensory testing, and assessment for neuropathic signs (allodynia, hyperalgesia, sensory deficits) [^899c543e].
- **Diagnostic tests**: Tailored to suspected etiology — blood tests (glucose, B12, thyroid), nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing, skin biopsy, endoscopy, or imaging as indicated [^899c543e].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **cause-specific**:

- **Neuropathic pain**: Gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, tricyclic antidepressants, topical agents (capsaicin, lidocaine) [^1ff0b278].
- **Burning mouth syndrome**: Topical clonazepam, capsaicin rinses, cognitive behavioral therapy, alpha-lipoic acid [^b4495f9d] [^2b713f8d].
- **GERD**: Proton pump inhibitors, lifestyle modifications [^notfound].
- **Vulvodynia**: Topical lidocaine, pelvic floor therapy, tricyclic antidepressants [^notfound].
- **Functional disorders**: Multidisciplinary care, psychological support, symptom-targeted therapies [^e5c18e55].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by **etiology** and response to therapy. Chronic burning pain can cause significant distress, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life [^9268e151]. Persistent symptoms may lead to disability and psychosocial complications if untreated [^9268e151].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Seek care for **burning sensations** that are persistent, severe, or accompanied by:

- Neurological deficits (weakness, numbness, coordination loss)
- Gastrointestinal bleeding, weight loss, or dysphagia
- Cardiac symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations)
- Signs of infection or systemic illness (fever, rash, joint pain)
- Significant psychological distress or functional impairment

---

A burning sensation is a **multifaceted symptom** with diverse causes; a focused evaluation and mechanism-based treatment are key to relief, and persistent or unexplained cases warrant specialist referral.

### The practical evaluation and management of patients with symptoms of a sore burning mouth [^13201c95]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

There are many etiologic factors to consider in a patient who presents with symptoms or sensations of a sore burning mouth. These range from local causes within the oral cavity to underlying systemic disease, including psychologic factors. This paper aims to describe the different clinical presentations and to outline a systematic approach to the evaluation and management of such patients. The clinician will be directed to the relevant diagnosis by following the traditional medical model of taking a focused history, performing a thorough clinical examination, considering the potential differential diagnoses, and requesting pertinent and appropriate investigations. The various differential diagnoses and broad treatment options will also be discussed and outlined. This paper will not, however, discuss burning mouth syndrome (oral dysesthesia), which is a diagnosis of exclusion, whereby the oral mucosa is clinically normal and there are no identifiable medical or dental causes to account for the patient's symptoms.

### Burning mouth syndrome [^95c7ccee]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Pain in the tongue or oral tissues described as "burning" has been referred to by many terms including burning mouth syndrome. When a burning sensation in the mouth is caused by local or systemic factors, it is called secondary burning mouth syndrome and when these factors are treated the pain will resolve. When burning mouth syndrome occurs in the absence of identified risk indicators, the term primary burning mouth syndrome is utilized. This article focuses on descriptions, etiologic theories, and management of primary burning mouth syndrome, a condition for which underlying causative agents have been ruled out.

### Burning mouth syndrome: current clinical, physiopathologic, and therapeutic data [^06ed3d19]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is defined as an "intraoral burning for which no medical or dental cause was found." Lifetime prevalence ranges from 3.7% to 18% - 40% in the elderly. There is no consensus among experts on the diagnostic criteria of BMS, the etiology is poorly understood, and there are no existing clinical guidelines. Therefore, BMS is often underdiagnosed and its management complex. For patients with BMS, this lack of clinical expertise may result in decreased quality of life and increased psychological distress.We conducted a systematic review to identify clinical features, pathophysiology, and therapeutic strategies for BMS. We discuss the multifactorial origin, involving peripheral nerve dysfunction and hormonal dysfunction, as well as psychological traits. We also describe the results of randomized clinical trials for each treatment through a pathophysiologic approach. This review should help clinicians recognize BMS, understand its pathophysiology, and gain an enhanced scientific understanding of therapeutic alternatives.

### How diagnostic tests help to disentangle the mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain symptoms in painful neuropathies [^51365ad9]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain, ie, pain arising directly from a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory afferent pathway, manifests with various symptoms, the commonest being ongoing burning pain, electrical shock-like sensations, and dynamic mechanical allodynia. Reliable insights into the mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain symptoms come from diagnostic tests documenting and quantifying somatosensory afferent pathway damage in patients with painful neuropathies. Neurophysiological investigation and skin biopsy studies suggest that ongoing burning pain primarily reflects spontaneous activity in nociceptive-fiber pathways. Electrical shock-like sensations presumably arise from high-frequency ectopic bursts generated in demyelinated, nonnociceptive, Aβ fibers. Although the mechanisms underlying dynamic mechanical allodynia remain debatable, normally innocuous stimuli might cause pain by activating spared and sensitized nociceptive afferents. Extending the mechanistic approach to neuropathic pain symptoms might advance targeted therapy for the individual patient and improve testing for new drugs.

### Burning mouth syndrome [^9686fa2f]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning sensation in the tongue or other oral sites, usually in the absence of clinical and laboratory findings. Affected patients often present with multiple oral complaints, including burning, dryness and taste alterations. Burning mouth complaints are reported more often in women, especially after menopause. Typically, patients awaken without pain but note increasing symptoms through the day and into the evening. Conditions that have been reported in association with burning mouth syndrome include chronic anxiety or depression, various nutritional deficiencies, type 2 diabetes (formerly known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) and changes in salivary function. However, these conditions have not been consistently linked with the syndrome, and their treatment has had little impact on burning mouth symptoms. Recent studies have pointed to dysfunction of several cranial nerves associated with taste sensation as a possible cause of burning mouth syndrome. Given in low dosages, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be effective in patients with burning mouth syndrome. Topical capsaicin has been used in some patients.

### Reappraising neuropathic pain in humans – how symptoms help disclose mechanisms [^3aa1f7f1]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain--that is, pain arising directly from a lesion or disease that affects the somatosensory system--is a common clinical problem, and typically causes patients intense distress. Patients with neuropathic pain have sensory abnormalities on clinical examination and experience pain of diverse types, some spontaneous and others provoked. Spontaneous pain typically manifests as ongoing burning pain or paroxysmal electric shock-like sensations. Provoked pain includes pain induced by various stimuli or even gentle brushing (dynamic mechanical allodynia). Recent clinical and neurophysiological studies suggest that the various pain types arise through distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Ongoing burning pain primarily reflects spontaneous hyperactivity in nociceptive-fibre pathways, originating from 'irritable' nociceptors, regenerating nerve sprouts or denervated central neurons. Paroxysmal sensations can be caused by several mechanisms; for example, electric shock-like sensations probably arise from high-frequency bursts generated in demyelinated non-nociceptive Aβ fibres. Most human and animal findings suggest that brush-evoked allodynia originates from Aβ fibres projecting onto previously sensitized nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn, with additional contributions from plastic changes in the brainstem and thalamus. Here, we propose that the emerging mechanism-based approach to the study of neuropathic pain might aid the tailoring of therapy to the individual patient, and could be useful for drug development.

### Burning mouth syndrome [^4d239c48]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Objective To review the clinical entity of primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS), its pathophysiological mechanisms, accurate new diagnostic methods and evidence-based treatment options, and to describe novel lines for future research regarding aetiology, pathophysiology, and new therapeutic strategies. Description Primary BMS is a chronic neuropathic intraoral pain condition that despite typical symptoms lacks clear clinical signs of neuropathic involvement. With advanced diagnostic methods, such as quantitative sensory testing of small somatosensory and taste afferents, neurophysiological recordings of the trigeminal system, and peripheral nerve blocks, most BMS patients can be classified into the peripheral or central type of neuropathic pain. These two types differ regarding pathophysiological mechanisms, efficacy of available treatments, and psychiatric comorbidity. The two types may overlap in individual patients. BMS is most frequent in postmenopausal women, with general population prevalence of around 1%. Treatment of BMS is difficult; best evidence exists for efficacy of topical and systemic clonazepam. Hormonal substitution, dopaminergic medications, and therapeutic non-invasive neuromodulation may provide efficient mechanism-based treatments for BMS in the future. Conclusion We present a novel comprehensive hypothesis of primary BMS, gathering the hormonal, neuropathic, and genetic factors presumably required in the genesis of the condition. This will aid in future research on pathophysiology and risk factors of BMS, and boost treatment trials taking into account individual mechanism profiles and subgroup-clusters.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^90fd9442]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

4. Revised grading system

The grading system is intended for determining the level of certainty with which the pain in question is neuropathic. A finding of probable neuropathic pain in a given individual patient should prompt consideration of treatment according to the neuropathic pain treatment guidelines,but the grading system is not intended for medico-legal purposes or to classify diseases. The refinements in the present grading system (Fig. 2) follow the classical clinical method of diagnosis in that history, clinical examination, and diagnostic tests stepwise add to level of certainty that the pain in question is neuropathic.

4.1. Possible neuropathic pain

Evaluation of the patient according to the grading system should be undertaken if the patient's history suggests that pain could be related to a neurological lesion or disease and not other causes such as inflammation or non-neural tissue damage. At this stage, pain descriptors, the presence of nonpainful sensory symptoms, and any aggravating and alleviating factors can be taken into account. Pain descriptions such as burning or hot, electric shocks or shooting, pricking or pins and needles, pain evoked by light touching or cold, and nonpainful sensations such as numbness and tingling are suggestive, but not pathognomonic for neuropathic pain, and other descriptors may apply as well.The combination of several descriptors, however, has a highly discriminant value and several screening tools (questionnaires) have been developed to identify patients who may have neuropathic pain to alert the clinician to undertake further assessment (though they cannot be used alone to identify neuropathic pain). These include, but are not limited to the LANSS,the neuropathic pain questionnaire,the Douleur Neuropathique en 4 questions,the painDETECT,and ID-Pain.

The following two criteria need to be fulfilled to reach the first level of certainty-“possible” neuropathic pain.

### Burning mouth syndrome: recognition, understanding, and management [^ee2deac2]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) can be a frustrating condition to the patient and the practitioner because the patient often experiences a continuous burning pain in the mouth without any apparent clinical signs, but the practitioner is unable to definitively diagnose symptoms even with the use of diagnostic testing or imaging. To overcome this dilemma, it is important for the practitioner to recognize and understand the complexities of BMS. The practitioner can then develop a sound approach to management of this condition and patients can be educated and reassured regarding BMS.

### A systematic review of treatment for patients with burning mouth syndrome [^b4495f9d]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is defined as idiopathic orofacial pain with intraoral burning or dysaesthesia recurring daily for more than 2 hours per day and more than 3 months, without any identifiable causative lesions, with and without somatosensory changes in International Classification of Orofacial Pain, 2020 (1). BMS prevalence ranges from 0.1% to 3.9% and is primarily present in postmenopausal women aged between 50 and 70 (2,3). BMS commonly manifests as burning, prickling, tingling, itching or numbness affecting the tongue, lip, palate, gums and other oral mucosae. The pain intensity increases throughout the day and peaks in the late evening. Patients often complain of dysgeusia, xerostomia, altered sensation in the oral mucosa, and psychological issues such as anxiety and depression. The pathogenesis of BMS has been hypothesised to be associated with psychological disorders and peripheral and central neuropathy, but at present it is classified as idiopathic chronic pain. Diagnosing and managing patients with BMS remains a challenge to clinicians due to its poorly understood pathogenesis and inconsistent and limited response to various treatments. Besides, it has an exceptionally low spontaneous remission prevalence of 3–4% after 5–6 years of diagnosis. There are no global guidelines on BMS treatment, and published review articles included clinical studies with limited follow up periods (<2 months) (–). Based on the current universal ICOP criteria, the diversity of BMS patients’ underlying pain mechanism, and the difference in evidence on short- and long- term benefit of treatment in BMS, we sought to conduct a systematic review on different therapeutic strategies for patients presenting with BMS, with the question “which range of treatments have effective short (≤3 months) and long-term (>3 months) outcomes in improving the pain symptoms in BMS patients?”. Parallel with the aim of providing a personalised treatment for each patient, the sustainability of a treatment efficacy and patients’ compliance and response towards the therapy and its side effects should be considered.

### Is burning mouth syndrome a neuropathic pain condition? [^dd2b58e5]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is defined as an "intraoral burning or dysaesthetic sensation, recurring daily… more than 3 months, without clinically evident causative lesions" (IHS 2013). In addition to pain, taste alterations are frequent (dysgeusia, xerostomia). Although lacking clinical signs of neuropathy, more accurate diagnostic methods have shown neuropathic involvement at various levels of the neuraxis in BMS: peripheral small fiber damage (thermal quantitative sensory testing, electrogustatometry, epithelial nerve fiber density), trigeminal system lesions in the periphery or the brainstem (brainstem reflex recordings, trigeminal neurography, evoked potentials), or signs of decreased inhibition within the central nervous system (deficient brainstem reflex habituation, positive signs in quantitative sensory testing, neurotransmitter-positron emission tomography findings indicative of deficient striatal dopamine function). Abnormalities in electrogustatometry indicate the involvement of the small Aδ taste afferents, in addition to somatosensory small fibers. According to these findings, the clinical entity of BMS can be divided into 2 main subtypes compatible with either peripheral or central neuropathic pain, which may overlap in individual patients. The central type does not respond to local treatments and associates often with psychiatric comorbidity (depression or anxiety), whereas the peripheral type responds to peripheral lidocaine blocks and topical clonazepam. Burning mouth syndrome is most prevalent in postmenopausal women, having led to a hypothesis that BMS is triggered as a consequence of nervous system damage caused by neurotoxic factors affecting especially vulnerable small fibers and basal ganglia in a setting of decrease in neuroprotective gonadal hormones and increase in stress hormone levels, typical for menopause.

### Burning mouth syndrome and secondary oral burning [^7f7818ee]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome is a complex disorder of unclear etiology that is most prevalent in perimenopausal women. It is often accompanied by dysguesia and subjective xerostomia. Recent evidence implicates both central and peripheral neuropathies, possibly representing a phantom pain syndrome in some patients. Ensuring that the patient's oral burning is not secondary to some other local or systemic factor is central to appropriate management. Current standard therapies include clonazepam, paroxetine, and cognitive behavioral therapy, and several promising new alternatives are described.

### Burning mouth syndrome [^194f301f]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is an enigmatic, misunderstood, and under-recognized painful condition. Symptoms associated with BMS can be varied, thereby providing a challenge for practitioners and having a negative impact on oral health-related quality of life for patients. Management also remains a challenge for practitioners because it is currently only targeted for symptom relief without a definitive cure. There is an urgent need for further investigations to determine the efficacy of different therapies because this is the only way viable therapeutic options can be established for patients with this chronic and painful syndrome.

Broader Implications for AI in Clinical Decision-Making and Future Directions

In a broader context, our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of AI—particularly LLMs—in enhancing clinical decision-making. By demonstrating that LLMs can achieve a high degree of diagnostic accuracy for BMS, we provide insights into how such models may reduce diagnostic uncertainty in complex, subjective conditions. This work underscores the potential for LLMs to function as valuable adjuncts to clinician expertise, particularly in medical and dental fields where symptom presentations are nuanced and overlapping.

Looking beyond BMS, LLM-driven diagnostic support may offer substantial benefits in various medical domains that rely heavily on clinical judgment and patient-reported outcomes. For instance, the ability of LLMs to rapidly process patient histories and incorporate large bodies of medical literature could facilitate more timely and accurate diagnoses, particularly in under-resourced settings with limited access to specialists. However, real-world implementation requires careful consideration of ethical, legal, and educational factors to safeguard patient safety and maintain professional accountability.

Integration of LLMs Into Multi-Disciplinary Diagnostic Teams

Future research should explore the structured integration of LLMs into multi-disciplinary diagnostic teams composed of dentists, oral surgeons, psychiatrists, neurologists, and other relevant specialists. Such teams could leverage the computational strengths of LLMs—especially in systematically ruling out organic causes and synthesizing diverse patient data—while clinicians contribute the essential contextual, psychosocial, and experiential knowledge that AI models currently lack. By collaboratively evaluating high-risk or ambiguous cases, human–AI “co-diagnosis” could refine diagnostic accuracy, foster individualized treatment plans, and promote shared decision-making between patients and healthcare providers.

Broadening the Scope to Other Medically Unexplained Oral Symptoms

Beyond BMS, our findings carry implications for other MUOS, such as oral cenesthopathy, and persistent idiopathic facial pain. These conditions share the diagnostic challenges of subjective symptomatology and uncertain etiology, making them potential targets for LLM-assisted diagnostic support. By incorporating comprehensive patient histories, psychosocial factors, and multidisciplinary inputs (eg, from neurology, psychiatry, and oral medicine), future research could adapt our LLM-driven framework to systematically evaluate these complex disorders. Such an approach may facilitate earlier and more accurate diagnoses, reduce the burden of extensive referral processes, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes. Moreover, refining the training data to include a broader array of MUOS presentations could yield more generalizable AI tools, fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration and supporting the development of holistic, patient-centered care models.

### Modulation of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels by plant derived substances used in over-the-counter cough and cold remedies [^cdcc5265]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The dosage of menthol also plays some role in the sensation experienced, with low dosages causing a cooling sensation and higher dosages a burning sensation. The extent of sensation experienced could reflect the number of menthol sensitive or insensitive neurons, with sensitive neurons having higher expression of TRPM8 and lower thresholds to cold stimuli. In addition, menthol also acts on the warm receptor TRPV3, thus activation of this receptor may explain why high concentration of menthol cause burning sensations. The activation of TRPA1 by menthol may explain the role it can play as an analgesic, as activation of TRPM8 alone does not cause increased skin sensitisation. Instead activation of TRPA1 by menthol can have a bimodal effect, with low doses causing pain and inflammation and high doses acting as an antagonist hence the analgesic effect, thus analgesic effects are potentially a consequence of TRPM8 activation and TRPA1 inhibition.

### Contribution of neuroinflammation in burning mouth syndrome: indications from benzodiazepine use [^36376722]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Characterized by burning and painful oral sensations in absence of clinically significant mucosal abnormalities, the burning mouth syndrome is, despite numerous researches made, basically idiopathic and, consequently, difficult to treat effectively. Therapy with tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines has been proposed, although the exact pathomechanism is not clear. The objective of this study is to define the possible reasons for the efficacy of benzodiazepines in the treatment of the burning mouth syndrome. Starting from the report of eight cases successfully treated with prazepam, the present authors examined the clinical features and the evidence from literature that support the possibility of a role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of the burning mouth syndrome. Available data suggest that the nervous system could be crucial in the pathogenesis of the syndrome (altered perception of pain, disturbance of neural transmission, increased excitability, negative involvement of trigeminal-vascular system), and the present authors' experience lets them suppose a role for neuroinflammation. This hypothesis could also explain the positive response to benzodiazepines in some patients. The important role of neuroinflammation in dermatologic and oral diseases has been only recently investigated and acknowledged. Further studies on the connection between neuroinflammation and burning mouth syndrome could open interesting perspectives in the understanding and management of this difficult clinical condition.

### Burning mouth syndrome [^5f374d7f]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic condition characterized by burning of the oral mucosa, with or without dysgeusia and xerostomia, in the setting of no underlying systemic disease or identifiable abnormalities on physical examination or laboratory testing. BMS disproportionately affects postmenopausal women. The pathophysiology of the disease is unknown; no single treatment has proven universally successful. In light of these shortcomings, having a practical approach to the evaluation and management of patients with BMS can improve both patient quality of life and physician satisfaction.

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^1ff0b278]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Peripheral neuropathic pain is a common finding in patients with peripheral nerve injury. It has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as a pain “caused by lesions or diseases of the somatosensory nervous system.”Peripheral neuropathic pain is typically chronic in nature and is caused by a heterogenous group of diseases. It has an estimated prevalence of between 6.9% and 10% of the population.It is typically described as a “pins and needles,” burning, cramping, or tingling pain by patients.Prior research has demonstrated that neuropathic causes of pain may be underrecognized and inadequately managed.In this review, we seek to briefly outline the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathic pain and provide a comprehensive list of non‐interventional treatment approaches.

### Cytokine levels and their role in the etiopathogenesis of burning mouth syndrome: a systematic review [^13b00395]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Burning Mouth Syndrome is characterized by variable symptoms that include pain, burning and paraguesia in an otherwise healthy-appearing oral mucosa. Although the etiopathogenesis of Burning Mouth Syndrome is unknown, some studies provide evidence of subclinical inflammation leading to disrupted cytokine levels.

Aim

To investigate the expression of cytokines and role in the etiopathogenesis of Burning Mouth Syndrome.

Methods

Online databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) were searched from November 1986 to November 2018 for case control/cross-sectional studies comparing the levels of cytokines in patients with Burning Mouth Syndrome and healthy controls.

Results

A total of eight studies were included in the current review. Four studies were of high and four studies were of moderate quality. Seven studies evaluated IL-6, out of which four showed comparable results, two showed higher levels and one study reported lower levels in Burning Mouth Syndrome patients compared to controls. Four studies assessed IL-2, out of which two reported comparable results whereas one study reported higher levels and one study reported lower levels in Burning Mouth Syndrome patients compared to controls. IL-10 levels were measured in three studies that reported no significant differences in the levels between Burning Mouth Syndrome and healthy controls.

Discussion and Conclusion

The etiopathogenesis of Burning Mouth Syndrome is multifactorial. Studies have provided scientific evidence that inflammation plays a key role in Burning Mouth Syndrome pathogenesis. However, whether up-regulation or down-regulation of specific cytokines contribute to the etiopathogenesis of Burning Mouth Syndrome remains debatable. Further high-quality studies with larger sample size and assessing a wider array of cytokines are warranted in order to obtain strong conclusions.

### Pain experiences in adult burn survivors during rehabilitation and recovery: a qualitative systematic review [^42d774b8]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Individuals’ experience of pain postburn injury remains a challenge.Pain is a sensory response that aids the body in responding to threats or tissue damage, thereby promoting protection and facilitating tissue repair. Acute burn pain results from various harmful stimuli such as heat, cold, mechanical forces, and chemicals.Research highlights that the mechanisms of pain following burn injury involve complex pathophysiology, encompassing both peripheral and central processes. This pain combines elements of acute nociceptive, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain and changes over time.Despite advancements in management and interventions for burn care, pain continues to be a consistent variable where, despite the efforts of the multidisciplinary team, pain persists in various forms. The wide variation in causes and severity of burn injuries complicates the identification of specific pain pathways in individual cases, presenting obstacles to ascertaining the relative impact of these mechanisms on individual pain experiences or analgesic responses.Multiple factors are reported to influence the experience of pain, including age, sex, mechanism of injury, the depth and extent of the burn, premorbid experiences of pain, cognitive status, comprehension, preexisting health conditions, history of substance use or misuse, and psychological maturity.Burn pain perception and reporting are not solely physiological phenomena. Geographic and environmental contexts can also influence pain.For example, if the burn happened at work or at home (e.g. in a domestic violence situation).Variations in climate, such as humidity and temperature, can impact wound healingand pain sensitivity, potentially altering the pain experiences of burn patients. Additionally, economic and systemic challenges may include a shortage of pain specialists.Ultimately, the experience of pain is individual-specific.

### Abnormal sweating patterns associated with itching, burning and tingling of the skin indicate possible underlying small-fibre neuropathy [^a3efb340]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Itching, burning, numbness and tingling of the skin are frequent reasons for dermatology consultation. We hypothesized that these sensations may be attributable to a small-fibre neuropathy. Sweating, which is mediated by small nerve fibres, may be a surrogate marker of small-fibre neuropathy.

Objectives

To investigate the results of thermoregulatory sweat testing (TST), which depicts and estimates whole-body sweating, in patients with itching, burning, numbness and tingling sensations.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 227 patients with itching, burning, numbness and tingling sensations involving the skin who were seen at our institution during 2008 and also underwent TST.

Results

The mean age of the cohort was 54 years (range 3-89), and 58% were female. In all, 149 patients (66%) had abnormal TST results; in 119 (80%) of these patients the areas of anhidrosis on TST corresponded to their symptomatic areas. For each symptom analysed separately, the area of anhidrosis correlated with the area of symptoms in most patients.

Conclusions

Patients with burning, itching, numbness and tingling have abnormal sweating patterns and often do not sweat in the symptomatic areas. These novel findings suggest that a small-fibre neuropathy may underlie many cutaneous symptoms and that the neuropathy can be estimated using TST.

### Management of vulvar pain [^8b9af67e]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Vulvodynia is a frequently used medical term that literally means "vulvar pain". Therefore, vulvodynia is a symptom, not a disease. The term itself indicates a variety of unpleasant chronic vulvar sensations, including burning, rawness, soreness, irritation, sensitivity, and formication. This may or may not include dyspareunia. Primary vulvodynia occurs when these sensory disturbances occur in the absence of observable dermatologic disease or vulvovaginal infection. There are several causes for this, including neuropathy, referred pain, and pelvic floor muscle dysfunction. For the purist, it is the patient in whom there is no observable reason for vulvar pain who represents the true case of vulvodynia. However, vulvodynia can also occur secondarily as a symptom of vulvar skin disease. Restricting the present paper to patients without objective signs leaves out all the important conditions which come into the differential diagnosis of vulvar pain which should be ruled out first. The first step in managing vulvodynia is making an accurate diagnosis of its cause. The present review summarizes the diagnosis and management of the chronic dermatologic diseases which may cause primary and secondary vulvodynia. The etiology of primary vulvodynia is much more poorly understood than secondary vulvodynia, and treatment of some aspects remains controversial.

### The effect of cold tetracaine on the severity of burning sensation upon instillation [^191f14dd]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Based on the previous studies, the effect of temperature on burning sensation upon instillation of topical eye drops is still controversial. This led us to conduct the double-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a large sample size in order to answer this important research question.

The result of our study showed that cold temperature tetracaine caused less burning sensation than room temperature tetracaine upon instillation. This conformed to the findings of the studies of Li et aland Soltani et al.

The mechanism of how cooling tetracaine reduces the burning sensation could be explained by many theories. Cold temperature could reduce the nerve conduction velocityand lead to pain reduction. Cold pack or icepack is used to reduce pain in the musculoskeletal system,,and its onset of effect seems to be very rapid. Therefore, it is very likely that one of the main mechanisms by which cold temperature tetracaine alleviates burning sensation could be explained by the direct effect of temperature on nerve conduction. Through this mechanism, cold ophthalmic solutions, including tetracaine and artificial tears, have been found to be effective in pain reduction.Fujishima et alfound that cooled artificial tears decreased corneal sensation and gave comfort to the patient. Vasoconstriction caused by cold temperature is another mechanism that plays an important role in pain reduction. Previous studies have shown that the cold ophthalmic solution induces vasoconstriction,,and could reduce the inflammatory cells and mediators. One study showed that cold pack applied after cataract surgery reduced inflammation. In the study, the authors evaluated inflammation using laser flare-cell meter. They found that there was a significant cell count reduction in inflammation on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 and a significant reduction in flare counts on days 1, 14 and 28 after surgery in the cooled eye.

### A systematic review of treatment for patients with burning mouth syndrome [^e5c18d55]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In perspective, it is suggested that multicentre trials investigate various therapeutic techniques in regulating BMS pain and increase participant numbers to conclude the treatment guidelines for BMS. The sustainability of pain reduction or remission is not adequately studied due to a short assessment period of less than a year. No treatment achieves a 50% pain remission in BMS. Investigating the influence of BMS’s biopsychosocial and neurophysiological mechanisms will provide a robust framework for integrating its various confounding aetiology factors. Studies should be ideally designed with multi-arm comparison for various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments to grade the treatment efficacy based on the universally accepted BMS disease’s diagnosis criteria. Likewise, a greater volume for sample size, multicentre studies, and longitudinal follow-up studies will enhance BMS treatment strategies’ value. The beneficial effects exhibited for neuroprotective and analgesic auxiliary therapies such as phytomedicine and rTMS, and the behavioural therapy CBT, could be valuable alternatives or applied in conjunction with synthetic systemic drugs, with a lesser risk of adverse drug effects, and tailored, holistic individual patient treatment, rather than the disease itself.

### Assessment of pruritus characteristics and impact on burn survivors [^33dab0b1]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

The goal of this cross-sectional study was to characterize and describe persistent postburn pruritus. Cause and treatment of postburn itch is elusive. It has been suggested that burn survivors with persistent pruritus should be divided into acute itch (≤6 months postinjury) and chronic itch (>6 months postinjury) because the cause of itch may be different. Cross-sectional data of itch characteristics reported here are from the baseline data of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled pilot study of 23 subjects with frequent and bothersome postburn pruritus. Subjects self-completed validated scales for variables of itch sensation, affect of itch, and severity. Variables of quality of life, frequency, pain and itch intensity, skin condition, scar, and medication were also recorded. Itch frequency revealed that 87% of subjects experienced itching daily, 96% experienced three or more episodes a day, and 52% had episode durations lasting 5 to 30 minutes per incidence. Itch was reported as unbearable by 94% of subjects with chronic itch and by 86% of subjects with acute itch, whereas bothersome was 88 and 100%, respectively. Itch sensation dimension of stinging was 74% in both acute and chronic itch subjects. Crawling and burning sensations were often severe. Potential itch triggers and relief activities were identified. Differences in sensory and affective itch components were detected between acute and chronic itch subjects. Combinations of itch mechanisms probably contribute to the development of and changes in pruritus. Characterizing the sensation and affective itch dimensions in conjunction with inflammation, burn injury, recovery, scar maturation, medication, and psychological status should better elucidate postburn itch.

### Neural correlates of prickle sensation: a percept-related fMRI study [^67e867d9]. Nature Neuroscience (2002). Medium credibility.

The painful sensations produced by a laceration, freeze, burn, muscle strain or internal injury are readily distinguishable because each is characterized by a particular sensory quality such as sharp, aching, burning or prickling. We propose that there are specific neural correlates of each pain quality, and here we used a new functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method to identify time-locked responses to prickle sensations that were evoked by noxious cold stimuli. With percept-related fMRI, we identified prickle-related brain activations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), prefrontal cortex (PFC), premotor cortex (PMC), caudate nucleus and dorsomedial thalamus, indicating that multiple pain, sensory and motor areas act together to produce the prickle sensation.

### Phenazopyridine (pyridium) [^361868cf]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Pyridium is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled.

The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed two days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after two days. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.)

### Evaluating large language models for burning mouth syndrome diagnosis [^e6ff05df]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Reasoning

The reasoning reflects what the LLMs prioritize in determining the diagnosis of BMS. It lists various factors, including characteristic symptoms like daily fluctuation. However, what truly matters is whether the criteria for BMS are met and whether any differential diagnoses can be ruled out.

ChatGPT: The key reasoning points for diagnosing BMS include several critical aspects. First, the absence of organic abnormalities is utilized in 91% of cases, underscoring the heavy reliance on exclusionary criteria. Second, the primary symptoms of BMS, such as pain, a burning sensation, an oral discomfort, are referenced in 89% of cases, demonstrating alignment with established clinical markers. Additionally, the chronic nature of symptoms is highlighted in 79% of cases, emphasizing the persistent course of the condition. The strengths of this diagnostic approach lie in its systematic and logical progression, transitioning from exclusionary reasoning to a symptomatic focus. However, a notable weakness lies in the overestimation of psychosocial and functional domains, which may lead to misdiagnosis and subsequently influence treatment strategies. ChatGPT often tends to associate cases with psychological factors, particularly when there is a history of mental illness, specific triggers, or multiple or severe past illnesses.

Gemini: The reasoning patterns related to BMS exhibit variability. Primary symptoms of BMS were referenced in 87% of cases, demonstrating usage comparable to peers. The absence of organic abnormalities was cited in 85% of cases, reflecting a reasonable application of exclusionary logic. However, the chronic nature of symptoms was highlighted in only 58% of cases, indicating a potential gap in emphasizing the persistent characteristics of BMS. This variability in reasoning offers strengths, such as the potential to identify edge cases or atypical presentations, but also reveals weaknesses, including a lack of consistency and an over-reliance on specific features, which may increase the risk of misdiagnosis.

Claude: In 95% of cases, the absence of organic abnormalities serves as the dominant reasoning for diagnosis. Primary symptoms of BMS are highlighted in 91% of cases, emphasizing their diagnostic relevance. The chronic nature of symptoms is considered in 76% of cases, which is slightly lower compared to ChatGPT. The approach demonstrates strengths through its structured methodology and high alignment with BMS diagnostic criteria. However, it shares similar limitations with ChatGPT, particularly in distinguishing BMS from closely related conditions.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^e92928ac]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

In the absence of alarm symptoms or signs, FD is highly probable when epigastric pain or burning, early satiation, and/or postprandial fullness are reported, in line with the Rome IV criteria, and endoscopy is unlikely to change the diagnosis, even though a normal endoscopy is required as part of these diagnostic criteria. In routine clinical practice, therefore, clinicians can use the recently proposed Rome IV clinical criteria,which require the presence of one of more of these four cardinal symptoms, if reported as bothersome, for more than 8 weeks. Other symptoms can coexist but should not be predominant. Information about the characteristics of pain should be recorded. Usually, in FD, pain is in the upper abdomen or epigastrium, and may be present in fasting conditions, and/or precipitated or exacerbated by meal ingestion. Unlike in IBS, abdominal pain in FD is unrelated to the need to defaecate. All of this may help to differentiate patients with FD from those with IBS or to identify patients with FD with overlapping IBS, which can be of any subtype, and is reported to occur in up to 50% of patients.In this situation, the patient will report the presence of two different types of abdominal pain, one related and one unrelated, to defaecation. Other functional bowel disorders, including functional diarrhoea, functional constipation, or functional abdominal bloating and distension can also overlap with FD.Gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms also coexist in approximately one-third of patients with FD and, in this situation, evidence suggests that clinicians tend to favour a diagnosis of GORD over that of FD.The presence of a burning sensation that starts in the epigastrium but radiates to the chest may help to differentiate the heartburn of GORD from the epigastric pain of dyspepsia. The presence of eating disorders, or of disordered eating behaviour, is recognised increasingly in patients with FD, as discussed later.

### Characteristics of patients with neuropathic pain syndromes screened by the painDETECT questionnaire and diagnosed by physician exam [^9268e151]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain (NeP) is defined as “pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system”.NeP can result from a variety of underlying etiologies, such as metabolic disease, infection, malignancy, AIDS, medications, and toxins, manifesting in a broad range of symptoms, which makes it difficult to correctly diagnose because there are no standardized diagnostic criteria. This has resulted in under-diagnosis and under-treatment.A 2014 systematic review of 21 studies from around the world estimated that the general prevalence ranges from 6.9% to 10.0%.A prevalence of 10.0% has also been identified in the USA.

Patients with NeP experience a range of painful sensory symptoms including, but not limited to, allodynia, hyperalgesia, paresthesia, and sensations of burning or freezing,which have a detrimental effect on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and contribute to a decreased ability to perform daily activities and poorer health status.A systematic review of articles published between 1999–2012 found that as NeP pain severity increased so did work impairment (eg, unemployment and absenteeism) and health-care resource utilization.In addition, a retrospective chart review found that the annual estimated work productivity loss was $19,000 per person and the associated health-care costs per person were $2,219 per year,further indicating that NeP is both multifaceted and burdensome.

### Management of burns [^7257e61c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on burn injury: 
- Definition: Burn injuries are defined as damage to the skin or other body tissues caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, or radiation.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of burn injuries involves the destruction of skin layers, which triggers an immune and inflammatory response, metabolic changes, and potentially distributive shock.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of burn injury in the US is estimated at 140 per 100,000 person-years.
- Risk factors: The risk factors for burn injuries include self-inflicted injuries or abuse/neglect, lack of social support resources, inadequate housing and food resources, and substance use disorders, including alcohol.
- Disease course: Clinically, burn injuries present with redness, blistering, and skin damage. The severity of these symptoms can vary depending on the depth and extent of the burn. Superficial burns may only cause redness and pain, while deeper burns can lead to blistering, skin necrosis, and even systemic symptoms such as shock.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of burn injuries can vary widely, depending on factors such as the severity and extent of the burn, the patient's overall health, and the presence of complications. Burns involving a large percentage of the body surface area or those that result in inhalation injury can have a poor prognosis.

### The effect of cold tetracaine on the severity of burning sensation upon instillation [^b1329643]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Topical ophthalmic anesthesia is a part and parcel of ophthalmic examinations and procedures these days. It is widely used because of its rapid onset, easy application, and the low risk of side effects. There are many different types of topical anesthetic agents. Tetracaine is one of the most common topical anesthetics used in general practice due to its efficacy and wide availability.

While instillation of tetracaine is easy and lasts long enough for most ophthalmic examinations and procedures, it can often cause burning sensation and ocular pain.–These adverse effects can be very unpleasant to the patients and they are the main limitations of tetracaine use in clinical practice. Various studies have tried to look into ways of attenuating these adverse effects.–,–Adjusting the temperature of the solution may be a viable option for this.

There have been few studies regarding the effect of temperature of tetracaine solution on burning sensation.The results of these studies suggested that lowering the temperature of tetracaine eye drop may alleviate ocular pain on instillation.However, the sample size of these studies was relatively small and was not statistically calculated. In addition, nearly all these studies were performed in healthy volunteers,and only one study was conducted in patients undergoing phacoemulsification.As such, the outcome of these findings may not be generalizable to the patients undergoing ophthalmic examination in ophthalmology clinic.

In view of this, we conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of cold vs room temperature topical tetracaine on the severity of burning sensation in all comers of the ophthalmic outpatient clinic.

What should I avoid while taking sumatriptan tablets? Sumatriptan tablets can cause dizziness, weakness, or drowsiness. If you have these symptoms, do not drive a car, use machinery, or do anything where you need to be alert. What are the possible side effects of sumatriptan tablets? Sumatriptan tablets may cause serious side effects. See “What is the most important information I should know about sumatriptan tablets?” These serious side effects include:

changes in color or sensation in your fingers and toes (Raynaud’s syndrome) stomach and intestinal problems (gastrointestinal and colonic ischemic events).

Symptoms of gastrointestinal and colonic ischemic events include:

sudden or severe stomach pain stomach pain after meals weight loss nausea or vomiting constipation or diarrhea bloody diarrhea fever problems with blood circulation to your legs and feet (peripheral vascular ischemia). Symptoms of peripheral vascular ischemia include: cramping and pain in your legs or hips feeling of heaviness or tightness in your leg muscles burning or aching pain in your feet or toes while resting numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs cold feeling or color changes in 1 or both legs or feet hives (itchy bumps); swelling of your tongue, mouth, or throat medication overuse headaches. Some people who use too many sumatriptan tablets may have worse headaches (medication overuse headache). If your headaches get worse, your healthcare provider may decide to stop your treatment with sumatriptan tablets. serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious problem that can happen in people using sumatriptan tablets, especially if sumatriptan tablets are used with anti-depressant medicines called SSRIs or SNRIs.

### Phenazopyridine hcl 100mg [^8589684b]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the mucosa of the lower urinary tract caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters.

The use of phenazopyridine for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. The drug should be used for symptomatic relief of pain and not as a substitute for specific surgery or antimicrobial therapy.

Phenazopyridine is compatible with antimicrobial therapy and can help relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antimicrobial therapy controls the infection.

Treatment of a urinary tract infection with phenazopyridine should not exceed 2 days. There is no evidence that the combined administration of phenazopyridine and an antimicrobial provides greater benefit than administration of the antimicrobial alone after 2 days. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)

### Evaluating large language models for burning mouth syndrome diagnosis [^aeb0b2b1]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

From a clinical standpoint, those familiar with BMS recognize that it does not necessarily manifest as bilateral pain in all cases.In addition, it is well known that many patients report that their pain diminishes during meals. Based on other similar clinical vignettes, it appears that LLMs sometimes offer limited analysis concerning topics with multiple conflicting opinions—especially those that are clinically recognized but mentioned in only a few published studies.

When considering the clinical application of LLMs, this limitation should be addressed. For content or diagnoses that remain open to debate, a clinician’s judgment is indispensable. Furthermore, whenever providing a diagnosis, it is prudent to make the LLM’s reasoning explicit. If errors are identified, they should be corrected to facilitate ongoing learning and improvement of these models.

### Neuropathic pain phenotyping by international consensus (neuroPPIC) for genetic studies: a neuPSIG systematic review, Delphi survey, and expert panel recommendations [^1c6b4974]. Pain (2015). Low credibility.

NeuroPPIC has only provided a consensual statement on the nature of “entry level” phenotyping and instruments that can be used to accomplish successful classification of participants as having vs not having neuropathic pain. These NeuroPPIC guidelines are for the basic phenotyping requirements for any genetic study of neuropathic pain in adults. It is notable that this “entry level” phenotyping is based only on study participants' responses to questions and does not include clinical examination or further investigations. This “entry level” phenotyping approach will allow inclusion in large-scale questionnaire-based surveys. Our Delphi survey confirms that augmenting a simple symptom checklist by questions on pain bodily distribution and history will allow the identification of “possible” neuropathic pain. Although symptoms could be confined to a smaller list of verbal descriptors (eg, “hot/burning pain” and “pain evoked by light touch”), the use of a slightly longer but well-validated screening instrument will prevent the need for validation of a new questionnaire instrument. Available screening instruments include DN4, S-LANSS, and PainDETECT, but we are making no statement on which of these, if any, is to be preferred. This approach conforms to the “very general” approach outlined in the introduction and will be suitable for large-scale population-based studies, including those in which neuropathic pain is just one of a number of conditions to be phenotyped. More extensive phenotyping of additional aspects of neuropathic pain will require a more detailed set of assessments, to allow for inclusion of “very specific” phenotypes. Although NeuroPPIC was able to provide some pointers towards these levels, we have not yet furnished agreed guidelines on the nature of these phenotypes and the instruments to collect them, and this will require further work, building on the “entry level” approach. Any additional, more extensive phenotyping should, however, be consistent with the “entry level” approach, to allow specificity to be built in to the basic model. This will allow incremental approaches to phenotyping within a large cohort, and the testing for replication of associations identified in extensively phenotyped cohorts.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^1bf5519a]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

All guidelines focused on the assessment of neuropathic pain highlight the use of a comprehensive history and examination with reliance on clinical judgment in the interpretation of screening tools and investigations.

History

Neuropathic pain stems from a wide variety of causes that can be broadly organized into two basic categories: peripheral and central etiologies. However, presentation may be variable both between peripheral and central etiologies and within individuals with the same etiology. Common peripheral neuropathic conditions include diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, radicular pain (RP), and postsurgical chronic neuropathic pain (PSCP). Central conditions include multiple sclerosis, poststroke pain, spinal cord injury–related pain, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and trigeminal neuralgia (TN).

The clinical presentation of neuropathic pain commonly includes descriptions of burning, pins and needles (paresthesia), tingling, numbness, electric shocks/shooting, crawling (formication), itching, and intolerance to temperature. In more advanced cases, patients may describe pain arising from stimuli that are not usually painful (i.e. allodynia) or pain from normally painful stimuli that is out of proportion to what would be expected. (i.e. hyperalgesia).

The use of validated questionnaires is a simple means of identifying the presence of neuropathic pain and quantifying its impact on the patient: PainDetect, Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions (DN4), and the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms (LANSS). PainDetect relies solely on patient input without the need for a physical exam, with a sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 80%, respectively. The DN4 and LANSS are both short measures of the presence of neuropathic pain. The DN4 has seven pain discriminators and three examination findings: a score of 4+ indicates that neuropathic pain is likely, and its sensitivity and specificity are 83% and 90%. The LANSS has five symptom descriptors and two examination findings. Its sensitivity and specificity are 82–91% and 80–94%. The more conventionally known numeric rating scale (NRS) and/or the visual analog scale (VAS) can be used to measure pain intensity.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^9e9ba0f2]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline—urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms note that acute-onset symptoms attributable to the urinary tract typically include dysuria in conjunction with variable degrees of increased urinary urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence. Dysuria (urethral burning during voiding) is central in the diagnosis of UTI, and acute-onset dysuria is a specific symptom, with more than 90% accuracy for UTI in young women in the absence of concomitant vaginal irritation or increased vaginal discharge. Dysuria can have other causes (e.g., atrophic vaginitis, pelvic floor myofascial pain, vulvar lichen sclerosus), and the specificity of this symptom outside of this narrow population has not been defined. In older adults, the symptoms of UTI may be less clear, and careful evaluation of their chronicity becomes an important consideration when the diagnosis of UTI is in doubt.

### Burn pain: a systematic and critical review of epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment [^eb713357]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This review aims to examine the available literature on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of burn-induced pain.

Methods

A search was conducted on the epidemiology of burn injury and treatment of burn pain utilizing the database Medline, and all relevant articles were systemically reviewed. In addition, a critical review was performed on the pathophysiology of burn pain and animal models of burn pain.

Results

The search on the epidemiology of burn injury yielded a total of 163 publications of interest, 72 of which fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria, with no publications providing epidemiological data on burn injury pain management outcomes. The search on the treatment of burn pain yielded a total of 213 publications, 14 of which fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria, highlighting the limited amount of evidence available on the treatment of burn-induced pain.

Conclusions

The pathophysiology of burn pain is poorly understood, with limited clinical trials available to assess the effectiveness of analgesics in burn patients. Further studies are needed to identify new pharmacological targets and treatments for the effective management of burn injury pain.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^73aa0fa1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Functional abdominal pain: the basic science—mechanisms of nociception in the digestive tract emphasize distension and contractions. Primary causes of abdominal pain of digestive tract origin are distension and excessively strong contractions of the musculature, whereas other stimuli such as pinching and burning of the mucosa do not evoke pain. Hypersensitivity of the mechanoreceptors detecting stretch (distension) and contractile force is described as a pain factor in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), and hypersensitivity to distension is found in a substantial subset of patients that meet Rome III symptom-based criteria for diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^f05a1962]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Neuropathic ocular pain (NOP)—evaluation and diagnostic approach—can be challenging to identify because individuals can also have ocular surface disorders; the first step is a thorough ocular surface and tear parameter examination to evaluate nociceptive sources, and the examination also should include an assessment of patients’ symptoms; in general, individuals with NOP have symptoms that outweigh the observed signs of disease; questionnaires like the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI)-Eye or the Ocular Pain Assessment Survey (OPAS) include neuropathic qualities such as burning pain or sensitivity to wind and light, and other clues to NOP are ocular symptoms that persist despite appropriate treatment and/or resolution of tear film and ocular surface abnormalities; if NOP is suspected, the “anesthetic challenge test” can aid in localizing pain—improvement after the anesthetic drop suggests a nociceptive or peripheral neuropathic component, whereas no improvement suggests a central or nonocular cause.

### Altered thermal grill response and paradoxical heat sensations after topical capsaicin application [^4e3542f5]. Pain (2015). Low credibility.

The thermal grill illusion, where interlaced warm and cold bars cause an unusual burning sensation, and paradoxical heat sensations (PHS), where cold is perceived as warm when alternating warm and cold, are examples of a complex integration of thermal sensations. Here, we investigated the effect of sensitization of heat-sensitive neurons on cold and warm integration. We examined thermal thresholds, PHS, and warm, cold, and pain sensations to alternating cold (10°C) and warm (40°C) bars (the thermal grill [TG]) in the primary area (application site) after topical application with capsaicin and vehicle control (ethanol) on the volar forearms in randomized order in 80 healthy participants. As expected, capsaicin induced heat allodynia and hyperalgesia and decreased cold and cold pain sensation. In addition, we found that after capsaicin application, the TG caused less pain and burning than the 40°C bars alone in contrast to the control side where the TG caused more pain and burning, consistent with the thermal grill illusion. In both situations, the pain intensity during the TG correlated inversely with both cold and warm pain thresholds but not with detection thresholds. Paradoxical heat sensation was only seen in 3 participants after control application but in 19 participants after capsaicin. Those with PHS after capsaicin application had higher detection thresholds to both cold and warm than those without PHS, but there was no difference in thermal pain threshold. These results suggest that a complex cross talk among several cold and warm sensitive pathways shapes thermal perception.

### Phenazopyridine (phenazopyridine hydrochloride) [^40f7619d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled.

The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after 2 days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section).

### The effect of cold tetracaine on the severity of burning sensation upon instillation [^0e7e6844]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Tetracaine is one of the most common eye drops that are used for analgesia in clinical practice. However, it causes ocular burning sensation when instilled. This study aimed to compare the effects of the cold and room temperature tetracaine on burning sensation.

Patients and methods

We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial at the ophthalmology outpatient clinic, Phramongkutklao Hospital during January 2016–February 2017. In this study, 424 consecutive patients (those with a history of keratopathy or neuropathy were excluded) who received dilated fundus examination were randomized to receive cold tetracaine (4°C) in one eye and room temperature tetracaine (22.5°C) in the other eye. Each patient was asked to answer the questionnaire on the severity of burning sensation using 100 mm visual analog scale.

Results

Patients reported less burning sensation on the eye that received cold tetracaine (visual analog scale 20.50±18.8 vs 22.70±20 mm; P =0.025). In the subgroup analysis, young patients (≤40 years old), female subjects, patients who received tetracaine for the first-time and those who had no previous ocular surgery reported more benefit from cold tetracaine. The subgroup of patients who had normal corneal sensation, identified by using a Cochet–Bonnet esthesiometer, also showed greater benefit from cold tetracaine compared to those with impaired corneal sensation.

Conclusion

Cold tetracaine caused less burning sensation than room temperature solution. Its benefit was greater in the subgroup of patients who reported more severe burning sensation. We recommend using cold tetracaine in routine practice, especially in those who are anticipated to have this common side effect.

### Evaluating large language models for burning mouth syndrome diagnosis [^2d8df0d9]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Against this backdrop, the present study aims to address a crucial gap in current diagnostic methods for BMS by evaluating the potential of LLMs to improve diagnostic accuracy. We posit that BMS, with its intricate and subjective symptom descriptions, may present significant challenges for LLM-based diagnostics, particularly when distinguishing between overlapping oral and maxillofacial pain syndromes. Building on broader efforts in AI-driven medical diagnostics, our research specifically focuses on whether LLMs can overcome existing limitations—such as the reliance on exclusionary criteria, subtle variations in patient-reported pain, and a lack of standardized clinical pathways—to provide reliable, supportive tools for clinicians. Therefore, our hypothesis is that diagnosing BMS will be challenging for LLMs, yet understanding the nature of these challenges could pave the way for more refined, AI-assisted diagnostic strategies. By systematically examining LLM diagnostic performance on BMS, we seek to inform both the dental community and AI researchers on how these models might be optimized or integrated into clinical practice for managing complex, medically unexplained oral conditions.

### Oral health implications in Parkinson's disease [^a1d81690]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome

Among middle-aged and elderly, anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric conditions associated with burning mouth syndrome (BMS), affecting 63.7% of cases, followed by depressive disorders, which affect 36.3%. BMS is a chronic neuropathic pain condition characterized primarily by a burning sensation or pain in the absence of an identifiable cause. The exact etiology of BMS remains unclear, but recent studies suggest it may involve a combination of neuropathic, endocrine, and psychological factors. The following table (Table 1) summarizes key findings from the literature, highlighting connections between oral health issues and Parkinson’s disease.

Table 1 
The surveys or experiments about Parkinson’s disease and oral diseases

Decreased ability to maintain oral hygiene

Current studies suggest that as Parkinson’s disease progresses, patients’ ability to manage their oral hygiene declines. Those impacts are all-around. Cognitive impairment diminishes the ability to maintain proper oral hygiene and reduces the likelihood of seeking dental care. A lack of oral hygiene practices in individuals with cognitive impairment often results in a severely compromised oral environment. Autonomic dysfunction and anti-Parkinson medications can lead to dysphagia, chewing difficulties, oral dyskinesia, salivary overflow, and xerostomia. These issues disrupt the self-cleaning mechanisms of the oral cavity and compromise oral hygiene, with swallowing problems potentially leading to aspiration pneumonia, a life-threatening condition. In addition, PD patients may have difficulty in the aspect of using dental cleaning tools. A retrospective study found that over two-thirds of individuals with Parkinson’s disease did not replace their brush heads for eight weeks, and most brushed for less than two minutes. The tremors in the hands, head, and face of PD patients, which make using interdental brushes and dental floss challenging and can easily cause pain or gum damage. Additionally, swallowing dysfunction increases the risk of choking and asphyxia when using mouthwash.

### Restless genital syndrome in parkinson disease [^7e678302]. JAMA Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Symptoms in the genital region, such as pain, discomfort, tingling, and burning sensations, have rarely been reported in Parkinson disease (PD), and the previous cases were attributed to nonmotor off symptoms. We report a patient with PD and severe genital discomfort unrelated to motor fluctuations but compatible with restless genital syndrome.

Observations

A 65-year-old woman with PD experienced a disabling discomfort in her pelvis and genital region for 3 years. The episodes occurred in the evening and were triggered by sitting or lying down for a period. Gynecological investigation was unrevealing. She experienced improvement with a low dose of a dopamine agonist.

Conclusion and Relevance

Restless genital syndrome is a rare disorder that can be a source of distress and disability. In patients with PD, restless genital syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of genital symptoms and restlessness, along with nonmotor wearing off and akathisia. A detailed clinical history is essential for this diagnosis and treatment with dopamine agonists can provide benefit.

### A systematic review of treatment for patients with burning mouth syndrome [^2b713f8d]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Burning mouth syndrome is a chronic idiopathic intractable intraoral dysaesthesia that remains a challenge to clinicians due to its poorly understood pathogenesis and inconsistent response to various treatments.

Aim

This review aimed to study the short- (≤3 months) and long-term (>3 months) effectiveness and sustainable benefit of different burning mouth syndrome treatment strategies and the associated side effects.

Materials and Methods

Randomised controlled trials of burning mouth syndrome treatment compared with placebo or other interventions with a minimum follow up of 2 months were searched from the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane database (published to July 2020).

Results

Twenty-two studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria and analysed. Nine categories of burning mouth syndrome treatment were identified: Anticonvulsant and antidepressant agents, phytomedicine and alpha lipoic acid supplements, low-level laser therapy, saliva substitute, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and cognitive behaviour therapy. Cognitive behaviour therapy, topical capsaicin and clonazepam, and laser therapy demonstrated favourable outcome in both short- and long-term assessment. Phytomedicines reported a short-term benefit in pain score reduction. The pooled effect of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) pain score improvement was low, but its positive effects increased in long term assessment.

Conclusion

A more significant volume in terms of sample size, multi-centres, and multi-arm comparison of therapeutic agents with placebo and longitudinal follow-up studies is recommended to establish a standardised burning mouth syndrome treatment protocol. Further studies are required to assess the analgesic benefits of topical clonazepam and capsaicin, alternative medicines with neurodegenerative prevention capability and psychology support in treating burning mouth syndrome and reducing systemic adverse drug reactions.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^899c543e]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Examination

No single sign or physical finding is diagnostic of neuropathic pain. Nearly 50% of patients with musculoskeletal pain use words that are commonly associated with neuropathic pain (e.g. “shooting” and “tingling”) to describe their pain, and as much as 30% of patients with non-neuropathic pain will describe “burning,” thus making it difficult to rely on patient history and descriptions alone. Consequently, a thorough examination is crucial to determining the actual presence of neuropathic pain over more ambiguous symptoms or conditions.

The physical examination for neuropathic pain is straightforward and should include evaluation of tone, strength, reflexes, sensation, and vasomotor/sudomotor activity. It requires a paperclip or pin to test “pinprick” sensation, a cotton ball or fingers to test “light touch,” a reflex hammer cooled with tap water to test response to “cold,” a tuning fork at 128 Hz for “vibration” sensation, and a thermometer to assess vasomotor responses. Classically, a patient with neuropathic pain should have abnormal sensation in the area of maximal pain intensity. Sensory changes should be rated as “increased,” “decreased,” or “normal”; a patient with neuropathic pain will commonly demonstrate decreased sensation to some sensory modalities and report pain in response to others. The overall purpose of the examination should be to rule in, or out, the relevant neural pathways related to the patient’s history.

If a neural lesion is suspected, an electroneuromyography (EMG) and nerve stimulation study (NCS) can be performed to better define the region/area of defect and narrow the possibilities. If the examination fails to reveal a clear diagnosis but neuropathic pain is still suspected, referral to neurology or a more detailed investigation using quantitative sensory testing (QST) may be warranted in ambiguous cases. Referral to a pain physician also may be indicated for diagnostic nerve blocks to further narrow down the source of the pain. Lastly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or skin biopsy can be used to identify central lesions or small fiber neuropathy, respectively.

Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory profiles of all patient etiologies can be found in Figure 2. In the multivariate NPSI models, there was a significant effect of PHS on burning pain and electric shock–like pain, both being less frequent in patients with PHS. In addition, there was a significant interaction between PHS and duration of disease for burning pain, indicating more burning sensation for patients with presence of PHS and a disease duration below 1 year, and less burning sensation for patients with elevated PHS and a duration over a year.

### Evaluating large language models for burning mouth syndrome diagnosis [^7c2738aa]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Gemini: Error analysis revealed that informational fallacies accounted for 72.7% of the identified issues. These fallacies stemmed from logical thought processes that were compromised by the overestimation or underestimation of the given information, as well as biases introduced by the inherent training data. The findings also highlighted a more diverse error profile, including somatoform disorders, which reflect difficulties in distinguishing functional syndromes; drug-induced burning mouth sensations, indicating an over-reliance on medication-related etiologies; and cases of BMS combined with neuropathic pain, revealing challenges in recognizing BMS as a standalone diagnosis. This diversity emphasizes the presence of less targeted diagnostic reasoning and a potentially weaker integration of the primary diagnostic criteria for BMS.

Below, we present a qualitative insight drawn from a misdiagnosis example—specifically, a case in which the LLM’s training data was insufficient and thus serves as a typical example of an informational fallacy—to illustrate the performance of large language models (LLMs). The following content was input into the LLM:

A 53-year-old female patient presents with a primary complaint of a burning sensation and dull pain in the palate. The symptoms began 13 months ago, following the emotional stress associated with caring for and the eventual passing of her mother. The pain is unilateral, affecting only the left side, and tends to be more intense in the evening compared to the morning. Interestingly, the symptoms diminish during meals. Her medical history includes a gastric hernia and postnasal drip. The severity of the symptoms, assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale, is 64. No organic abnormalities were observed in the oral cavity, and panoramic radiographic imaging also revealed no structural abnormalities.

In response to this clinical vignette, Gemini provided the following reasoning:

However, there are some atypical features for BMS:
Unilateral pain: BMS usually presents bilaterally.
Pain diminishes during meals: This is unusual for BMS, where eating can sometimes exacerbate symptoms due to increased awareness of oral sensations.

### Terminology, criteria, and definitions in complex regional pain syndrome: challenges and solutions [^afdeed9d]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Challenge 1: recognition of the condition of CRPS and its terminology

The term used to describe a disease or clinical condition is important as it provides not only a means for medical communication, but also an accurate framework for understanding the causal mechanisms, pathophysiology, and clinical characteristics of the condition.In the case of CRPS there have been many attempts to find a universally accepted name that suits this condition resulting in the existence of a wide variety of terms (Table 1).As many as 202 names, expressed in several languages, have been identified, the names reflecting various theories held related to the initializing event, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical expression or to the name of the author.Causalgia, from the Greek meaning heat and pain, was the founding term for the syndrome. This was first used by Mitchell et al to represent the burning nature of the pain, as seen within American Civil War casualties suffering traumatic bullet wounds.With the advent of radiology the clinical features of CRPS were greatly expanded.In the 1940s, when the hypothesis that the sympathetic nervous system played a key role in the development and maintenance of the disease, the term “reflex sympathetic dystrophy” was introduced.In an attempt to introduce scientific strategy to the disease concept, “causalgia” came to be used to identify the syndrome in the presence of a nerve lesion, while “reflex sympathetic dystrophy” was left to describe the syndrome without such evidence. However, this latter term was found to be too simplistic and has been discarded. For instance, it has been noted that only 15% of patients develop dystrophy and the role of a simple peripheral reflex being driven by the sympathetic nervous system has not been validated.

### Paradoxical heat sensation as a manifestation of thermal hypesthesia: a study of 1090 patients with lesions of the somatosensory system [^1e7f684b]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Paradoxical heat sensation (PHS) is the perception of warmth when the skin is cooled. Paradoxical heat sensation rarely occurs in healthy individuals but more frequently in patients suffering from lesions or disease of the peripheral or central nervous system. To further understand mechanisms and epidemiology of PHS, we evaluated the occurrence of PHS in relation to disease aetiology, pain levels, quantitative sensory testing parameters, and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) items in patients with nervous system lesions. Data of 1090 patients, including NPSI scores from 404 patients, were included in the analysis. We tested 11 quantitative sensory testing parameters for thermal and mechanical detection and pain thresholds, and 10 NPSI items in a multivariate generalised linear model with PHS, aetiology, and pain (yes or no) as fixed effects. In total, 30% of the neuropathic patients reported PHS in contrast to 2% of healthy individuals. The frequency of PHS was not linked to the presence or intensity of pain. Paradoxical heat sensation was more frequent in patients living with polyneuropathy compared with central or unilateral peripheral nerve lesions. Patients who reported PHS demonstrated significantly lower sensitivity to thermal perception, with lower sensitivity to normally painful heat and cold stimuli. Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory scores were lower for burning and electric shock-like pain quality for patients with PHS. Our findings suggest that PHS is associated with loss of small thermosensory fibre function normally involved in cold and warm perception. Clinically, presence of PHS could help screening for loss of small fibre function as it is straightforward to measure or self-reported by patients.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^793583fc]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Typical symptoms of GERD consist of heartburn, oesophageal chest pain and regurgitation.

The relationship of belching to reflux disease is variable, but belching can be part of reflux pathophysiology.

Chronic cough and wheezing have a low but potential pathophysiological relationship to reflux disease.

Hoarseness, globus, nausea, abdominal pain and other dyspeptic symptoms in the absence of typical symptoms have a low likelihood of pathophysiological relationship to reflux disease.

The modern diagnosis of GERD starts with identification of troublesome symptoms, but not all symptoms carry equal weight. Burning sensations beneath the breast bone (heartburn) or retrosternal chest pain may be interchangeable when responsive to empiric anti-secretory medication,especially after a cardiac aetiology for chest pain is ruled out.Approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of patients with heartburn, and half of patients with non-cardiac chest pain report response to short-term antisecretory therapy, but a 10%–25% placebo effect can confound this response; thus, response to an empiric PPI trial alone is insufficient for a conclusive GERD diagnosis.Both heartburn and chest pain can arise from motor disorders (such as achalasia) and DGBI mechanisms.

Regurgitation, the effortless presence of sour or bitter gastric content in the mouth, often does not fully improve with acid suppression alone.Acidic reflux episodes become weakly acidic or non-acidic following antisecretory therapy,regurgitation of which can be an important mechanism for refractory GERD leading to clinically relevant, incremental decline in health-related quality of life.Regurgitation needs differentiation from rumination, a subconsciously learnt postprandial behaviour, sometimes pleasurable, that typically stops when the regurgitate becomes acidic; this can be mistaken for PPI-refractory GERD.Rumination is treated with behavioural therapy rather than acid suppression or antireflux surgery (ARS) (figure 1).

Both supragastric belching (where air ingested or injected into the oesophagus does not reach the stomach before eructation) and gastric belching (where air in the proximal stomach is vented during a transient LES relaxation) can trigger reflux.Belching (and lack thereof, abelchia) can also be part of behavioural syndromes without pathological reflux (figure 1).

### Burning mouth syndrome-AAFP (...) [^06acc122]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Pain Characteristics In more than one half of patients with burning mouth syndrome, the onset of pain is spontaneous, with no identifiable precipitating factor. Approximately one third of patients relate time of onset to a dental procedure, recent illness or medication course. Regardless of the nature of pain onset, once the oral burning starts, it often persists for many years. 8 The burning sensation often occurs in more than one oral site, with the anterior two thirds of the tongue, the anterior hard palate and the mucosa of the lower lip most frequently involved. 5 Facial skin is not usually affected. No correlation has been noted between the oral sites that are affected and the course of the disorder or the response to treatment. In many patients with the syndrome, pain is absent during the night but occurs at a mild to moderate level by middle to late morning.

The burning may progressively increase throughout the day, reaching its greatest intensity by late afternoon and into early evening. 5 Alterations in taste occur in as many as two thirds of patients and often include complaints of persistent tastes or changes in the intensity of taste perception. Dysgeusic tastes accompanying oral burning are often reduced by stimulation with food. 5, 8 In contrast, application of a topical anesthetic may increase oral burning while decreasing dysgeusic tastes. DRY MOUTH It is not surprising that dry mouth has been suggested as an etiologic factor, in view of the higher incidence of this problem in patients with burning mouth syndrome. Other investigations have found that the ability to detect bitter taste decreases at the time of menopause.

21 This reduction in bitter taste at the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve results in intensification of taste sensations from the area innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve and the production of taste phantoms. 22 It has been suggested that damage to taste might also be associated with loss of central inhibition of trigeminal-nerve afferent pain fibers, which can lead to oral burning symptoms.
19. Management The clinical history is helpful in diagnosing burning mouth syndrome. Most patients with the disorder report an increase in pain intensity from morning to night, decreased pain with eating, oral dryness that waxes and wanes with the burning, and the frequent presence of taste disturbances. 8 Even when a patient reports typical features of burning mouth syndrome, other potential causes should be ruled out.

### Itch, pain, and burning sensation are common symptoms in mild to moderate chronic venous insufficiency with an impact on quality of life [^d96f2ba0]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

To our knowledge there are no studies evaluating the prevalence and characteristics of itch, pain, and burning sensation among patients with mild to moderate chronic venous insufficiency or assessing the impact of these symptoms on quality of life. In this report 100 patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients who suffered from itch were also assessed with the use of a validated questionnaire and a modified Skindex-16 questionnaire. We found that the prevalence of itch was 66%. Concomitant itch and burning sensation as well as itch and pain were noted in 47% and 44% of the patients, respectively. No correlation was noted between the severity of these symptoms and the degree of venous insufficiency. Itch had a negative impact on quality of life. A limitation of this study is that the participants, who were primarily hospital employees, are more likely to develop these symptoms. Therefore this study does not reflect the true prevalence of these symptoms in the general population. This study found that itch, pain, and burning sensation are common symptoms of mild to moderate chronic venous insufficiency with a significant impact on quality of life.

### Parkinson's disease related pain: a review of recent findings [^43bfda1a]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

PD-related neuropathic pain comprises radicular pain and central Parkinson's pain. Radicular pain has a higher prevalence in patients with PD than in the general population (14–35 % vs. 10 %). This high frequency probably reflects the lumbar discal structure damage due to festination, kyphosis and dystonia. Pain directly related to PD (central Parkinson's pain) is a relatively rare condition (4–10 % of patients). It mainly affects the body side with predominant motor symptoms and patients usually describe it as a burning, cramping sensation. Unlike “classic” central pain, central Parkinson's pain has no association with the clinically evident sensory deficits that reflect afferent pathway damage. Although the data argues against the currently accepted criteria for defining neuropathic pain given that the diagnosis requires a sensory deficit, most investigators believe that this type of pain arises directly from basal ganglia dysfunction that alters sensory processing of nociceptive inputs.

Over the past 2 years interest in problems related to pain in PD has enormously increased. This article reviews and summarizes the new findings in PD-related pain published in the Journal of Neurology in the years 2011 and 2012.

### An integrated perspective on diabetic, alcoholic, and drug-induced neuropathy, etiology, and treatment in the US [^d374c999]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of neuropathic pain

The diagnosis of NeuP is usually made on clinical grounds. Screening questionnaires are available for NeuP, including the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs,PainDetect,and Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4).Of these, the DN4 has the higher sensitivity and specificity. The DN4 is a questionnaire that consists of four questions and incorporates both subjective and objective information, namely the patient’s perception of pain and the physician’s exam findings. It has been validated as a screening tool for different types of NeuP, including diabetic neuropathy, and has sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 92%, respectively, at a score cutoff of 4.At a score cutoff of 3, sensitivity and specificity are 84%.While these screening tools are useful, the diagnosis ultimately hinges on the clinician’s intuition from effective interviewing and physical examination. Symptoms of neuropathy can range from hypoalgesia and paresthesia (tingling) to hyperalgesia, especially prominent in the distal extremities, known as the “stocking and glove” distribution. Patients with neuropathy may exhibit a painful response to benign stimuli, such as light touch from a cotton swab or a finger. Patients may also exhibit an attenuated/exaggerated response to a pinprick. These phenomena are known as allodynia and hypo/hyperalgesia, respectively. As the neuropathy progresses, more severe symptoms, including burning sensations and electric shocks, can arise. Symptoms are aggravated during rest and prolonged weakness and sensory loss in extremities; particularly feet can culminate in gait impairment.Because the diagnosis is based on subjective data, it can sometimes be challenging for the physician to track response to therapeutics. With this said, the threshold to treat NeuP is exceedingly low, given the good side-effect profile of most drugs. In our experience, most physicians would trial a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) if a patient complained of burning pain, even if no other findings were present.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^e8f14299]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain—symptom characterization and terminology—should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Although the term chest pain is used in clinical practice, patients often report pressure, tightness, squeezing, heaviness, or burning, and a more appropriate term is “chest discomfort”; patients may also report a location other than the chest, including the shoulder, arm, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw. Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac, and pain—described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations—suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

### Primary burning mouth syndrome: a questionnaire study of neuropathic and psychological components [^96964f56]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The pathophysiology of primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is extensively debated but poorly understood.

Objective

The aim of the study was to evaluate neuropathic and psychological components of BMS in patients with primary BMS.

Methods

Subjects were recruited through a consultation dedicated to mouth diseases, during which a diagnosis of primary BMS was assessed. Patients answered the abbreviated Douleur Neuropathique 4 questionnaire (DN4i), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the questionnaire de la douleur de Saint-Antoine (QDSA), the French version of the McGill pain questionnaire.

Results

Thirty-five patients with primary BMS were included in the study: 31 % of them had a DN4i score in favour of neuropathic pain and 34.3 % had a HADS overall score in favour of anxiety and depressive disorder.

Conclusion

Both physiological and psychological aspects of BMS need to be actively investigated by clinicians to successfully manage these patients. The physiological and psychological aspects are not mutually exclusive. The DN4i and the HADS are easy-to-use tools and could be used in an initial assessment of BMS patients.

6.2 Versus Neuropathic Pain Conditions

Neuropathic pain conditions, including radiculopathies and peripheral neuropathies, often mimic MPS due to overlapping symptoms, such as radiating or referred pain patterns. Radiculopathies involve compression or irritation of the nerve roots, resulting in pain, numbness, and weakness along the distribution of the affected nerve root. Similarly, peripheral neuropathies arise from damage to peripheral nerves and typically present with burning, tingling, or electric shock‐like sensations alongside pain.

Despite the similarities, there are distinct differences. Neuropathic pain is characterized by specific neurological signs, including sensory deficits and, when motor nerve fibers are involved, muscle weakness and altered reflexes—features that are absent in MPS. Additionally, while neuropathic pain patterns align with dermatomal distributions corresponding to affected nerve pathways, the referred pain patterns in MPS originate from trigger points in specific muscles and do not follow a dermatomal pattern. A thorough neurological examination is crucial, as it can help identify sensory abnormalities, muscle weakness, and reflex changes that are hallmarks of neuropathic conditions.

### Opioid-induced hyperalgesia and burn pain [^c1d49b54]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of pain produced during the management of burn injury has been an ongoing problem for physicians caring for these patients. The main therapeutic option for analgesia has been the repeated and prolonged use of opioids. The adverse effects of opioids are well known but the long term use of opioids which produces tolerance with accompanying dose escalation and dependence is most problematic. Another potentially important consequence of opioid exposure that sometimes masks as tolerance is that of opioid induced hyperalgesia. This syndrome is manifest as enhanced pain, sensitivity and loss of analgesic efficacy in patients treated with opioids who actually become sensitized to painful stimuli. This article focuses on the treatment of burn pain and how current analgesic therapies with opioids may cause hyperalgesia and affect the adequacy of treatment for burn pain. This article also provides possible modalities to help therapeutically manage these patients and considers future analgesic strategies which may help to improve pain management in this complicated patient population.

### How can we best diagnose severity levels of dry eye disease: current perspectives [^22f50583]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Symptoms by themselves are often inadequate for the differential diagnosis of ocular surface disease (OSD), because a wide variety of ocular surface and tear film disorders such as DED, OA, blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and bacterial or viral infections can produce the same symptoms.Signs and symptoms of DED do not often correlate.Only about two-thirds of patients with dry eye symptoms test positive for DED with traditional confirmatory tests.Despite some patients having minimal objective signs such as punctate corneal fluorescein staining, they complain of severe ocular irritation, whereas others present with severe staining and have minimal symptomatology.The ability to practically examine tear biomarkers reveals that specific biomarkers correlate to the signs and symptoms in all forms of dry eye.

Typical ocular surface-related symptoms include eye irritation, burning, tearing, stinging, a gritty or foreign body sensation, photophobia, fluctuating vision, redness, intermittent sharp pain, and transient blurred vision. Environments that generate desiccating stress including high temperature, low humidity, air conditioning, and activities that lead to reduced blinking such as driving, computer use, reading, and watching television can worsen dry eye symptoms.Ocular itching, frequently referenced as the hallmark OA symptom, is not just an allergic issue, just as tear film instability is not just related to DED.DED symptoms have features of neuropathic ocular pain, including spontaneous pain, hyperalgesia and dysesthesias.Initial ocular surface damage or inflammation may cause central and/or peripheral sensitization, producing hypersensitivity and persistent DED symptoms despite the source of inflammation and/or damage being removed.

Capsaicin

Capsaicin has shown to be an effective pain desensitiser especially with oral topical application for up to 4 months. Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 receptors (TRPV1) are found in the PNS and CNS. The numbers of TRPV1 receptors are significantly increased in the mucosa of BMS patients’ tongues. Activation of TRPV1 at the peripheral terminal fibre endings leads to the release of neuropeptides such as substance P, neurokinin A (NKA) and calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), which contributes to the onset of hyperalgesia pain and inflammation. Local capsaicin application activates the TRPV1 and modulates the nociceptive transmission of pain impulses from the peripheral stimulation site to the central nervous system by blocking axonal transportation, depleting neuropeptides, and loss of membrane action potential. Hence, capsaicin-induced analgesic effect by desensitisation of the nociceptive fibre (–), which is a reversible process. The used of topical capsaicin have been suggested in neuropathic pain, such as postherpetic neuralgia and painful HIV associated polyneuropathy (–) but not inflammatory pain such as osteoarthritis.

A study showed no difference between systemic and topical capsaicin efficacy in BMS. However, gastric pain limits systemic capsaicin use. The use of topical capsaicin rinse is recommended in BMS due to its rapid action and there being no reported adverse effects, as seen in other synthetic drugs. However, there are no known risks of long-term repeated rinsing of capsaicin, especially in the oral cavity mucosa innervation. Patients should be warned of the initial increase in burning pain induced by topical capsaicin rinse or application followed by the discharge in the C and Aδ nociceptive fibres, but this effect is limited, of short duration, and followed by pain relief. Cutaneous site pre-treatment with anaesthetic cream has been used clinically to reduce the capsaicin patch-induced treatment discomfort in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. Hence, a possible hypothetical proposition of a mouth rinse mixture containing both capsaicin and lidocaine may mask this initial burning pain and enhance pain relief effectiveness.

### Burning mouth syndrome responsive to duloxetine: a case report [^0d04ceb9]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic, idiopathic, intraoral mucosal pain condition in the absence of specific oral lesions and systemic disease. Among evidence-based pharmacological treatments for this disorder, topical and systemic clonazepam, levosulpiride, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been used with partial results.

Case

We report a case of a 65-year-old otherwise healthy woman with a 3-year history of oral burning. Clinical and laboratory evaluations allowed us to make a diagnosis of burning mouth syndrome. She was treated with duloxetine (60 mg p.o. qd), a selective serotonin, and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, obtaining a complete remission of symptoms, evaluated via standardized clinical rating scales, and an improvement of her quality of life and level of functioning.

Discussion

The pathogenesis of BMS still remains unclear. Recently, it has been suggested an underlying neuropathic mechanism, demonstrating a dysfunction in the trigeminal nociceptive pathways at peripheral and/or central nervous system level. The rationale behind the administration of duloxetine resides in its central mechanism of action, and analgesic effects previously demonstrated in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and fibromyalgia. Also, it has been shown to reduce painful physical symptoms associated with depression.

Conclusion

We hypothesize that duloxetine might represent a useful, effective, and additional therapeutic option in the treatment of BMS.

5.2 Application-Associated Pain

Even following use of a local anesthetic prior to administration of QUTENZA, patients may experience substantial procedural pain and burning upon application of QUTENZA and following removal of QUTENZA. Prepare to treat acute pain during and following the application procedure with local cooling and/or appropriate analgesic medication.

5.3 Increase in Blood Pressure

In clinical trials, transient increases in blood pressure occurred during or shortly after exposure to QUTENZA. The changes averaged less than 10 mm Hg, although some patients had greater increases and these changes lasted for approximately two hours after QUTENZA removal. Increases in blood pressure were unrelated to the pretreatment blood pressure but were related to treatment-related increases in pain. Monitor blood pressure periodically during and following the treatment procedure and provide adequate support for treatment-related pain.

Patients with unstable or poorly controlled hypertension, or a recent history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, may be at an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects. Consider these factors prior to initiating QUTENZA treatment.

5.4 Sensory Function

Reductions in sensory function have been reported following administration of QUTENZA. Decreases in sensory functions are generally minor and temporary (including to thermal and other harmful stimuli). All patients with pre-existing sensory deficits should be clinically assessed for signs of sensory deterioration or loss prior to each application of QUTENZA. If sensory deterioration or loss is detected or pre-existing sensory deficit worsens, continued use of QUTENZA treatment should be reconsidered.

5.5 Severe Application Site Burns

Cases of full-thickness (third-degree) and deep partial-thickness (second-degree) burns have been reported following administration of QUTENZA. Cases of full-thickness (third-degree) burns, requiring hospitalization and skin grafting have been reported in patients who received QUTENZA for an unapproved indication and/or frequency of dosing at an application site where there had been prior skin trauma ​[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. ​Ensure that dosage and administration recommendations are followed ​[see Dosage and Administration (2)]. ​

### Peripheral burning sensation: a novel clinical marker of poor prognosis and higher plasma-paraquat concentrations in paraquat poisoning [^d1e976a5]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Self-poisoning with paraquat has a case fatality ratio (CFR) over 65% in Sri Lanka. Plasma-paraquat concentration is the best prognostic indicator for patient outcome but is not readily available. Alternative surrogate clinical markers could be useful in management and determining prognosis. Anecdotal reports by medical and research staff suggested that patients who complained of burning sensation of the body had a poor prognosis and a prospective study was initiated.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study in three hospitals in Sri Lanka. We collected demographic data, presence or absence of burning sensation, and major outcome, and determined the plasma-paraquat concentration within 24 h post-ingestion.

Results

There were 179 patients with deliberate self-ingestion of paraquat over 30 months. Burning sensation was reported in 84 patients (48%), which was initiated at a median of 1 day (range 1-3 days) post-ingestion. Of the patients who had burning, 61 died [CFR = 72.62%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 62-81]. Of the 91 patients who had no peripheral burning, 23 died (CFR = 25.27%, 95% CI = 18.15-35.9). Presence of peripheral burning sensation was associated with a significantly higher risk of death (odds ratio = 7.8, 95% CI = 3.9-15, p < 0.0001). Patients who complained of peripheral burning died at a median of 36 h (interquartile range = 30.5-88) following ingestion whereas those who had no peripheral burning died at a median of 50.5 h (interquartile range = 16.75-80). The difference was not significant (p > 0.05). Median admission plasma-paraquat concentration in patients with peripheral burning (2.67 microg/mL, 95% CI = 0.84-14.2) was significantly higher than in the patients with no peripheral burning (0.022 microg/mL, 95% CI = 0.005-0.78; p < 0.001). Peripheral burning has a sensitivity of 0.72 (95% CI = 0.6-8) and specificity of 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64-0.08) and a positive predictive value of 0.73 (95% CI = 0.6-0.8).

Discussion

It is possible that this symptom may help discriminate between patients who have poor chance of survival and those who may potentially benefit from interventions. The mechanism is not clear but could either include a direct concentration-related effect or be a marker of oxidative stress.

Conclusion

Presence of burning sensation is associated with high plasma-paraquat concentrations and is strongly predictive of death.
