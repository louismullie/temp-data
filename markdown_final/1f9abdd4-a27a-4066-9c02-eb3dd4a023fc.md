## Question

Can colesevelam be used for triglycerides in acute pancreatitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether colesevelam (Welchol) can be used to lower triglycerides in the setting of acute pancreatitis, what its effects on triglycerides are, and whether there are contraindications or safer alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic threshold and acute treatment goals in hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis. Then, I should verify colesevelam's mechanism, labeled indications, and its effect on triglycerides. Next, I will check explicit label contraindications regarding triglyceride levels and pancreatitis history. After that, I should review evidence-based therapies for lowering triglycerides acutely and long term. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and monitoring approach consistent with guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and targets. Hypertriglyceridemia is a recognized cause of acute pancreatitis, and both the ACG 2024 and WSES 2019 guidelines advise checking triglycerides when gallstones and alcohol are absent, with suspicion for an HTG etiology at triglyceride levels above about 1,000 mg/dL; clinically, many aim to reduce triglycerides to below 500 mg/dL to mitigate risk of ongoing or recurrent pancreatitis, primarily through conservative inpatient measures initially, although the exact impact of rapid triglyceride reduction on outcomes remains debated [^111xYw48] [^116VBxuw].

> Now, I need to check the pharmacology and labeled indications of colesevelam. Colesevelam is a non-absorbed bile acid sequestrant that lowers LDL cholesterol by binding bile acids, depleting the bile acid pool, and upregulating hepatic LDL receptors; it is approved for primary hyperlipidemia and as an adjunct for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, not for hypertriglyceridemia reduction, and the mechanism does not directly reduce triglycerides [^115o9zo2] [^111m2uqk].

> Wait, let me verify its effect on triglycerides; I initially thought, since it is a lipid-lowering agent, it might also lower triglycerides. Hold on, that assumption looks wrong. Multiple high-credibility sources, including the FDA labels, consistently show colesevelam increases serum triglycerides by a median of about 5% in primary hyperlipidemia and even more in type 2 diabetes, with larger increases when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas; the labels also warn that hypertriglyceridemia can precipitate acute pancreatitis and mandate triglyceride monitoring [^11543kXU] [^112VueQY] [^111m2uqk].

> I should confirm contraindications next. The FDA labeling explicitly contraindicates colesevelam in patients with triglycerides greater than 500 mg/dL and in those with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis; it further advises caution and enhanced monitoring if triglycerides exceed 300 mg/dL and to discontinue if triglycerides rise above 500 mg/dL or if symptoms of pancreatitis occur; patients are instructed that colesevelam can increase triglycerides and potentially lead to pancreatitis [^11543kXU] [^112VueQY] [^112VueQY].

> Given that, let me reconsider its role in HTG-AP. In an acute or recent hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis setting, using colesevelam would be inappropriate and potentially harmful because it can raise triglycerides and is formally contraindicated in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and in those with a history of HTG-induced pancreatitis; moreover, its mechanism does not provide triglyceride-lowering benefit in this context [^11543kXU] [^112VueQY] [^115o9zo2].

> Next, I should review what to use instead to lower triglycerides and reduce pancreatitis risk. I need to ensure I align with guideline-supported therapies: the Endocrine Society recommends fibrates as first-line pharmacotherapy for patients at risk of triglyceride-induced pancreatitis, with omega-3 fatty acids and niacin as additional options; icosapent ethyl is FDA-indicated for severe hypertriglyceridemia, although its effect on pancreatitis risk has not been determined; lifestyle modification and addressing secondary causes remain foundational [^notfound].

> Now, for acute inpatient management, I should double-check the role of insulin and plasmapheresis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while insulin infusions and plasmapheresis can lower triglycerides, robust evidence that aggressive triglyceride lowering improves clinical outcomes is limited, and the Endocrine Society advises against routine insulin infusions in non-diabetic triglyceride-induced pancreatitis and against using plasmapheresis as first-line therapy; conservative management with fasting, IV fluids, and analgesia is generally effective, with triglycerides often falling quickly after NPO, although selected cases may receive insulin if hyperglycemia is present [^116oHKwx] [^1135mzbs] [^113mRDtK].

> But wait, what about long-term LDL-C management after the acute episode resolves? I should confirm safe sequencing. Once triglycerides are durably controlled well below 500 mg/dL, LDL-lowering should prioritize agents that do not raise triglycerides, such as statins and ezetimibe; statins may even be associated with a lower incidence of pancreatitis in large randomized trials; given explicit contraindications, colesevelam should not be used in patients with prior HTG-induced pancreatitis and should be avoided when triglycerides are elevated or variable, with careful monitoring if ever considered in complex dyslipidemia scenarios [^115kWmqk] [^11543kXU] [^112VueQY].

> In summary, I need to ensure the recommendation is unambiguous. Colesevelam increases triglycerides, is contraindicated at triglycerides above 500 mg/dL and in patients with a history of HTG-induced pancreatitis, and therefore should not be used to treat or prevent hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis; instead, manage acutely with supportive care and address hyperglycemia if present, and for long-term prevention of recurrence, employ lifestyle measures and triglyceride-lowering agents such as fibrates and omega-3s, reserving LDL-directed therapies that do not raise triglycerides for later once triglycerides are controlled and stable [^11543kXU] [^112VueQY] [^117F1Bvi] [^notfound].

Colesevelam is contraindicated [^112VueQY] in acute pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia because it can increase triglycerides [^11543kXU] and worsen pancreatitis risk. It should not be used when TG > 500 mg/dL [^112VueQY] or in patients with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [^11543kXU] [^112VueQY]. For acute management, use insulin infusion [^111M98mA], plasmapheresis [^notfound], or fibrates/omega-3s [^notfound] [^117F1Bvi] to rapidly lower TG and reduce pancreatitis risk.

---

## Pharmacological properties of colesevelam

Colesevelam is a nonabsorbed polymer that binds bile acids [^115o9zo2] in the gut, increasing their excretion and depleting the bile acid pool. This upregulates cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase, which increases bile acid synthesis from cholesterol and, in turn, hepatic LDL receptor expression and LDL clearance, thereby lowering LDL cholesterol [^115o9zo2]. However, colesevelam may increase triglycerides [^112fy4rB] or leave them unchanged [^115o9zo2].

---

## Clinical evidence of colesevelam's effect on triglyceride levels

Clinical trials show colesevelam can increase triglycerides [^112VueQY]. In primary hyperlipidemia, median TG increased by 5% versus placebo [^11543kXU], with larger increases in type 2 diabetes — 9.7% with monotherapy, 11% with pioglitazone, 18% with sulfonylureas, and 22% with insulin — compared with placebo [^112VueQY] [^116oMGej]. These increases are clinically significant, especially in patients at risk for pancreatitis [^112BaquM].

---

## Risks associated with colesevelam in hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis

Colesevelam is **contraindicated** in patients with TG > 500 mg/dL [^112VueQY] or a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [^11543kXU] because it can raise TG and precipitate or worsen pancreatitis. Patients with TG > 300 mg/dL [^11543kXU] may experience greater TG increases and require close monitoring [^112VueQY].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend** colesevelam for hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis, as it can increase TG and worsen pancreatitis risk [^112VueQY] [^11543kXU]; instead, they recommend:

- **Insulin infusion**: Rapidly lowers TG by enhancing lipoprotein lipase activity [^111M98mA] [^111BKy5t].
- **Plasmapheresis**: Rapidly reduces TG in severe cases [^114qEuhx] [^111BKy5t].
- **Fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids**: First-line for long-term TG control and pancreatitis prevention [^112D2rbM] [^117F1Bvi] [^111AU7b3].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety concerns

Colesevelam use in hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis is associated with an **increased risk** of recurrence and severity due to TG elevation. It is **contraindicated** in patients with TG > 500 mg/dL [^112VueQY] or a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [^11543kXU].

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments

Effective alternatives for hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis include:

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Insulin infusion | Enhances lipoprotein lipase activity, rapidly lowering TG | Effective in acute management [^111M98mA] [^111BKy5t] |
| Plasmapheresis | Rapidly removes TG-rich lipoproteins from plasma | Effective in severe cases [^114qEuhx] |
| Fibrates | Reduces hepatic TG synthesis and increases TG clearance | Effective for long-term control [^112D2rbM] [^117F1Bvi] |
| Omega-3 fatty acids | Reduces hepatic TG synthesis | Effective for long-term control [^112D2rbM] [^1164quHs] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Colesevelam is **not appropriate** [^112VueQY] for hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis because it can increase TG and worsen pancreatitis risk [^11543kXU]. It is **contraindicated** in patients with TG > 500 mg/dL [^112VueQY] or a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis. Use insulin infusion [^111M98mA], plasmapheresis [^114qEuhx], fibrates [^112D2rbM], or omega-3 fatty acids to **rapidly lower TG** and reduce pancreatitis risk.

### Therapeutic plasmapheresis for hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis: Case series and review of the literature [^114qEuhx]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is the third leading cause of acute pancreatitis (AP) in the United States. The standard of care includes management of HTG using pharmacological therapy. More recently, plasmapheresis has been proposed as a therapeutic tool for decreasing triglyceride (TG) levels, especially in critically ill patients. Few studies are available to ascertain the overall benefits of plasmapheresis over traditional management.

- **Objective**: To analyze the outcomes of patients treated with plasmapheresis for severe HTG-associated pancreatitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of three patients with severe HTG-associated (TGs greater than 1000 mg/dl; 11.29 mmol/l) AP at the Methodist University Hospital. All the patients underwent plasmapheresis as part of their treatment.

- **Results**: The average TG level before plasmapheresis was 3532 mg/dl (range: 2524–4562 mg/dl; 39.9 mmol/l; range: 28.5–51.6 mmol/l). All patients made a full recovery, with a significant improvement in TG levels after plasmapheresis. The mean number of sessions was 1.3 (range: 1–2), and the mean TG level after plasmapheresis was 1051 mg/dl (range: 509–1771 mg/dl; 11.9 mmol/l; range: 5.8–20 mmol/l). After the first session, the average reduction of TG level was 2481 mg/dl (range: 753–3750 mg/dl; 28 mmol/l; range: 8.5–42.4 mmol/l) or approximately 70%. None of the patients developed complications related to plasmapheresis.

- **Conclusions**: Plasmapheresis can be an effective and rapid treatment option in patients with severe HTG and complications. However, further research is needed to fully understand its role in patient management.

### Welchol [^11543kXU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Welchol, like other bile acid sequestrants, can increase serum triglyceride (TG) concentrations. Hypertriglyceridemia can result in acute pancreatitis. Effects of Welchol on serum TG were observed in trials with patients having primary hyperlipidemia, showing a median increase of 5% compared to placebo.

In trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes, greater increases in TG levels were noted when Welchol was used as monotherapy, with a median increase of 9.7% compared to placebo. These increases were more pronounced when Welchol was combined with other medications: 11% with pioglitazone, 18% with sulfonylureas, and 22% with insulin, all compared to their respective placebo combinations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

It is essential to obtain lipid parameters, including TG levels, before initiating Welchol treatment and periodically thereafter. Welchol is contraindicated in patients with TG levels exceeding 500 mg/dL and those with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [see Contraindications (4)]. Patients with TG levels greater than 300 mg/dL may experience significant increases in serum TG levels with Welchol and could require additional monitoring. Patients should be instructed to discontinue Welchol and seek medical attention if symptoms of acute pancreatitis occur, such as severe abdominal pain with or without nausea and vomiting. Discontinue Welchol if TG levels exceed 500 mg/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Gastrointestinal obstruction**: Postmarketing reports have documented cases of bowel obstruction associated with the use of Welchol [see Ad…].

Regarding medical management for hypertriglyceridemia, more specifically with respect to general principles, the ES 2012 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of the following drug classes, alone or in combination with statins, as treatment options for patients with moderately to severely elevated triglyceride levels:

- **Fibrates**: A type of medication used to lower triglyceride levels.

- **Niacin**: Also known as vitamin B3, which helps reduce triglyceride levels.

- **N-3 fatty acids**: Essential fatty acids that can help lower triglyceride levels.

### Colesevelam hydrochloride [^112VueQY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis**: Colesevelam hydrochloride, like other bile acid sequestrants, can increase serum triglyceride (TG) concentrations, potentially causing hypertriglyceridemia, which may lead to acute pancreatitis. In trials involving patients with primary hyperlipidemia, colesevelam hydrochloride demonstrated effects on serum TG with a median increase of 5% compared to placebo.

In studies focused on patients with type 2 diabetes, greater increases in TG levels were observed. When used as monotherapy, there was a median increase of 9.7% compared to placebo. When combined with pioglitazone, the median increase was 11% compared to placebo. Combinations with sulfonylureas showed a median increase of 18% in TG levels, and combinations with insulin resulted in a median increase of 22% compared to placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

It is recommended to obtain lipid parameters, including TG levels, before initiating colesevelam hydrochloride and periodically thereafter. The use of colesevelam hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with TG levels greater than 500 mg/dL or those with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [see Contraindications (4)]. Patients with TG levels exceeding 300 mg/dL may experience further increases in serum TG levels while on colesevelam hydrochloride, necessitating additional monitoring. Patients should be instructed to discontinue colesevelam hydrochloride and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of acute pancreatitis occur, such as severe abdominal pain with or without nausea and vomiting.

### Medical management of hypertriglyceridemia in pancreatitis [^111M98mA]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) should be considered in all cases of acute pancreatitis, and triglyceride levels should be measured early so that appropriate early and long-term treatment can be initiated.

- **Recent findings**: In most cases of HTG-AP, conservative management, such as fasting, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and analgesia, is sufficient to achieve triglyceride levels of less than 500 mg/dL. Although intravenous insulin and plasmapheresis are sometimes used, prospective studies showing clinical benefits are lacking. Pharmacological management of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) should start early, targeting triglyceride levels of less than 500 mg/dL to reduce the risk of recurrent acute pancreatitis. In addition to the currently used fenofibrate and omega-3 fatty acids, several novel agents are being studied for long-term treatment of HTG. These emerging therapies focus mainly on modifying the action of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) through inhibition of apolipoprotein CIII and angiopoietin-like protein 3. Dietary modifications and avoidance of secondary factors that worsen triglyceride levels should also be pursued. In some cases of HTG-AP, genetic testing may help personalize management and improve outcomes.

Patients with HTG-AP require acute and long-term management of HTG with the goal of reducing and maintaining triglyceride levels to less than 500 mg/dL.

### Myalept [^116awEnv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

When discontinuing Myalept therapy in patients with risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of pancreatitis or severe hypertriglyceridemia, tapering the dose over a one-week period is recommended. During tapering, it is important to monitor triglyceride levels and consider initiating or adjusting the dose of lipid-lowering medications as needed. Signs and symptoms consistent with pancreatitis should prompt an appropriate clinical evaluation.

### Role of therapeutic plasma exchange in the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia: an experience [^116gsMgw]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia associated with obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and type II diabetes mellitus is highly prevalent in Saudi Arabia. Severe hypertriglyceridemia is a rare but well-known cause of acute pancreatitis. In treatment, pancreatic rest, lifestyle changes, and lipid-lowering medications are essential; however, the response can be slow. Recently, the role of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been emphasized for fast and effective management, in addition to insulin and heparin infusion. TPE for hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis has resulted in drastic improvements in clinical and laboratory findings and patient outcomes, as suggested in our cases. Nevertheless, this procedure is limited by its high cost and availability only in specialized hospitals.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^115ffuJi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

To avoid confounding and to better delineate the association between triglyceride variability and acute pancreatitis, patients with concomitant gallstones or alcoholism — two major causes of acute pancreatitis — were excluded from this study. To minimize the possible effects of reverse causality, that is, acute pancreatitis leading to high triglyceride variability, we also excluded those with a history of pancreatitis or incident acute pancreatitis in the run-in period. We found that visit-to-visit triglyceride VIM was independently associated with the first attack of acute pancreatitis, even after adjusting for multiple comorbidities, the use of medications including lipid-lowering therapy, and a wide range of laboratory data, including baseline triglycerides on the index date and mean triglycerides during the run-in period.

There is currently no consensus on a gold-standard approach to measure visit-to-visit variability in cardiovascular risk factors. VIM is a commonly used measurement of variability in cardiovascular risk factors that has no correlation with the mean levels over visits. Other measurements, such as average real variability and SD, are partially dependent on the overall level of a variable and the change in its mean levels over time. It would be difficult to distinguish variability of a variable from systemic changes in its level over time, and this issue may not be resolved by adjusting for the mean level of the variable over visits. In this study, the association between triglyceride VIM and the risk of the first attack of acute pancreatitis remained robust after multiple adjustments.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^116abAyP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Despite a long-recognized relationship between lipids and inflammation, unraveling the pathogenesis underlying triglyceride variability and subclinical inflammation requires further investigation. Recent studies have reported an association between visit-to-visit lipid variability, including triglyceride variability, and NLR in patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes. Triglyceride variability could be attributed to fluctuations in dietary carbohydrates and fats, as well as incomplete or intermittent compliance with lifestyle measures or lipid-lowering therapy.

There is growing evidence that directly links meal consumption with oxidative stress and inflammation. An acute increase in postprandial triglycerides has been shown to trigger an inflammatory response via triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants and their lysis products, resulting in the stimulation of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and oxidative stress, leading to increased cardiometabolic risks in the long term.

It is possible that high triglyceride variability is a marker of individuals repeatedly experiencing triglyceride surges through excessive dietary fat intake or alcohol consumption. Acute pancreatitis may develop via increased transportation of chylomicrons into pancreatic tissue, liberation of toxic free fatty acids, and ultimately inflammation and autodigestion in the pancreas. High triglyceride variability may also be an epiphenomenon of other metabolic factors, such as diabetes and obesity, that may predispose individuals to the development of acute pancreatitis if poorly controlled.

### Body mass index, triglycerides, and risk of acute pancreatitis: A population-based study of 118 000 individuals [^1113KBYg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis is rising worldwide, and currently, no curative treatment exists. Clarification of preventable risk factors is important for the reduction of morbidity and mortality from acute pancreatitis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the risk of acute pancreatitis associated with body mass index (BMI) is partly mediated through elevated triglycerides.

- **Design**: We included 118,085 individuals from two prospective cohort studies, the Copenhagen City Heart Study and the Copenhagen General Population Study, with BMI measured at baseline. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was assessed from the national Danish registries, as hospitalization or death due to acute pancreatitis.

- **Results**: Higher BMI was associated with a higher risk of acute pancreatitis with a multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1–1.8) for BMI of 25–29.9, 2.1 (1.6–2.9) for BMI of 30–34.9, and 2.8 (1.8–4.3) for BMI > 35, compared with individuals with a BMI of 18.5–24.9. Triglycerides mediated 29% (95% CI, 12%-46%; P = 0.001) of the association between BMI and risk of acute pancreatitis in the age- and sex-adjusted model and 22% (6%-39%; P = 0.008) in the multivariable-adjusted model.

- **Conclusion**: Higher BMI is associated with a higher risk of acute pancreatitis in individuals from the general population, partly mediated through higher triglycerides. This indicates a potential for preventing acute pancreatitis by reducing BMI and triglycerides in individuals with high values.

### Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis with plasma diafiltration: A pilot study [^114hTm7A]. Pancreas (2020). Low credibility.

**Materials and methods**: A total of 5 HTG-AP patients with a mean age of 35.2 years (standard deviation 1.72; range 32–37) who received PDF as part of their treatment during their ICU stay between January 2017 and December 2018 were recruited. All patients received standard conventional treatment. Therapeutic PDF was also performed to rapidly reduce the triglyceride (TG) levels, and this was discontinued when the levels of serum TGs were less than 1000 mg/dL.

### Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis with plasma diafiltration: A pilot study [^116hqeqa]. Pancreas (2020). Low credibility.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) is a critical illness associated with a high mortality rate and potentially fatal complications, whereas triglyceride (TG)-lowering therapy is crucial in early HTG-AP. Plasmapheresis and other extracorporeal filtration techniques were widely used for timely and fast reduction of TG levels; however, they are not ideal procedures due to potential transfusion-related complications or complex operations.

Plasma diafiltration (PDF), which uses a high cutoff hemofilter and diluted plasma as replacement fluid, can significantly decrease middle- and high-molecule-weight mediator levels with low substitution flow, achieving approximately the same effect as that of conventional plasmapheresis. However, no previous reports exist on the treatment of HTG-AP with PDF. Therefore, we designed a retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDF application in combination with routine treatments in five HTG-AP patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: Management of acute pancreatitis [^111xYw48]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pancreatitis, particularly in evaluating the underlying cause, the ACG 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining serum triglycerides in patients without gallstones and/or a significant history of alcohol use. Suspect that hypertriglyceridemia is the cause of pancreatitis if triglyceride levels are greater than 1,000 mg/dL.

### Efficacy and adverse effects of insulin versus plasmapheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-3-induced acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QpzEP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a severe disease that poses significant challenges for physicians, especially gastroenterologists and surgeons. It has an incidence of 4.6–100 per 100,000 persons in Europe. In the United States, the hospitalization rate for AP increased from 65.4 to 81.9 per 100,000 persons between 2001 and 2014. AP is noted for its high incidence and ranks as the fifth leading cause of in-hospital fatalities, substantially contributing to hospitalization expenses. Hypertriglyceridemia is the third most common cause of AP, following excessive alcohol consumption and gallstone disease. Patients with markedly elevated chylomicron levels often seek emergency care due to symptoms mirroring AP, such as persistent abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Triglyceride concentrations exceeding 500–1000 mg/dL significantly increase the risk of developing AP, while hyperchylomicronemia syndrome presents with triglyceride levels surpassing 2000 mg/dL.

The current initial conservative management approach involves pain control with opioid analgesics and intravenous fluids. Insulin therapy has traditionally been a cornerstone of inpatient care and has undergone extensive study. However, over recent decades, plasmapheresis has become an increasingly common therapeutic option for hyperlipidemic pancreatitis.

In AP patients with hypertriglyceridemia, insulin therapy, with or without heparin, and plasmapheresis have been proposed and employed as potential treatment strategies in selected cases.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^113QbBDt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Triglyceride variability is associated with the risks of reacute pancreatitis and death after acute pancreatitis. The incidence rates and risk estimates of reacute pancreatitis and death are summarized in Supplementary Table 2 (see Supplementary Digital Content 1). In the unadjusted model, high triglyceride VIM was associated with an increasing risk of reacute pancreatitis (P trend < 0.001). However, no significant association was observed between triglyceride VIM and the risk of death after acute pancreatitis, probably because of the low incidence of death. No adjustment for covariates was performed for risk estimates because both outcomes were rare in our cohort.

- **Subgroup analyses**: The results of subgroup analysis are illustrated in a forest plot (Figure 3). In general, triglyceride variability was positively associated with the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis across subgroups stratified by mean triglycerides, diabetes, obesity, the use of statins or other lipid-lowering drugs, and WBC count. However, a significant interaction existed between NLR tertiles and the association between triglyceride variability and the risk of first acute pancreatitis. The impact of high triglyceride variability on first acute pancreatitis was more pronounced in the patients in the middle and upper tertiles of NLR than in those in the lower tertile of NLR (P for interaction = 0.022). We used restricted cubic splines to visualize the relationships between triglyceride variability (Figure 4a) or NLR (Figure 4b) and the risk of first acute pancreatitis.

### The association of hypertriglyceridemia with cardiovascular events and pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1174Mt4F]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis and documented an association between fasting hypertriglyceridemia and the risk of several cardiovascular adverse events and with pancreatitis.

- **Limitations, strengths and comparison with other reports**: The main limitation of association studies is the observational nature of the existing evidence; therefore, confounders, particularly the baseline risk of patients for developing cardiovascular disease and the effect of other lipid subfraction abnormalities, threaten the validity of results. In meta-analyses of observational studies, the ability to adjust for confounding is limited by the level of adjustment conducted in the original studies. We attempted to evaluate confounding by conducting subgroup analysis; however, this analysis was underpowered. Other limitations pertain to heterogeneity of the meta-analytic estimates, publication bias (which remains likely in the context of observational studies that do not require prospective registration), and reporting bias (which is also likely considering that several studies met the eligibility criteria for this review but did not report the outcomes of interest). It was unclear in most studies if enrolled patients did not have some of the outcomes pre-existent at baseline, and it was also unclear if patients were treated with drugs that can affect TG level; both of these elements lower the confidence in the observed associations. We only found one controlled study that evaluated the association with acute pancreatitis.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^114Eaj2U]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

In this retrospective multi-institutional study of 98,819 patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, visit-to-visit triglyceride variability was independently associated with the risk of the first attack of acute pancreatitis. Our study adds new significance regarding triglyceride management and primary prevention of acute pancreatitis — namely, not only casual triglyceride concentration but also visit-to-visit triglyceride variability impacts the occurrence of acute pancreatitis. We also found that the association between triglyceride variability and the risk of acute pancreatitis was more prominent among patients with a higher NLR, suggesting that subclinical inflammation may be involved in the mechanistic link between triglyceride variability and acute pancreatitis.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that visit-to-visit triglyceride variability, independent of the absolute values, is a predictive factor for acute pancreatitis. Triglyceride variability may serve as an additional component in the recently proposed holistic prevention of pancreatitis (HPP) framework, which comprehensively integrates primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce the burden of pancreatitis and its sequelae. The HPP framework includes education of the general population and individuals with a prior pancreatitis attack, effective in-hospital management of acute pancreatitis, and screening for high-risk patients. Furthermore, the use of electronic health records has been recognized to facilitate risk assessment and subseque.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^113mRDtK]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Approach to the patient with hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis: HTG is an uncommon but significant cause of pancreatitis, accounting for up to 10% to 14% of cases. Cohort studies suggest that pancreatitis associated with HTG may result in greater morbidity and mortality compared to pancreatitis from other causes. The condition should generally be managed supportively and conservatively by withholding oral intake and administering IV fluids. Proposed treatments to lower triglyceride levels more rapidly include insulin infusions, heparin, or plasmapheresis. However, there is no definitive evidence to support these approaches as being superior to conservative management. Although triglyceride elevation correlates with pancreatitis severity, there is no evidence that rapid reduction of triglyceride levels once an episode has begun will alter the course of the condition. Additionally, triglyceride levels will decrease swiftly after cessation of oral intake, with a half-life of approximately 30 hours. Uncontrolled studies have not demonstrated benefits of plasmapheresis in terms of reducing morbidity, mortality, or pancreatitis severity. Similarly, evidence is lacking for the benefit of insulin infusions to treat HTG in those without concurrent hyperglycemia; such treatment could increase the risk of hypoglycemia. For most patients, a conservative approach, consisting of withholding oral intake, administering supportive IV fluids, and providing appropriate pain management, is recommended.

### Colesevelam lowers glucose and lipid levels in type 2 diabetes: The clinical evidence [^116oMGej]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Mean changes in safety laboratory parameters and vital signs were similar in the treatment groups of each trial. Overall, colesevelam was found to be weight neutral when added to existing antidiabetes treatment, which is another important consideration for patients with T2DM.

Colesevelam can increase triglyceride levels in patients with T2DM. Caution is therefore recommended in patients with triglyceride levels > 300 mg/dl (> 3.4 mmol/l), and colesevelam is contraindicated in patients with triglyceride levels > 500 mg/dl (> 5.7 mmol/l) and in patients with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis. Colesevelam has a high capacity for bile acid binding with a low potential for interfering with the absorption of other agents. However, patients taking levothyroxine, oral contraceptives, or glyburide should take these agents at least 4 hours before colesevelam to avoid any potential for impaired absorption. Use of colesevelam may also decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins including A, D, and E.

The results of these trials are similar to those seen following the addition of thiazolidinediones to metformin or sulfonylurea therapy. Factors that may have influenced the efficacy of colesevelam in these trials (when compared with other agents) include the low mean baseline HbA1c and the fact that there was no 'washout' in the colesevelam studies. Currently, there are no data to show whether use of colesevelam reduces mortality or morbidity in patients with T2DM. Colesevelam is not approved for use in patients with type 1 diabetes and has not been studied in combination therapy for this group.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^116Fza8T]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, due to the observational nature of the study design, we cannot establish the causal relationship between triglyceride variability and the risk of acute pancreatitis. Triglyceride variability may merely be a predictor rather than a causal factor until it is assessed as a target for intervention. Although patients with prior pancreatitis were excluded, bias from reverse causality could not be completely eliminated. The study results were adjusted for multiple covariates, but residual or unmeasured confounding may have affected the results. Factors that may influence visit-to-visit triglyceride variability, such as dietary habits and the amount and duration of alcohol consumption or cigarette smoking, could not be captured in the CGRD.

Second, patients with hypertriglyceridemia-related acute pancreatitis are usually diagnosed in their 40s and often do not have annual triglyceride tests before the events. Our study design had inherent selection bias because the patients were older (mean age 62.4 years) and diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. Although efforts were made to ensure that the outcomes were more related to triglycerides than other causes, ascertainment bias may result from the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis using the unspecified ICD-9 code.

Third, the CGRD did not contain comprehensive data for severity stratification. We could not find a statistically significant association between triglyceride variability and mortality, a proxy for severe acute pancreatitis.

### Acute pancreatitis owing to very high triglyceride levels treated with insulin and heparin infusion [^116C2JQv]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridaemia is the third most common cause of acute pancreatitis in the United States. The treatment approach for hypertriglyceridaemia at the time of writing has largely been conservative, including weight loss, exercise, and avoidance of medications that raise triglyceride levels. This approach, however, is not practical in cases of acute pancreatitis due to severely elevated triglycerides. A small number of case reports have been published supporting the treatment of acute pancreatitis due to severely elevated triglyceride levels with insulin and heparin. We report a case of acute pancreatitis in a young woman due to a triglyceride level of 15,215 mg/dl who was successfully treated with insulin and heparin.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114CWiLv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

The aim was to develop clinical practice guidelines on hypertriglyceridemia.

- **Participants**: The Task Force included a chair selected by The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), five additional experts in the field, and a methodologist. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence, email discussion, conference calls, and one in-person meeting. The guidelines were reviewed and approved sequentially by The Endocrine Society's CGS and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

- **Conclusions**: The Task Force recommends that the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia be based on fasting levels, that mild and moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of 150–999 mg/dl) be diagnosed to aid in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, and that severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of > 1000 mg/dl) be considered a risk for pancreatitis. The Task Force also recommends that patients with hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for secondary causes of hyperlipidemia and that subjects with primary hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for family history of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. The Task Force recommends that the treatment goal in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in agreement with National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines.

### Issues in hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis: an update [^1111mKa6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a well-established but underestimated cause of acute pancreatitis. The clinical presentation of HTG-induced pancreatitis is similar to other causes. Pancreatitis secondary to HTG is typically seen in the presence of one or more secondary factors (such as uncontrolled diabetes, alcoholism, medications, or pregnancy) in a patient with an underlying common genetic abnormality of lipoprotein metabolism, such as familial combined hyperlipidemia or familial hypertriglyceridemia. Less commonly, a patient with a rare genetic abnormality, like familial chylomicronemic syndrome, with or without an additional secondary factor, is encountered.

The risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with serum triglycerides > 1000 mg/dL and > 2000 mg/dL is approximately 5% and 10% to 20%, respectively. It is not clear whether HTG pancreatitis is more severe than when it is due to other causes. Clinical management of HTG pancreatitis is similar to that of other causes. Insulin infusion in diabetic patients with HTG can rapidly reduce triglyceride levels. The use of apheresis is still experimental, and better-designed studies are needed to clarify its role in the management of HTG pancreatitis. Diet, lifestyle changes, and control of secondary factors are key to the treatment, with medications as useful adjuncts to the long-term management of triglyceride levels. Control of triglyceride levels to 500 mg/dL or less can effectively prevent recurrences of pancreatitis.

### Triglyceride-lowering therapies in hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis in China: A multicentre prospective cohort study [^111AZiTg]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory process of the pancreas caused by various aetiologies, among which gallstones and alcohol abuse are the leading causes globally. Hypertriglyceridemia has been reported as another common cause, accounting for 5.9% of cases in North America, according to a recent international cohort study. Notably, hypertriglyceridemia is often under-recognised as an aetiology in patients with acute pancreatitis when other etiological risk factors are present. In China, recent studies showed that hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) accounted for 14.3% to 23.9% of AP cases. Rapidly changing lifestyles and genetic variants might explain this phenomenon.

Previous studies indicated that, compared with other causes, patients with HTG-AP are more likely to experience severe disease courses, with an incidence of organ failure as high as more than 40%. However, a recent study using data from an international registry showed that HTG-AP patients had outcomes similar to those with other aetiologies, with 42% of HTG-AP patients experiencing moderately severe/severe AP. The severity of organ failure seems to depend partly on the intensity of the inflammatory response and partly on the injury caused by toxic fatty acids, a lipase-mediated decomposition product of triglycerides. In this regard, efforts have been made to reduce triglyceride levels to prevent or improve organ failure.

The optimal therapeutic target for plasma triglyceride levels is unclear, although previous studies have suggested lowering plasma triglyceride levels as a potential therapeutic strategy.

### Severe hypertriglyceridemia in a subject with disturbed lifestyle and poor glycemic control without recurrence of acute pancreatitis: a case report [^1176oUV4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is often observed as the result of lipid abnormality and is frequently associated with other lipid and metabolic disorders. Aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia is caused by various conditions; however, severe hypertriglyceridemia is usually induced by the addition of some secondary clinical conditions such as uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity with insulin resistance.

- **Case presentation**: A 40-year-old man with a 4-year history of dyslipidemia and T2DM visited after interrupting his therapy for about 1.5 years. He had a past history of acute pancreatitis. His lifestyle was markedly disturbed, and he had many risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia. Surprisingly, his serum triglyceride level was as high as 16,900 mg/dL. The aggravation and remission of his hypertriglyceridemia were closely associated with changes in RLP-cholesterol levels in dyslipidemia and glycoalbumin and ketone body levels in T2DM.

- **Conclusion**: We report very severe hypertriglyceridemia, which seemed to be caused by a markedly disturbed lifestyle and poorly controlled T2DM. Total therapy with diet and drugs for each disease is very important for the improvement of very severe hypertriglyceridemia. This case report suggests that very severe hypertriglyceridemia alone does not necessarily lead to acute pancreatitis, although it is crucial to check pancreatitis markers in such situations.

### Hypertriglyceridemia-associated drug-induced acute pancreatitis [^111h3fqk]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

The aim of our study was to investigate the cases of drug-induced acute pancreatitis (DIAP) with hypertriglyceridemia as the mechanism of injury.

- **Methods**: A MEDLINE search (1963–2018) of the English language literature was performed, looking for all human case reports of adults (> 18 years old) with hypertriglyceridemia as the mechanism of DIAP. The latest search date was February 28, 2018. Drugs were classified into probability groups based on a classification used by Badalov et al. (Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2007;5:648–661).

- **Results**: The search revealed a total of 76 cases in 59 published reports. A total of 25 medications were found to be implicated in DIAP secondary to the hypertriglyceridemia mechanism. Most of the acute pancreatitis cases were mild or moderately severe with favorable outcomes. In 3 cases involving tamoxifen, pagaspargase, and quetiapine, patient death was the outcome. Plasmapheresis was only used in 9 cases in an effort to decrease triglyceride levels.

- **Conclusions**: Hypertriglyceridemia-associated DIAP is a rare phenomenon, and the systematic review provides a summary of drugs that have been implicated in this phenomenon, which allows physicians to be aware of this adverse effect when these drugs are used.

### Efficacy and adverse effects of insulin versus plasmapheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-3-induced acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113T4DiD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

All the studies included in the systematic review and meta-analysis compared the efficacy of insulin ± heparin versus plasma exchange in the reduction of triglyceride levels among patients with hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (AP). From the analysis, there was no statistical difference between insulin ± heparin and plasma exchange in reducing triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-induced AP. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of safety between the two treatment options, indicating non-inferiority in terms of safety profile as well as the reduction in triglyceride levels. More studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings.

- **What is already known**: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a significant medical challenge with a rising incidence and substantial healthcare costs. Hypertriglyceridemia is a leading cause of AP, but optimal treatment strategies remain debatable. Insulin ± heparin therapy and plasmapheresis have been proposed as potential treatments, but limited literature exists on their comparative effectiveness and safety.

- **What the new findings are**: This systematic review and meta-analysis found insulin ± heparin therapy and plasmapheresis to be equally effective in reducing triglyceride levels in AP patients. Considering cost-effectiveness, convenience, and resource availability, insulin ± heparin therapy may be preferred in clinical practice, especially in resource-limited settings for AP.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^116rTgVc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The exact mechanism for how triglyceride variability contributes to the development of acute pancreatitis remains to be elucidated. In this study, subgroup analyses showed a more prominent association between triglyceride variability and the risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Restricted cubic splines showed that the hazard ratio (HR) for acute pancreatitis was linearly associated with both triglyceride variability and NLR on a continuous scale.

We hypothesize that the risk of acute pancreatitis associated with increased triglyceride variability may be partly mediated by subclinical inflammation. NLR is the ratio between neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood, reflecting the balance between inflammation (as indicated by the neutrophil count) and adaptive immunity (as indicated by the lymphocyte count) in the immune system. NLR has been extensively evaluated for its prognostic value in a variety of clinical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and malignancies.

Evidence has shown that NLR is more effective than other inflammatory markers in predicting the severity and prognosis of acute pancreatitis. Our findings complement the results of a large cohort study, in which mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia (177–443 mg/dL or 2–5 mmol/L) was shown to be associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis, with a more pronounced association observed in patients with higher C-reactive protein levels and leukocyte counts.

### Diabetes dyslipidemia [^111BrDGM]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Most hypertriglyceridemia in diabetes is mild to moderate, and statins remain the drug of first choice even in patients with mixed dyslipidemias. However, in patients with genetic susceptibility, severe hypertriglyceridemia may develop, with an attendant risk of pancreatitis. When triglycerides exceed 11 mmol/L, a fibrate should be considered first to reduce triglycerides and the risk of pancreatitis.

Purified omega-3 fatty acids can lower triglycerides as effectively as fibrates; however, they have little effect on HDL or LDL cholesterol. Omacor® (Abbott Healthcare, Abbott Park, IL, USA) contains 90% omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (mostly eicosapentaenoate or docosahexaenoate) and, in combination with a statin, can decrease triglycerides by a further 30%, most probably by inhibiting hepatic triglyceride synthesis. Despite evidence that omega-3 fatty acids stabilize atheromatous plaques and reports of beneficial hypotensive and antithrombotic effects, a recent trial of omega-3 fatty acids in patients with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes found no effect on CHD risk.

Another future therapeutic option may be the dual PPAR-α/γ agonist saroglitazar, which was approved in India in 2013. It has been shown to significantly reduce plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HbA1c, and fasting glucose levels.

### Management of hypertriglyceridaemic pancreatitis in the acute setting and review of literature [^111DK2KE]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a potentially life-threatening complication of severe hypertriglyceridaemia. It ranks as the third most common cause of AP after gallstone disease and alcohol excess. Standard therapy involves the use of lipid-lowering agents, low-molecular-weight heparin, and insulin infusion. In cases where standard medical therapies fail, non-pharmacological methods such as therapeutic plasma exchange, which targets the removal of triglycerides, can yield positive results in the acute phase. Although there are currently no guidelines for management in the acute phase, these approaches should be considered in cases of severe or very severe hypertriglyceridaemia. Here, we report the case of a 37-year-old man with recurrent acute pancreatitis (reAP) due to hypertriglyceridaemia and review the literature.

### Efficacy and adverse effects of insulin versus plasmapheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-3-induced acute pancreatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Vk3ZU]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure is another complication that was investigated in this study and compared between the two treatment groups. From the study analysis, patients from the plasma exchange therapy group had a higher chance of developing acute renal failure compared to patients managed by insulin ± heparin therapy. However, the difference was statistically insignificant and contradictory between the two studies, so a conclusive comparison cannot yet be established.

Taking into consideration cost-effectiveness, convenience of administration, and resource stewardship, insulin ± heparin therapy may be more favorable in the actual clinical context. Easier affordability with insulin ± heparin may further improve treatment rates for self-paying patients, leading to better follow-up rates. Additionally, insulin ± heparin therapy involves a simpler setup than plasmapheresis, which requires costly equipment and greater operating and maintenance costs. Clinical decisions may also be influenced by the healthcare setting and the availability of resources until clearer research on the superiority of a specific therapy is established. Given the limited availability of plasmapheresis in rural areas, insulin ± heparin therapy will invariably be favored over plasmapheresis for the treatment of such patients. To gain a deeper understanding of this illness, more randomized trials are required to establish concrete evidence.

There were numerous findings in this review that pointed in opposite directions. The analytical results did not show any significant difference in favor of either therapy.

### Elevated serum triglyceride levels in acute pancreatitis: A parameter to be measured and considered early [^115UakSf]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

A prospective single-cohort observational study of adult patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (AP) in a third-level referral center was designed to evaluate the role of elevated levels of triglycerides (TG) in AP patients.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients aged 18 years or older with AP were included according to the definitions of Atlanta 2012. The diagnosis of AP required two of the following three features: (1) typical abdominal pain, (2) serum amylase or lipase more than 3 times the normal values, and (3) contrast computed tomography (CT) with radiological findings suggestive of pancreatitis. When CT was not performed, pancreatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal ultrasound (US) with signs of pancreatitis were admitted. Patients underwent the measurement of TG levels in the first 24 hours of admission.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Patients with AP whose etiology was hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) syndrome, patients with another major disease coexisting with AP (such as upper gastrointestinal bleeding that required an invasive endoscopic, radiological, or surgical procedure or that involved duodenal perforation or perforation of the bile duct), patients with another pathology not related to AP (such as periampullary neoplasia or neoplasia of the proximal or middle third of the biliary tract, or serious infectious pathology), transferred patients, and patients who arrived at the emergency department more than 72 hours after the onset of symptoms were excluded.

These inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to reduce the bias of including patients with prolonged disease and to avoid alterations in TG values that can occur after 4 hours.

### Issues in hyperlipidemic pancreatitis [^113Zae37]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a rare cause of pancreatitis. Pancreatitis secondary to HTG typically presents as an episode of acute pancreatitis (AP) or recurrent acute pancreatitis (reAP), and rarely as chronic pancreatitis. A serum triglyceride (TG) level of more than 1,000 to 2,000 mg/dL in patients with type I, IV, or V hyperlipidemia (per Fredrickson's classification) is an identifiable risk factor.

The typical clinical profile of hyperlipidemic pancreatitis (HLP) involves a patient with a preexisting lipid abnormality and the presence of a secondary factor, such as poorly controlled diabetes, alcohol use, or medication, that can induce HTG. Less commonly, patients with isolated hyperlipidemia (type V or I) without a precipitating factor present with pancreatitis. Interestingly, serum pancreatic enzymes may be normal or only minimally elevated, even in the presence of severe pancreatitis diagnosed by imaging studies.

The clinical course in HLP is similar to that of pancreatitis from other causes. Routine management of AP caused by hyperlipidemia should mirror the treatment for other causes. A thorough family history of lipid abnormalities should be obtained, and efforts should be made to identify secondary causes. Reducing TG levels to well below 1,000 mg/dL effectively prevents further episodes of pancreatitis. The mainstay of treatment includes dietary restriction of fat and the use of lipid-lowering medications, primarily fibric acid derivatives. Experiences with plasmapheresis, lipid pheresis, and extracorporeal lipid elimination are limited.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia: Common questions and answers [^111AU7b3]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as fasting serum triglyceride levels of 150 mg per dL or higher, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Severely elevated triglyceride levels (500 mg per dL or higher) increase the risk of pancreatitis.

- **Common risk factors**: Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus are common risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia.

- **Less common risk factors**: Excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, being overweight, use of certain medications, and genetic disorders.

- **Management of high triglyceride levels (150 to 499 mg per dL)**: Management starts with dietary changes and physical activity to lower cardiovascular risk. Lowering carbohydrate intake (especially refined carbohydrates) and increasing fat (especially omega-3 fatty acids) and protein intake can lower triglyceride levels. Moderate- to high-intensity physical activity can also lower triglyceride levels and improve body composition and exercise capacity.

- **Medication considerations**: Calculating a patient's 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease helps to determine the role of medications. Statins can be considered for patients with high triglyceride levels who have borderline (5% to 7.4%) or intermediate (7.5% to 19.9%) risk. For patients at high risk who continue to have high triglyceride levels despite statin use, high-dose icosapent (purified eicosapentaenoic acid) can reduce cardiovascular mortality (number needed to treat = 111 to prevent one cardiovascular death over five years). Fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, or niacin should be considered for patients with severely elevated triglycerides.

### Prevention and management of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis during pregnancy: A systematic review [^115dVw4G]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Severe gestational hypertriglyceridemia can lead to acute pancreatitis, with a maternal mortality rate of approximately 20%. The recent National Lipid Association part 2 expert panel recommendations provide guidance on monitoring pregnant women at high risk for hyperlipidemia. It is suggested that high-risk women have triglyceride levels checked once every trimester. If fasting triglycerides exceed 250 mg/dL, it is recommended to conduct monthly triglyceride level checks and screen for gestational diabetes. Additionally, implementing a strict low-carbohydrate, low-fat diet, along with regular exercise, is advised.

For fasting triglyceride levels greater than 500 mg/dL, despite adherence to strict dietary and lifestyle modifications, treatment with omega-3 fatty acids is recommended while continuing a fat-restricted diet. In cases where triglyceride levels reach 1000 mg/dL or for pregnant women exhibiting clinical signs and symptoms of pancreatitis with triglyceride levels exceeding 500 mg/dL, despite maximal lifestyle changes and pharmacologic therapy, additional medical intervention should be considered.

Take 6 tablets once daily or 3 tablets twice daily with a meal and liquid.

- **Testing prior to initiation of colesevelam hydrochloride tablets**: Obtain lipid parameters, including triglyceride (TG) levels, before starting colesevelam hydrochloride tablets. Colesevelam hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with TG levels > 500 mg/dL [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Recommended dosage in primary hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus**: The recommended dosage of colesevelam hydrochloride tablets for adults and for boys and postmenarchal girls aged 10 to 17 years with primary hyperlipidemia is 3.75 grams daily. The recommended dosage for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus is also 3.75 grams daily. Colesevelam hydrochloride tablets should be taken as follows: take 6 tablets once daily or 3 tablets twice daily. Due to tablet size, colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension is recommended for use in the pediatric population.

- **Important dosing information for primary hyperlipidemia**: Colesevelam hydrochloride tablets can be dosed at the same time as a statin, or the two can be dosed apart. Monitor lipid levels within 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of colesevelam hydrochloride tablets.

- **Administration instructions**: Take colesevelam hydrochloride tablets with a meal and liquid. For patients with difficulty swallowing tablets, use colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension.

### Marked effects of novel selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α modulator, pemafibrate in severe hypertriglyceridemia: Preliminary report [^115z53sh]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia for the prevention of acute pancreatitis is a significant challenge in patients with triglyceride (TG) levels greater than 1,000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L). Episodes of relapsing acute pancreatitis can lead to chronic pancreatitis, as well as both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency in the future. However, no study at the time of writing had verified the efficacy of pemafibrate in these patients.

The PROMINENT trial, currently ongoing worldwide, aims to evaluate the efficacy of pemafibrate in preventing cardiovascular events in high-risk diabetic patients, although the trial excludes patients with TGs greater than 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L). This preliminary report of three patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia is the first evidence that pemafibrate can dramatically reduce very high serum TG levels greater than 1,000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L).

### Conservative management in hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis [^114iYFPt]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia, defined as serum triglyceride levels exceeding 10 mmol L⁻¹, is implicated in approximately 9% of acute pancreatitis cases. Certain guidelines consider severe hypertriglyceridemia an indication for plasmapheresis.

- **Objective**: We assembled the natural trajectory of triglyceride levels in patients with acute pancreatitis due to severe hypertriglyceridemia who were managed conservatively without plasmapheresis to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed on 22 hospital admissions for acute pancreatitis episodes attributed to severe hypertriglyceridemia. Patients received supportive management, including the cessation of oral intake (NPO) and intravenous hydration. Insulin infusion was implemented in 12 patients to manage concomitant hyperglycemia.

- **Results**: Triglyceride levels for the group were evaluated using a mixed-effects model. The average triglyceride level decreased from 45.4 mmol L⁻¹ at presentation to 13.3 mmol L⁻¹ within 48 hours, corresponding to a mean 69.8% decrease. Regression analysis indicated a triglyceride half-life of 30.6 hours. Findings were consistent for both the NPO-only and insulin infusion subgroups.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis can be safely and effectively managed conservatively without the need for plasmapheresis.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^1133hLRt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

In this retrospective multi-institutional cohort study, high triglyceride variability was associated with an increased risk of the first attack of acute pancreatitis, independent of baseline and mean triglyceride levels. The association between triglyceride variability and acute pancreatitis may be partly mediated by subclinical inflammation.

### Lipid-modifying therapies and risk of pancreatitis: A meta-analysis [^115kWmqk]. JAMA (2012). Low credibility.

Statin therapy has been associated with pancreatitis in observational studies. Although lipid guidelines recommend fibrate therapy to reduce pancreatitis risk in persons with hypertriglyceridemia, fibrates may lead to the development of gallstones, a risk factor for pancreatitis.

- **Objective**: To investigate associations between statin or fibrate therapy and incident pancreatitis in large, randomized trials.

- **Data sources**: Relevant trials were identified in literature searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science (January 1, 1994, for statin trials and January 1, 1972, for fibrate trials, through June 9, 2012). Published pancreatitis data were tabulated where available (6 trials), and unpublished data were obtained from investigators (22 trials).

- **Study selection**: We included randomized controlled cardiovascular end-point trials investigating effects of statin therapy or fibrate therapy. Studies with more than 1000 participants, followed up for more than 1 year, were included.

- **Data extraction**: Trial-specific data described numbers of participants developing pancreatitis and changes in triglyceride levels at 1 year. Trial-specific risk ratios (RRs) were calculated and combined using random-effects model meta-analysis. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic.

- **Results**: In 16 placebo- and standard care-controlled statin trials with 113,800 participants conducted over a weighted mean follow-up of 4.1 (SD, 1.5) years, 309 participants developed pancreatitis (134 assigned to statin, 175 assigned to control) (RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.62–0.97; p = 0.03; I2 = 0%]).

### Triglyceride-lowering therapies in hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis in China: A multicentre prospective cohort study [^111b9soB]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, triglyceride-lowering therapies vary greatly among centers in the management of hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP). More rapid triglyceride decline was not associated with improving the incidence and duration of organ failure in HTG-AP patients but may be associated with more intensive care unit (ICU) requirements. In light of our results, pursuing rapid triglyceride decline with aggressive lowering therapies may be ineffective and bear unnecessary risks. However, a confirmatory trial is needed before formal recommendations can be made.

### Continuous insulin therapy versus apheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis [^111BKy5t]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment modality for lowering triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-associated acute pancreatitis is unknown. We evaluated the efficacy of continuous insulin infusion and apheresis procedures as triglyceride-lowering therapy.

- **Materials and methods**: Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data were retrospectively evaluated for patients with HTG-associated pancreatitis who received continuous insulin infusion or apheresis in a single tertiary center. The endpoints were modality effectiveness and clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: The study included 48 patients (mean age, 40.4 ± 9.9 years). Apheresis and insulin infusion were performed in 19 and 29 patients, respectively, within the first 24 hours of hospital admission. Apheresis procedures included therapeutic plasma exchange in 10 patients and double filtration plasmapheresis in nine patients. Baseline mean triglyceride level was higher in the apheresis group. The two groups were similar in terms of other baseline clinical and demographic characteristics. Seventeen patients (58.6%) in the insulin group and nine patients (47.4%) in the apheresis group exhibited Balthazar grades D-E. There was a rapid reduction (78.5%) in triglyceride level after the first session of apheresis. Insulin infusion resulted in a 44.4% reduction in mean triglyceride level in the first 24 hours. The durations of fasting and hospital stay, and the rates of respiratory failure and hypotension, were similar between groups. More patients in the apheresis group experienced acute renal failure or altered mental status.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^112BaquM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as serum triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), is a common clinical problem, with a prevalence of 25%–30% in the adult population in developed countries. Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with an increased risk of both cardiovascular disease and acute pancreatitis. The pathogenetic link between hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is thought to be triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, which are converted to remnant particles and contribute to the development of atherosclerotic plaques. However, the mechanism behind hypertriglyceridemia-related acute pancreatitis is less clear. A widely accepted theory involves the hydrolysis of triglycerides by pancreatic lipase and excessive formation of toxic free fatty acids, resulting in acinar cell and pancreatic capillary injury. Another hypothesis is chylomicronemia-induced hyperviscosity in pancreatic capillaries, leading to subsequent ischemia, tissue necrosis, and inflammation in the pancreas.

The risk of acute pancreatitis has been shown to increase progressively with serum triglycerides > 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L). Cohort studies have estimated that only 5% of patients with serum triglycerides > 1,000 and 10%–20% of patients with serum triglycerides > 2,000 mg/dL develop acute pancreatitis, suggesting that the risk of developing pancreatitis is not uniform in its relationship with hypertriglyceridemia. The severity and complication rates of hypertriglyceridemia-related acute pancreatitis are generally higher than for other types of acute pancreatitis.

### Effect of serum triglycerides on clinical outcomes in acute pancreatitis: Findings from a regional integrated health care system [^1128frL1]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of serum triglycerides on the development of multiple or persistent organ failure in patients with acute pancreatitis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients hospitalized for acute pancreatitis between 2006 and 2013. Triglyceride levels measured before and within 72 hours of admission were compared. In addition, the effect of triglyceride levels on the development of multiple or persistent organ failure during hospitalization for acute pancreatitis was assessed.

- **Results**: Among 2519 patients, 267 patients (10.6%) developed organ failure, of which 75 patients developed multiple system organ failure and 82 patients developed persistent organ failure. Triglyceride levels in patients who developed organ failure were initially much higher than in patients who did not develop organ failure, but by 72 hours into admission, they approached levels of patients who did not develop organ failure. Approximately 8% of patients had triglyceride levels greater than 500 mg/dL, the majority of whom had similarly high levels before admission.

- **Conclusions**: Increased triglyceride levels were associated with the development of multiple or persistent organ failure among patients hospitalized with acute pancreatitis. Patients with high triglyceride levels at the time of admission were likely to have high triglyceride levels before admission.

### Hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis: Perspectives from China [^111ZMJC5]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

HTG-AP exhibits a high recurrence rate, with up to 64.8% of patients experiencing relapse within one year, driven by persistently elevated triglyceride levels at discharge and during follow-up. Multivariable analysis identifies poor triglyceride control, a high comorbidity index (e.g. diabetes and hypertension), and inadequate follow-up care as independent risk factors, emphasizing the need for sustained lipid-lowering therapy and lifestyle modifications. Recurrent pancreatitis also heightens the risk of postacute pancreatitis diabetes mellitus (PAPDM), with affected patients showing a significantly elevated incidence due to repeated pancreatic injury.

Yang et al. reported that triglyceride levels exceeding 3.1 mmol/L one month post-discharge predict recurrence with an odds ratio of 10.3, surpassing US recurrence rates of 32%, where alcohol-related factors often dominate. China's emphasis on metabolic management – integrating lipid-lowering agents like statins or fibrates with glycemic control via insulin or oral hypoglycemics – offers a distinct long-term approach, potentially more suited to its HTG-AP population than Western alcohol-centric models that prioritize abstinence and counseling.

### Severe hypertriglyceridemia-related pancreatitis: Characteristics and predictors of recurrence [^112kJz7X]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) as a cause for acute pancreatitis is often delayed, with limited data on the characteristics and predictors of recurrence in this population.

- **Methods**: A regional database of severe HTG levels of 1000 mg/dL or greater was analyzed to identify subjects with acute pancreatitis. Factors associated with recurrence during long-term follow-up were investigated.

- **Results**: Severe HTG-associated pancreatitis was evident in 171 patients, of whom 75% were diabetics. Recurrence was observed in 16% and was associated with younger age, alcohol abuse, and an increase in triglyceride levels. In multivariable analysis, peak triglyceride levels of greater than 3000 mg/dL (hazard ratio, 2.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–6.64; P = 0.011) and most recent triglyceride levels of greater than 500 mg/dL (hazard ratio, 3.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.60–8.66; P = 0.002) remained independently associated with recurrence. These lipid measures, as well as alcohol abuse, were additionally correlated with a stepwise increase in the number of pancreatitis episodes.

- **Conclusions**: Severe HTG-related pancreatitis was closely associated with diabetes. Extreme HTG and a lack of attainment of lower triglyceride levels were independent long-term predictors of recurrence. These findings emphasize the importance of early identification and successful treatment of severe HTG and its underlying disorders to reduce the burden of recurrence.

### Role of mean platelet volume in hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis during pregnancy [^113QT9Fo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis during pregnancy (APP) is a rare but life-threatening disease with an estimated incidence of approximately 3–10 per 10,000. AP can result in multiple organ dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation due to the activation of the inflammatory and coagulation systems. Additionally, pregnancy-related physiologic alterations influence the diagnosis and management of many diseases. Thus, APP can severely affect the mother and fetus, increasing the risk of intrauterine fetal death.

The most common cause of APP is gallstones, followed by alcohol abuse, hypertriglyceridemia, and unidentified causes. Non-gallstone pancreatitis is considered more likely to result in complications and a poorer prognosis, such as hypertriglyceridemia-induced AP (HTG-AP).

Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a blood parameter used for measuring platelet size and is widely recognized as an indicator of thrombocytic activity. Moreover, MPV has been studied in various thrombotic and inflammatory diseases.

At the time of writing, there have been few studies reporting the association between MPV and AP, and the results have been inconsistent. Furthermore, fewer reports have focused on the relationship between MPV and HTG-AP during pregnancy (HTG-APP), and the role of MPV remains unclear in this population. Therefore, we designed the study to assess the role of MPV and the potential relationship with disease severity in HTG-APP.

### Hypertriglyceridaemia-induced pancreatitis [^114bB8XB]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridaemia is the third most common cause of acute pancreatitis but is relatively rare and therefore requires a high level of clinical suspicion to be diagnosed. We discuss the case of a 46-year-old man who initially presented to the accident and emergency department with suspected first presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and a normal amylase but who did not respond to DKA treatment. Further history revealed significant cardiovascular risk factors. Examination showed evidence of hyperlipidaemia, and investigations revealed acute pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridaemia. We discuss the causes of hypertriglyceridaemia, the difficulty in differentiating primary versus secondary hypertriglyceridaemia, possible pathogenesis, and evidence-based treatments.

### Not every patient needs a triglyceride check, but all can get pancreatitis: A systematic review and clinical characterization of isotretinoin-associated pancreatitis [^115zWe2M]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). High credibility.

Monitoring triglycerides for patients on isotretinoin is primarily practiced to avoid hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to clinically describe the published cases of hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis. A comprehensive search strategy using MEDLINE, Embase, and grey literature was conducted (1960 to January 2016) to identify all case reports of isotretinoin-associated pancreatitis and all relevant studies of isotretinoin and triglycerides for any indication (≥ 20 patients). Terms related to isotretinoin, triglycerides, and pancreatitis were searched with all available synonyms.

Studies using isotretinoin and mentioning triglycerides or pancreatitis were searched in full text, where available, for cases of pancreatitis. Studies from all countries and published in any language were included, but Korean and Turkish studies could not be analyzed. Two authors independently reviewed the publications to determine eligibility and for data extraction. In total, 125 papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were searched for cases of pancreatitis. Eleven papers with 25 cases of pancreatitis associated with isotretinoin were identified; four of these cases were likely due to hypertriglyceridemia. Three patients had elevated baseline triglycerides but no monitoring. Pancreatitis occurred 6 and 7 weeks, and 6 months after the initiation of therapy. For the fourth patient, who was treated for glioblastoma and died, no detailed clinical information was available. Idiosyncratic pancreatitis associated with isotretinoin is the most frequent.

### Effect of colesevelam on liver fat quantified by magnetic resonance in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: a randomized controlled trial [^115Ckbkp]. Hepatology (2012). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterized by features of steatosis, hepatocellular injury, and parenchymal inflammation with or without perisinusoidal fibrosis on liver histology in individuals who consume little or no alcohol. A subset of patients with NASH may progress to develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for NASH.

Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant (BAS), interrupts the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and causes increased conversion of hepatic cholesterol to bile acids. It increases plasma glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels, which activates pancreatic β-cells to release insulin. One possible mechanism by which colesevelam increases GLP-1 is by moving the site of fat absorption to the ileum, where fat absorption by L cells causes GLP-1 release. This might explain the mechanism of action of colesevelam responsible for improving glucose homeostasis.

Furthermore, randomized controlled clinical trials have shown the efficacy of colesevelam in lowering plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels and improving glycemic control. Both increased plasma LDL cholesterol and insulin resistance are associated with NASH. Therefore, it is plausible that improvement in LDL cholesterol and glycemic control by colesevelam might improve NASH. We hypothesized that colesevelam would reduce hepatic fat content in patients with NASH by increased utilization of hepatic cholesterol.

### Colesevelam hydrochloride [^115o9zo2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: In primary hyperlipidemia, colesevelam hydrochloride, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in colesevelam hydrochloride, is a non-absorbed, lipid-lowering polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine, impeding their reabsorption. As the bile acid pool becomes depleted, the hepatic enzyme cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase is upregulated, which increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells, resulting in the dual effect of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, and increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors. These compensatory effects result in increased clearance of LDL-C from the blood, leading to decreased serum LDL-C levels. Serum TG levels may increase or remain unchanged. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, the mechanism by which colesevelam hydrochloride improves glycemic control is unknown.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: A maximum therapeutic response to the lipid-lowering effects of colesevelam hydrochloride was achieved within 2 weeks and was maintained during long-term therapy. In the diabetes clinical studies, a therapeutic response to colesevelam hydrochloride, as reflected by a reduction in HbA1c, was initially noted following 4–6 weeks of treatment and reached maximal or near-maximal effect after 12–18 weeks of treatment.
