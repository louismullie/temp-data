## Question

Prevention of third degree laceration in delivery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to prevent third-degree perineal lacerations during vaginal delivery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and its epidemiology to anchor risk. Then, I should verify the strongest modifiable risk factors. Next, I will examine antenatal prevention strategies, followed by intrapartum techniques and operative delivery considerations. After that, I need to review episiotomy strategy and its nuances. I will then consider system-level quality improvement bundles, and finally synthesize a practical, prioritized prevention framework with attention to evidence certainty and implementation details.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and baseline risk so I don't jump to conclusions. Third-degree perineal lacerations are obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) involving the external and/or internal anal sphincter, with fourth-degree tears extending to rectal mucosa; contemporary U.S. data suggest an overall OASIS incidence near 4.9% with higher rates in primiparous women, and large population studies show third-degree tears around 3.3% and fourth-degree around 1.1% of vaginal deliveries, underscoring the need for targeted prevention efforts [^114MJVne] [^117WBvbF].

> Hold on, let's not conflate correlation with causation; I need to check which risk factors are most robust and modifiable. Operative vaginal delivery, especially forceps, confers the highest risk, with forceps-associated OASIS rates up to roughly one-third in some series and adjusted odds around 1.8-fold versus vacuum in comparative cohorts; macrosomia and occiput posterior position also independently increase risk, and prolonged second stage beyond two hours further elevates odds; episiotomy interacts with mode and risk, with midline episiotomy increasing OASIS risk while mediolateral episiotomy may be protective in assisted deliveries; prior OASIS increases recurrence risk approximately 4–10 fold depending on cohort and severity, which should shape counseling and planning [^115B4usK] [^113JEBY9] [^1128faZ9] [^116oNbcm] [^112xY8Pr].

> Next, I should review antenatal strategies, but wait, let me verify what actually helps. Antenatal perineal massage from 34–35 weeks reduces third- and fourth-degree tears in primiparous women, with a pooled risk reduction around 50% in Cochrane analyses; pelvic floor muscle training improves tone but does not reliably reduce laceration rates, so I should not overstate its preventive value for OASIS; conversely, routine episiotomy increases severe lacerations and should be avoided in spontaneous deliveries, reinforcing a restrictive-use policy as standard [^117WRptc] [^115777pz].

> I will now examine intrapartum perineal techniques, and I need to ensure I weigh heterogeneous evidence. Warm compresses during the second stage likely reduce third- and fourth-degree tears by about 50% and also reduce perineal pain, making them a low-risk, high-acceptability intervention; perineal massage during second stage may reduce severe tears but evidence is less consistent; hands-off or poised techniques reduce episiotomy without clear benefit for OASIS prevention, so I should frame them as episiotomy-sparing rather than OASI-preventive; controlled delivery with manual perineal support and guidance of the fetal head is supported by RCOG-aligned practices and may reduce major OASIS, though much of the evidence is observational and bundle-based [^1112nuu3] [^1124Tqiw] [^112avV85] [^1143i6LM] [^1158e1E7] [^115iNPxA].

> But wait, what if the delivery requires instruments; I should double-check the comparative risks. Forceps increase severe lacerations compared with vacuum, so when feasible, vacuum is preferred to mitigate OASIS risk; when operative delivery is indicated, a mediolateral episiotomy at approximately 60 degrees at crowning reduces OASIS risk and is endorsed in quality bundles; conversely, midline episiotomy should be avoided given its association with higher rates of third- and fourth-degree tears; if malposition is present, prophylactic manual rotation does not clearly reduce operative delivery or OASIS, so I should not rely on it solely for OASI prevention [^113JEBY9] [^111gNJaq] [^113piGyG] [^1164XidR].

> Let me consider system-level interventions, because individual maneuvers may underperform without context. Implementation of the four-element OASI Care Bundle — antenatal information, manual perineal protection, selective mediolateral episiotomy at 60 degrees when indicated, and systematic perineal examination including rectal assessment — has been associated with meaningful reductions in major OASIS in multiple settings; training in recognition and repair, standardized classification, and simulation-based education improve diagnostic accuracy and outcomes; restrictive episiotomy policies over decades have halved both episiotomy and OASIS rates without harming neonatal outcomes, supporting a population-level strategy [^113piGyG] [^112Pikj5] [^112ZideD] [^115777pz] [^111Ceg1q].

> I should confirm the role of antibiotics in this preventive pathway, and I need to be precise. Prophylactic second-generation cephalosporin at the time of repair reduces wound complications such as breakdown and infection by about two-thirds in a small RCT, but this addresses post-repair morbidity rather than primary prevention of OASIS; moreover, a larger cohort using cefazolin did not show benefit, suggesting agent selection matters and that antibiotics are adjuncts, not substitutes for mechanical prevention and meticulous repair technique [^112y3WhC] [^115B4usK] [^11512QdD].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized approach, and I should double-check that each element aligns with evidence strength. For spontaneous deliveries, prioritize antenatal perineal massage, warm compresses, manual perineal protection with controlled delivery, and avoidance of routine episiotomy; for assisted deliveries, prefer vacuum over forceps when appropriate and use selective mediolateral episiotomy at 60 degrees at crowning; across settings, embed the OASI Care Bundle, ensure rectal examination after all vaginal births, and provide simulation-based training to standardize recognition and repair; counsel patients with prior OASIS on recurrence risk and consider mode-of-delivery planning in high-risk combinations such as macrosomia with forceps or OP position [^1112nuu3] [^113piGyG] [^111gNJaq] [^112xY8Pr].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidentiary caveats so we don't overpromise. Much of the perineal technique literature has risk of bias and heterogeneity, especially for hands-on versus hands-off comparisons, and some newer trials are underpowered for OASIS endpoints; therefore, I should emphasize that warm compresses and restrictive, bundle-based care have the most consistent signals, while maintaining humility about effect sizes and local implementation factors [^1112nuu3] [^112avV85] [^1143i6LM].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses downstream care because prevention includes minimizing sequelae when tears occur. Immediate recognition with systematic rectal exam, repair in the operating room with adequate lighting and regional or general anesthesia, consideration of prophylactic second-generation cephalosporin, and structured follow-up for pain, infection, and pelvic floor symptoms are essential to close the loop on prevention and mitigation of OASIS-related morbidity [^114iTXy1] [^112y3WhC] [^114jaLAh].

---

Third-degree perineal lacerations can be reduced by **restrictive episiotomy** (avoiding midline, using mediolateral only when indicated) [^1115AYCP] [^115777pz] and **manual perineal protection** (hands-on/poised) during delivery [^114jaLAh] [^1158e1E7]. Additional benefit comes from **warm compresses** during the second stage [^1112nuu3] [^111v1V4P] and **slow, controlled delivery** of the fetal head [^1158e1E7]. Risk increases with forceps, macrosomia, and prolonged second stage; **individualized management** and **skilled attendance** are essential [^114MJVne] [^117WBvbF].

---

## Risk factors for third-degree perineal lacerations

Several maternal, fetal, and obstetric factors **increase the risk** of third-degree lacerations:

- **Maternal factors**: Nulliparity, Asian ethnicity, short perineal body length (< 2.5 cm), and advanced maternal age [^114MJVne] [^114FPjcY] [^114ZCDbp].

- **Fetal factors**: Macrosomia (birth weight > 4,000 g), persistent occiput posterior position, and large head circumference [^114T2Ej8] [^116oNbcm].

- **Obstetric factors**: Operative vaginal delivery (forceps or vacuum), midline episiotomy, prolonged second stage of labor (> 2 hours), and shoulder dystocia [^114MJVne] [^117WBvbF].

---

## Evidence-based preventive strategies

### Antenatal interventions

Antenatal perineal massage starting at 34–35 weeks' gestation reduces third- and fourth-degree lacerations, especially in primiparous women [^111SduJy] [^1112nuu3]. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) does not reduce laceration risk and is not recommended for this purpose [^117WRptc].

---

### Intrapartum interventions

- **Restrictive episiotomy**: Avoid routine episiotomy; when indicated, use mediolateral episiotomy at a 60° angle to reduce OASIS risk [^1115AYCP] [^115777pz].

- **Manual perineal protection**: Hands-on or hands-poised techniques during delivery reduce severe perineal trauma [^114jaLAh] [^1158e1E7].

- **Warm compresses**: Applied during the second stage, they reduce third- and fourth-degree lacerations and perineal pain [^1112nuu3] [^111v1V4P].

- **Controlled delivery of the fetal head**: Slow, controlled delivery with perineal support reduces severe lacerations [^114jaLAh] [^1158e1E7].

---

### Management of modifiable risk factors

Avoid **routine episiotomy**; use selective mediolateral episiotomy only when indicated [^111gNJaq] [^115777pz]. Minimize **operative vaginal delivery** by using forceps or vacuum only when necessary, and prefer vacuum over forceps when feasible [^113JEBY9]. Manage **prolonged second stage** with active maternal pushing, upright positions, and timely intervention to prevent severe perineal trauma [^115QKvup] [^116oNbcm].

---

## Role of healthcare provider training and experience

Training and experience significantly affect **OASI rates**. Skilled attendance and standardized techniques reduce severe perineal trauma [^114jaLAh]. The **OASI Care Bundle** — manual perineal protection, selective mediolateral episiotomy, and systematic perineal examination — reduces OASI incidence [^113piGyG] [^112Pikj5].

---

## Summary of evidence-based preventive strategies

| **Intervention** | **Evidence level** | **Effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Antenatal perineal massage | High | Reduces third- and fourth-degree lacerations |
| Restrictive episiotomy | High | Reduces severe perineal trauma |
| Manual perineal protection | Moderate | Reduces severe perineal trauma |
| Warm compresses | Moderate | Reduces third- and fourth-degree lacerations |
| Controlled delivery of fetal head | Moderate | Reduces severe perineal trauma |
| Pelvic floor muscle training | High | No effect on laceration prevention |

---

Preventing third-degree perineal lacerations requires a **multifaceted approach**, including antenatal perineal massage, restrictive episiotomy, manual perineal protection, warm compresses, and controlled delivery of the fetal head. Addressing modifiable risk factors and ensuring skilled attendance further reduce risk.

### Obstetric lacerations: prevention and repair [^114jaLAh]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Obstetric lacerations are a common complication of vaginal delivery. Lacerations can lead to chronic pain and urinary and fecal incontinence. Perineal lacerations are defined by the depth of musculature involved, with fourth-degree lacerations disrupting the anal sphincter and the underlying rectal mucosa and first-degree lacerations having no perineal muscle involvement. Late third-trimester perineal massage can reduce lacerations in primiparous women; perineal support and massage and warm compresses during the second stage of labor can reduce anal sphincter injury. Conservative care of minor hemostatic first- and second-degree lacerations without anatomic distortion reduces pain, analgesia use, and dyspareunia. Minor hemostatic lesions with anatomic disruption can be repaired with surgical glue. Second-degree lacerations are best repaired with a single continuous suture. Lacerations involving the anal sphincter complex require additional expertise, exposure, and lighting; transfer to an operating room should be considered. Limited evidence suggests similar results from overlapping and end-to-end external sphincter repairs. Postdelivery care should focus on controlling pain, preventing constipation, and monitoring for urinary retention. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be administered as needed. Opiates should be avoided to decrease risk of constipation; need for opiates suggests infection or problem with the repair. Osmotic laxative use leads to earlier bowel movements and less pain during the first bowel movement. Simulation models are recommended for surgical technique instruction and maintenance, especially for third- and fourth-degree repairs.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for third-and fourth-degree perineal tear during vaginal birth [^115B4usK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

One to eight per cent of women suffer third-degree perineal tear (anal sphincter injury) and fourth-degree perineal tear (rectal mucosa injury) during vaginal birth, and these tears are more common after forceps delivery (28%) and midline episiotomies. Third- and fourth-degree tears can become contaminated with bacteria from the rectum and this significantly increases in the chance of perineal wound infection. Prophylactic antibiotics might have a role in preventing this infection.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for reducing maternal morbidity and side effects in third- and fourth-degree perineal tear during vaginal birth.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2010) and the reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing outcomes of prophylactic antibiotics versus placebo or no antibiotics in third- and fourth-degree perineal tear during vaginal birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the reports and extracted data.

Main Results

We identified and included one trial (147 participants) that compared the effect of prophylactic antibiotic (single-dose, second generation cephalosporin, intravenously) on postpartum perineal wound complications in third- or fourth-degree perineal tears. Perineal wound complications (wound disruption and purulent discharge) at the two-week postpartum check up were 8.20% and 24.10% in the treatment and the control groups respectively (risk ratio 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.96).

Authors' Conclusions

Although the data suggest that prophylactic antibiotics help to prevent perineal wound complications following third- or fourth-degree perineal tear, loss to follow-up was very high. The results should be interpreted with caution as they are based on one small trial.

### Is it possible to predict or prevent third degree tears? [^112SsF5K]. Colorectal Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

This paper reviews the causes anal sphincter injury during vaginal delivery. It emphasises that they are not usually the result of poor obstetric care. The role of the colorectal surgeon in their management is discussed.

Methods

Medline was searched using the key words third degree tears, pregnancy, risk factors, prevention and recurrence risk. A hand search of journals and located articles was made. Two hundred and twenty three papers were identified, 84 are referenced.

Results

The reported incidence of anal sphincter tears is usually between 0.5% and 2.5% of vaginal deliveries. Maternal factors such as parity and age and obstetric factors such as mode of presentation, the use of forceps and the size of the baby all influence the incidence of sphincter tears. Predicting tears in individual women is inaccurate and midwifery practices can do little to prevent them. Reducing pelvic floor morbidity by increasing the caesarean section rate would require that a large number of caesarean sections be done to prevent a small number of tears. The recognition of perineal trauma is improved by training. Accurate apposition of the sphincters with antibiotic cover and post-operative laxatives are the important technical aspects of the repair. Colorectal follow up helps to identify those women with symptoms and allows advice about the advisability of subsequent vaginal deliveries. A previous third degree tears increases the risk of a subsequent one, although the overall risk remains low. A second vaginal delivery after a third degree tear that has resulted in a functional deficit predisposes to worsening function. When there is no residual anatomical defect and no functional loss, there is no evidence of increased risk of incontinence following another vaginal delivery.

Conclusion

Vaginal delivery will continue to be the main method of delivery and will continue to generate a low incidence of pelvic floor morbidity. The management of injury to the anal sphincter is facilitated by close co-operation between obstetricians and colorectal surgeons.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for fourth-degree perineal tear during vaginal birth [^115zXXZU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

One to eight per cent of women suffer third-degree perineal tears (anal sphincter injury) and fourth-degree perineal tear (rectal mucosa injury) during vaginal birth, and these tears are more common after forceps delivery (28%) and midline episiotomies. Fourth-degree tears can become contaminated with bacteria from the rectum and this significantly increases in the chance of perineal wound infection. Prophylactic antibiotics might have a role in preventing this infection.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for reducing maternal morbidity and side-effects in fourth-degree perineal tear during vaginal birth.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (30 July 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 15 July 2005), and LILACS (1982 to 15 July 2005).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials which reported data comparing outcomes of prophylactic antibiotics versus placebo or no antibiotics in fourth-degree perineal tear during vaginal birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

No trials were found that met the selection criteria.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials were identified.

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient data to support a policy of routine prophylactic antibiotics in fourth-degree perineal tear during vaginal birth. A well-designed randomised controlled trial is needed.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of postpartum perineal wound complications: a randomized controlled trial [^112y3WhC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate whether prophylactic antibiotics at the time of repair of third- or fourth-degree perineal tears after vaginal delivery prevent wound infection and breakdown.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients who sustained third- or fourth-degree perineal tears after a vaginal delivery were recruited for the study. Each patient was given a single intravenous dose of a second-generation cephalosporin (cefotetan or cefoxitin) or placebo before repair of third- or fourth-degree perineal tears. Obstetricians and patients were blinded to study drug. The perineum was inspected for evidence of infection or breakdown at discharge from the hospital and at 2 weeks postpartum. Primary end points were gross disruption or purulent discharge at site of perineal repair by 2 weeks postpartum.

Results

One hundred forty-seven patients were recruited for the study. Of these, 83 patients received placebo and 64 patients received antibiotics. Forty patients (27.2%) did not return for their 2-week appointment. Of the patients seen at 2 weeks postpartum, 4 of 49 (8.2%) patients who received antibiotics and 14 of 58 (24.1%) patients who received placebo developed a perineal wound complication (P = 0.037). There were no differences between groups in parity, incidence of diabetes, operative delivery, or third-degree compared with fourth-degree lacerations.

Conclusion

By 2 weeks postpartum, patients who received prophylactic antibiotics at the time of third- or fourth-degree laceration repair had a lower rate of perineal wound complications than patients who received placebo.

### Evaluation of third-degree and fourth-degree laceration rates as quality indicators [^117WBvbF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the patterns and predictors of third-degree and fourth-degree laceration in women undergoing vaginal delivery.

Methods

We identified a population-based cohort of women in the United States who underwent a vaginal delivery between 1998 and 2010 using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Multivariable log-linear regression models were developed to account for patient, obstetric, and hospital factors related to lacerations. Between-hospital variability of laceration rates was calculated using generalized log-linear mixed models.

Results

Among 7,096,056 women who underwent vaginal delivery in 3,070 hospitals, 3.3% (n = 232,762) had a third-degree laceration and 1.1% (n = 76,347) had a fourth-degree laceration. In an adjusted model for fourth-degree lacerations, important risk factors included shoulder dystocia and forceps and vacuum deliveries with and without episiotomy. Other demographic, obstetric, medical, and hospital variables, although statistically significant, were not major determinants of lacerations. Risk factors in a multivariable model for third-degree lacerations were similar to those in the fourth-degree model. Regression analysis of hospital rates (n = 3,070) of lacerations demonstrated limited between-hospital variation.

Conclusion

Risk of third-degree and fourth-degree laceration was most strongly related to operative delivery and shoulder dystocia. Between-hospital variation was limited. Given these findings and that the most modifiable practice related to lacerations would be reduction in operative vaginal deliveries (and a possible increase in cesarean delivery), third-degree and fourth-degree laceration rates may be a quality metric of limited utility.

### Selective vs routine midline episiotomy for the prevention of third-or fourth-degree lacerations in nulliparous women [^1115AYCP]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether selective midline episiotomy contributes to the prevention of third- or fourth-degree perineal lacerations.

Study Design

A randomized controlled clinical trial was performed with 446 nulliparous women with deliveries after 28 weeks of pregnancy. Patients were randomized to undergo either routine episiotomy or selective episiotomy. In the selective episiotomy group, episiotomies were performed only in cases of imminent lacerations, fetal distress, or forceps delivery.

Results

In the group of 223 patients who underwent routine episiotomy, 32 (14.3%) had third- or fourth-degree perineal lacerations, as compared to 15 (6.8%) in the group of 222 patients undergoing selective episiotomy (relative risk, 2.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.18–3.81). Only reduction in third-degree lacerations was significant when analyzed separately. Moreover, periurethral, labia minora, and superficial vaginal lacerations were significantly more frequent in the selective episiotomy group.

Conclusion

The policy of performing selective midline episiotomy in nulliparous patients results in a reduction in the risk of third-degree perineal lacerations.

### Risk factors for birth canal lacerations in primiparous women [^1126QLrq]. American Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Lacerations of the birth canal are common side effects of vaginal birth. They are potentially preventable. Although serious long-term consequences have been identified for severe perineal lacerations, less attention has been paid to lacerations in other locations and how the risk factors vary for different lacerations. We analyzed a dataset including 1009 primiparous women with singleton pregnancies and vaginal deliveries, and we examined risk factors for third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations and periurethral, vaginal, and labial lacerations using logistic regression analysis. Large fetal size (≥ 3500 g) substantially increased the risk of perineal (odd ratio [OR], 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 7.9) and periurethral (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.0 to 5.0) lacerations but not other types of lacerations. Episiotomy had no impact on perineal lacerations (OR 0.9) but had very strong protective effects for other lacerations (OR 0.1). Prolonged second stage of labor (> 120 minutes) increased the risk of perineal and vaginal lacerations but reduced the risk for periurethral lacerations. Instrumental deliveries were significant risk factors for third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations, with by far the strongest effect for low forceps (OR 25.0 versus < 3 for outlet forceps, outlet vacuum, and low vacuum). We concluded that separating different birth canal lacerations is critical in identifying risk factors and potential preventive strategies.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 198: prevention and management of obstetric lacerations at vaginal delivery [^114MJVne]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on obstetric perineal trauma:

- **Definition**: Obstetric anal sphincter injuries are perineal lacerations that occur during vaginal delivery and involve damage to the anal sphincter complex, referred to as third- and fourth-degree perineal tears.
- **Pathophysiology**: Fetal descent and delivery exert significant pressure on the perineum and anal sphincter. During delivery, the advancing fetal head stretches the perineum and applies direct tensile and shear forces to the anal sphincter complex. These mechanical forces can exceed the tensile strength of the sphincter fibers, leading to partial or complete disruption. In some cases, the rectal mucosa may also be torn if the force is transmitted through the sphincter. Additionally, the use of instruments such as forceps or vacuum amplifies these forces, increasing the risk of sphincter damage by exerting localized pressure and traction during delivery.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of obstetric anal sphincter injuries is estimated at 4.9%, with a higher rate in primiparous women at 6% compared to 2% in multiparous women. Other reports suggest a significantly higher incidence, including occult injuries, ranging from 11.5% to 35.0% after first vaginal deliveries and 3.4% to 12.1% with subsequent deliveries.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for obstetric perineal lacerations include maternal factors such as nulliparity, Asian ethnicity, and prolonged (> 2 hours) second stage of labor, fetal factors such as high birth weight, shoulder dystocia, and persistent occiput posterior presentation, as well as procedural factors such as induction of labor, epidural anesthesia, operative vaginal delivery, and episiotomy.
- **Disease course**: In most cases, perineal lacerations are clearly identified during vaginal delivery; however, some tears may be missed at the time of delivery and detected later in the postpartum period. Patients with postpartum tears typically present with symptoms such as perineal pain, bleeding, discharge, and/or fecal incontinence.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Potential complications of unrepaired or improperly repaired third- and fourth-degree obstetric perineal tears include wound infection, wound dehiscence, perineal and rectovaginal fistulas, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The risk of recurrent injury in subsequent pregnancies is 5.6% with a second vaginal delivery and 9.5% with a third vaginal delivery.

### Hands-on vs hands-off technique for the prevention of perineal injury: a randomized clinical trial [^115h7g9a]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Perineal trauma after vaginal delivery is common and is associated with severe morbidity, including incontinence, pelvic pain, and sexual dysfunction. Morbidity is mainly related to third- or fourthdegree lacerations.

Objective

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that in nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies at term, hands-off technique during spontaneous vaginal delivery could reduce the rate of perineal laceration.

Study Design

This was a parallel-group, nonblinded, randomized clinical trial. Nulliparous women in spontaneous labor with singleton pregnancies and vertex presentation admitted to the labor and delivery room between 37 0/7 and 42 0/7 weeks of gestation were eligible, and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive hands-off technique (intervention group) or hands-on technique during pushing in the second stage of labor. The primary outcome was perineal laceration (any degree). The effect of hands-off technique on each outcome was quantified as relative risk with 95% confidence interval.

Results

A total of 70 women were enrolled in the trial. Perineal lacerations (any degree) occurred in 15 of 35 (42.9%) women in the intervention group and 33 of 35 (94.3%) women in the control group (relative risk, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.31–0.67). Hands-off technique was also associated with significantly decreased incidence of episiotomy (relative risk, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.14–0.88), first-degree lacerations (relative risk, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.20–0.87), and second-degree lacerations (relative risk, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.19–0.99). There was no significant between-group difference in third- and fourth-degree lacerations, but the trial was not powered for these outcomes.

Conclusion

In nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies at term, hands-off technique reduces the rate of perineal lacerations.

### Third-and fourth-degree perineal lacerations: defining high-risk clinical clusters [^11551uwG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Statistical methods that measure the independent contribution of individual factors for third-/fourth-degree perineal laceration (TFPL) fall short when the clinician is faced with a combination of factors. Our objective was to demonstrate how a statistical technique, classification and regression trees (CART), can identify high-risk clinical clusters.

Study Design

We performed multivariable logistic regression, and CART analysis on data from 25,150 term vaginal births.

Results

Multivariable analyses found strong associations with the use of episiotomy, forceps, vacuum, nulliparity, and birthweight. CART ranked episiotomy, operative delivery, and birthweight as the more discriminating factors and defined distinct risk groups with TFPL rates that ranged from 0–100%. For example, without episiotomy, the rate of TFPL was 2.2%. In the presence of an episiotomy, forceps, and birthweight of > 3634 g, the rate of TFPL was 68.9%.

Conclusion

CART showed that certain combinations held low risk, where as other combinations carried extreme risk, which clarified how choices on delivery options can markedly affect the rate of TFPL for specific mothers.

### Evidence-based labor management: third stage of labor (part 5) [^111PDhZP]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

During the third stage of labor, oxytocin and tranexamic acid, oxytocin and misoprostol, oxytocin and methylergometrine, or carbetocin is recommended for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal delivery. Intravenous oxytocin (10 IU) immediately after delivery of the neonate (after either anterior shoulder or whole-body delivery) and before delivery of the placenta is recommended. If oxytocin and tranexamic acid combination is chosen, intravenous tranexamic acid (1 g) in addition to intravenous oxytocin (10 IU) immediately after delivery of the neonate and before placental delivery is recommended. If oxytocin and misoprostol combination is chosen, sublingual misoprostol (400 µg) in addition to intravenous oxytocin (10 IU) immediately after delivery of the neonate is recommended. If there is no intravenous access or if in low-resource settings, sublingual misoprostol (400 µg) and intramuscular oxytocin (10 IU) are recommended. If oxytocin and methylergometrine combination is chosen, intramuscular methylergometrine (0.2 mg) and intravenous oxytocin (10 IU) immediately after delivery of the neonate are recommended. Single-dose intravenous or intramuscular carbetocin (100 µg) immediately after delivery of the neonate is recommended. Controlled cord traction and delayed cord clamping for approximately 60 seconds is recommended. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute umbilical cord milking, uterine massage, or nipple stimulation for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage. Repair of first- and second-degree lacerations with continuous synthetic suture technique is recommended. No repair of first-degree lacerations if hemostatic and normal cosmesis can be considered. Repair of third-degree lacerations with end-to-end or overlap continuous synthetic suture technique is recommended. Repair of fourth-degree lacerations with delayed absorbable 4–0 or 3–0 polyglactin or chromic suture in a running fashion is recommended. The use of single-dose second-generation cephalosporin at the time of third- or fourth-degree laceration repairs can be considered. Skin-to-skin contact after delivery is recommended. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute routine cord blood gas sampling after delivery. Public cord blood banking is recommended.

### Characteristics associated with severe perineal and cervical lacerations during vaginal delivery [^1128faZ9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize potentially modifiable risk factors for third- or fourth-degree perineal lacerations and cervical lacerations in a contemporary U.S. obstetric practice.

Methods

The Consortium on Safe Labor collected electronic medical records from 19 hospitals within 12 institutions (228,668 deliveries from 2002 to 2008). Information on patient characteristics, prenatal complications, labor and delivery data, and maternal and neonatal outcomes were collected. Only women with successful vaginal deliveries of cephalic singletons at 34 weeks of gestation or later were included; we excluded data from sites lacking information about lacerations at delivery and deliveries complicated by shoulder dystocia; 87,267 and 71,170 women were analyzed for third- or fourth-degree and cervical lacerations, respectively. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to adjust for other factors.

Results

Third- or fourth-degree lacerations occurred in 2,516 women (2,223 nulliparous [5.8%], 293 [0.6%] multiparous) and cervical lacerations occurred in 536 women (324 nulliparous [1.1%], 212 multiparous [0.5%]). Risks for third- or fourth-degree lacerations included nulliparity (7.2-fold risk), being Asian or Pacific Islander, increasing birth weight, operative vaginal delivery, episiotomy, and longer second stage of labor. Increasing body mass index was associated with fewer lacerations. Risk factors for cervical lacerations included young maternal age, vacuum vaginal delivery, and oxytocin use among multiparous women, and cerclage regardless of parity.

Conclusion

Our large cohort of women with severe obstetric lacerations reflects contemporary obstetric practices. Nulliparity and episiotomy use are important risk factors for third- or fourth-degree lacerations. Cerclage increases the risk for cervical lacerations. Many identified risk factors may not be modifiable.

### Committee opinion no. 647: limitations of perineal lacerations as an obstetric quality measure [^112acaTD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Perineal lacerations are a common occurrence with vaginal delivery. Although perineal lacerations are tracked easily from coding data, there are a variety of problems with using rates of such tears as a quality measure. The rate of severe perineal lacerations should not be used as a measure of obstetric quality for the following three reasons: 1) third-degree and fourth-degree perineal lacerations may not be defined uniformly; 2) severe perineal lacerations are associated strongly with nonmodifiable risk factors; and 3) diminishing the use of operative vaginal delivery, in an effort to decrease severe perineal lacerations, likely would result in an increased rate of cesarean delivery. Measuring the rate of episiotomy with unassisted vaginal deliveries is an alternative candidate for quality measurement, but it requires validation before widespread implementation.

### Risk factors for severe perineal tear: can we do better? [^114T2Ej8]. American Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Our aim was to investigate the risk factors associated with severe perineal tears defined as either third- or forth-degree tears and, ultimately, find strategies for prevention. We carried a retrospective analysis of a computerized perinatal database, collected prospectively, from a single county hospital between January 1, 1993 and June 30, 1998. Singleton vaginal vertex deliveries were analyzed for potential risk factors using univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis including all two-way interactions. Severe perineal tear occurred in 1905 (8.2%) of 23,244 vaginal deliveries. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, the following factors carried a significantly higher risk for severe laceration: midline episiotomy, primary vaginal delivery, use of pudendal block, forceps deliveries, and birth weight more than 4000 g. The study of interactions demonstrated that mediolateral episiotomy was associated with an increased risk for severe tear only during the first vaginal delivery, but not during a repeat vaginal delivery. Our data suggest that primary vaginal delivery, fetal weight above 4000 g, and the use of pudendal analgesia can help identify in advance patients at highest risk for severe perineal tear. During the delivery of these patients usage of vacuum (instead of forceps) and restricting the use of midline episiotomy might reduce the incidence of severe perineal tear. In cases where episiotomy seems crucial, the use of a mediolateral episiotomy may reduce the likelihood of severe perineal tear.

### Perineal techniques during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma [^1112nuu3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Most vaginal births are associated with trauma to the genital tract. The morbidity associated with perineal trauma can be significant, especially when it comes to third- and fourth-degree tears. Different interventions including perineal massage, warm or cold compresses, and perineal management techniques have been used to prevent trauma. This is an update of a Cochrane review that was first published in 2011.

Objectives

To assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence and morbidity associated with perineal trauma.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (26 September 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Published and unpublished randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating perineal techniques during the second stage of labour. Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated methodological quality. We checked data for accuracy.

Main Results

Twenty-two trials were eligible for inclusion (with 20 trials involving 15,181 women providing data). Overall, trials were at moderate to high risk of bias; none had adequate blinding, and most were unclear for both allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. Interventions compared included the use of perineal massage, warm and cold compresses, and other perineal management techniques. Most studies did not report data on our secondary outcomes. We downgraded evidence for risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision for all comparisons. Hands off (or poised) compared to hands onHands on or hands off the perineum made no clear difference in incidence of intact perineum (average risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.12, two studies, Tau² 0.00, I² 37%, 6547 women; moderate-quality evidence), first-degree perineal tears (average RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.77, two studies, 700 women; low-quality evidence), second-degree tears (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.28, two studies, 700 women; low-quality evidence), or third- or fourth-degree tears (average RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.26, five studies, Tau² 0.92, I² 72%, 7317 women; very low-quality evidence). Substantial heterogeneity for third- or fourth-degree tears means these data should be interpreted with caution. Episiotomy was more frequent in the hands-on group (average RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, Tau² 0.07, I² 74%, four studies, 7247 women; low-quality evidence), but there was considerable heterogeneity between the four included studies. There were no data for perineal trauma requiring suturing. Warm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress)A warm compress did not have any clear effect on the incidence of intact perineum (average RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.21; 1799 women; four studies; moderate-quality evidence), perineal trauma requiring suturing (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.66; 76 women; one study; very low-quality evidence), second-degree tears (average RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.56; 274 women; two studies; very low-quality evidence), or episiotomy (average RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.23; 1799 women; four studies; low-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compress increases or reduces the incidence of first-degree tears (average RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.79; 274 women; two studies; I² 88%; very low-quality evidence). Fewer third- or fourth-degree perineal tears were reported in the warm-compress group (average RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.79; 1799 women; four studies; moderate-quality evidence). Massage versus control (hands off or routine care)The incidence of intact perineum was increased in the perineal-massage group (average RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.73, six studies, 2618 women; I² 83% low-quality evidence) but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies). This group experienced fewer third- or fourth-degree tears (average RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.94, five studies, 2477 women; moderate-quality evidence). There were no clear differences between groups for perineal trauma requiring suturing (average RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.61, one study, 76 women; very low-quality evidence), first-degree tears (average RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.05, five studies, Tau² 0.47, I² 85%, 537 women; very low-quality evidence), or second-degree tears (average RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.12, five studies, Tau² 0.32, I² 62%, 537 women; very low-quality evidence). Perineal massage may reduce episiotomy although there was considerable uncertainty around the effect estimate (average RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.03, seven studies, Tau² 0.43, I² 92%, 2684 women; very low-quality evidence). Heterogeneity was high for first-degree tear, second-degree tear and for episiotomy - these data should be interpreted with caution. Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard careOne study (66 women) found that women receiving Ritgen's manoeuvre were less likely to have a first-degree tear (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69; very low-quality evidence), more likely to have a second-degree tear (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.73 to 6.09; very low-quality evidence), and neither more nor less likely to have an intact perineum (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.31; very low-quality evidence). One larger study reported that Ritgen's manoeuvre did not have an effect on incidence of third- or fourth-degree tears (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.96,1423 women; low-quality evidence). Episiotomy was not clearly different between groups (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.03, two studies, 1489 women; low-quality evidence). Other comparisonsThe delivery of posterior versus anterior shoulder first, use of a perineal protection device, different oils/wax, and cold compresses did not show any effects on perineal outcomes. Only one study contributed to each of these comparisons, so data were insufficient to draw conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that warm compresses, and massage, may reduce third- and fourth-degree tears but the impact of these techniques on other outcomes was unclear or inconsistent. Poor-quality evidence suggests hands-off techniques may reduce episiotomy, but this technique had no clear impact on other outcomes. There were insufficient data to show whether other perineal techniques result in improved outcomes. Further research could be performed evaluating perineal techniques, warm compresses and massage, and how different types of oil used during massage affect women and their babies. It is important for any future research to collect information on women's views.

### Perineal techniques during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma and postpartum complications [^112avV85]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is responsible for around 27% of global maternal deaths. Perineal tears are common in vaginal births and a significant contributor to excessive blood loss. A diversity of perineal techniques are utilised to prevent perineal trauma and reduce the incidence of PPH; however, they lack evidence-based comparisons to understand their effects.

Objectives

To assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence of and morbidity associated with perineal trauma to prevent postpartum complications.

Search Methods

We searched four databases and two trial registers up to 16 April 2024. We checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of women in the second stage of labour who intended to give birth vaginally, comparing any perineal techniques with control or another perineal technique. We excluded studies that performed perineal techniques outside the second stage of labour.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were second-, third- and fourth-degree tears measured immediately after birth, and PPH ≥ 500 mL measured within 24 hours after birth.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool to assess bias in the included RCTs.

Synthesis Methods

We synthesised results for each outcome within each comparison using meta-analysis where possible. Where this was not possible due to the nature of the data, we synthesised results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Included Studies

We included a total of 17 studies with 13,695 participants.

Synthesis Of Results

Hands off (or poised) versus hands on Hands off (poised) may result in little to no difference in second-degree tears (risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 1.64; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence) and third- or fourth-degree tears when data are combined (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.99; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of hands off (poised) on third-degree tears and fourth-degree tears when reported separately (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.27; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence and RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 71.22; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Hands off (poised) may result in little to no difference in PPH ≥ 500 mL (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.47; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). Hands off (poised) probably results in little to no difference in breastfeeding two days after birth (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.06; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence) and perineal pain (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.01; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). Vocalisation versus control Vocalisation may result in a reduction in second-degree tears (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.38; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) and third-degree tears (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.32; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), but the CIs are wide and include the possibility of no effect. No events were reported for fourth-degree tears (low-certainty evidence). Vocalisation may increase maternal satisfaction (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.51; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of vocalisation on perineal pain (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.58; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Warm compress on the perineum versus control (hands off or no warm compress) Warm compress on the perineum may result in little to no difference in second-degree tears (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.21; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence), but likely results in a reduction in third- or fourth-degree tears (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.79; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Evidence from two smaller studies is very uncertain about the effect of warm compress on the perineum on third-degree tears (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.04 to 7.05; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence) or fourth-degree tears (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.06; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence) when reported separately. Warm compress likely results in a large reduction in perineal pain (mean difference (MD) -0.81, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.44; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of warm compress on the perineum on maternal satisfaction and PPH ≥ 500 mL. Massage of the perineum versus control (hands off or no usual care) Massage of the perineum may have little to no effect on second-degree tears (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; 4 studies; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of massage of the perineum on third-degree tears (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.02; 4 studies; very low-certainty evidence). Massage of the perineum may reduce fourth-degree tears but the CIs are wide and include the possibility of no effect (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.61; 4 studies; low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that massage likely results in little to no difference in perineal pain (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90, 1.05; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). One study reported 10 participants with postpartum haemorrhage across three interventions (warm compress, massage, control). Combined warm compress and massage of the perineum versus control Combined warm compress and massage of the perineum likely results in a reduction in second-degree tears when compared to a control (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.86; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on third-degree tears (RR 2.92, 95% CI 0.12 to 70.72; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The intervention may result in a reduction in PPH ≥ 500 mL but the CIs are wide and include the possibility of no effect (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.35; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). Combined warm compress and massage likely results in an increase in maternal satisfaction (MD 0.4, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.81; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). Combined warm compress and massage of the perineum versus massage alone Combined warm compress and massage of the perineum may result in little to no difference in second-degree tears (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) when compared to massage alone, but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on third- or fourth-degree tears (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.49; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). It may also result in little to no difference in PPH ≥ 500 mL (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.07; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that combined warm compress and massage may result in little to no difference in maternal satisfaction (1 study; low-certainty evidence). Other perineal techniques We also assessed evidence on the following comparisons, but since they are used less frequently in global clinical practice to optimise birth outcomes, we have not presented the results summary here: Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care; primary delivery of posterior versus anterior shoulder; massage with enriched oil on the perineum versus massage with liquid wax; petroleum jelly on the perineum versus control; and perineal protection device versus control.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, the evidence for the effectiveness of perineal techniques to reduce perineal trauma and postpartum haemorrhage is very uncertain. Very few studies reported rates of postpartum haemorrhage, adverse events, women's or health workers' experience or other important outcomes that allow us to understand the effectiveness and acceptability of perineal techniques to reduce perineal trauma. Prior to any further large trials, research is needed to clarify the types of interventions, including a clear description of the process of development and involvement of relevant stakeholders. There is a need to clarify how the intervention is proposed to achieve its effects. Trials would benefit from process evaluation alongside, to explore context, mechanisms and effects.

### Episiotomy and increase in the risk of obstetric laceration in a subsequent vaginal delivery [^115BkuZv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether episiotomy at first vaginal delivery increases the risk of spontaneous obstetric laceration in the subsequent delivery.

Methods

A review was conducted of women with consecutive vaginal deliveries at Magee-Womens Hospital between 1995 and 2005, using the Magee Obstetrical Maternal and Infant database. The primary exposure of interest was episiotomy at first vaginal delivery. Multivariable polytomous logistic regression modeling of potential risk factors was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for obstetric laceration in the second vaginal delivery.

Results

A total of 6,052 patients were included, of whom 47.8% had episiotomy at first delivery. Spontaneous second-degree lacerations at the time of second delivery occurred in 51.3% of women with history of episiotomy at first delivery compared with 26.7% without history of episiotomy (P < .001). Severe lacerations (third or fourth degree) occurred in 4.8% of women with history of episiotomy at first delivery compared with 1.7% without history of episiotomy (P < .001). Prior episiotomy remained a significant risk factor for second-degree (OR 4.47, 95% confidence interval 3.78–5.30) and severe obstetric lacerations (OR 5.25, 95% confidence interval 2.96–9.32) in the second vaginal delivery after controlling for confounders. Based on these findings, for every four episiotomies not performed one second-degree laceration would be prevented. To prevent one severe laceration, performing 32 fewer episiotomies is required.

Conclusion

Episiotomy at first vaginal delivery increases the risk of spontaneous obstetric laceration in the subsequent delivery. This finding should encourage obstetric providers to further restrict the use of episiotomy.

### Can pelvic floor muscle training prevent perineal laceration? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117WRptc]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is reportedly able to reduce risk factors for perineal trauma. However, the effects of these exercises on perineal injuries are unclear.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness of PFMT in the prevention of perineal laceration.

Search Strategy

Searches were conducted in PubMed/Medline, LILACS, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CINAHL. For search strategies, we combined the terms PFMT, tear, laceration, perineum, and delivery.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of PFMT for the prevention of perineal laceration during vaginal delivery. There were no period or language limitations.

Data Collection and Analysis

We conducted data extraction and synthesis. We performed a quality appraisal, a qualitative synthesis, and for meta-analysis we used the Software R.

Main Results

Nine studies were included. In most studies, PFMT was performed daily, with a wide range of the number of contractions and sustainability. Prevalence of perineal laceration had a wide range and information on laceration degree was limited. Meta-analysis showed that PFMT was not effective to prevent perineal laceration.

Conclusion

Pelvic floor muscle training does not prevent perineal laceration. Further studies are needed to investigate different protocols and interventions.

### An evidence-based approach to defining fetal macrosomia [^111jD6YV]. American Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aims to determine the risk of adverse outcomes associated with the current diagnostic criteria for fetal macrosomia. Study

Design

We evaluated three techniques for characterizing birth weight as a predictor of shoulder dystocia or third- or fourth-degree laceration in 79,879 vaginal deliveries. First, we compared deliveries with birth weights above or below 4,500 g. We then performed logistic regression using birth weight as a continuous predictor, both with and without fractional polynomial transformation. Finally, we calculated the number of cesarean sections required to prevent one incident of the interrogated outcomes (number needed to treat [NNT]).

Results

Rates of adverse intrapartum outcomes increase incrementally with increasing birth weight and are predicted most accurately with logistic regression following fractional polynomial transformation. The NNT for third- or fourth-degree laceration dropped from 14.3 (95% confidence interval, 13.9–14.7) at a birth weight of 3,500 g to 6.4 (95% CI, 6.1–6.8) at 4,500 g and, for shoulder dystocia, from 54.9 (95% CI, 51.5–58.6) at 3,500 g to 5.6 (95% CI, 5.2–6.0) at 4,500 g.

Conclusion

The conventional distinction between "normal" and "macrosomic" does not reflect the incremental effect of increasing birth weight on the risk of obstetric morbidity. Outcomes analysis can inform fetal growth standards to better reflect relevant thresholds of risk.

### A retrospective study on perineal lacerations in vaginal delivery and the individual performance of experienced mifwives [^114DF5wn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

In obstetrics, one important complication is the occurrence of perineal lacerations in the course of a vaginal delivery. Perineal lacerations occur in up to two-thirds of women and have been claimed to cause social problems and affect a mother's psychological well-being. The classification of perineal lacerations is well-known: first or second degree lacerations include the skin, subcutaneous and muscle layers, but exclude the anal sphincter. The third- or fourth degree category (severe perineal lacerations) include partial or complete tears to the anal sphincter or the rectum, respectively.

Risk factors for severe perineal lacerations include increasing birth weight, operative vaginal deliveries, labor induction and augmentation. Moreover, manual protection of the perineum could not be proven to be beneficial according to meta-analyses of randomized trials. It has, however, been argued that randomized trials only investigated separate, specific interventions, and, thus, might not be appropriate for the evaluation of the highly complex process of delivery, which integrates several different maneuvers. This includes communication between the midwife/obstetrician and the delivering woman, perineal support, and a delivery position that would allow visualization of the perineum during the last few minutes of delivery, among other factors. It seems plausible that this process likely depends on the individual person who cares for the delivering woman, and, thus, it was our study objective to quantify this possible contributing factor. With regard to quality control, this seems of great importance to us. If differences in obstetric performance at an individual level would have a major impact on outcome, those with a poorer performance could be identified and re-training could be offered.

In Austria, midwives usually perform spontaneous deliveries. Thus, we retrospectively evaluated all experienced midwives in our department and compared their performance concerning perineal lacerations as the major outcome parameter.

### Hyaluronidase for reducing perineal trauma [^115sV7Gs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Perineal trauma after vaginal birth is common and can be associated with short- and long-term health problems. Perineal hyaluronidase (HAase) injection has been widely used to reduce perineal trauma, perineal pain and the need for episiotomy since the 1950s. The administration of HAase is considered to be a simple, low risk, low cost and effective way to decrease perineal trauma without causing adverse effects.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of perineal HAase injection for reducing perineal trauma, episiotomy and perineal pain during vaginal delivery.

Search Methods

To identify studies for inclusion in this review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) in November 2023.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing women giving birth to their first baby receiving perineal HAase injection compared to placebo injection or no intervention during vaginal delivery of a single foetus with vertex foetal presentation (foetus with head engaging the maternal pelvis).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted and checked data, and evaluated the risk of bias in the studies. Our primary outcomes were perineal trauma (tears or episiotomy, or both), episiotomy and perineal pain. Our secondary outcomes were first and second degree perineal lacerations, third and fourth degree perineal lacerations, perineal oedema 1 hour after vaginal delivery, perineal oedema 24 hours after vaginal delivery and neonatal Apgar scores of less than 7 at five minutes after birth (Apgar score is a measure of the health status of a newborn). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included five randomised controlled trials involving a total of 747 women (data were available for 743 women). The dosage of HAase used in the perineal injection varied from 750 turbidity-reducing units to 5000 international units. The certainty of the evidence was largely low (ranging from very low to moderate). Perineal HAase injection versus placebo injection Data from three trials involving 426 women provided low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference between the HAase and placebo groups in the incidence of perineal trauma (tears or episiotomy, or both) (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03; 426 participants, 3 studies), episiotomy (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.15; 427 participants, 3 studies), first and second degree perineal lacerations (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.18; 341 participants, 3 studies), third and fourth degree perineal lacerations (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.05; 426 participants, 3 studies), and perineal oedema one hour after vaginal delivery (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.25; 303 participants, 2 studies). Moreover, perineal HAase injection during the second stage of labour likely resulted in a reduction in incidence of perineal oedema 24 hours after vaginal delivery compared with placebo injection (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.70; 303 participants, 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be no difference between groups in Apgar scores less than 7 at five minutes (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.24 to 105.95; 148 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence). Perineal HAase injection versus no intervention Data from three trials involving 373 women suggested that perineal HAase injection during the second stage of labour may result in a lower incidence of perineal trauma (tears or episiotomy, or both) (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88; 373 participants, 3 studies; low-certainty evidence) compared with no intervention. The evidence is very uncertain for episiotomy (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.42; 373 participants, 3 studies), first and second degree perineal lacerations (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.18; 373 participants, 3 studies) and perineal oedema one hour after vaginal delivery (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.71; 139 participants, 1 study), all very low certainty evidence. No third and fourth degree perineal lacerations, perineal oedema 24 hours after vaginal delivery or Apgar scores less than 7 at five minutes were reported in these three trials. No side effects were reported in the included trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Perineal HAase injection during the second stage of labour may result in a lower incidence of perineal trauma (tears or episiotomy, or both) compared with no intervention, but not compared with placebo injection, in women having a vaginal delivery. Meanwhile, perineal HAase injection likely reduces the incidence of perineal oedema 24 hours after vaginal delivery compared with placebo injection. The potential use of perineal HAase injection as a method to reduce perineal trauma and perineal oedema remains to be determined as the number of high-quality trials and outcomes reported was too limited to draw conclusions on its effectiveness and safety. Further rigorous randomised controlled trials are required to evaluate the role of perineal HAase injection in vaginal deliveries, including evaluating whether there is any differential effect based on the dose, frequency and positioning of HAase injection.

### Perineal body length and prevention of perineal lacerations during delivery in Cameroonian primigravid patients [^115YxdCs]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The rate of perineal tears in Cameroonian primiparous women is reported to be up to 59.7%. The present study aimed to assess the relationship between perineal length and perineal tears.

Methods

We conducted a prospective study of primiparous women with singleton pregnancies of at least 36 +6 weeks length. The admitting physician measured the length of the perineal body at the first stage of labor and this value was hidden from the delivery personnel until delivery occurred. The presence of perineal trauma and other delivery characteristics were recorded. Data were analyzed using univariate analyses and multiple logistic regression.

Results

The mean perineal body length was 3.21 ± 0.75 cm (range 1.5–5.5 cm). 34 (33.0%) primiparous women sustained spontaneous perineal tears and 20 (19.4%) had episiotomies. No third- or fourth-degree perineal tears were observed. Perineal body length shorter than 2.5 cm was a significant (P < 0.04) predictor of spontaneous perineal lacerations (58.3% vs. 29.7% with relative risk 0.59). Both duration of second stage of labor longer than 60 min and occiput posterior presentation were associated with an increased risk of episiotomy in primiparous patients.

Conclusion

Perineal body length less than 2.5 cm significantly predisposed to spontaneous perineal lacerations.

### Development and validation of a protocol for documentation of obstetric perineal lacerations [^117AXrrm]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

During vaginal delivery about 80% of women contract some degree of perineal trauma, primiparous women more frequently than multiparous women. The majority of tears are first- or second-degree perineal tears, but third- and fourth-degree tears occur in 3.2–4.3% of vaginal deliveries irrespective of parity. In Sweden during 2009–2013, 6.2% of primiparas contracted a third- or fourth-degree tear. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries are the largest risk factor for developing anal incontinence among women, so these perineal tears merit attention. Second-degree perineal lacerations have been suggested as a "marker" for perineal trauma sufficient to cause anal sphincter injury, meaning that women with these tears should be thoroughly examined. The clinical diagnosis of obstetric and sphincter injuries has proven difficult. Endoanal ultrasound performed at the delivery ward diagnoses obstetric anal sphincter defects more accurately than a clinical examination, but has not yet become a routine method.

Administrative discharge codes are increasingly used in health services research, both as a measure of quality of care and for scientific purposes. In Sweden, national monitoring of perineal tears and other obstetric complications is pursued through the Pregnancy Registry (Graviditetsregistret). Data are automatically extracted from the medical record system in most Swedish counties. The validity of the scientific studies and national quality monitoring based on discharge codes heavily depends on the accuracy of the available data. Two previous American studies on the accuracy of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears have shown varying results. Romano et al. showed accurately reported diagnoses, while Brubaker et al. found that nearly a quarter of hospital discharges associated with a third- or fourth-degree tear were undercoded. Thus, before drawing too far-reaching conclusions from comparisons of quality of care, the validity of the diagnostic codes must be established.

### Diagnosis, management and training in perineal trauma: a UK national survey of obstetricians [^112ZideD]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Looking in more detail at the identification of obstetric lacerations from images and descriptive text for first- and second-degree tears, more respondents correctly identified the image than the description. Both were high, but perhaps this shows a little less understanding of classification, as one will expect it to be the same if participants have a full understanding of the classification descriptions. Third and fourth-degree tear identification was even better. These results indicate that most physicians are well-educated in the classification of OASI. This is likely due to the training they have received. When compared with results from the American survey, the UK physicians were slightly better at identifying and classifying perineal tears (third-degree tears from description: UK 98.3%, 99% and 98.3%; American 87%, 90.2% and 92.7%). Both surveys used standardised images and text, which are easier to classify than a patient in a clinical setting, who may have bleeding and pain. But this is certainly a good indication of clinical practice and understanding.

The identification of non-perineal injuries, such as cervical tears, was not as accurate. Many respondents were inappropriately using the Sultan Classification for these injuries. This was also found in the American survey. We suggest that a standardised nomenclature might be designed for non-perineal tears to clarify the way in which these tears should be described.

There are many indicators from our results that imply good knowledge and education in the prevention of obstetric tears in the UK. "Manual perineal support" and "controlled or guided delivery" were the highest selected answers for preventing OASI. This is recommended in the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top guideline. Almost all respondents said that they use mediolateral episiotomy, which is known to be safer in the reduction of OASI than midline episiotomy. In the US survey, the majority (58%) were still using a midline episiotomy. This is likely to be due to the implementation of the OASI care bundle, which promotes these practices.

### Duration of second stage of labor and instrumental delivery as risk factors for severe perineal lacerations: population-based study [^117KWHDB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Severe perineal laceration is a common and important complication of vaginal delivery, with a strong impact on quality of life. Depending on the anatomical structures involved, severe perineal lacerations fall into two categories: third-degree lacerations, which involve the anal sphincter complex, and fourth-degree lacerations, which extend to the rectal mucosa. Severe perineal lacerations are associated with later faecal incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Third and fourth degree perineal lacerations have been reported to occur in approximately 7% of vaginal deliveries among primiparous mothers in Sweden. Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of being aware of the risk factors for obstetric anal sphincter injury in order to prevent severe perineal lacerations. Several risk factors have been identified, including primiparity, large fetal size, vaginal instrumental delivery, and occiput posterior position.

The second stage of labor is defined as the time period from complete dilation of the cervix to birth of the infant. Prolonged second stage of labor has been associated with risks of adverse maternal outcomes, including severe perineal lacerations. However, these studies have methodological limitations, including oversimplified categorization of second stage of labor, lack of information on study population characteristics and control of confounding. To our knowledge, no previous study has used prospectively recorded information to investigate the duration of the second stage of labor as an independent risk factor for severe perineal lacerations, taking important maternal and delivery characteristics into account.

In the present population-based cohort study, we used data recorded from the partograph to investigate the effect of duration of the second stage of labor on the risk of severe perineal lacerations in primiparous mothers.

### Diagnosis, management and training in perineal trauma: a UK national survey of obstetricians [^114xgoud]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Prevention

Table 3 shows that the methods used by most participants to help prevent OASIs were "controlled or guided delivery" and "manual perineal support". Almost all (99.3%) of the respondents said that they perform episiotomies, 299 (99%) said that they use a mediolateral episiotomy and 1 respondent said they use a lateral episiotomy.

Table 3
Methods of prevention of obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI)

Diagnosis

Very few participants described their ability to identify tears as "very poor" (Table 4), but 3.6% of respondents described themselves as "poor" at identifying third-degree tears. When asked about using the sub-category system to describe third-degree tears, 100% of participants reported using this.

Table 4
Self-assessment of ability to identify obstetric tears

Tables 5 and 6 show the identification of perineal injuries from images and text descriptions. Overall, most respondents correctly identified first-, second-, third- and fourth-degree tears. Identification of other perineal injuries, e.g. labial tears, was less consistent, with many respondents incorrectly using the Sultan Classification for non-perineal injuries.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 198: prevention and management of obstetric lacerations at vaginal delivery [^111uzMh6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Lacerations are common after vaginal birth. Trauma can occur on the cervix, vagina, and vulva, including the labial, periclitoral, and periurethral regions, and the perineum. Most of these lacerations do not result in adverse functional outcomes. Severe perineal lacerations, extending into or through the anal sphincter complex, although less frequent, are more commonly associated with increased risk of pelvic floor injury, fecal and urinary incontinence, pain, and sexual dysfunction with symptoms that may persist or be present many years after giving birth. The purpose of this document is to provide evidence-based guidelines for the prevention, identification, and repair of obstetric lacerations and for episiotomy.

### Childbirth-induced trauma to the urethral continence mechanism: review and recommendations [^112xW1tK]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

To summarize the literature on immediate pelvic floor damage from childbirth and episiotomy, a MEDLINE search of English language articles published from 1983 to 2001 was performed. Vaginal delivery causes varying degrees of muscular, neuromuscular, and connective tissue damage. This damage may result in urinary and/or fecal incontinence. Routine midline episiotomy increases the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations, which may lead to fecal incontinence. Routine use of mediolateral episiotomy does not prevent urinary incontinence (UI) or severe perineal tears. It is possible to reduce the rate of mediolateral episiotomy to as low as 20% in primiparas without increasing the risk of anal sphincter damage. Control of obesity before delivery, as well as pelvic floor exercises and regular physical exercise both before and after delivery, seem to reduce the risk of postpartum UI.

### A retrospective study on perineal lacerations in vaginal delivery and the individual performance of experienced mifwives [^114yb3C1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

All in all, we consider the requirement of benchmarking our results against other published data fulfilled to look at the individual midwife. Since several other parameters were independent risk factors for perineal lacerations in addition to the individual midwife in the multivariate model, we can rule out that some of the midwives cared for more complex deliveries. Thus, differences in handling, probably also in communication with the delivering woman, likely contributed to the differences in outcomes. In our department, midwives usually deliver children based on general recommendations about the last stage of delivery. This includes that the hand of the midwife should control the speed of the head crowning through the vaginal introitus, while the other hand should support the perineum. The mother would then be asked to stop pushing and, when most of the head is out, the perineal ring would be pushed under the neonate's chin as described previously. It, however, must be noted that literature comparing this "hands-on" method to the "hands-off" or the "hands-poised" methods is controversial. Several studies showed favorable results for the latter two methods, others concluded that a clear beneficial effect could be seen for the "hands-on" method. These observations are in line with the last Cochrane database systematic review on this topic stating that "hands-off" versus "hands-on" showed no effect on third- and fourth-degree tears as well as with a recent meta-analysis. Accordingly, current midwifery guidelines recommend that either approach is appropriate. However, randomized controlled trials evaluating different techniques of perineal support may not be the only approach for investigating such complex interventions. Taken these considerations together, it is likely that other modifiable factors contributed to the differences in individual outcomes. Other recommended strategies include emphasis on selective mediolateral episiotomy, good visualization of the perineum at birth and communication with the mother regarding slow pushing. Unfortunately, we could not evaluate the latter two factors due to the retrospective study design. However, in this context, it must be emphasized once more that all analyzed midwives were experienced and had performed several hundred vaginal deliveries before the study period. Moreover, from our experience, the extent to which these maneuvers are exerted differs between the midwives. This is in line with the previously published observations that many midwives preferred a personalized approach rather than an a standardized recommended technique and that many midwives will respond to different clinical scenarios by changing technique.

### Anal incontinence among women with one versus two complete third-degree perineal lacerations [^114xAz4x]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the rate of anal incontinence and severe incontinence among women who had 0, 1, and ≥ 2 additional vaginal deliveries after sustaining a third-degree perineal laceration and between subjects with one versus two third-degree tears.

Method

A telephone survey was done to assess the anal function of all subjects who sustained a complete third-degree tear as a nullipara.

Result

The rate of anal incontinence and severe incontinence was similar among women who had 0, 1, and ≥ 2 additional deliveries (11/65, 11/67, and 12/40, p = 0.179; 2/65, 1/67, and 2/40, p = 0.811) and between women who had one sphincter tear and no additional delivery versus those with two tears and ≥ 2 subsequent deliveries (11/65 and 10/37, p = 0.225. 2/65 and 2/37, p = 0.460).

Conclusion

Additional vaginal deliveries and a repeat sphincter tear after the initial third-degree laceration were not associated with a higher rate or severity of anal incontinence.

### Trends and determinants of the use of episiotomy in a prospective population-based registry from central India [^11615eTH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Episiotomy — the surgical incision of the perineum to enlarge the vaginal outlet at the time of fetal delivery — was once the most common surgical procedure in obstetrics. In 1979, two-thirds of all vaginal deliveries in the United States involved an episiotomy. The theoretical benefits — including prevention of severe perineal injury, faster second stage of labor, and prevention of shoulder dystocia — also led to its routine use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where obstructed labor is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. A large study conducted in the mid-1990s in 13 Latin American countries found a median rate of episiotomy in nulliparous women ranging from 69.2% in Mexico to 96.2% in Ecuador. Similarly, a 2003 study from the Global Network for Women and Children's Research found that rates among nulliparous women neared 100% in many countries, including India.

Despite the theoretical benefits of episiotomy, its true clinical impact remains unclear. There are well documented risks associated with its use, including excessive blood loss, wound dehiscence, infection, short- and long-term perineal pain, and increased risk of severe lacerations in future deliveries. Some studies have also found a higher risk of dyspareunia and long-term symptoms related to pelvic floor dysfunction. A Cochrane systematic review on the topic concluded that restrictive use of episiotomy leads to better clinical outcomes — including a decreased incidence of severe (third- and fourth-degree) lacerations — as compared to routine use. In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended against its routine/liberal use. While the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recognizes its utility in assisted vaginal birth (vacuum or forceps delivery), their guideline states that "current data and clinical opinion suggest that there are insufficient objective evidence-based criteria to recommend episiotomy".

### Influence of the second stage of labor on maternal and neonatal outcomes in vaginal births after caesarean section: a multicenter study in Germany [^111q1Kac]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

In a retrospective investigation performed in 2019, Miller et al. concluded that an operative intervention might be considered after a two-hour duration of the second stage of labor without epidural anesthesia, a three-hour duration with epidural anesthesia, and a one-hour duration or less in women with a previous vaginal delivery, for those undergoing TOLAC. These measures are in accordance with former guidelines. According to the new guidelines, the duration of the second stage of labor with and without epidural anesthesia could be at least 4 and 3 h, respectively. Zhang et al. used an interval-censored regression to analyze labor curves and suggested that the 95th percentiles of the second stage of labor in nulliparous women were 3.6 and 2.8 h with and with without epidural anesthesia. However, only low-risk women were included in the investigation. Labor curves for high-risk women, such as those undergoing TOLAC, have not been thoroughly examined yet. As Zheng et al. suggested, the ideal time for the second stage of labor would differ by populations and may be shorter for patients undergoing TOLAC.

After application of the new guidelines, we observed a slight but not statistically significant increase in third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations from 0.9 to 1.2%. Risk factors for third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations, such as the mother's ethnicity and infants large for their gestational age, were comparable in both groups. Furthermore, as the frequency of vaginal operative deliveries decreased after the establishment of the new guidelines, a reduction in third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations could be expected. In a study comprising 19,831 patients, Zipori et al. registered an increase in third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations from 1 to 1.3% after application of the new labor guidelines. Third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations exert a significant impact on the patients' quality of life in terms of higher rates of dyspareunia, wound breakdown and infection, urinary incontinence, and postpartum depression secondary to perineal pain.

### Episiotomy: evolution of a common obstetric practice at a public hospital [^111Ceg1q]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the rate and impact of episiotomy on maternal and newborn outcomes before and after restricted use of episiotomy.

Study Design

This population-based observational study used an obstetric database of all deliveries since 1990 that has been maintained with quality checks. Inclusion criteria were vaginal deliveries at ≥ 37 weeks. Exclusion criteria included fetal malformations, multifetal gestations, or fetal deaths known on arrival to Labor and Delivery. The primary outcomes of interest were episiotomy, perineal lacerations, and newborn outcomes. To evaluate the impact of restrictive episiotomy, data from 1990 to 1997 (35% overall episiotomy rate) were compared with data from 2010 to 2017 (2.5% overall episiotomy rate). Univariable analysis of maternal and infant outcomes were performed comparing the two-time epochs with the Pearson's Chi-squared test.

Results

Overall, 268,415 women met inclusion criteria and 49,089 (18.2%) had an episiotomy. The rate of episiotomy decreased from 37% of deliveries in 1990 to 2% in 2017. A total of 82,082 deliveries occurred in the 1990 to 1997 epoch and 57,183 in 2010 to 2017. Indicated use of episiotomy was associated with a significant decrease in third and fourth degree lacerations. Immediate newborn condition (5-minute Apgar's score ≤ 3 and umbilical artery pH < 7.1) and neonatal outcomes (intraventricular hemorrhage [IVH] grade 3/4, positive culture sepsis, neonatal seizures, and neonatal demise) were not significantly different.

Conclusion

Selective, indicated use of episiotomy compared with routine was associated with lower rates of third/fourth-degree lacerations with no change in neonatal outcomes. The common obstetric practice of routinely performing episiotomy, presumably to prevent perineal trauma, proved untrue when analyzed over almost three decades.

Key Points

· Episiotomy use decreased overtime at our institution. · Decreased episiotomy use was associated with significant improvement in maternal outcomes. · Neonatal outcomes were unchanged suggesting no deleterious effects with restricted episiotomy.

### Evaluation of delivery options for second-stage events [^116PzmFQ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cesarean delivery in the second stage of labor is common, whereas the frequency of operative vaginal delivery has been declining. However, data comparing outcomes for attempted operative vaginal delivery vs cesarean in the second stage are scant. Previous studies that examine operative vaginal delivery have compared it to a baseline risk of complications from a spontaneous vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. However, when a woman has a need for intervention in the second stage, spontaneous vaginal delivery is not an option she or the provider can choose. Thus, the appropriate clinical comparison is cesarean vs operative vaginal delivery.

Objective

Our objective was to compare outcomes by the first attempted operative delivery (vacuum, forceps vs cesarean delivery) in patients needing second-stage assistance at a fetal station of +2 or below.

Study Design

We conducted secondary analysis of an observational obstetric cohort in 25 academically affiliated US hospitals over a 3-year period. A subset of ≥ 37 weeks, nonanomalous, vertex, singletons, with no prior vaginal delivery who reached a station of +2 or below and underwent an attempt at an operative delivery were included. Indications included for operative delivery were: failure to descend, nonreassuring fetal status, labor dystocia, or maternal exhaustion. The primary outcomes included a composite neonatal outcome (death, fracture, length of stay ≥ 3 days beyond mother's, low Apgar, subgaleal hemorrhage, ventilator support, hypoxic encephalopathy, brachial plexus injury, facial nerve palsy) and individual maternal outcomes (postpartum hemorrhage, third- and fourth-degree tears [severe lacerations], and postpartum infection). Outcomes were examined by the 3 attempted modes of delivery. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for primary outcomes adjusting for confounders. Final mode of delivery was quantified.

Results

In all, 2531 women met inclusion criteria. No difference in the neonatal composite outcome was observed between groups. Vacuum attempt was associated with the lowest frequency of maternal complications (postpartum infection 0.2% vs 0.9% forceps vs 5.3% cesarean, postpartum hemorrhage 1.4% vs 2.8% forceps vs 3.8% cesarean), except for severe lacerations (19.1% vs 33.8% forceps vs 0% cesarean). When confounders were taken into account, both forceps (OR, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.49) and vacuum (OR, 0.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–0.17) were associated with a significantly lower odds of postpartum infection. The neonatal composite and postpartum hemorrhage were not significantly different between modes of attempted delivery. Cesarean occurred in 6.4% and 4.4% of attempted vacuum and forceps groups (P = 0.04).

Conclusion

In patients needing second-stage delivery assistance with a station of +2 or below, attempted operative vaginal delivery was associated with a lower frequency of postpartum infection, but higher frequency of severe lacerations.

### Repair of episiotomy and obstetrical perineal lacerations (first-fourth) [^1178VW5j]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Perineal injury after vaginal delivery is common, affecting up to 90% of women. Perineal trauma is associated with both short- and long-term morbidity, including persistent pain, dyspareunia, pelvic floor disorders, and depression, and may negatively affect a new mother's ability to care for her newborn. The morbidity experienced after perineal injury is dependent on the type of laceration incurred, the technique and materials used for repair, and the skill and knowledge of the birth attendant. After all vaginal deliveries, a systematic evaluation including visual inspection and vaginal, perineal, and rectal exams is recommended to accurately diagnose perineal lacerations. Optimal management of perineal trauma after vaginal birth includes accurate diagnosis, appropriate technique and materials used for repair, providers experienced in perineal laceration repair, and close follow-up. In this article, we review the prevalence, classification, diagnosis, and evidence supporting different closure methods for first- through fourth-degree perineal lacerations and episiotomies. Recommended surgical techniques and materials for different perineal laceration repairs are provided. Finally, best practices for perioperative and postoperative care after advanced perineal trauma are reviewed.

### Nurse-midwives' ability to diagnose acute third-and fourth-degree obstetric lacerations in Western Kenya [^112cE45E]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Obstetric fistula devastates the lives of women and is found most commonly among the poor in resource-limited settings. Unrepaired third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations have been shown to be the source of approximately one-third of the fistula burden in fistula camps in Kenya. In this study, we assessed potential barriers to accurate identification by Kenyan nurse-midwives of these complex perineal lacerations in postpartum women.

Methods

Nurse-midwife trainers from each of the seven sub-counties of Siaya County, Kenya were assessed in their ability to accurately identify obstetric lacerations and anatomical structures of the perineum, using a pictorial assessment tool. Referral pathways, follow-up mechanisms, and barriers to assessing obstetric lacerations were evaluated.

Results

Twenty-two nurse-midwife trainers were assessed. Four of the 22 (18.2%) reported ever receiving formal training on evaluating third- and fourth-degree obstetric lacerations, and 20 of 22 (91%) reported health-system challenges to adequately completing their examination of the perineum at delivery. Twenty-one percent of third- and fourth-degree obstetric lacerations in the pictorial assessment were incorrectly identified as first- or second-degree lacerations.

Conclusion

County nurse-midwife trainers in Siaya, Kenya, experience inadequate training, equipment, staffing, time, and knowledge as barriers to adequate diagnosis and repair of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears.

### Diagnosis, management and training in perineal trauma: a UK national survey of obstetricians [^115Fp5v6]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and hypothesis

Perineal trauma during vaginal delivery is very common. Training in diagnosis and repair of trauma, including obstetric anal sphincter injuries, varies in the UK. We aimed to investigate the current knowledge and training received by obstetric physicians.

Methods

A national, validated survey was conducted online, using Qualtrics. The National Trainees Committee distributed the survey. It was also sent directly to consultants via email.

Results

A total of 302 physicians completed the survey and were included in the analysis. 3.9% of participants described their training in obstetric perineal trauma as "very poor" or "poor". 20.5% said they have not received training. 8.6% of physicians practising for more than 10 years had not had training for over 10 years. 70.5% responded "somewhat agree" or "strongly agree" when asked if they would like more training. Identification of first, second, third-, and fourth-degree tears from images and descriptions was very good (more than 80% correct for all categories). Classification of other perineal trauma was less consistent, with many incorrectly using the Sultan Classification. "Manual perineal support" and "Controlled or guided delivery" were the most frequently selected methods for the prevention of obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI).

Conclusions

Training experience for physicians in obstetric perineal trauma varies. Further improvement in training and education in perineal trauma, particularly in OASI, is needed for physicians. Perineal trauma that is not included in the Sultan Classification is often misclassified.

Identification of first, second, third-, and fourth-degree tears from images and descriptions was very good (more than 80% correct for all categories). Classification of other perineal trauma was less consistent, with many incorrectly using the Sultan Classification. "Manual perineal support" and "Controlled or guided delivery" were the most frequently selected methods for the prevention of obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI).

Conclusions

Training experience for physicians in obstetric perineal trauma varies. Further improvement in training and education in perineal trauma, particularly in OASI, is needed for physicians. Perineal trauma that is not included in the Sultan Classification is often misclassified.

### Duration of second stage of labor and instrumental delivery as risk factors for severe perineal lacerations: population-based study [^114PYy6Y]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

c Time from fully dilated cervix to birth

In stratified analyses by mode of vaginal delivery, rates and adjusted OR are presented in Table 3. In instrumental vaginal deliveries, rates of severe perineal lacerations were higher at each time point than in spontaneous vaginal deliveries but remained the same after 2 h.

Table 3
Risk of severe perineal lacerations, maternal, fetal and delivery characteristics by mode of vaginal delivery

a Perineal lacerations third- and fourth degree

b Adjusted for maternal age, BMI, maternal height, parental cohabitation, smoking, epidural analgesia, oxytocin augmentation, induction of labor, gestational age, episiotomy, occiput posterior position, head circumference, birthweight more than 4500 g and mode of delivery

c Time from fully dilated cervix to birth

The relative risk of perineal laceration increased with duration of second stage of labor during the first 3 h but then remained almost unaltered, both in instrumental and non-instrumental deliveries. The absolute risk of severe perineal lacerations was more than 2 times higher in instrumental versus non-instrumental deliveries for each category of second stage duration. The occiput posterior fetal head position, high birth weight and large head circumference were significantly associated with perineal lacerations in both vaginal instrumental and non-instrumental deliveries. Episiotomy was a significant protector for severe perineal lacerations among vaginal instrumental deliveries, whereas it was a significant risk factor among non-instrumental deliveries (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94 and OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.27–1.69, respectively). (Table 3) The test of interaction for duration of second stage of labor and mode of delivery was not significant (p = 0.43).

### Study protocol. IDUS-instrumental delivery&ultrasound: a multi-centre randomised controlled trial of ultrasound assessment of the fetal head position versus standard care as an approach to prevent morbidity at instrumental delivery [^1169rYKr]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Instrumental deliveries are commonly performed in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with rates of 12–17% in most centres. Knowing the exact fetal head position is a pre-requisite for safe instrumental delivery. Traditionally, diagnosis of the fetal head position is made on transvaginal digital examination by delineating the suture lines of the fetal skull and the fontanelles. However, accurate diagnosis of the fetal head position by transvaginal digital examination can be unreliable.

Malpositions in labour in a vertex-presenting fetus are known to be associated with increased prolonged first and second stages of labour, oxytocin augmentation, use of epidural analgesia, chorioamnionitis, assisted vaginal delivery, third and fourth degree perineal lacerations, caesarean delivery, excessive blood loss, and postpartum infection. Trial of instrumental delivery in theatre is twice as likely to fail in occipito-posterior (OP) positions and failed trials are associated with increased neonatal and maternal morbidity and trauma.

We propose a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the use of ultrasound to diagnose the fetal head position prior to attempting instrumental delivery.

The hypothesis is that an abdominal ultrasound scan performed in addition to routine clinical assessment reduces the incidence of incorrect diagnosis of the fetal head position which will reduce the risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity.

### Fecal and urinary incontinence after vaginal delivery with anal sphincter disruption in an obstetrics unit in the United States [^1137qbCH]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence of urinary and bowel incontinence in relation to anal sphincter laceration in primiparous women and to identify factors that are associated with anal sphincter laceration in a unit that uses primarily midline episiotomy.

Study Design

From January 1, 1997, to March 30, 2000, 2941 questionnaires concerning pelvic floor function 6 months after delivery were mailed to primiparous women who were delivered vaginally at the University of Michigan Medical Center. Charts were reviewed for 2858 deliveries to assess the use of episiotomy and the degree of perineal trauma, along with demographic and pertinent delivery variables. There were 943 women who completed the urinary function questionnaire and 831 women who completed the bowel function questionnaire. Univariate analysis was performed on all covariates. Multiple logistic regression was used for the analysis of the presence of third- or fourth-degree lacerations as the outcome.

Results

Nineteen percent of the women who completed the survey had sustained third- or fourth-degree lacerations during childbirth. The women in the sphincter laceration group were more likely (23.0%) to have bowel incontinence than the women in the control group (13.4%) (P < .05). The incidence of worse bowel control was nearly 10 times higher in women with fourth-degree lacerations (30.8%) compared with women with third-degree lacerations (3.6%, P < .001). Macrosomia (odds ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.61, 2.99), forceps-assisted delivery (odds ratio, 4.75; 95% CI, 3.43, 6.57), and vacuum-assisted delivery (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% CI, 2.64, 4.66) were associated with higher risks of third- and fourth-degree lacerations. Midline episiotomy (odds ratio, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.81, 2.77), but not mediolateral (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.375, 1.19), episiotomy was associated with anal sphincter lacerations. More than one half of the women had new onset of urinary incontinence after delivery and reported several lifestyle modifications to prevent leakage.

Conclusion

Women with third- and fourth-degree lacerations were more likely to have bowel incontinence than women without anal sphincter lacerations. Fourth-degree lacerations appear to affect anal continence greater than third-degree lacerations.

### Obstetric perineal tears, birth characteristics and the association with urinary incontinence among primiparous women 12 months postpartum: a prospective cohort study [^113wbkzA]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study found an association between the degree of perineal lacerations and any UI among primiparous women 12 months postpartum. Women with third- or fourth-degree tears had higher risks of any UI than women with no tears, labial tears or first-degree tears. This could be related to neurological damage to the pelvic floor or muscle damage. In this study, the increased risk of any UI seemed to be due to defects in the superficial perineal muscles rather than defects in the anal sphincter muscles. This highlights the importance of preventing and managing all perineal lacerations in the postpartum period to reduce the risk of UI.

### Perineal techniques during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma [^1124Tqiw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Most vaginal births are associated with some form of trauma to the genital tract. The morbidity associated with perineal trauma is significant, especially when it comes to third- and fourth-degree tears. Different perineal techniques and interventions are being used to prevent perineal trauma. These interventions include perineal massage, warm compresses and perineal management techniques.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence of perineal trauma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (20 May 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of ControlledTrials (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2 of 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to 20 May 2011) and CINAHL (January 1983 to 20 May 2011).

Selection Criteria

Published and unpublished randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating any described perineal techniques during the second stage.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trails for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated methodological quality. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

We included eight trials involving 11,651 randomised women. There was a significant effect of warm compresses on reduction of third- and fourth-degree tears (risk ratio (RR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.84 (two studies, 1525 women)). There was also a significant effect towards favouring massage versus hands off to reduce third- and fourth-degree tears (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.94 (two studies, 2147 women)). Hands off (or poised) versus hand on showed no effect on third- and fourth-degree tears, but we observed a significant effect of hands off on reduced rate of episiotomy (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.96 (two studies, 6547 women)).

Authors' Conclusions

The use of warm compresses on the perineum is associated with a decreased occurrence of perineal trauma. The procedure has shown to be acceptable to women and midwives. This procedure may therefore be offered to women.

### Perineal care [^113Rx5uE]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over 85% of women having a vaginal birth suffer some perineal trauma. Spontaneous tears requiring suturing are estimated to occur in at least a third of women in the UK and US, with anal sphincter tears in 0.5% to 7% of women. Perineal trauma can lead to long-term physical and psychological problems.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of intrapartum surgical and non-surgical interventions on rates of perineal trauma? What are the effects of different methods and materials for primary repair of first- and second-degree tears and episiotomies? What are the effects of different methods and materials for primary repair of obstetric anal sphincter injuries (third- and fourth-degree tears)? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 38 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: active pushing, spontaneous pushing, and sustained breath-holding (Valsalva) method of pushing; continuous support during labour; conventional suturing; different methods and materials for primary repair of obstetric anal sphincter injuries; episiotomies (midline and mediolateral incisions); epidural analgesia; forceps; methods of delivery ("hands-on" method, "hands poised"); water births; non-suturing of muscle and skin (or perineal skin alone); passive descent in the second stage of labour; positions (supine or lithotomy positions, upright position during delivery); restrictive or routine use of episiotomy; sutures (absorbable synthetic sutures, catgut sutures, continuous sutures, interrupted sutures); and vacuum extraction.

### Do women with prior obstetrical anal sphincter injury regret having a subsequent vaginal delivery? [^1142vNgv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 115 women were identified as eligible and mailed the questionnaire. Of these, 65 women did not respond or were excluded for incomplete data, leaving 50 women from whom data were collected and analyzed. Average age of respondents was 38.4 ± 3.8 years, 95.9% were Caucasian, median parity was 2, and average time since most recent delivery was 6.1 ± 2.4 years.

All women had an OASIS with the incident delivery; 82% (41/50) had a third-degree laceration and 18% (9/50) had a fourth-degree laceration. For their subsequent delivery, 82% (n = 41) opted for a repeat VD, 16% (n = 8) had a planned cesarean delivery (CD), and 2% (n = 1) had an unplanned CD. All of the planned CDs were scheduled to minimize any additional pelvic floor injury. Figure 1 demonstrates the frequency of perineal laceration types in the incident and subsequent deliveries. Of the 41 women with a subsequent VD, 61% (25/41) had a second-degree laceration and 4.9% (2/41) had a recurrent OASIS. There were no repeat fourth-degree lacerations, although 4/9 women who had a fourth-degree laceration in the incident delivery opted for a CD for their subsequent delivery.

### Nurse-midwives' ability to diagnose acute third-and fourth-degree obstetric lacerations in Western Kenya [^1119Vcf1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Twenty-two of the 22 (100%) nurse-midwife Maternal Health Trainers, from the seven sub-counties of Siaya County who attended a one-day maternal health-training program in September of 2015, agreed to participate in the assessment. Twelve (54.5%) of the 22 Maternal Health Trainers were female, the mean years of post-graduate clinical experience was 16.0 (range 1–28), and the mean number of deliveries attended per Maternal Health Trainer in the month immediately prior to the survey was 17.6 (range 0–77) (Table 1). Six participants did not respond to the question regarding post-training experience.

Table 1
Participant Demographics

Fourteen (63.6%) Maternal Health Trainers reported having received training in visual and manual evaluation to identify first- and second-degree obstetric lacerations, while only four of the 22 (18.2%) had received training on evaluating for third- and fourth-degree obstetric lacerations. Two of the 22 (9.1%) respondents reported routinely performing rectal exams to evaluate the perineum following delivery (Table 2). None of the participants felt comfortable with repairing OASIS.

Table 2
Participants' experience with third- and fourth-degree obstetric lacerations

Fifteen of 22 (68.2%) respondents described that the mean distance to a referral center where an obstetric laceration repair could be performed was 25.3 (range 10–50) kilometers. Twelve of 20 (60%) respondents reported having a system for follow-up after referral for OASIS repair (Table 2). Twenty of 22 participants (90.9%) reported other health systems barriers to perineal tear diagnosis; under-staffing, heavy workloads, inadequate supplies, deliveries occurring at night, and inadequate light sources all contributed to making evaluation of the perineum difficult following delivery (Table 3).

Table 3
Participant scores on pictorial laceration assessment

The 22 Maternal Health Trainers correctly identified third- or fourth- degree obstetric lacerations in a mean of 5.6 out of eight (69.9%) OASIS images presented in the pictorial assessment. A mean of 1.6 of five (26.4%) depictions of the anus and anal sphincter complex were correctly identified and only a mean of 0.5 of five (10.9%) muscles of the perineum were identified correctly in the assessment. (Table 3).

### Duration of second stage of labor and instrumental delivery as risk factors for severe perineal lacerations: population-based study [^116oNbcm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

We sought to investigate the impact of the duration of second stage of labor on risk of severe perineal lacerations (third and fourth degree).

Methods

This population based cohort study was conducted in the Stockholm/Gotland region, Sweden, 2008–2014. Study population included 52 211 primiparous women undergoing vaginal delivery with cephalic presentation at term. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR), using 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main exposure was duration of second stage of labor, and main outcome was risks of severe perineal lacerations (third and fourth degree).

Results

Risk of severe perineal lacerations increased with duration of second stage of labor. Compared with a second stage of labor of 1 h or less, women with a second stage of more than 2 h had an increased risk (aOR 1.42; 95% CI 1.28–1.58). Compared with non-instrumental vaginal deliveries, the risk was elevated among instrumental vaginal deliveries (aOR 2.24; 95% CI 2.07–2.42). The risk of perineal laceration increased with duration of second stage of labor until less than 3 h in both instrumental and non-instrumental vaginal deliveries, but after 3 h, the ORs did not further increase. After adjustments for potential confounders, macrosomia (birth weight > 4 500 g) and occiput posterior fetal position were risk factors of severe perineal lacerations.

Conclusions

The risk of severe perineal laceration increases with duration until the third hour of second stage of labor. Instrumental delivery is the most significant risk factor for severe lacerations, followed by duration of second stage of labor, fetal size and occiput posterior fetal position.

### The prevention of perineal trauma during vaginal birth [^111gNJaq]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Perineal trauma after vaginal birth is common, with approximately 9 of 10 women being affected. Second-degree perineal tears are twice as likely to occur in primiparous births, with a incidence of 40%. The incidence of obstetrical anal sphincter injury is approximately 3%, with a significantly higher rate in primiparous than in multiparous women (6% vs 2%). Obstetrical anal sphincter injury is a significant risk factor for the development of anal incontinence, with approximately 10% of women developing symptoms within a year following vaginal birth. Obstetrical anal sphincter injuries have significant medicolegal implications and contribute greatly to healthcare costs. For example, in 2013 and 2014, the economic burden of obstetrical anal sphincter injuries in the United Kingdom ranged between £3.7 million (with assisted vaginal birth) and £9.8 million (with spontaneous vaginal birth). In the United States, complications associated with trauma to the perineum incurred costs of approximately $83 million between 2007 and 2011. It is therefore crucial to focus on improvements in clinical care to reduce this risk and minimize the development of perineal trauma, particularly obstetrical anal sphincter injuries. Identification of risk factors allows modification of obstetrical practice with the aim of reducing the rate of perineal trauma and its attendant associated morbidity. Risk factors associated with second-degree perineal trauma include increased fetal birthweight, operative vaginal birth, prolonged second stage of labor, maternal birth position, and advanced maternal age. With obstetrical anal sphincter injury, risk factors include induction of labor, augmentation of labor, epidural, increased fetal birthweight, fetal malposition (occiput posterior), midline episiotomy, operative vaginal birth, Asian ethnicity, and primiparity. Obstetrical practice can be modified both antenatally and intrapartum. The evidence suggests that in the antenatal period, perineal massage can be commenced in the third trimester of pregnancy to increase muscle elasticity and allow stretching of the perineum during birth, thereby reducing the risk of tearing or need for episiotomy. With regard to the intrapartum period, there is a growing body of evidence from the United Kingdom, Norway, and Denmark suggesting that the implementation of quality improvement initiatives including the training of clinicians in manual perineal protection and mediolateral episiotomy can reduce the incidence of obstetrical anal sphincter injury. With episiotomy, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics recommends restrictive rather than routine use of episiotomy. This is particularly the case with unassisted vaginal births. However, there is a role for episiotomy, specifically mediolateral or lateral, with assisted vaginal births. This is specifically the case with nulliparous vacuum and forceps births, given that the use of mediolateral or lateral episiotomy has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of obstetrical anal sphincter injury in these groups by 43% and 68%, respectively. However, the complications associated with episiotomy including perineal pain, dyspareunia, and sexual dysfunction should be acknowledged. Despite considerable research, interventions for reducing the risk of perineal trauma remain a subject of controversy. In this review article, we present the available data on the prevention of perineal trauma by describing the risk factors associated with perineal trauma and interventions that can be implemented to prevent perineal trauma, in particular obstetrical anal sphincter injury.

### Duration of second stage of labor and instrumental delivery as risk factors for severe perineal lacerations: population-based study [^114ZCDbp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Among 52 211 primiparous mothers with singleton vaginal deliveries and information on the second stage of labor, 4 050 (7.8%) had third- or fourth- degree perineal lacerations.

Table 1 presents the proportion of severe perineal lacerations according to maternal, delivery, and infant characteristics. The rates of perineal lacerations increased from 5.3 to 12.2% with increasing duration of second stage of labor. Rates of perineal lacerations generally increased with maternal age, gestational age and with short maternal stature. Compared to smokers, non-smokers had higher rates of perineal lacerations. The rates of severe perineal lacerations in women with vaginal instrumental and vaginal non-instrumental deliveries were 15.3% and 6.0%, respectively. Vacuum extraction was the most common method used in 3 940 deliveries while forceps were used in 110 (2.7%) instrumental deliveries. Occiput posterior position, a high birth weight and a large head circumference were also associated with increased rates of perineal lacerations (13.8%, 20.9% and 11.4% respectively).

Rates by mode of delivery are presented graphically in Table 1. In instrumental vaginal deliveries, rates of severe perineal lacerations were much higher at each time point than in spontaneous vaginal deliveries. In both groups, the rates remained about the same beyond the third hour.

When we calculated the risk of third and fourth degree lacerations depending on mode of vaginal delivery, we adjusted for duration of second stage of labor, maternal age, BMI, maternal height, cohabitation, smoking, epidural analgesia, oxytocin augmentation, induction of labor, gestational age, episiotomy, occiput posterior position, head circumference and birth weight. The aOR for instrumental deliveries was 2.24, 95% CI 2.07–2.42 (crude OR 2.87, 95% CI 2.68–3.07).

### Impact of peripartum antibiotics on wound complications in women with obstetric anal sphincter injury [^11512QdD]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of antibiotics on preventing wound complications following obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASI).

Methods

This is a cohort study with retrospective and prospective components of women who sustained an OASI at vaginal delivery. The primary objective of this study was to assess the impact of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of delivery on perineal wound complications. Women were grouped based on peripartum antibiotic administration: no antibiotics (NABX), antibiotics for OASI wound complication prophylaxis (PABX), antibiotics for therapeutic indications (TABX), and antibiotics for any indication (AABX, PABX+TABX).

Results

Four hundred and twenty-five women with OASI were included in this analysis. Most women experienced a third-degree perineal laceration (358, 84.2%). One hundred and sixteen (27.3%) women received NABX, 195 (45.9%) women received PABX, and 114 (26.8%) women received TABX. Cefazolin was the most common antibiotic in the PABX group. Perineal wound complications occurred in 51 (12.0%) women: 14 (12.4%) in NABX, 26 (13.3%) in PABX, 11 (9.6%) in TABX, and 37 (12.0%) in AABX. The incidence of perineal wound complications did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, peripartum antibiotics did not reduce wound complication incidence following OASI. It is likely that a first-generation cephalosporin is not the ideal antibiotic in this clinical setting.

### Forceps compared with vacuum: rates of neonatal and maternal morbidity [^113JEBY9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare perinatal outcomes between forceps- and vacuum-assisted deliveries. Our hypothesis was that the force vectors achieved in forceps delivery will lead to fewer shoulder dystocias, but greater perineal lacerations.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of 4,120 term, cephalic, singleton, nonrotational operative vaginal deliveries at a single institution. Outcomes examined included rates of neonatal trauma, shoulder dystocia, and perineal lacerations. Potential confounders, including maternal age, birthweight, ethnicity, parity, station at delivery, episiotomy, attending physician, anesthesia, and length of labor, were controlled for using multivariate logistic regression.

Results

Among the 2,075 (50.4%) forceps- and 2,045 (49.6%) vacuum-assisted deliveries, the rate of shoulder dystocia was lower among women undergoing forceps delivery (1.5% compared with 3.5%, P < .001), as was the rate of cephalohematoma (4.5% compared with 14.8%, P < .001), whereas the rate of third- or fourth-degree perineal laceration was higher (36.9% compared with 26.8%, P < .001). These differences in perinatal complications persisted when controlling for the confounders listed above. The adjusted odds ratio for shoulder dystocia was 0.34 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20–0.57), for cephalohematoma was 0.25 (95% CI 0.19–0.33), and for third- or fourth-degree lacerations was 1.79 (95% CI 1.52–2.10) when comparing forceps to vacuum.

Conclusion

Vacuum-assisted vaginal birth is more often associated with shoulder dystocia and cephalohematoma. Forceps delivery is more often associated with third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations. These differences in complications rates should be considered among other factors when determining the optimal mode of delivery.

### Perineal techniques during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma and postpartum complications [^1143i6LM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Rationale

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is responsible for around 27% of global maternal deaths. Perineal tears are common in vaginal births and a significant contributor to excessive blood loss. A diversity of perineal techniques are utilised to prevent perineal trauma and reduce the incidence of PPH; however, they lack evidence‐based comparisons to understand their effects.

Objectives

To assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence of and morbidity associated with perineal trauma to prevent postpartum complications.

Search methods

We searched four databases and two trial registers up to 16 April 2024. We checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of women in the second stage of labour who intended to give birth vaginally, comparing any perineal techniques with control or another perineal technique. We excluded studies that performed perineal techniques outside the second stage of labour.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were second‐, third‐ and fourth‐degree tears measured immediately after birth, and PPH ≥ 500 mL measured within 24 hours after birth.

Risk of bias

We used the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool to assess bias in the included RCTs.

Synthesis methods

We synthesised results for each outcome within each comparison using meta‐analysis where possible. Where this was not possible due to the nature of the data, we synthesised results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Included studies

We included a total of 17 studies with 13,695 participants.

Synthesis of results

Hands off (or poised) versus hands on

Hands off (poised) may result in little to no difference in second‐degree tears (risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 1.64; 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence) and third‐ or fourth‐degree tears when data are combined (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.99; 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of hands off (poised) on third‐degree tears and fourth‐degree tears when reported separately (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.27; 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence and RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 71.22; 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence).

Hands off (poised) may result in little to no difference in PPH ≥ 500 mL (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.47; 1 study; low‐certainty evidence).

Hands off (poised) probably results in little to no difference in breastfeeding two days after birth (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.06; 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence) and perineal pain (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.01; 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Vocalisation versus control

Vocalisation may result in a reduction in second‐degree tears (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.38; 1 study; low‐certainty evidence) and third‐degree tears (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.32; 1 study; low‐certainty evidence), but the CIs are wide and include the possibility of no effect. No events were reported for fourth‐degree tears (low‐certainty evidence).

Vocalisation may increase maternal satisfaction (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.51; 1 study; low‐certainty evidence).

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of vocalisation on perineal pain (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.58; 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence).

Warm compress on the perineum versus control (hands off or no warm compress)

Warm compress on the perineum may result in little to no difference in second‐degree tears (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.21; 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence), but likely results in a reduction in third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.79; 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). Evidence from two smaller studies is very uncertain about the effect of warm compress on the perineum on third‐degree tears (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.04 to 7.05; 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence) or fourth‐degree tears (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.06; 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence) when reported separately.

Warm compress likely results in a large reduction in perineal pain (mean difference (MD) ‐0.81, 95% CI ‐1.18 to ‐0.44; 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence).

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of warm compress on the perineum on maternal satisfaction and PPH ≥ 500 mL.

Massage of the perineum versus control (hands off or no usual care)

Massage of the perineum may have little to no effect on second‐degree tears (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; 4 studies; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of massage of the perineum on third‐degree tears (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.02; 4 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). Massage of the perineum may reduce fourth‐degree tears but the CIs are wide and include the possibility of no effect (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.61; 4 studies; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that massage likely results in little to no difference in perineal pain (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90, 1.05; 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence).

One study reported 10 participants with postpartum haemorrhage across three interventions (warm compress, massage, control).

Combined warm compress and massage of the perineum versus control

Combined warm compress and massage of the perineum likely results in a reduction in second‐degree tears when compared to a control (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.86; 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on third‐degree tears (RR 2.92, 95% CI 0.12 to 70.72; 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence).

The intervention may result in a reduction in PPH ≥ 500 mL but the CIs are wide and include the possibility of no effect (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.35; 1 study; low‐certainty evidence).

Combined warm compress and massage likely results in an increase in maternal satisfaction (MD 0.4, 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.81; 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Combined warm compress and massage of the perineum versus massage alone

Combined warm compress and massage of the perineum may result in little to no difference in second‐degree tears (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06; 1 study; low‐certainty evidence) when compared to massage alone, but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.49; 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence).

It may also result in little to no difference in PPH ≥ 500 mL (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.07; 1 study; low‐certainty evidence).

The evidence suggests that combined warm compress and massage may result in little to no difference in maternal satisfaction (1 study; low‐certainty evidence).

Other perineal techniques

We also assessed evidence on the following comparisons, but since they are used less frequently in global clinical practice to optimise birth outcomes, we have not presented the results summary here: Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care; primary delivery of posterior versus anterior shoulder; massage with enriched oil on the perineum versus massage with liquid wax; petroleum jelly on the perineum versus control; and perineal protection device versus control.

Authors' conclusions

Overall, the evidence for the effectiveness of perineal techniques to reduce perineal trauma and postpartum haemorrhage is very uncertain.

Very few studies reported rates of postpartum haemorrhage, adverse events, women's or health workers' experience or other important outcomes that allow us to understand the effectiveness and acceptability of perineal techniques to reduce perineal trauma. Prior to any further large trials, research is needed to clarify the types of interventions, including a clear description of the process of development and involvement of relevant stakeholders. There is a need to clarify how the intervention is proposed to achieve its effects. Trials would benefit from process evaluation alongside, to explore context, mechanisms and effects.

### Third-and fourth-degree perineal tears, management (green-top guideline no. 29) [^114iTXy1]. RCOG (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for obstetric anal sphincter injury, more specifically with respect to surgical repair, indications and setting of surgery, RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend to perform repair of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears in an operating theater under regional or general anesthesia, ensuring good lighting and appropriate instruments. Insert a vaginal pack if excessive bleeding occurs and transfer the patient to the theater promptly. Consider performing repair of obstetric anal sphincter injuries in the delivery room under certain circumstances after discussion with a senior obstetrician.

### Development and validation of a protocol for documentation of obstetric perineal lacerations [^111FArob]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

We studied the documentation for 187 women, which is a sufficient number to make a statistical comparison of the documentation methods except for third- and fourth-degree perineal tears, where the numbers were too small to compare with statistical methods. The fact that no power calculation was made when planning the study is a limitation. A considerably larger study sample would be required to achieve the power to compare the documentation methods regarding third- and fourth-degree perineal tears, but that was judged not feasible within a reasonable period of time. The study only includes one obstetric unit, which possibly limits the external validity; however, we have no specific reason to believe that the result would change if we repeated the study in another obstetric unit. The fact that documentation was made by the same person in both ObstetriX and the new documentation protocol for each woman indicates that the differences observed are due to the different configurations of the protocols and are not random.

There was a loss of 87 women who were eligible for the study but for unknown reasons were not included. It is possible that in many cases the reason for non-inclusion was that the midwife or obstetrician was not aware of the study; however, it is hard to completely rule out any form of selection bias.

We found that the new documentation protocol had better coverage in terms of information on perineal lacerations. This might because this protocol specifically asks if there was a perineal laceration and, if so, what degree of perineal laceration there was. Conversely, in ObstetriX, accessible information about the degree of perineal laceration is only generated if the documentation protocol "Suturing of delivery-related injury" is used, which was only the case if the laceration was sutured by an obstetrician rather than a midwife. Since the majority of second-degree perineal lacerations are sutured by midwives, no diagnosis is registered in those cases. The documentation protocol of ObstetriX only includes classification into second-, third-, and fourth-degree perineal tears, but not first-degree perineal tear, so there is no information about these lacerations in ObstetriX.

### National trends of episiotomy in non-instrumental vaginal deliveries (2013–2022): a multi-data source approach [^116aMX8E]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Episiotomy and obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) are recognized indicators of intrapartum care quality. The aim of this study was to assess episiotomy trends in non-instrumental vaginal deliveries across all Portuguese public maternities over the last decade. Rates of third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations were also evaluated.

Methods

A retrospective secondary data analysis was conducted using data from an official national health entity, including all non-instrumental vaginal deliveries in the Portuguese National Health Service between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2022. Information on episiotomy and third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations was extracted. Descriptive statistics were presented using absolute and relative frequencies. Linear regression was used to assess trends. Additional national databases were consulted to validate findings, and data quality was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A significance level of 5% was considered.

Results

Of 689908 registered deliveries, 490322 (71%) were vaginal, and 361887 (52%) were non-instrumental vaginal deliveries. Among the latter, the episiotomy rate was 42.5%. A significant decrease was observed in episiotomy rates, from 63% in 2013 to 21% in 2022, (P < 0.001), accompanied by a significant increase in third-degree perineal lacerations (0.15% to 0.31%, P < 0.001), while fourth-degree perineal lacerations remained stable (0.03% to 0.02%, P = 0.001).

Conclusion

A restrictive episiotomy policy was increasingly adopted in Portugal over the last decade. Although rare, third-degree perineal lacerations increased during this period. Further research is needed to determine optimal intrapartum care practices regarding episiotomy use. Standardized data coding and improved access to anonymized national datasets are essential for accurate monitoring and cross-country comparability.

### Effects of manual perineal protection and pushing techniques used in the second stage of labor on perineal outcomes: a randomized controlled trial of combinations of strategies [^113opJYM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study was conducted to compare the effects of combinations of manual perineal protection and pushing techniques in terms of perineal outcomes in nulliparous women. The frequency of episiotomy was greater in the coached pushing & hands-on manual perineal protection group, and the frequency of first-degree lacerations was greater in the uncoached pushing & hands-poised manual perineal protection group. The frequencies of second-, third-, and fourth-degree perineal lacerations and an intact perineum were similar between the groups. This was the first randomized controlled trial to examine the combined effects of second-stage hands-on, hands-poised and coached, uncoached-pushing approaches on episiotomy and perineal injury. Despite several studies on these techniques, the likelihood of the techniques being applied separately in practice is low.

The primary outcomes of the study related to episiotomy and perineal laceration were similar to those of Lee's retrospective cross-sectional study. Lee reported that the HO-CP combination was not associated with a reduced risk of moderate-to-severe perineal injury compared with the HP-UCP combination in nulliparous women. The use of the HO-CP approach in multiparous women was associated with a significant increase in the risk of moderate and severe perineal injuries. Multiparous pregnant women were not included in this study. In a preliminary study, which inspired subsequent research on manual perineal protection, McCandlish et al. (1998) reported a similar frequency of perineal trauma between the HO and HP techniques and a lower frequency of episiotomy in the HP group. In their study, most women delivered in the semirecumbent/lithotomy position. However, information on pushing management was not available. The results of the present study were similar to those of the pioneering study. Following this pioneering study, many studies with different results on manual perineal protection and systematic analyses of these studies were conducted. A Cochrane review by Aasheim et al. (2017) reported that the hands-off technique reduced the frequency of episiotomy. Meta-analyses by Bulchandani et al. (2015), Aasheim et al. (2017), Pierce-Williams et al. (2019), and Huang et al. (2020) reported similar perineal trauma frequencies for hands-off, hands-poised and hands-on techniques.

### Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other delivery trauma: a US national survey of obstetrician-gynecologists [^1155SGgL]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Obstetric lacerations complicate the majority of deliveries. The application of standardized guidelines for assessing delivery trauma has not been assessed thoroughly in the United States. We recently identified gaps in US midwives' clinical assessment of delivery trauma. We conducted a cross-sectional national survey of practicing obstetricians in the United States to characterize their classification of obstetric lacerations. We hypothesized that attending obstetricians' identification and diagnosis of delivery trauma would be similar to our findings for midwives with frequent inaccuracy.

Methods

We recruited clinically active obstetricians through the Pregnancy-Related Care Research Network. We asked participants to classify (from written definitions) and diagnose (from standard illustrations) common forms of vaginal delivery trauma using the widely employed perineal laceration degree system. We performed bivariate analysis of high- and low-scoring respondents and logistic regression to model characteristics associated with higher diagnostic accuracy.

Results

Of the 162 respondents who started the survey, 76% (123) were included for analysis (22% of solicited emails). Overall, we found wide variation in response accuracy with as few as 62% of respondents correctly classifying certain types of lacerations. Only 49 out of 123 (40%) use the Sultan third-degree subclassification system and 67 out of 123 (52%) continue to use the midline/median approach for episiotomies. Providers reporting fewer deliveries per month and fewer publicly insured patients earned higher scores.

Conclusions

Obstetricians in a nationally representative US perinatal provider network inconsistently identify perineal and nonperineal lacerations. We found important clinical knowledge gaps, suggesting that vaginal delivery diagnoses in obstetric quality studies and pelvic floor research might be inaccurate.

### Factors affecting follow-up for specialty postpartum care after obstetric anal sphincter injury at a single U.S. institution [^112kWBAx]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the electronic medical records (EMRs) at a single institution in the United States from January 2018 to December 2023. This study met the criteria for IRB review exemption authorized by 45 CFR 46.104, category 2. Patients who sustained third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations during a vaginal delivery were identified based on Delivery Report data during the study period. Demographic data were extracted from the medical records, including age, self-identified race and ethnicity, primary language spoken at home, parity, and insurance type. We extracted the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) score, which is routinely assessed in all birthing people prior to hospital discharge. The EPDS is a widely used validated screening tool for postpartum depression. It is a self-reported ten-item scale, with scores that range from 0 to 30, with a score ≥ 10 indicating an increased risk for depression. Obstetric data extracted from the delivery summary or delivery note included the gestational age at delivery, delivery method, performance of an episiotomy, birthweight, and the presence of an OASI. OASIS are classified using standard definitions based on the amount of anal sphincter injury. Third-degree lacerations indicate injury to the anal sphincter complex and are subclassified into 3a (a tear of less than 50% of the external anal sphincter [EAS]), 3b (a tear of more than 50% of the EAS), and 3c (a tear of the EAS and the internal anal sphincter [IAS]). A fourth-degree perineal laceration is a laceration involving both the EAS and IAS as well as the anal epithelium.

### Pregnancy in women with prior treatments for pelvic floor disorders [^112xY8Pr]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI) — risk of recurrence and predictors in subsequent pregnancy are described as follows: reported recurrence rates range "between 4% and 10%", with the "odds ratio for repeat OASI was 4.2% in women with 1 prior delivery with OASIs", and in those with "2 prior OASIs, the risk of repeat injury in a third delivery was 10.6%", with another study finding prior OASI "increases the risk of repeat injury in a subsequent delivery by 10-fold". Recurrence risk is higher after a prior fourth-degree laceration compared with third-degree (7.7% vs 4.7%). A meta-analysis identified predictors including "operative vaginal delivery (forceps and vacuum)", "large for gestational age fetus (> 4 kg)", "shoulder dystocia", and "prior fourth degree laceration", and noted "Maternal age of younger than 35 years" marginally increased recurrence risk. In a vaginally delivered cohort of "82 women, 12% of which resulted in a recurrent OASI. None of these women developed fecal incontinence", whereas others suggested women with "2 prior OASIs have a nearly 70% risk of long-term anal incontinence". A "2014 Cochrane review concluded that risk of repeat OASI could be reduced" by measures including "antenatal pelvic floor muscle strengthening", "perineal massage or creams", earlier induction of labor, "elective caesarean section", "vacuum extraction as opposed to forceps", and "selective episiotomy".

### No episiotomy versus selective lateral / mediolateral episiotomy (EPITRIAL): an interim analysis [^113SSf5K]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The objective of this trial was to evaluate whether avoiding episiotomy can decrease the risk of advanced perineal tears.

Material and Methods

In this randomized (1:1) parallel-group superiority trial, primiparous women underwent randomization into standard care (155 cases) vs. no episiotomy (154 cases) groups. The primary endpoint was the incidence of advanced (3rd- and 4th-degree) perineal tears. Secondary outcomes included perineal integrity, suturing characteristics, second-stage duration, incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, neonatal variables, and various postpartum symptoms 2 days and 2 months after delivery.

Results

At prespecified 1-year interim analysis, the groups did not differ in terms of baseline demographic and obstetric characteristics. Six advanced perineal tears (3.9%) were diagnosed in the standard care group vs. two in no episiotomy group (1.3%), yielding a calculated odds ratio (OR) of 0.33 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06–1.65). Unexpectedly, rates of episiotomy performance also did not significantly vary between groups: 26.5% (41 cases) vs. 21.4% (33 cases), respectively, p = 0.35. No significant differences were noted in any secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

No difference in the rates of advanced perineal tears was found between groups; however, the main limitation of our study was unexpectedly high rates of episiotomy in the nonepisiotomy group. Thus, the main conclusion is that investigator monitoring and education should be continuously practiced throughout the trial duration, stressing the importance of adherence to the protocol.

### Postpartum urinary incontinence and birth outcomes as a result of the pushing technique: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QKvup]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The duration of the second stage of labor was significantly shorter by 18.25 min in the directed pushing group compared with the spontaneous pushing group. Notably, the maternal delivery position greatly affects the duration of the second stage of labor and pushing. Specifically, the recumbent (horizontal) position makes it difficult to utilize gravity and could prolong the duration of the second stage of labor. The upright position makes it easy to exploit gravity and tends to shorten the duration of the second stage of labor. Therefore, subgroup analysis by maternal delivery position is required. The subgroup analysis showed that the duration of the second stage of labor for the spontaneous pushing group in the recumbent position was significantly longer by 21.39 min compared with that in the directed pushing group. However, the duration of the second stage of labor when women were in the upright position was not significantly different between both pushing groups. According to the results, spontaneous pushing in the upright position could help fetal descent and avoid too strong pushing.

When identifying disorders of the pelvic floor muscles, it is necessary to also consider the maternal delivery position in the future. Spontaneous pushing results in no suturing, as well as no significant difference in urinary incontinence or third- or fourth-degree laceration. Gupta et al. compared the occurrence of third- or fourth-degree laceration between the upright position and the horizontal positions of women in the second stage of labor. They found no difference in the number of third- or fourth-degree perineal lacerations between women laboring in the upright and recumbent positions.

The results showed that spontaneous pushing does not cause stress to the perineum as the fetus slowly descends during the second stage of labor. Even though fetal descending takes time, it can be inferred that it does not cause any serious effects to the PFMs.

### Obstetric anal sphincter injury care bundle: a quality improvement initiative [^112mVFaL]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obstetric lacerations occur in 75% of vaginal deliveries and damage to the anal sphincter complex occurs in approximately 6–7% of these. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) may increase the risk of OASIS in subsequent deliveries, result in loss of bowel control, and negatively affect quality of life. Furthermore, they have an effect on post-partum recovery, mental health, and choices about future deliveries. OASIS are tracked as a National Quality Indicator for obstetric care (National Quality Forum #0748). Risk factors for OASIS (operative delivery, episiotomy, increased fetal birthweight, labor induction/augmentation, persistent occiput posterior fetal position, and primiparity) are not universally modifiable for prevention. However, there are opportunities for optimizing OASIS recognition, repair and post-partum care to achieve the best possible outcomes. Unfortunately, there is a lack of guidelines or complete consensus on which are the most important elements of peri-partum OASIS care. Wound infection or breakdown is common following OASIS and risk is mitigated by administering appropriate preoperative antibiotics (second-generation cephalosporin). Further, these complications most often present within 2 weeks after delivery. Many guidelines suggest surgical repair in an operating room given the importance of adequate lighting, anesthesia, and appropriate instruments in achieving excellent anatomical and functional repair. Although long-term outcomes with regard to continence, prolapse, and pelvic floor function are difficult to study and quantify after OASIS, it is clear that preventing infection, breakdown, and reoperation may contribute to mitigating these undesirable outcomes.

### Active delivery of the anterior arm and incidence of second-degree perineal tears: a clinical practice evaluation [^113qTcdg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

Couder maneuver in primiparous women at term is feasible with a low failure rate and influences the distribution of perineal tears by lowering second-degree perineal tear in a highly significant manner (p < 0.01). In our series, there were three times less second-degree perineal lesions in the patients who were exposed to this maneuver. These avoided lesions became instead first-degree perineal trauma or intact perineum. Although our study did not show any significant differences in the rates of intact perineums between the two groups, our exposed group's rate of 20.8% was much higher than the 9.6% reported in a 2013 study in nulliparas. Again, suturing such slightly damaged perineum can be discussed in the interest of optimizing the perineal comfort of patients. Several studies show that not suturing the skin reduces perineal pain and dyspareunia, without increasing the risk of the wound's reopening. No third- or fourth-degree perineal tears were observed during this study, which is in line with the very low rate in our department – respectively, 4% and 2% based on our 2010 study. There was no significant difference in the rate of anterior perineal lesions in the two groups (p = 0.33).

This maneuver does not aim to overmedicalize childbirth. It should be assimilated as a continuation of the maneuver of lowering the fetal head and aiding the natural movement of restitution. Indeed, in the lithotomy birthing position, and unlike the lateral or upright positions, in which the posterior shoulder is delivered first, it is the manual assistance of the movement of restitution, which, by tensing the sternocleidomastoid muscle, leads to the delivery of the anterior shoulder, first. CM is simply the logical continuation of managing this anterior upper limb by completely lowering it under the pubic symphysis. Lowering the anterior arm in a calm and controlled fashion does not in any way delay fetal expulsion. The fetal head must be delivered carefully to manage the perineum as to avoid severe perineal trauma, but carefully managing delivery of the shoulders also contributes to reducing lesions.

### Pregnancy in women with prior treatments for pelvic floor disorders [^115v3c6m]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI) — classification and recurrence: a third-degree perineal laceration involves the anal sphincter complex and is divided into 3a, 3b, and 3c; in 3a less than 50% of the external anal sphincter is torn, in 3b more than 50%, and 3c involves damage to both the external and internal anal sphincter; a fourth-degree laceration involves the anal sphincter complex (internal and external) and the anal mucosa. Some researchers group severity as lower grade or minor tears (3a and 3b) versus higher grade or major tears (3c and 4). Reported overall recurrence rates in subsequent pregnancies range from 4.5% to 13.4%.

### Development and validation of a protocol for documentation of obstetric perineal lacerations [^116fEpr1]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

The new documentation protocol appears to diagnose second-degree perineal tears to a greater extent than ObstetriX. The current Swedish documentation method might systematically underestimate second-degree perineal lacerations, which is unfortunate given the increasing research interest in these lacerations. Second-degree perineal lacerations might cause future morbidity if not sutured correctly or if complicated, for example, by an infection. Additionally, second-degree perineal tears might hide an occult sphincter rupture, which is another reason why these lacerations merit further attention. Overall, the two documentation methods appear to have acceptable agreement on diagnosis of third-degree perineal lacerations; however, we refrained from calculating agreement and testing for statistically significant differences regarding these lacerations, as the numbers of cases were too small.

Overall, the agreement is good between the two documentation methods regarding labial tears, vaginal rupture, and episiotomy. The two documentation methods seem to give equally comprehensive information about labial lacerations. In the documentation protocol, labial tears are specified as those requiring suturing, which is not the case in ObstetriX. To some extent, this might explain the cases where ObstetriX and the new documentation protocol disagree. In the case of vaginal rupture and episiotomy, the new documentation protocol gives more information than ObstetriX. This may be because the new protocol focuses more specifically on the perineal and vaginal trauma that has occurred compared with the protocol "Delivery care 1" in ObstetriX.

One could expect that the information obtained from a documentation protocol that asks specific and detailed questions about obstetric perineal trauma would be even more complete than this study showed. The fact that the new documentation protocol was filled in on a physical sheet of paper might partly explain this. A computerized documentation protocol with mandatory questions that cannot be signed before all necessary tick boxes are filled in would increase coverage of information even more.

To our knowledge, a validated protocol for documentation of obstetric perineal laceration in a research context has been lacking. In the present study, we have developed and validated a new documentation protocol which has proved to be suitable for scientific purposes. The current Swedish documentation method, on the other hand, appears to systematically underestimate the incidence of second-degree perineal tears. The increasing demand for health care organizations to follow up quality of care makes this new protocol useful to implement in future obstetric record systems.

### Persistent postpartum pain – A somatic and psychologic perfect storm [^113fbvyS]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Operative Interventions

While spontaneous lacerations are associated with higher rates of perineal pain at two to twelve months compared to those with an intact perineum, episiotomy has an even greater association with persistent perineal pain at three months. However, this may be due to the relationship between episiotomy and third and fourth degree lacerations. Other research has confirmed the relationship between obstetric sphincter injury and perineal PPP. Amongst primiparous individuals, dyspareunia at six months has also been associated with degree of obstetric laceration by some investigators but not others.

Nulliparous patients report higher perineal pain at six weeks postpartum even after adjusting for degree of perineal trauma, as well as sexual problems at eight and sixteen weeks postpartum.

Even when controlling for parity, length of labor and perineal trauma, operative VD has been found to be associated with perineal pain. Similarly, when controlling for length of labor, degree of perineal trauma and infant birthweight, operative VD is associated with perineal pain at six to seven months postpartum. Operative VD is also associated with dyspareunia at six months even after controlling for other factors such as degree of laceration.

While duration of the second stage of labor has been found to be associated with increased perineal pain at the time of hospital discharge, this association is not present at six weeks or three months post-delivery. Post-vaginal dyspareunia is thought to be due to muscle hypertonicity, scar tenderness, vestibular tenderness, and/or atrophy.

With regard to laceration repair, while continuous suture has been associated with less short-term pain, no difference between interrupted and continuous suture has been shown with respect to long-term pain. Similarly, suture type does not seem to impact rates of long-term perineal pain and dyspareunia.

### Reducing obstetric anal sphincter injuries using perineal support: our preliminary experience [^115iNPxA]. International Urogynecology Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIs) are associated with significant short-term and long-term morbidity. Over the past decade, there has been a steady rise in the rate of OASIs. There is therefore a compelling need to identify strategies to minimize OASIs. The objective of this study was to determine if perineal support at the time of vaginal delivery can reduce the incidence and severity of OASIs.

Methods

All labour ward staff including midwives and doctors were invited to train in the technique of perineal support during vaginal delivery. Two experts from Norway conducted workshops with practical hands-on training on pelvic models. The midwives and doctors underwent further training with women in labour, and mandatory training was continued within the department. All midwives and doctors were instructed to support the perineum during both spontaneous and assisted vaginal delivery.

Results

From April 2011 to November 2014, 11,135 women underwent vaginal delivery. The OASI rate decreased from 4.7% to 4.1% (p = 0.11). There was a significant reduction (0.9% to 0.3%, p < 0.001) in 3c third-degree and fourth-degree tears (major OASIs). In a multivariate analysis, perineal support was associated with a significant reduction in the rates of OASIs (23%; OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63–0.95, p = 0.01]) and major OASIs (71%; OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17–0.69, p = 0.03).

Conclusions

This interventional study showed that perineal support during vaginal delivery can reduce the risk of major OASIs. With sustained reinforcement of this intervention programme, we anticipate a further reduction in OASI rates.

### A multi-centre quality improvement project to reduce the incidence of obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI): study protocol [^113piGyG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Third and fourth degree perineal tears, or obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASI), sustained during childbirth can result in anal incontinence and psychosocial problems which require ongoing treatment. Within the English National Health System (NHS) reported rates of OASI have gradually increased. In response, a care bundle was developed incorporating four elements: 1) antenatal information to women, 2) manual perineal protection during all vaginal births, 3) episiotomy to be performed with a 60° mediolateral angle at crowning (when clinically indicated) and 4) perineal examination (including per rectum) after childbirth. Implementation of the OASI Care Bundle is aided by a skills development module and an awareness campaign. The project is a collaboration between two national professional bodies, an NHS hospital trust and an academic institution.

Methods

Implementation of the OASI Care Bundle will be evaluated using a stepped-wedge design. From January 2017 sixteen maternity units across England, Wales and Scotland will participate in the study over a 15-month period, with sequential roll-out of the intervention in four blocks (regions) of four units. The primary clinical outcome is OASI rate. Regression analysis will adjust for differences in organisational characteristics and obstetric risk factors in women who gave birth before and after implementation of the care bundle. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with clinicians will evaluate the feasibility of integrating the care bundle into routine practice. Interviews with women will explore the acceptability of the intervention.

Discussion

This protocol outlines the evaluation of our quality improvement project which aims to prevent OASI using a bundle of evidence-based interventions that are each widely used in practice. The OASI project aims to 1) standardise practice to prevent OASI in a way that is acceptable to clinicians and women and 2) identify the barriers and enablers associated with upscaling interventions within maternity units. If found to be effective, feasible and acceptable, the OASI Care Bundle will be shared with a range of audiences using the communication channels available to the professional bodies.

Trial registration

The OASI Project was retrospectively registered on thedatabase date assigned 03/10/2017.

### Has the use of routine episiotomy decreased? Examination of episiotomy rates from 1983 to 2000 [^112daeSe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if practice patterns have been altered by the large body of literature strongly advocating the selective use of episiotomy.

Methods

An electronic audit of the medical procedures database at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital from 1983 to 2000 was completed. Univariate and multivariable models were computed using logistic regression models.

Results

Overall episiotomy rates in 34,048 vaginal births showed a significant reduction from 69.6% in 1983 to 19.4% in 2000. Significantly decreased risk of episiotomy was seen based upon year of childbirth (odds ratio [OR] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86, 0.87), black race (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.28, 0.31), and spontaneous vaginal delivery (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.36, 0.45). Increased association with episiotomy was seen in forceps deliveries (OR 4.04, 95% CI 3.46, 4.72), and with third- or fourth-degree lacerations (OR 4.87, 95% CI 4.38, 5.41). In deliveries with known insurance status, having Medicaid insurance was also associated with a decreased episiotomy risk (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.54, 0.64).

Conclusion

There was a statistically significant reduction in the overall episiotomy rate between 1983 and 2000. White women consistently underwent episiotomy more frequently than black women even when controlling for age, parity, insurance status, and operative vaginal delivery.

### Perineal techniques during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma and postpartum complications [^113eBTnF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is commonly defined as a blood loss of 500 mL or more within 24 hours after birth. About 27% of global maternal deaths are attributable to PPH, making PPH the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. While PPH is relatively common — affecting approximately 5% of all births worldwide — most PPH‐related deaths (around 80%) occur in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), primarily in sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia. Most of these deaths could be avoided by using prophylactic uterotonics during the third stage of labour, paired with timely detection and appropriate treatment. Reducing the burden of PPH has important health and equity implications towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets.

Effectively intervening against PPH requires understanding and addressing a range of interrelated clinical and non‐clinical contributing factors. Risk factors include maternal anaemia, grand‐multiparity, prolonged labour and multiple gestation. However, many women presenting with PPH have no identifiable risk factors. Thus, health workers must be prepared to quickly detect and manage excessive bleeding in all births. Uterine atony is the most common cause of PPH; other causes include vaginal and cervical trauma (lacerations or tears), uterine rupture, retained placental tissue and maternal bleeding disorders. Multiple causes of PPH can co‐exist in the same woman, which means healthcare workers must be prepared to detect and treat PPH from all causes in all women giving birth. Appropriate treatment of PPH relies on a combination of medications and clinical interventions, with the ability to rapidly escalate to higher levels of care if the bleeding is unresponsive to initial treatment.

### Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI) in the presence of an intact perineum [^114FPjcY]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Background

At time of vaginal delivery, 65%–85% of women are expected to have some form of obstetric perineal injury. These obstetric injuries are classified from first degree to fourth degree (table 1). Third-degree and fourth-degree tears involve the anal sphincter complex and collectively are known as obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASI) and occur in 4%–9% of mothers delivering vaginally. The incidence of OASI injuries increases with certain risk factors including: nulliparity, maternal age, induction of labour, fetal macrosomia, fetal malposition, occipito-posterior position, compound presentations, a short perineum, Asian ethnicity, prolonged second stage of labour, operative vaginal deliveries (ventouse and forceps) and shoulder dystocia.OASI in the absence of laceration of the perineal skin is a rarely reported and clinically experienced perineal injury. Atypical OASI has been reported previously, though this specific injury identified has never been described before in detail in the literature. OASI results in significant consequences beyond the initial injury: increased recovery time, chronic pain, dyspareunia, sexual dysfunction and anal incontinence. These sequelae can have significant physical, behavioural and psychological consequences, and identifying these injuries early, providing prompt treatment and appropriate follow-up is essential for holistic care of these women. We hope to increase awareness of this unusual presentation of an OASI with intact perineal skin to highlight the importance of careful perineal and rectal examination after any vaginal delivery.

### Hands-and-knees posturing and fetal occiput anterior position: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116nyUZE]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Persistent occiput posterior and occiput transverse positions are associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. The objective of this study was to assess if the use of hands-and-knees posturing increased the rate of occiput anterior position immediately after posturing during the second stage of labor or at the time of birth.

Data Sources

An electronic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed from inception to September 2020.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Eligibility criteria included all randomized controlled trials of singleton gestations at ≥ 36 weeks' gestation that were randomized to either the hands-and-knees posture group or control group. The primary outcome was a composite of occiput anterior positioning during the second stage of labor or at birth. Individual components of the composite were assessed as secondary outcomes. Additional secondary outcomes were a change to occiput anterior position immediately after the intervention, use of regional anesthesia, duration of labor, mode of delivery, third- or fourth-degree perineal laceration, neonatal birthweight, and Apgar score less than 7 at 5 minutes.

Methods

The methodological quality of all the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. A meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model of DerSimmonian and Laird to produce a summary of the treatment effects in terms of relative risk or mean difference with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Of the 1079 studies screened, 5 met the inclusion criteria (n = 1727 hands-and-knees posture vs n = 1641 controls). When compared with the control group, patients who adopted the hands-and-knees posture had the same rate of occiput anterior positioning in the second stage of labor or at birth (81.2% vs 81.2%; relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.92–1.14), as well as immediately after the intervention (34.1% vs 18.0%; relative risk, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.88–2.90). On the basis of the post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with an ultrasound-diagnosed malposition before posturing, there was a higher rate of occiput anterior positioning immediately after the intervention (17.0% vs 10.3%; relative risk, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–2.52), but this relationship did not persist at delivery. The remainder of the subgroup analyses and secondary outcomes were not significant.

Conclusion

Adopting a hands-and-knees posture does not increase the rate of occiput anterior positioning at time of delivery.

### Decreased anal sphincter lacerations associated with restrictive episiotomy use [^115777pz]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether restrictive episiotomy use was associated with decreases in anal sphincter lacerations and the risk of anal sphincter laceration attributable to episiotomy.

Study Design

This was a retrospective database study. Rates of episiotomy, anal sphincter laceration (third- or fourth-degree tear), and other confounding variables were compared among vaginal deliveries before (1999) and after (2002) restrictive episiotomy use was implemented at our institution. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio of anal sphincter laceration that was due to episiotomy and other variables.

Results

The episiotomy rate decreased 56% (37% to 17%, P < .001) between 1999 and 2002, whereas the anal sphincter laceration rate decreased 44% (9.7% to 5.4%, P < .001). There were no changes in age, race, nulliparity, prolonged second stage of labor, operative vaginal deliveries, birth weight, or macrosomia, although oxytocin use and epidural use decreased slightly (37% to 31%, P < .001, and 80% to 76%, P = 0.02, respectively). The adjusted odds ratio of anal sphincter laceration attributable to episiotomy decreased 55%, from 6.5 (95% CI: 3.8, 11.1) to 2.9 (95% CI: 1.7, 5.0), between 1999 and 2002. Conversely, the adjusted odds ratios of anal sphincter laceration attributable to the other independent risk factors all increased or remained the same: operative vaginal delivery, which increased from 4.4 (95% CI: 2.7, 6.9) to 6.3 (95% CI: 3.6 11.1); nulliparity, from 2.9 (95% CI: 1.8, 4.8) to 2.9 (95% CI: 1.4, 5.9); macrosomia, from 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1, 3.4) to 2.6 (95% CI: 1.3, 5.4); and prolonged second stage, from 2.0 (95% CI: 1.3, 3.0) to 2.1 (95% CI: 1.2, 3.7).

Conclusion

With restrictive episiotomy use, the episiotomy rate, anal sphincter laceration rate, and risk of anal sphincter laceration attributable to episiotomy were all reduced by approximately 50%.

### Prophylactic manual rotation of the fetal head (manual rotation alone) to reduce operative delivery and complications for mother and babies [^1164XidR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Manual rotation of the fetal head for women with fetal malpresentation (occipital posterior (OP) or occipital transverse (OT)) is commonly performed to increase the chances of normal vaginal delivery and is perceived to be safe. Prophylactic manual rotation has the potential to prevent operative delivery and caesarean section, and reduce obstetric and neonatal complications. This review updates a previous 2014 Cochrane review.

Objectives

To assess the effect of prophylactic manual rotation compared to no manual rotation for women with malposition in labour on mode of delivery, and maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, three other databases and three trial registries in March 2024. We reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised or cluster-randomised clinical trials comparing prophylactic manual rotation in labour for fetal malposition versus expectant management, augmentation of labour or operative delivery were eligible. Participants included women at term or preterm, (< 37 weeks' gestation) planning a vaginal birth with a cephalic singleton fetal malposition in labour. We defined prophylactic manual rotation as rotation performed without immediate instrumental vaginal delivery. We excluded non-randomised studies, and studies comparing manual rotation as part of a multi-component intervention without the ability to isolate the effect.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were operative delivery (forceps or vacuum delivery or caesarean section), maternal and perinatal mortality, caesarean section, instrumental delivery (forceps or vacuum delivery), third- or fourth-degree perineal trauma and postpartum haemorrhage of 500 mL or more.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors independently assessed RCTs for inclusion and extracted data. Two review authors independently evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB 1, version 5.2) tool.

Synthesis Methods

We analysed dichotomous data using a random effects model and presented the results as summary risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Included Studies

The review included six RCTs in Australia, France and the United States, recruiting a total of 1002 participants. We judged the overall risk of bias to be low for three RCTs (444 participants). We assessed the other three RCTs (558 participants) to have a high risk of performance and detection bias as they did not blind the control group. All RCTs included pregnant women in labour ≥ 37 weeks gestation with a singleton pregnancy at full cervical dilatation. A single study enrolled only nulliparous women. The majority of women (> 80%) had epidural analgesia. Four RCTs enrolled women in the OP position, one RCT enrolled women in the OT position, and one RCT enrolled women in both the OP and OT positions. All confirmed fetal position using ultrasound.

Synthesis Of Results

Findings from six RCTs involving 1002 participants suggest that manual rotation, compared to no manual rotation, may result in little to no difference in the rates of operative delivery (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.04; low-certainty evidence); caesarean section (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.56; low-certainty evidence); instrumental delivery (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.03; low-certainty evidence); third- or fourth-degree perineal trauma (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.49; low-certainty evidence); and postpartum haemorrhage of 500 mL or more (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.25; low-certainty evidence). There was no maternal or perinatal mortality. A single subgroup analysis for caesarean delivery comparing nulliparous versus multiparous deliveries found evidence of an interaction. Neither subgroup showed evidence of a difference in caesarean delivery. No other subgroup analyses showed evidence of an interaction, including comparisons of occiput posterior versus occiput transverse position; nulliparous versus multiparous deliveries; and digital (fingers) versus whole-hand rotation. Due to the risk of bias (lack of blinding) and imprecision in three studies, we downgraded the certainty of evidence to low. One additional study is ongoing but may be underpowered to detect important differences.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, we are uncertain whether prophylactic manual rotation early in the second stage of labour prevents operative delivery for women with fetal malpresentation. Further appropriately designed trials are required to determine the efficacy of manual rotation in both low-middle income and high-income settings.

### Efficacy of skin-to-skin contact between mother and newborn during the third stage of labour in reducing postpartum haemorrhage risk [^114poxBf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

What does this article contribute to the global clinical community?

This article provides evidence on the potential of SSC as an effective and non-invasive strategy to reduce the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. By addressing a gap in the literature, it underscores the importance of considering simple and natural interventions that can significantly impact maternal safety and recovery.

### Posterior compartment symptoms in primiparous women 1 year after non-assisted vaginal deliveries: a Swedish cohort study [^114s5Pas]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

In Sweden, the option of a postnatal consultation is voluntary and falls on the woman to make the appointment, and in 2014, over three-quarters (77%) of women made the appointment. Furthermore, the appointment is with a midwife, and rarely with the caregiver who managed the delivery. In an Italian study by Soligo et al. only approximately half of women were invited back for consultation and assessment of pelvic floor dysfunction and at a tertiary referral hospital in Milan 3 months postpartum, and this was in a study setting with multiple reminders. Furthermore, it has been shown that only 33% of international urogynaecologists and 25% of obstetricians routinely counsel women on the prevention of postnatal pelvic floor dysfunction, even though 60% of them are aware of the major risk factors and protective factors. Lipschuetz et al. state that 64% of primiparous women report at least one symptom of a pelvic floor disorder, making it a major concern postpartum. Faecal incontinence is a significant factor that decreases quality of life, and must thus be properly assessed and addressed postnatally.

Consistent with de Leeuw et al. the vast majority of women who undergo vaginal delivery will not obtain an OASI. Other studies in similar populations have reported a higher incidence of FI in women postpartum. Handa et al. reported an incidence of 30.6% in a 15-year postpartum follow-up. Similarly, a register-based study published in The Lancet in 2019 reported an incidence of FI of 37% postpartum, additionally stating high maternal age and foetal bodyweight as the strongest risk factors. Rikard-Bell et al. failed to demonstrate any statistically significant differences between perineal outcomes and symptoms of bowel dysfunction, prolapse or sexual dysfunction. Furthermore, in 2016, Leeman et al. published a prospective study where rates of FI did not differ between groups (7% for intact/minor laceration vs 10% for second-degree or greater laceration). They conclude that "women having second degree laceration are not an increased risk for pelvic floor dysfunction other than increased pain, and slightly lower sexual function scores at 6 months postpartum". Here, we have studied specific features of FI in a selected group of women with minor and second-degree injuries only. We would argue that in this way our findings add even more evidence that women with no perineal tears also suffer from pelvic floor dysfunction of the magnitude that was previously considered to be linked primarily to third- and fourth-degree perineal tears.

10 OBSTETRIC ANAL SPHINCTER INJURY (OASI)/SEVERE PERINEAL TRAUMA

Every attempt should be made to ensure that OASI or third‐ and fourth‐degree tears (sometimes referred to as "severe perineal trauma") do not occur, by supporting the perineum and controlling the presenting part. When they do occur, all birth attendants should be trained in recognition and escalation for appropriate repair. 37 Various interventions have been shown to prevent third‐ and fourth‐degree tears, such as the use of a warm compress on the perineum during the second stage. 38

### Consensus statement on pain management for pregnant patients with opioid use disorder from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology, Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine [^111unKdi]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Postvaginal delivery pain with high-order vaginal lacerations — epidural opioids (eg, morphine 3mg) may be considered, but there are limited data supporting its safety or efficacy; higher doses may be associated with pruritus which may be challenging to treat given risks for withdrawal with nalbuphine (Class IIa, Level C-LD). Evidence notes that complex vaginal deliveries in OUD (eg, high-degree lacerations, vaginal hematomas) could consider neuraxial morphine or hydromorphone, though consensus on appropriate dose is not available; acetaminophen and NSAIDs are universally noted to be effective and should be scheduled whenever possible, and the presence of OUD treated or untreated with MOUD has an uncertain effect on epidural opioid dose requirements. Patients with high-order vaginal lacerations should receive education on risks and benefits of opioid exposure as part of multimodal and tailored analgesic strategies (Class IIa, Level C-EO), and if short courses are required on discharge, then short interval outpatient follow-up (eg, 5–7 day prescription, no refills, with follow-up appointment within 1 week of discharge) is prudent (Class IIa, Level C-EO).

### Active delivery of the anterior arm and incidence of second-degree perineal tears: a clinical practice evaluation [^1135k29Z]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This study provides an objective view of our clinical practice. The design is simple with a significant statistical power demonstrating the feasibility and benefit of this maneuver. In a previous study, we reported that our policy of restricting the use of episiotomy did not increase the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears, with a rate of episiotomy of barely more than 1%. This policy of highly selective use led to a statistically significant increase in the rate of intact perineums, allowing more than 85% of patients who gave birth vaginally to leave our maternity department with trauma that was less severe than that associated with episiotomy. Thus, results of this present study are not applicable in all maternity wards where episiotomy is regularly performed.

Futhermore, the use of CM must be taught and supervised in a non-trained team. Indeed, operators who use it to early, based on a misunderstanding or anxiety can interfere with normal restitution and interfere with normal shoulder delivery. Training sessions are necessary to safely practice this technique in delivery rooms. In our study, professionals who took part to the study were volunteer and accustomed to practice this maneuver at delivery. External validity could be lost when CM is performed without prior teaching.

Others limitations of the study are absence of blinding and randomization. Lack of blinding can lead to the operator classifying tears as not in need of suturing. They may classify small second-degree tears as first degree. In our teaching maternity, three professionals are present with the parturient in the delivery room: a midwife, a student midwife and a child care assistant. It was difficult for ethics reasons to propose a perineal examination by a fourth blinded person while preserving women's intimacy after delivery. Intimacy has to be ensured according to the French hospitalized patient Charter. Perineal tears could have been photographed before and after CM, but the interpretation would have been difficult and not contributive. No randomization was performed for this study because it was a prospective collection of data following the introduction of a new maneuver in current practice. It was necessary to ensure the feasibility of the maneuver by midwives before considering a randomised trial.

### Effect of subsequent vaginal delivery on bowel symptoms and anorectal function in women who sustained a previous obstetric anal sphincter injury [^112vvN51]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

It is to this end that we decided to perform a subgroup analysis looking at outcomes for symptomatic women with normal anal manometry and EAUS, who delivered by VD versus CS. This analysis is unique, with other published literature reflecting the guidelines of the RCOG (which by its own admission lack a strong evidence base) recommending that symptomatic women deliver by CS. It is important to remember that although CS broadly speaking prevents further damage to the pelvic floor, it carries a burden of potential morbidity for which women should also be counselled. The CS rate for women included in our study was 19%. This rate is significantly lower than the 50% CS rate of Karmarkar et al. who used the same antenatal assessment methods, but a less detailed protocol.

We would also argue that a fourth-degree tear does not preclude vaginal delivery, as has been cautioned in the past. In our cohort, there were 9 fourth-degree index tears. Six of these were recommended CS; 3 were recommended VD (2 asymptomatic with normal anorectal physiology tests and 1 with minor symptoms and normal anorectal physiology tests). We would advocate that referral to a unit able to provide full antenatal assessment with anal manometry and EAUS is essential before making a recommendation on mode of delivery for these women.

### Development and validation of a protocol for documentation of obstetric perineal lacerations [^112ZKi3x]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study shows that the new documentation protocol delivers more comprehensive information regarding perineal lacerations compared with the current obstetric record system, ObstetriX, when used in primiparous women. The new protocol appears to specifically diagnose second-degree perineal lacerations to a greater extent than ObstetriX, which implies that the incidence of these perineal lacerations might be systematically underestimated. We could not see any difference in the ability to diagnose third-degree perineal tears, but the new protocol gave more comprehensive information regarding suturing. The agreement between the new protocol and ObstetriX was generally good when comparing labial lacerations, vaginal ruptures, and episiotomies.

Strengths and limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first validation of a protocol for documentation of perineal lacerations. The lack of a previously validated protocol implies that we do not know the true incidence of perineal lacerations when comparing the two documentation methods, which is a limitation. The index method used in this study, ObstetriX, is far from suitable as a reference method for documentation of perineal trauma because of the substantial lack of information. Many of the estimates of diagnostic accuracy suggested for use in validation of health administrative data, such as sensitivity and specificity, were thus considered inappropriate to use. The ideal reference method would be clinical examination by experts in perineal rupture classification, but this method was not practically possible to implement. Due to this lack of a previously validated protocol, validation against the current obstetric medical record system in Sweden was considered acceptable. Since the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists classification of perineal rupture was used, the results may be transferred to an international context.

### Nurse-midwives' ability to diagnose acute third-and fourth-degree obstetric lacerations in Western Kenya [^113pTLEz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

A written survey and a pictorial assessment tool were developed by U.S. obstetricians/gynecologists and reviewed with Kenyan Family and Emergency Medicine postgraduates (residents) and a Kenyan clinical officer for cultural context, clarity of questions, and feasibility of design. Adjustments were made as recommended. The Siaya County Ministry of Health Maternal Health Taskforce directed that the assessment take place during a previously planned one-day county maternal health-training program for nurse-midwife "Maternal Health Trainers" from each of the seven Siaya sub-counties. Maternal Health Trainers were appointed by their respective counties based on experience, skills, and desire to serve as maternal health advocates for their county. Verbal informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to administration of the assessment.

The final assessment tool contained color images (used with permission from the Perineal and Anal Sphincter Trauma Program, Croydon University Hospital, Croydon UK) of normal and abnormal perineal anatomy (e.g. obstetric lacerations) with accompanying clinical scenarios. During the assessment, images (some illustrative diagrams and some actual images of perineal tears) were sequentially projected on a screen as well as on tablets/computers, which allowed for high-resolution views. Research staff gave clinical scenarios verbally. Each participant marked their own responses on separate scorecards, and the group was proctored to be certain that answers were individual. Some images required identification of perineal anatomy (e.g. anal sphincter, rectal/anal mucosa, and muscles of the perineal body) and others required diagnosis of the degree of laceration (included ten pictures: one of a first-degree tear, one of a button-hole tear, and eight of third- or fourth-degree tears). Answers were recorded as correct if the participant correctly identified the degree of laceration or identified an OASIS and/or stated the general structure (e.g. sphincter, anus, muscle, etc.), but a correct answer did not require the formal anatomical name. Study personnel were available to provide clarification of any questions. An accompanying open-response survey collected information on participant demographics, training and experience with obstetric tears, and barriers to adequate perineal laceration diagnosis and repair.

Social pressure emerged as one of several factors that contribute to performing episiotomy outside of clinical criteria. If there are complications such as a third degree or fourth degree tear where the episiotomy is not performed, there are social repercussions, motivating its routine use:

"If you do not perform an episiotomy, [the vaginal canal] can be torn on several sides, and the most dangerous is when it reaches the anal sphincter; now the complication comes, which is a fistula, no? And [colleagues] are going to say 'why didn't you do the episiotomy?' So, the idea is that sometimes you even make a small [routine] cut and that's it". General Physician informant, B, X08

These statements contrast with other statements that episiotomy be avoided as a method of imparting obstetric violence and in the context of current discourse on humanized childbirth.

We also found examples where there was social pressure to avoid episiotomy alongside a perceived shift in norms:

"There was a time when episiotomies were being avoided a lot. for the same reason, because of the environment of obstetric violence, but. well, I watched four cases of [natural] tearing". General Physician informant, B, H07

"[Episiotomy] has been avoided for humanized birth. [delivery] has to progress… but now we say don't push it, there is no "Be quick and done!" but rather naturally progress thus avoid episiotomy". Nurse informant, B, H01

### Hyaluronidase for reducing perineal trauma [^1147V63C]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Perineal hyaluronidase (HAase) injection was widely used to reduce the occurrence of perineal trauma, pain and need for episiotomy in the 1950s to 1960s. Reports suggested that the administration of HAase was a simple, low risk, low cost and effective way to decrease perineal trauma without adverse effects.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of perineal HAase injection for reducing spontaneous perineal trauma, episiotomy and perineal pain in vaginal deliveries.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2013), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (both on 1 April 2013), and reference lists of retrieved studies. We also contacted relevant organisations.

Selection Criteria

Published and unpublished randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing perineal HAase injection with placebo injection or no intervention in vaginal deliveries.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated methodological quality. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

The search strategy identified six potentially eligible studies. Two studies were excluded. We included four randomised controlled trials that randomised a total of 599 women (data were available for 595 women). Two trials (283 women) compared the effects of perineal HAase injection during the second stage of labour with placebo injection and were at low risk of bias. Three trials (one three-armed trial was analysed twice) (373 women) compared the effects of perineal HAase injection during second stage of labour with no intervention and two out of the three trials were at high risk of bias. Data from four trials involving 599 women suggested that perineal HAase injection during second stage of labour had a lower incidence of perineal trauma (average risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.95, Tau² = 0.08, I² = 82% compared with women in the control group, but there was no clear evidence of a reduction in the incidence of episiotomy (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.29, Tau² = 0.17, I² = 66%), first and second degree perineal lacerations (average RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.33, Tau² = 0.30, I² = 85%) and third and fourth degree perineal lacerations (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.13). Data from two trials involving 283 women indicated that there was no clear evidence of a reduction in the incidence of perineal trauma (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.06, Tau² = 1.07, I² = 7%), episiotomy (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.89, Tau² = 0.27, I² = 54%), first and second degree perineal lacerations (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.40, Tau² = 1.11, I² = 10%) and third and fourth degree perineal lacerations (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.13) with perineal HAase injection. Data from three trials involving 373 women suggested that perineal HAase injection during second stage of labour had a lower incidence of perineal trauma (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88, Tau² = 0.08, I² = 78%) compared with no intervention, but had no clear effect on in the incidence of episiotomy (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.42, Tau² = 0.16, I² = 70%) and first and second degree perineal lacerations (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.10, Tau² = 0.18, I² = 59%). No side effects were reported in the included trials. No included trials reported on perineal pain and other pre-specified secondary outcomes: perineal trauma requiring suturing; blood loss; dyspareunia; urinary incontinence; faecal incontinence; assisted delivery rate; women's satisfaction; Apgar score less than seven at five minutes and need for admission to special care baby unit.

Authors' Conclusions

Perineal HAase injection during second stage of labour had a lower incidence of perineal trauma compared with control or no intervention, but there was no clear evidence of benefit compared with placebo injection. The difference in incidence of perineal trauma may probably be due to bias and confounding in the non-placebo controlled comparison, this result should be interpreted cautiously. The potential use of perineal HAase injection as a method to reduce perineal trauma were yet to be determined as there was no appropriate established dose for HAase, no evidence of follow up, and the number of high-quality trials and outcomes reported were too limited to draw conclusions on its effectiveness and safety. Further rigorous randomised controlled trials are required to evaluate the role of perineal HAase injection in vaginal deliveries.

### Prevalence and risk factors of overt postpartum urinary retention among primiparous women after vaginal delivery: a case-control study [^112APFFa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study confirmed the role of forceps delivery as a risk factor for PUR, which was previously reported. Instrument-assisted delivery may damage the pelvic, pudendal, and peripheral nerves, resulting in impairment of the reflexes and voluntary mechanisms required for urination, as well as mechanical outlet obstruction due to vulvar oedema or hematoma. Direct bladder or urethral trauma resulting from instrument-assisted delivery contributes to PUR. Our study indicated that vulvar oedema increased the risk of PUR by up to 6.92-folds, which corroborates this statement. In addition, pain caused by vulvar oedema may result in reflex urethral spasm, and subsequently PUR.

In the present study, episiotomy and second-degree perineal tears were both identified as independent risk factors for PUR, which is in line with the findings of previous studies. In a systematic review by Mulder et al. episiotomy was found to be directly related to PUR. Avondstondt et al. reported that second-degree or worse obstetrical laceration increased the risk of PUR by 3.66-folds. The mechanism is yet to be determined, but it may be that pain caused by perineal trauma leads to changes in bladder sensation, central nervous system inhibition, and persistent urethral spasm. However, there is a lack of consensus in the literature regarding the independent contribution of episiotomy to PUR. Therefore, it is still questionable whether episiotomy is an independent risk factor. Buchanan et al. reported that only third- or fourth-degree perineal trauma was a significant independent predictor of PUR. There were no cases of third- or fourth-degree perineal trauma in our study. Severe perineal trauma is a rare condition, and even in our hospital with a large delivery number, there are less than five cases per year. In addition, patients with severe perineal trauma typically require catheterisations after suturing, which was not one of our inclusion criteria.

### Diagnosis, management and training in perineal trauma: a UK national survey of obstetricians [^112yN6Z9]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

A national practice survey in the UK in 2002 demonstrated that 33% of consultant obstetricians (672 respondents) and 22% of trainees (148 respondents) incorrectly classified a tear in the anal sphincter as a second-degree tear. This was attributed to a lack of recognition, due to a lack of training. In the same survey, 64% of consultants and 64% of trainees said that there was a "lack of" or "unsatisfactory" training in the management of OASIs. Since that survey, courses have been developed to train physicians and midwives in the prevention, diagnosis and management of perineal trauma including OASI.

Training has been shown to improve the detection of OASI and the accuracy of classification. A quality improvement study in Palestine also showed that after education and training, there was a significant increase in the diagnosis of OASIs and this was attributed to an increase in accurate diagnosis. Krissi et al. found that there was a decreased rate of OASIs following a structured hands-on workshop. This was attributed to improved accuracy in the classification of trauma, and improved awareness of risk factors and prevention techniques.

Similar surveys in the United States, Australia and New Zealand have also found a need for improved training in the diagnosis and management of obstetric injuries. In a national cohort of US obstetricians, 66% of respondents had no formal training in obstetric trauma diagnosis and classification, whereas 75.8% of trainees of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists previously attended an OASI workshop. However, 86.4% still felt that additional training would be valuable. Almost all (98%) obstetrics and gynaecology resident physicians in Spain felt that there was a need for a theoretical–practical course on pelvic floor anatomy and the repair of its injuries.

Prevention and management of OASI are often part of the training that physicians receive. The Green-top guideline for third- and fourth-degree tears gives an evidence-based approach to the prevention, diagnosis and management of OASI for UK physicians. When US physicians were asked about guidelines for the repair of obstetric lacerations, only 33.3% said that they were available in their hospital.

### Which elements were significant in reducing obstetric anal sphincter injury? A prospective follow-up study [^112Pikj5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI) is a serious complication of vaginal delivery. The severity of OASI is documented and confirmed by organizations representing women, such as "Mothers with Anal Sphincter Injuries in Childbirth". Suffering from an OASI is a strong risk factor for a negative birth experience.

Several interventional trials show that application of a care bundle involving a hands-on approach to perineal protection may reduce the risk of OASI. Furthermore, several trials find that improved results with these interventions may be sustainable. In one program, the specific use of manual perineal protection is documented and a protective effect found.

Previously, we showed that only the element of having a hand on the fetal head resulted in a statistically and clinically significant reduction in OASI, albeit the analysis as an exploratory pilot study was carried out on a modest-sized cohort; thus, the risk of a type 2 error was calculated to be 50%.

We aimed at analyzing the individual elements of an OASI care bundle including episiotomy and several known risk factors in a large cohort. Even though episiotomy may be viewed as a grade 2 laceration in itself, there is the potential that its use may reduce the risk of OASI. Moreover, we wished to examine the sustainability over several years of the OASI care bundle. In general, a care bundle is meant to be implemented as a whole. However, this may be complex in daily practice at a birth department since the ideal situation is not always present where all elements of the care bundle can be applied. Acute situations and specific birth positions and wishes by the woman giving birth may prevent the use of all elements. For this reason, we wished to analyze which separate elements of the care bundle were protective in order to provide evidence for a more thorough understanding of the value of each of the involved elements of the care bundle. In the broader perspective, there is a need for OASI research to focus more on delivery procedures and not restricting risk analyses to individual data on the woman or the infant.

### Selective versus routine use of episiotomy for vaginal birth [^1159fPHh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Summary

This important and well‐performed review assesses the effects of selective use of episiotomy compared with routine episiotomy during vaginal birth. We would like to have more information on several important definitions, used in this review. It is known that there are several strong indications for the use of an episiotomy, such as fetal distress, breech delivery and assisted delivery. We can presume that with "restricted use of episiotomy" the review authors mean that there was no episiotomy used, unless there was such a strong indication for an episiotomy in that specific case. We wonder what the exact indications were in this specific review. To prevent confusion, we think it is necessary to have a clear description of what is meant by a "restrictive use of episiotomy" policy in this Cochrane review. The exact definitions of "anterior perineal trauma" and "posterior perineal trauma" are described properly under the subheading "description of the condition". In addition, the various degrees of spontaneous ruptures are well‐defined. However, the terms "severe vaginal/perineal trauma" (outcome 5) and "severe perineal trauma" (outcome 8) are not well described. We can assume involvement of the anal sphincter complex (third and fourth degree ruptures) is defined as severe trauma. Unfortunately, this is not described in the background text, although it is of great importance to interpret the outcomes of the review correctly. Similarly, the exact definitions of Outcomes 21, 24 and 27 (Moderate/severe perineal pain in 3 days; ‐ 10 days; ‐3 months) are not clear. The methods used in the individual trials to assess the degree of experienced pain, for example the standardized visual analogue score, are not described. In Outcome 33 (Healing complications at 7 days), there is no specification of these complications and/or symptoms involved with healing complications. Therefore, it is not possible for the reader to determine how serious these complications were. In conclusion, we think that this review would gain strength if the above mentioned definitions are added to the description of the data.

### Perineal lacerations during subsequent vaginal delivery… [^111gTAFS]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately one half of women who sustain severe perineal laceration during vaginal delivery report significant long-term symptoms such as pain, dyspareunia and flatal incontinence. In addition, they are believed to be at high risk of repeated laceration during subsequent deliveries, but this risk has not been quantified. Peleg and colleagues studied the implications for a subsequent vaginal delivery in women with a history of severe perineal laceration during vaginal delivery. The authors studied the records of 4, 015 women who had delivered their first infant at a university hospital between 1978 and 1995 and had records of vaginal, vertex delivery of a singleton infant weighing 2, 500 g or more after at least 36 weeks of gestation. The women were divided into two groups depending on evidence of perineal laceration. Records of a subsequent delivery at the same institution were analyzed for evidence of perineal laceration. A total of 774 of the deliveries studied were complicated by severe perineal laceration. Factors significantly associated with perineal laceration were increased birth weight, use of instrumentation and episiotomy. Maternal age and weight were not significantly associated with laceration. During subsequent births, 58 of the women with previous laceration had repeated severe laceration. This was more than twice the risk of severe laceration than the risk in other women during second deliveries. The risk was clearly related to the use of episiotomy and instrumental delivery. The highest risk during the second delivery was in women with a history of severe laceration who had instrumental delivery and episiotomy in the second delivery. Over 20 percent of these women sustained a second severe laceration.

The authors conclude that cutting an episiotomy and using instruments during delivery are significantly related to severe perineal lacerations and that the risk of laceration is more than doubled in women with a history of severe perineal laceration during a previous delivery. After reviewing other studies, the authors call for a reassessment of episiotomy in modern obstetrics because the evidence linking this common procedure to severe laceration and subsequent morbidity is now overwhelming.
