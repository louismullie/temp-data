## Question

treatment for bacterial tonsillitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for bacterial tonsillitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about differentiating viral from bacterial etiologies using validated clinical scores. Then, I should verify the appropriate testing strategy, including RADT and when to back up with culture. Next, I will confirm first-line antibiotic choices and durations, clarify alternatives for penicillin allergy, and consider supportive care and the role of corticosteroids. After that, I should review indications for tonsillectomy and watchful waiting thresholds, address recurrent infections and carriers, and ensure antibiotic stewardship principles are upheld. Finally, I will outline follow-up and management of treatment failure, making sure each step is reference-grounded and internally consistent [^117EcNvV] [^115H7z7h] [^116JcF45] [^113dDL6T].

> Let me first confirm how to estimate pretest probability. The Centor or McIsaac criteria remain practical for triage, recognizing that fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical nodes, and absence of cough increase the likelihood of group A Streptococcus, while most pharyngitis is viral, especially in adults, so I need to avoid premature anchoring on GAS without supportive features [^117P3DY1] [^117EcNvV]. I should double-check the epidemiology to calibrate expectations: GAS accounts for roughly 10–20% of adult and 30–50% of pediatric pharyngitis, underscoring why conservative testing and treatment pathways are essential to reduce overtreatment [^117EcNvV] [^116JcF45].

> Next, I should review the testing strategy. For patients with a moderate-to-high Centor/McIsaac score, rapid antigen detection testing (RADT) reduces unnecessary antibiotics and is effective for guiding prescriptions in primary care, and when RADT is negative but suspicion remains high, especially in children and adolescents, I need to consider a backup throat culture to avoid false negatives and misclassification of true GAS infection [^113bY21x] [^115H7z7h] [^117EcNvV]. Wait, let me verify the nuance in adults versus children: IDSA emphasizes microbiologic confirmation overall and is more permissive of no culture backup in adults with low suspicion, but a culture backup is prudent when clinical concern persists, particularly in pediatrics, which aligns with stewardship goals [^115H7z7h] [^117EcNvV].

> I need to ensure I am not testing when it is unlikely to help. In patients with 0–1 Centor features or with a clear viral syndrome such as cough, rhinorrhea, or oral ulcers, testing is not recommended because the post-test probability of GAS remains low and false positives or overdiagnosis risk downstream harm, so I should reserve diagnostics for those with at least a moderate pretest probability [^117EcNvV] [^117P3DY1]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: if there is a known outbreak or special epidemiology, thresholds can shift, but in routine settings avoiding low-yield testing preserves stewardship integrity [^117EcNvV].

> Now, I will confirm first-line antibiotic therapy when GAS is confirmed or highly suspected. Penicillin V or amoxicillin for a full 10-day course remains the preferred approach given narrow spectrum, excellent efficacy for eradication, absence of resistance, and cost-effectiveness, with typical adult dosing such as penicillin V 500 mg twice daily or amoxicillin 500 mg twice daily, and once-daily amoxicillin 50 mg/kg is acceptable in children for adherence, which I should document in the record along with the diagnostic basis [^115H7z7h] [^116JcF45] [^114aiRxZ]. Let me think about the rationale one more time: these choices minimize collateral microbiome disruption while achieving pharyngeal eradication, which is aligned with IDSA and AAFP guidance [^115H7z7h] [^116JcF45].

> But wait, what about shorter courses? A 5-day, high-frequency penicillin V regimen (for example, 800 mg four times daily) has evidence of noninferiority to a 10-day course in per-protocol analyses, which may be reasonable when adherence to a shorter intensive course is likely; however, I should verify that IDSA still endorses 10 days as standard for eradication and frame the 5-day regimen as an evidence-supported alternative rather than the default, noting the sensitivity of some analyses and per-protocol emphasis [^113dhm2f] [^116QgiQb] [^115H7z7h]. Hold on, I should confirm shared decision-making here, carefully counseling on adherence and the limited margin by intention-to-treat in sensitivity analyses [^113dhm2f] [^116QgiQb].

> I will now examine options for penicillin-allergic patients. If the allergy is non-anaphylactic, a first-generation cephalosporin for 10 days is appropriate, whereas with anaphylaxis risk I should avoid beta-lactams and use clindamycin for 10 days or a macrolide such as azithromycin for 5 days, mindful of local macrolide resistance and AAFP's recommendation to avoid azithromycin unless β-lactam–allergic, and I should document the allergy phenotype clearly to guide safe selection and stewardship [^115d74AE] [^117AKQRB]. Wait, let me verify pediatric and adult azithromycin dosing consistency with the FDA label: adults often receive 500 mg on day 1 then 250 mg on days 2–5, and children receive 12 mg/kg daily for 5 days, which I need to tailor by weight and formulation [^114cRCAn] [^112RQmLe] [^114v2Udb].

> Supportive care is essential for all patients regardless of antibiotics. I should offer acetaminophen or NSAIDs for analgesia and antipyresis, maintain hydration, and provide anticipatory guidance about typical illness course, because symptom control improves comfort and function even when antibiotics are not indicated or while awaiting results, and this is consistently endorsed by IDSA and ESCMID [^113Le879] [^1144BvYF]. Let me reconsider corticosteroids: a single low dose, commonly dexamethasone up to 10 mg, can modestly accelerate pain relief and increase the likelihood of complete resolution by 48 hours, especially in more severe presentations; however, I should frame this as an adjunct with a weak recommendation, not routine care, and discuss patient preferences and potential uncertainties in rare adverse effects, aligning with BMJ Rapid Recommendations, Cochrane, and ESCMID guidance to consider steroids in severe cases with 3–4 Centor features [^114dQPo6] [^113GTnrG] [^111ncXxk]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm that when antibiotics are deferred or not given, the steroid evidence still applies; meta-analyses suggest benefits regardless of antibiotic co-administration, but benefits are modest and shared decision-making is key [^113jLX4r].

> Next, I should review indications for tonsillectomy using Paradise criteria and watchful waiting thresholds. For children with recurrent, well-documented throat infections meeting thresholds such as at least 7 episodes in one year, at least 5 per year for two years, or at least 3 per year for three years, tonsillectomy can be considered after confirming documentation of fever, cervical adenopathy, exudate, or a positive GAS test per episode, whereas those below these thresholds should generally undergo watchful waiting, with modifying factors like PFAPA, multiple antibiotic intolerance, or more than one peritonsillar abscess lowering the threshold for referral [^113dDL6T] [^112VWqdf] [^113RvRFF]. I need to ensure expectations are aligned: tonsillectomy should not be performed solely to reduce GAS frequency, as IDSA discourages surgery for that narrow purpose, reinforcing careful selection and shared decision-making with families and surgeons [^1172sFEp].

> I will now examine recurrent infections and carrier states. Hold on, I should verify that apparent recurrences may reflect viral infections in chronic GAS carriers rather than repeated true GAS episodes; carriers have low transmission risk and typically do not need eradication therapy unless special circumstances apply, so I must be cautious not to mislabel and overtreat, documenting testing and clinical context for each episode to distinguish patterns accurately [^115vHC39]. Regarding complications, I should manage suppurative events like peritonsillar abscess with appropriate acute therapy but avoid giving antibiotics solely to prevent suppurative or non-suppurative complications in low-risk patients without confirmed GAS, as ESCMID advises against prophylactic antibiotic initiation for such prevention in routine low-risk settings [^1118f9wf] [^115yqEj4].

> Antibiotic stewardship must be explicit at every step. I need to avoid antibiotics in clear viral tonsillitis, use narrow-spectrum agents when indicated, and leverage RADT-based strategies to reduce unnecessary prescribing without worsening symptom outcomes, while also avoiding macrolides unless there is a compelling allergy rationale given resistance concerns and guideline cautions from AAFP and ACP/CDC [^113bY21x] [^117AKQRB] [^117EcNvV]. Wait, let me double-check: stewardship audits consistently show substantial rates of non-recommended antibiotic use in pediatric pharyngitis, so embedding decision rules, test-and-treat protocols, and feedback can meaningfully curb misuse and align with best practices [^116kid8P].

> Follow-up and failure management require measured reassessment. If symptoms persist beyond 3–4 days of appropriate therapy or worsen, I should re-evaluate the diagnosis, check adherence and dosing, consider a throat culture if not previously obtained, and assess for alternate etiologies such as infectious mononucleosis, early peritonsillar abscess, or non-GAS pathogens, documenting the revised plan accordingly, while recognizing that routine test-of-cure is generally unnecessary in uncomplicated cases unless high-risk features or complications exist [^115H7z7h] [^111oPecZ]. Hold on, I should verify medication access and tolerability during this check-in, because nonadherence and intolerance are common, correctable reasons for apparent nonresponse [^115H7z7h].

> To consolidate this into a clear pathway, I should start with Centor-based risk assessment and reserve testing for moderate-to-high risk, use RADT with culture backup when suspicion remains high, initiate penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days for confirmed GAS or consider carefully selected 5-day high-frequency penicillin V when adherence is favorable and shared decision-making supports it, select cephalosporins or clindamycin or azithromycin appropriately for β-lactam allergy, provide universal analgesia and consider a single-dose corticosteroid for severe pain, ensure rigorous documentation for recurrent infections and apply Paradise criteria for surgical referral while favoring watchful waiting below thresholds, and anchor the whole process in antibiotic stewardship with planned follow-up to reassess and redirect when the clinical course deviates from expectations [^117P3DY1] [^113bY21x] [^115H7z7h] [^113dhm2f] [^115d74AE] [^114dQPo6] [^113dDL6T] [^117EcNvV].

---

The cornerstone of bacterial tonsillitis management is **penicillin or amoxicillin as first-line therapy** [^116JcF45] for 10 days to eradicate GAS and prevent complications [^115H7z7h]. For **penicillin allergy**, use a first-generation cephalosporin (if no anaphylaxis), clindamycin, or azithromycin for 5 days [^115d74AE] [^114cRCAn]. Supportive care with **acetaminophen or NSAIDs** [^113Le879] is recommended for symptom relief [^1144BvYF]. Tonsillectomy is reserved for recurrent infections that meet established frequency criteria [^113dDL6T] or for cases with modifying factors such as multiple antibiotic allergies or > 1 peritonsillar abscess [^113RvRFF]. Antibiotics are **not indicated** for viral tonsillitis [^117EcNvV].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

### First-line antibiotics

First-line antibiotics include **penicillin V** for 10 days — favored for its efficacy, safety, and low cost [^114aiRxZ] — and **amoxicillin** for 10 days, which is equally effective and more palatable, especially in children [^116JcF45] [^115H7z7h].

---

### Alternative antibiotics for penicillin allergy

- **First-generation cephalosporins**: 10 days; use if no anaphylactic reaction [^115d74AE].
- **Clindamycin**: 10 days; for severe beta-lactam allergy [^115d74AE].
- **Azithromycin**: 5 days; for severe beta-lactam allergy [^115d74AE] [^112RQmLe].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care includes **analgesics/antipyretics** (acetaminophen or NSAIDs) [^113Le879] for symptom relief [^1144BvYF] and **hydration and rest** to support recovery [^116kw671].

---

## Surgical intervention (tonsillectomy)

### Indications for tonsillectomy

Indications for tonsillectomy include **recurrent infections** (≥ 7 episodes/year, ≥ 5/year for 2 years, or ≥ 3/year for 3 years, with documentation [^113dDL6T]) and **modifying factors** such as multiple antibiotic allergies, PFAPA syndrome, or > 1 peritonsillar abscess [^113RvRFF].

---

## Prevention of complications

Prevention of complications centers on **antibiotic adherence** — completing the full course to prevent rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis — and **follow-up** to monitor for peritonsillar abscess or persistent symptoms.

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **chronic carriers**, who typically do not require treatment unless symptomatic or during outbreaks [^114WGiQz] [^115vHC39], and **antibiotic resistance**, for which narrow-spectrum antibiotics should be used whenever possible to minimize resistance.

---

Penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days remains the **first-line treatment** for bacterial tonsillitis, with alternatives for penicillin allergy [^115H7z7h] [^116JcF45]. Supportive care and selective tonsillectomy are important, and **antibiotics are not indicated for viral tonsillitis** [^117EcNvV].

Regarding surgical interventions for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to indications for tonsillectomy, the AAO-HNSF 2019 guidelines recommend evaluating pediatric patients with recurring throat infections not meeting criteria for tonsillectomy for modifying factors that may favor tonsillectomy. These factors include, but are not limited to:

- **Multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance**: Evaluate if these allergies or intolerances increase the frequency or severity of infections.

- **Periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome (PFAPA syndrome)**: Consider how this syndrome impacts the patient's overall health and frequency of infections.

- **History of more than one peritonsillar abscess**: Assess if previous peritonsillar abscesses suggest a higher risk of future occurrences without surgical intervention.

### Corticosteroids as standalone or add-on treatment for sore throat [^113GTnrG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Sore throat is a common condition associated with a high rate of antibiotic prescriptions, despite limited evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms of sore throat by reducing inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. This review is an update to our review published in 2012.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical benefit and safety of corticosteroids in reducing the symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2019), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 14 May 2019), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, 2002 to 2015), and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (inception to 2015). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared steroids to either placebo or standard care in adults and children (aged over three years) with sore throat. We excluded studies of hospitalized participants, those with infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included one new RCT in this update, for a total of nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children and 950 adults). In eight trials, participants in both corticosteroid and placebo groups received antibiotics; one trial offered delayed prescription of antibiotics.

### Efficacy and safety of rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat [^113bY21x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Sore throat is a common condition caused by viruses or bacteria and is a leading cause of antibiotic prescription in primary care. The most common bacterial species implicated is group A streptococcus ('strep throat'). Despite the majority of pharyngitis cases being viral in origin, between 50% and 70% are treated with antibiotics. One strategy to reduce antibiotic use is the employment of rapid tests for group A streptococcus to guide antibiotic prescriptions. These rapid tests can be utilized alone or in combination with a clinical scoring system.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of strategies based on rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat in primary care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS, as well as the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP on 5 June 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid tests with management based on clinical grounds to guide the prescription of antibiotics for people with a sore throat in ambulatory care settings. This included trials that randomized individuals, as well as cluster-RCTs in which individual practitioners (or practices) or emergency departments were randomized.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data on the primary outcomes (number of participants provided with an antibiotic prescription; number of participants with an antibiotic dispensed) and secondary outcomes (duration of sore throat symptoms; duration of other symptoms; quality of life measures).

### Towards evidence-based emergency medicine: Best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Can inflammatory markers distinguish streptococcal from viral tonsillitis [^117VCUwy]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

A short-cut review was performed to evaluate whether inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white cell count (WCC), and procalcitonin (PCT) are able to discriminate between streptococcal and viral tonsillitis, enabling a reduction in the overuse of antibiotics. Eight studies with a total of 1031 participants were found. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that WCC, CRP, and PCT levels are higher in patients with streptococcal tonsillitis compared to patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis without group A streptococcus isolated from a throat swab. Which of these markers has the best test performance characteristics requires further study.

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^111ncXxk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, ESCMID 2012 guidelines recommend considering offering corticosteroids in adult patients with more severe presentations, such as those with 3–4 Centor criteria.

### Review: Known, emerging, and remerging pharyngitis pathogens [^114VbJK6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both adults and children, responsible for 1%–2% of all outpatient visits in the United States annually. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) alone causes an estimated 5.2 million outpatient visits and 2.8 million antibiotic prescriptions annually among US persons aged 0–64 years with pharyngitis. As one of the most common reasons for primary care visits, it is the number one diagnosis linked to antibiotic use in school-aged children. Individuals complaining of sore throat also frequently present to medical emergency departments.

According to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2017), there were more than 1.19 million visits to US emergency departments for acute pharyngitis. In one study evaluating the medical and non-medical costs of pediatric pharyngitis, children missed a mean of 1.9 days of school or day care, and 42% of parents missed work. Further expanding the familial impact of pharyngitis, a second parent or caregiver also missed a mean of 1.5 days in 14% of families. Including indirect costs related to the loss of parents' wages while missing work, the estimated total cost in the United States was calculated as between $224 and $539 million annually.

In this review, we describe the key characteristics of GAS pharyngeal infections, as well as other causes of pharyngeal infections, and highlight emerging pathogens that clinicians must consider in children and adults.

### Tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection in moderately affected children [^111d8Dng]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

In previous clinical trials involving children severely affected by throat infections (defined as 7 or more well-documented, clinically significant, and adequately treated episodes of throat infection in the preceding year; or 5 or more such episodes in each of the 2 preceding years; or 3 or more such episodes in each of the 3 preceding years), we found tonsillectomy to be efficacious in reducing both the number and severity of subsequent episodes of throat infection for at least 2 years. The results seemed to warrant the election of tonsillectomy in children meeting the trials' stringent eligibility criteria, but they also provided support for nonsurgical management.

We undertook the present trials to determine whether tonsillectomy would offer equivalent benefits in children who were less severely affected than those in our earlier trials but nonetheless had indications for tonsillectomy comparable to those in general practice. Additionally, we explored whether, in such children, the addition of adenoidectomy would confer additional benefits.

- **Methods**: We conducted two parallel randomized, controlled trials at the Ambulatory Care Center of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. To be eligible, children were required to have a history of throat infections that met criteria slightly less stringent than those used in our previous trials regarding either the frequency of previous episodes, their clinical features, or their degree of documentation, but not relaxing more than one of these parameters. These reduced standards were nevertheless more stringent than those found in official guidelines.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115rpVFB]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat. This was done through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Data sources included Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and trial registries up to May 2017, as well as reference lists of eligible trials and related reviews.

- **Study selection**: Randomized controlled trials were selected based on the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings. These patients presented with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of a sore throat. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status.

- **Review methods**: Reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. A random effects model was used for meta-analyses, and the quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.

- **Results**: Ten eligible trials enrolled 1,426 individuals. Patients who received a single low dose of corticosteroids (most commonly oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence) and were 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%; high quality evidence).

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: Randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^113dhm2f]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

The primary outcome of the study was evaluated through clinical cure at the test of cure evaluation, which was achieved by 89.6% of patients in the five-day group (181/202) and 93.3% in the 10-day group (182/195). The study demonstrated that penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days was non-inferior to penicillin V 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days in the main analysis population (the per protocol population). The point estimate indicated a difference in the rate of clinical cure of −3.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval −9.7 to 2.2) in favor of the 10-day intervention group.

The non-inferiority of the five-day treatment was supported by supplementary analyses of the modified intention to treat population with imputed values as clinical cure. These results were confirmed using supplementary analyses of the modified intention to treat population with imputed values as not clinical cure and analyses of the per protocol population, where patients with only telephone follow-up (n = 14) and those outside the follow-up visit window (n = 17) were excluded. In two supplementary analyses, where modified intention to treat without imputation (n = 403) and when patients who mistakenly received an oral solution of penicillin V (n = 7) were excluded, the 95% confidence intervals crossed the non-inferiority line (−10.04 to 1.9 and −10.01 to 2.2, respectively). Importantly, all patients who received the oral solution were clinically cured.

### Does the choice of antibiotic affect outcome in strep throat [^1152TGdN]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There is insufficient evidence to show clinically meaningful differences between antibiotics for group A beta hemolytic streptococci tonsillopharyngitis. Penicillin or amoxicillin is recommended as the first choice, given the absence of resistance and low cost.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group a streptococcal pharyngitis [^117K3jjR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in participants with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It remains unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated.

- **Objectives**: To assess the evidence on the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in alleviating symptoms (pain, fever), shortening the duration of the illness, preventing relapse, and preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). Moreover, to evaluate the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to March week 3, 2016), Embase Elsevier (1974 to March 2016), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (2010 to March 2016). We also searched clinical trials registers.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, complications, or adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE tool to assess the overall quality of evidence.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: A retrospective study [^116kid8P]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we found that 28% of antibiotic prescriptions for pediatric patients evaluated for pharyngitis were not recommended by guidelines, primarily due to the prescription of antibiotics in spite of negative GAS test results. Given the frequency of pharyngitis in children, further targeted antimicrobial stewardship education for providers should be emphasized to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. Studies assessing why adherence to guidelines for the management of pharyngitis in children appears to be greater than in adults may help elucidate which aspects of antimicrobial stewardship efforts have been most successful.

### The global burden of sore throat and group A pharyngitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114hrVQC]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory infection by group A Streptococcus (Strep A) and other pathogens can result in a sore throat and a clinical diagnosis of pharyngitis or tonsillitis. Strep A sore throat and tonsillitis can progress to more severe infections, such as peritonsillar abscess or invasive infections; Strep A sore throat can also lead to post-infection sequelae, including acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). There is limited contemporary data on the global burden of all Strep A-related diseases. Based on 2010 estimates, each year RHD caused more than 345,000 deaths. Added to previous estimates that Strep A invasive infection caused more than 163,000 deaths, Strep A was postulated to be the fifth most lethal pathogen in the world. Strep A vaccines could significantly reduce this disease burden. Moreover, the World Health Organization highlights the potential role of Strep A vaccines in reducing antibiotic treatment of presumed Strep A sore throat, which could plausibly lead to reduced levels of antibiotic resistance and associated harms.

Despite the high global burden of Strep A diseases and the existence of several promising candidate vaccines in early development, investment in the late-stage development of these candidates has not been forthcoming. Therefore, a formal assessment of the value of prospective Strep A vaccines from both a commercial and societal perspective is warranted. The incidence and burden of sore throat and Strep A sore throat are important inputs for assessing the value of Strep A vaccines.

### Is Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guidance for GP management of tonsillitis suitable? A qualitative study [^111gzjwX]. Family Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) developed guidelines for the management of sore throat and indications for tonsillectomy in 1999 to address concerns about unnecessary surgery. Emergency admissions to hospitals for tonsillitis have since increased. Adults experience an average of 27 episodes of tonsillitis before undergoing tonsillectomy. We wished to explore the appropriateness of the guidance and/or its implementation in primary care.

- **Aim**: To explore the attitudes of GPs regarding the referral criteria they use when managing adults presenting with acute tonsillitis.

- **Design**: Secondary analysis of qualitative data from the National Trial of Tonsillectomy in Adults (NATTINA) feasibility and process evaluation.

- **Participants and setting**: Twenty-one GPs from practices throughout the UK.

- **Method**: In-depth interviews with GPs concerning both the feasibility and process evaluation phases of NATTINA. Analysis was conducted using the framework method.

- **Results**: GPs felt it was rarely necessary to refer patients. They were aware of guidelines and would refer if requested by a patient who fulfilled the guidelines criteria and/or who were missing considerable amounts of work.

- **Conclusion**: The introduction of the guidelines appears to coincide with what some may have hoped to be a desired effect of reducing adult sore throat referrals and subsequent tonsillectomies by increasing the number of episodes a patient must suffer before the referral threshold is met. GPs may find equipoise for tonsillectomy referral challenging as many patients express a strong preference.

### Recurrent throat infections (tonsillitis) [^112iL4tR]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis is clinical, and it can be difficult to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Rapid antigen testing has a very low sensitivity in diagnosing bacterial tonsillitis, but more accurate tests take longer to deliver results. Bacteria are cultured from few people with tonsillitis. Other causes include infectious mononucleosis from Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, hepatitis A, and rubella.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of tonsillectomy in children and adults with acute or chronic throat infections? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2006. BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, cold steel tonsillectomy, and diathermy tonsillectomy.

### Cefuroxime axetil [^116bucKm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (13 years and older) with mild-to-moderate pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pyogenes.

- **Limitations of use**: The efficacy of cefuroxime axetil tablets in the prevention of rheumatic fever was not established in clinical trials. Furthermore, the efficacy against penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.

Cefuroxime axetil tablets are also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients (who can swallow tablets whole) with acute bacterial otitis media due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including β-lactamase–producing strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (including β-lactamase–producing strains), or Streptococcus pyogenes.

For adult and pediatric patients (13 years and older) with mild-to-moderate acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis, cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated when caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae (non-β-lactamase–producing strains only).

- **Limitations of use**: The effectiveness of cefuroxime axetil tablets for sinus infections caused by β-lactamase–producing Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis in patients with acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis was not established due to insufficient numbers of these isolates in clinical trials.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117TWuXQ]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

- **Guideline panel and patient involvement**: According to the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, a guideline panel provided critical oversight to the review and identified populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. The panel included clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience of sore throat. Patients received personal training and support to optimize contributions throughout the guideline development process. The patients on the panel led the interpretation of the results based on what they expected the typical patient values and preferences to be, as well as the variation between patients. Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel and contributed to the selection and prioritization of outcomes, values, and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

- **Search strategy**: We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant published randomised controlled trials based on the strategy reported in the most recent Cochrane systematic review, modified under the guidance of a research librarian (appendix 1). We limited the search from 1 January 2010, which included a two-month overlap with the previous Cochrane review search, to 1 May 2017. There were no language restrictions. We reviewed reference lists from eligible new trials and related reviews for additional eligible trials.

### Pharyngitis [^116cRSaQ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Sore throat is one of the most common reasons for visits to family physicians. While most patients with a sore throat have an infectious cause (pharyngitis), fewer than 20 percent have a clear indication for antibiotic therapy (i.e.g.roup A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection). Useful, well-validated clinical decision rules are available to help family physicians care for patients who present with pharyngitis. Because of recent improvements in rapid streptococcal antigen tests, throat culture can be reserved for patients whose symptoms do not improve over time or who do not respond to antibiotics.

### Review: Diagnostic potential for collaborative pharyngitis biomarkers [^112qihkp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly observed in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria are the most frequently encountered etiologic agents; yeast, fungi, and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these are predominantly seen in unique populations, such as immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals. This manuscript (part 3 of 3) summarizes the state of biomarker diagnostic testing and highlights the expanding role they will likely play in the expedited diagnosis and management of patients with acute pharyngitis. Biomarkers, in conjunction with rapid antigen and/or nucleic acid amplification testing, will likely become the standard of care to accurately diagnose the etiologic agents of pharyngitis. This novel testing paradigm has the potential to guide appropriate patient management and antibiotic stewardship by accurately determining if the cause of pharyngitis is due to a viral or bacterial etiology.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^113xm9Qm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This review, first published in 2010 and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2021, aims to clarify this uncertainty.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). Additionally, to assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2023, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Elsevier, and Web of Science (Clarivate) up to 19 March 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, complications, and/or adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews.

### Assessing the quality of the management of tonsillitis among Australian children: A population-based sample survey [^113MQrcj]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The aims of this study were twofold: (1) to design and validate a set of clinical indicators of appropriate care for tonsillitis and (2) to measure the level of tonsillitis care that is in line with guideline recommendations in a sample of Australian children.

A set of tonsillitis care indicators was developed from available national and international guidelines and validated in four stages. This research used the same design as the CareTrack Kids study, which was described in detail elsewhere.

Samples of patient records from general practices, emergency departments, and hospital admissions were assessed. Patient records of children aged 0 to 15 years were evaluated for the presence of, and adherence to, the indicators for care delivered in 2012 and 2013.

Eleven indicators were developed. The records of 821 children (mean age, 5.0 years; SD, 4.0) with tonsillitis were screened. The reviewers conducted 2,354 eligible indicator assessments across 1,127 visits. Adherence to six indicators could be assessed and ranged from 14.3% to 73.2% (interquartile range 31.5% to 72.2%).

Our main findings are consistent with the international literature: the treatment of many children who present with confirmed or suspected tonsillitis is inconsistent with guidelines. Future research should consider how the indicators could be applied in a structured and automated manner to increase the reliability and efficiency of record reviews and help raise clinicians' awareness of appropriate tonsillitis management.

### Review: Known, emerging, and reemerging pharyngitis pathogens [^1153gQxv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most commonly encountered etiologic agents — yeast/fungi and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these are predominantly observed in unique populations (e.g. immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals). This article (part 1 of 3) summarizes the impact of acute pharyngitis on the health care system and reviews the etiologic agents of acute pharyngitis, including both emerging and reemerging pathogens that health care providers should consider when evaluating their patients. Finally, it sets the stage for parts 2 and 3, which discuss the evolving state of diagnostic testing for acute pharyngitis.

### MRI of acute neck infections: Evidence summary and pictorial review [^114WP489]. Insights into Imaging (2023). High credibility.

- **Main types of acute neck infections**:

	- **Pharyngotonsillar infections**: Tonsillitis, or pharyngotonsillitis, is an acute viral or bacterial infection of the oropharynx. The imaging characteristics of tonsillitis include edema and enhancement of the palatine tonsils and surrounding oropharyngeal mucosa, without abscess formation. Occasionally, the palatine tonsils exhibit a striped appearance on post-contrast T1-weighted images due to fluid in the tonsillar crypts. It is important not to confuse these stripes with small crescent-shaped abscesses.

- **Figure explanation**: Figure 13 demonstrates tonsillitis/peritonsillitis on axial (a, b) and coronal (c, d) post-contrast T1-weighted images in two patients. Note the striped appearance of the tonsils (indicated by arrows in a), peritonsillar enhancement (arrows in b – d), and the absence of any abscess formation.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: Randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^116QgiQb]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

A total of 433 patients were recruited and randomised by 17 primary healthcare centres, with a median of 23 patients (range 1–81) per centre. Patients were recruited between September 2015 and February 2018, with the final patient's last telephone follow-up performed in June 2018. Of the 433 randomised patients, 422 represented the modified intention-to-treat population, and 397 represented the per protocol population. Demographic and baseline data were comparable between the two intervention groups.

- **Flow diagram details**: Figure 1 presents the numbers of participants for each intervention group and the reasons for exclusions throughout the study. Seven healthcare centres out of 17 filled in a screening list and noted screening failures. It is defined as every patient who received at least one dose of study drug. MITT = modified intention to treat; PP = per protocol.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: a retrospective study [^112F1vk7]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

We performed a retrospective cohort study at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH), involving patients who had a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) and/or streptococcal throat culture in an outpatient setting from August 1, 2011, to July 31, 2012. The first 50 patients meeting inclusion criteria in each month of the study period were evaluated. Patients were excluded if they were 18 years of age or older, diagnosed with another bacterial infection during the visit, had a condition likely to cause deviation from typical pharyngitis management (e.g. neutropenia, airway compromise), were already taking antibiotics, or had been treated for GAS pharyngitis within the previous 30 days. Exclusion also applied if there was no visit documentation associated with the test; this included patients seen at local pediatric offices that use the BCH laboratory but have separate medical record systems. Information was obtained through a review of chart documentation, including notes, vital signs, lab results, and prescriptions. The study received approval from the Committee on Clinical Investigation at BCH.

- **Data collection**: Data abstracted from medical records included information about the visit (month, day of the week, time, and location) and the patient (age, gender, antibiotic allergies, comorbid illnesses, reasons for visit, maximum reported temperature in the previous 48 hours, history of cough, current antibiotics, and treatment for GAS pharyngitis within the previous 30 days).

### Acute pharyngitis [^117St1Y4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The primary care physician must identify patients with acute pharyngitis who require specific antimicrobial therapy while avoiding unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment for the majority of patients who have a benign, self-limited, usually viral infection. Differentiating between these two types of infection can often be easily accomplished by considering the epidemiological setting, history, physical findings, and results from a few readily available laboratory tests. When antimicrobial therapy is indicated, the safest, narrowest-spectrum, and most cost-effective drugs should be employed. Despite consensus on these principles by expert advisory committees, data from national surveys of ambulatory care reveal that antimicrobial agents continue to be prescribed indiscriminately for upper respiratory infections.

### Tonsillitis and tonsilloliths: Diagnosis and management [^116W8GFe]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, specifically in terms of indications for tonsillectomy, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend offering watchful waiting instead of tonsillectomy for patients with recurrent tonsillitis who have experienced:

- **Less than 7 episodes in the past year**: These patients are advised to undergo monitoring rather than immediate surgical intervention.

- **Less than 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years**: This threshold suggests that surgery may not be necessary.

- **Less than 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years**: This guideline supports a conservative management approach.

By adhering to these criteria, the recommendation is to adopt a strategy of careful observation over immediate surgical intervention in managing cases of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1135uPKm]. Otolaryngology — head and neck surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for tonsillectomy, particularly with respect to indications for the procedure, the AAO-HNSF 2019 guidelines recommend considering tonsillectomy in pediatric patients who experience recurrent throat infections. Specifically, tonsillectomy is advised if the child has had at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for two years, or at least 3 episodes per year for three years. Each episode of sore throat must be documented in the medical record and must include at least one of the following:

- **Temperature > 38.3 °C (> 101 °F)**: Elevated temperature indicating fever.
- **Cervical adenopathy**: Swelling of the cervical lymph nodes.
- **Tonsillar exudate**: Presence of pus on the tonsils.
- **Positive test for group A β-hemolytic streptococcus**: Confirmation of bacterial infection.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in adults: background, specific aims, and methods [^116bh6kw]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). High credibility.

The need to decrease excess antibiotic use in ambulatory practice has been fueled by the epidemic increase in antibiotic-resistant *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. The majority of antibiotics prescribed to adults in ambulatory practice in the United States are for acute sinusitis, acute pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, and nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections (including the common cold). For each of these conditions — especially colds, nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, and acute bronchitis (for which routine antibiotic treatment is not recommended) — a large proportion of the antibiotics prescribed are unlikely to provide clinical benefit to patients.

Because decreasing community use of antibiotics is an important strategy for combating the increase in community-acquired antibiotic-resistant infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a panel of physicians representing internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, and infectious diseases to develop a series of "Principles of Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Treatment of Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Adults". These principles provide evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment of adults with acute respiratory illnesses. This paper describes the background, specific aims, and methods used to develop these principles. The goal of the principles is to provide clinicians with practical strategies for limiting antibiotic use to the patients who are most likely to benefit from it.

### Diagnosis of strep throat in adults: Are clinical criteria really good enough [^113aYefM]? Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical manifestations of group A streptococcal and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis overlap quite broadly. For this reason, the updated Infectious Diseases Society of America practice guideline for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, published in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, recommends laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis by means of either throat culture or a rapid antigen detection test. However, a recently published guideline, developed by a subcommittee of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP-ASIM) in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, advocates use of a clinical algorithm alone, in lieu of microbiologic testing, for confirmation of the diagnosis in adults for whom the suspicion of streptococcal infection is high. In this discussion, we examine the assumptions of the ACP-ASIM guideline, question whether its recommendations will achieve the stated objective of dramatically decreasing excess antibiotic use, and suggest that its recommendations be confirmed by clinical trials before clinicians abandon long-held teachings regarding diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

### Pharyngitis management: Defining the controversy [^1149pYrX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines, and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis.

We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over-treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

Azithromycin is prescribed for different conditions, with specific dosages based on age and weight. It can be administered with or without food.

- **Acute bacterial sinusitis**: 10 mg/kg once daily for 3 days.

- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: A dosage of 10 mg/kg as a single dose on Day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg once daily from Days 2 through 5 is recommended.

- **Pharyngitis/tonsillitis**: Prescribed at 12 mg/kg once daily for a duration of 5 days. These dosages are determined based on the specific organisms indicated [see Indications and Usage (1.2)].

- **Pediatric dosage guidelines**: For otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis, and community-acquired pneumonia (age 6 months and older, see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)), the effectiveness of a 3-day or 1-day regimen in pediatric patients has not been established.

- **Otitis media and community-acquired pneumonia (5-day regimen)**: The dosing is calculated as 10 mg/kg on Day 1 and 5 mg/kg from Days 2 to 5, based on body weight:

### Is Helicobacter pylori colonization associated with chronic tonsillitis? - A meta-analysis and systematic review [^113hV9cJ]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between Helicobacter pylori colonization of tonsillar tissue in chronic tonsillitis and in noninfectious hyperplastic tonsils.

- **Materials and methods**: All included studies investigated the presence of Helicobacter pylori in tonsillar tissue removed for infectious or noninfectious factors. Included studies must have used an accepted method of testing for Helicobacter pylori. We pooled six eligible studies to perform a traditional meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Six studies were included, comprising 462 patients. Helicobacter pylori has a significant role in chronic tonsillitis compared with noninfectious indications for tonsillectomy in the pediatric population. Detection methods affected the results.

- **Conclusion**: The positive rate of Helicobacter pylori in the chronic tonsillitis group was significantly higher than in the simple noninfectious group for the pediatric population, but not for adults. We suspect that chronic tonsillitis is likely to be relevant to Helicobacter pylori.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^113TRu8s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although effectiveness increases in participants with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated.

- **Objectives**: To assess the evidence on the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in alleviating symptoms (pain, fever), shortening the duration of the illness, preventing relapse, and preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). Additionally, to evaluate the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 10, MEDLINE (1966 to October week 2, 2012), EMBASE (1974 to October 2012), and Web of Science (2010 to October 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, complications, or adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Seventeen trials (5352 participants) were included. Sixteen trials compared penicillin with other antibiotics (six with cephalosporins, six with macrolides, three with carbacephem, and one with sulfonamides). One trial compared clindamycin and ampicillin. Randomisation reporting, allocation concealment, and blinding were poor. There was no difference in symptom resolution between cephalosporin.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute pharyngitis in adults: Background [^112hzNXH]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute pharyngitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicated comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease, and a history of rheumatic fever. They do not apply during known outbreaks of group A streptococcus.

- **Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS)**: This is the causal agent in approximately 10% of adult cases of pharyngitis. The large majority of adults with acute pharyngitis have a self-limited illness, for which only supportive care is needed.

- **Antibiotic treatment**: Benefits only those patients with GABHS infection. All patients with pharyngitis should be offered appropriate doses of analgesics and antipyretics, as well as other supportive care.

- **Limit antibiotic prescriptions**: Limit prescriptions to patients who are most likely to have GABHS infection. Clinically screen all adult patients with pharyngitis for the presence of the four Centor criteria: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, no cough, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (lymphadenitis). Do not test or treat patients with none or only one of these criteria, since they are unlikely to have GABHS infection. For patients with two or more criteria, the following strategies are appropriate:
	- Test patients with two, three, or four criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results.
	- Test patients with two or three criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results or patients with four criteria.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: A clinical practice guideline [^113qrGFA]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids reflects a high value on a modest reduction of symptom severity and the time it takes to achieve such improvement and a substantial and important increase in the chance of complete resolution of pain at 48 hours.

The panel, including patient representatives, felt that the values and preferences are likely to vary greatly across patients, which justifies a weak recommendation. For example, achieving complete pain resolution 12 hours earlier may be of little importance for patients who feel less busy in their daily life, have a higher tolerance to pain, or whose symptoms are not so severe; whereas it may be very important to patients whose ability to go to school or perform at work is compromised, caregivers wishing to reduce their children's pain, or patients experiencing severe pain.

The panel believes that there is great variability in how much reduction in pain severity or time to complete pain resolution each patient would consider important. However, the greater the reduction in hours to achieve complete resolution of pain, the more likely it is that typical patients would place high value on those outcomes. Patients who place a high value on reducing symptoms by any amount (such as patients with lower tolerance to pain or with severe symptoms) are more likely to accept receiving corticosteroids.

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids also reflects concerns about acceptability, specifically how acceptable it is to treat a condition that is usually self-limiting with medications.

### Infectious indications for tonsillectomy [^111rcuwg]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Tonsillectomy is the most common major surgery performed on children in the United States. Throat infections of either bacterial or viral etiology can cause significant morbidity and decreased quality of life, and potentially lead to life-threatening complications. When performed in the proper patient, tonsillectomy can be a highly effective procedure. Recent clinical trials have sought to better define the appropriate infectious indications for surgery. Despite the improved understanding gained from these studies, the decision to operate must always be made on an individual basis with the primary care physician, surgeon, patient, and family all involved in the decision-making process.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tonsillectomy in children (update) [^114FXw6Y]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for tonsillectomy, the AAO-HNSF 2019 guidelines focus specifically on indications for tonsillectomy. They recommend evaluating pediatric patients with throat infections who do not meet the criteria for tonsillectomy. It is important to consider modifying factors that may favor the procedure, including but not limited to:

- **Multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance**: Patients with antibiotic sensitivities may benefit from tonsillectomy to prevent complications.

- **Periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome (PFAPA)**: This syndrome is a consideration when evaluating throat infections.

- **History of more than one peritonsillar abscess**: Patients with recurrent abscesses can be candidates for tonsillectomy to prevent further occurrences.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute pharyngitis in adults: background [^113SCypi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute pharyngitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicated comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease, or a history of rheumatic fever. These principles do not apply during known outbreaks of group A streptococcus.

- **Causal agent**: Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is responsible for approximately 10% of adult cases of pharyngitis. The majority of adults with acute pharyngitis have a self-limited illness, for which only supportive care is needed. Antibiotic treatment benefits only those patients with GABHS infection. All patients with pharyngitis should be offered appropriate doses of analgesics and antipyretics, along with other supportive care.

Do not test or treat patients with none or only one of these criteria, as they are unlikely to have GABHS infection.

- **Testing strategies**: For patients with two or more criteria, the following strategies are appropriate:
	- Test patients with two, three, or four criteria using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results.
	- Test patients with two or three criteria using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results, or patients with four criteria.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^114AaBsW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). Additionally, to assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^114dQPo6]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat. The study was designed as a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials.

Data sources included Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, and reference lists of eligible trials and related reviews.

- **Study selection**: Randomised controlled trials were included that added corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings exhibiting clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat. Trials were included regardless of language or publication status.

- **Review methods**: Reviewers independently and in duplicate identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. The random effects model was used for meta-analyses, and the quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.

The results indicated that 10 eligible trials enrolled 1,426 individuals. Patients who received a single low dose of corticosteroids, most commonly oral dexamethasone at a maximum dose of 10 mg, were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5; 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%).

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113jLX4r]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

Despite previous evidence suggesting that corticosteroids might be beneficial, several groups and guidelines currently recommend against their routine use. This is because the evidence was previously applicable only to patients with severe pharyngitis who were also prescribed antibiotics in an emergency department. The body of evidence now includes a broader representation of patients. The largest and most recent randomized controlled trial included 565 patients who presented to their general practitioner rather than an emergency department, and none initially received antibiotics. We found no subgroup differences with respect to the patient group; the evidence seems to apply equally to patients who did and did not receive antibiotics. The evidence also applies equally to patients with sore throats caused by group A β haemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis and those with sore throats negative for group A β haemolytic streptococcus.

In the five trials that reported co-interventions, about 80% of participants received additional analgesics such as paracetamol and NSAIDs. Therefore, a single dose of corticosteroids seems to further reduce pain when used in combination with other analgesics. Although the benefits are relatively small, many patients are likely to consider them important. However, patients with less severe sore throats will obtain less absolute benefit from corticosteroids. Thus, the balance of benefits and harms almost certainly depends on the severity of the patient's sore throat. With available evidence suggesting that serious adverse effects are rare or absent, the addition…

### Review: Known, emerging, and reemerging pharyngitis pathogens [^114miVT2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most commonly encountered etiologic agents, while yeast/fungi and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these pathogens are predominantly observed in unique populations, such as immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals. This article, part one of three, summarizes the impact of acute pharyngitis on the healthcare system.

- **Etiologic agents**: This section reviews the etiologic agents of acute pharyngitis, including both emerging and reemerging pathogens that healthcare providers should consider when evaluating their patients.

Finally, the article sets the stage for parts two and three, which discuss the evolving state of diagnostic testing for acute pharyngitis.

### Tonsillitis [^117HEKjo]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Low credibility.

The definition of severe throat infections is arbitrary, but recent criteria have defined severe tonsillitis as: five or more episodes of true tonsillitis a year, symptoms for at least one year, and episodes that are disabling and prevent normal functioning. Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis is clinical, and it can be difficult to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Rapid antigen testing has a very low sensitivity in diagnosing bacterial tonsillitis, but more accurate tests take longer to deliver results. Bacteria are cultured from few people with tonsillitis. Other causes include infectious mononucleosis from Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, hepatitis A, and rubella.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of tonsillectomy in children and adults with acute or chronic throat infections? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2014. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness of interventions for tonsillitis.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in adults: background, specific aims, and methods [^111wvbPt]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The need to decrease excess antibiotic use in ambulatory practice has been fueled by the epidemic increase in antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The majority of antibiotics prescribed to adults in ambulatory practice in the United States are for acute sinusitis, acute pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, and nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections (including the common cold). For each of these conditions — especially colds, nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, and acute bronchitis (for which routine antibiotic treatment is not recommended) — a large proportion of the antibiotics prescribed are unlikely to provide clinical benefit to patients.

Because decreasing community use of antibiotics is an important strategy for combating the increase in community-acquired antibiotic-resistant infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a panel of physicians representing the disciplines of internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, and infectious diseases to develop a series of "Principles of Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Treatment of Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Adults". These principles provide evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment of adults with acute respiratory illnesses. This paper describes the background, specific aims, and methods used to develop these principles. The goal of the principles is to provide clinicians with practical strategies for limiting antibiotic use to the patients who are most likely to benefit from it.

### Necrotizing tonsillitis caused by group C beta-hemolytic streptococci [^113v5WEz]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Tonsillitis and pharyngitis are among the most common infections in the head and neck. Viral tonsillitis is usually caused by enterovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus (causing infectious mononucleosis). Acute bacterial tonsillitis is most commonly caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.

On the other hand, pseudomembranous and necrotizing tonsillitis are usually caused by fusiform bacilli and spirochetes. Here we report what is, to our knowledge, the first case of necrotizing tonsillitis caused by group C beta-hemolytic streptococci.

### Tonsillar Helicobacter pylori colonization in chronic tonsillitis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111QedyA]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori colonization contributes significantly to multiple disease states, but its role in the development of tonsillar infection is unclear. Understanding the causes of chronic tonsillitis is important in clinical decision-making for this commonly treated disease.

- **Objective**: To assess the correlation between H. pylori colonization of tonsillar tissue in chronic tonsillitis and in noninfectious hyperplastic tonsils.

- **Data sources**: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Trial Registry (through June 2014), and relevant article bibliographies.

- **Study selection**: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing the correlation between H. pylori colonization in tonsillar tissues of patients undergoing tonsillectomy for either chronic tonsillitis or noninfectious causes. Included studies hypothesized that H. pylori played a role in the development of chronic tonsillitis. All included studies investigated the presence of H. pylori in tonsillar tissue removed for various indications. Included studies must have used an accepted method of testing for H. pylori.

- **Data extraction and analysis**: Studies were systematically reviewed by two independent reviewers for inclusion. Reported results of H. pylori testing between tissues removed for infectious or noninfectious causes were systematically reviewed. The odds ratio of H. pylori colonization in tissue removed for chronic tonsillitis compared with tissue removed for noninfectious causes was calculated using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: Six studies met inclusion criteria and had suitable data for pooling.

### Diagnosis and management of pharyngitis in a pediatric population based on cost-effectiveness and projected health outcomes [^116vNE7H]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Pharyngitis is a common childhood complaint. Management for children and adolescents includes one of six strategies: (1) observe without testing or treatment, (2) treat all suspected cases with an antibiotic, (3) treat those with positive throat cultures, (4) treat those with positive rapid tests, (5) treat those with positive rapid tests and those with positive throat cultures after negative rapid tests, or (6) use a clinical scoring measure to determine the diagnosis/treatment strategy. The sequelae of untreated group A hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis are rare, whereas antibiotic treatment may result in side effects ranging from rash to death. The cost-utility of these strategies for children has not been reported previously.

- **Methods**: A decision tree analysis incorporating the total cost and health impact of each management strategy was used to determine cost per quality-adjusted life-year ratios. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations assessed the accuracy of the estimates.

- **Results**: From a societal perspective with Medicaid reimbursements for testing, performing a throat culture for all patients had the best cost-utility. For private insurance reimbursements, rapid antigen testing had the best cost-utility. Observing without testing or treatment had the lowest morbidity rate and highest cost from a societal perspective but the lowest cost from a payer perspective. The model was most sensitive to the incidence of acute rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess after untreated GAS pharyngitis. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated…

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: A clinical practice guideline [^116kw671]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Acute sore throat is defined as pain in the throat lasting less than 14 days. It can be caused by conditions such as pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis, tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, or retropharyngeal abscess. Patients with sore throat may also experience headache, fever, muscle stiffness, cough, and general malaise.

Acute sore throat is common, but only a minority of patients will visit their general practitioner. A survey reported that the main reasons for visits are to establish the cause of the symptoms, obtain pain relief, and gain information on the course of the disease. Data from Dutch and Flemish primary care databases show that, for every 1,000 consecutive patients consulting a general practitioner, 50 present with an acute sore throat. In the US, more than 92 million visits by adults to primary care practices and emergency departments between 1997 and 2010 were recorded. Sore throat presenting as acute tonsillitis is also the most common cause for emergency admission to otorhinolaryngology services in the US.

Acute sore throat is a self-limiting disease, typically resolving after 7–10 days in adults and 2–7 days in children. Most infections are of viral origin; only a few are caused by bacterial infections, with group A β-haemolytic streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis being the most common pathogens. Evidence suggests that the time to resolution is not associated with the type of pathogen. About 2% of patients initially presenting with sore throat will have a mononucleosis infection caused by Epstein-Barr virus, which could prolong the duration.

### Diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis [^114WGiQz]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Common signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis include a sore throat, a temperature greater than 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C), tonsillar exudates, and cervical adenopathy. In contrast, cough, coryza, and diarrhea are more common with viral pharyngitis. Diagnostic tests available for streptococcal pharyngitis include throat culture and rapid antigen detection testing. Though throat culture is considered the diagnostic standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antigen detection testing have significantly improved.

The modified Centor score can assist physicians in determining whether patients require no testing, throat culture/rapid antigen detection testing, or empiric antibiotic therapy. Penicillin remains the treatment of choice due to its cost-effectiveness, narrow spectrum of activity, and effectiveness. Amoxicillin is equally effective and more palatable. In patients with a penicillin allergy, erythromycin and first-generation cephalosporins are viable options.

There have been reports of increased treatment failure with penicillin in cases of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS). Guidelines recommend first-generation cephalosporins for individuals with a penicillin allergy. However, some suggest using cephalosporins in all non-allergic patients because of improved GABHS eradication and effectiveness against chronic GABHS carriage. Although chronic GABHS colonization remains common despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, chronic carriers are at low risk of transmitting the disease or developing invasive GABHS infections, and generally, there is no need to treat carriers.
