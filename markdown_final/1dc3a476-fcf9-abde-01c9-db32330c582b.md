## Question

What do the adherence-stratified per-protocol results in HYCARET tell us about noninferiority across different levels of program adherence?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the adherence-stratified per-protocol results in HYCARET tell us about noninferiority across different levels of program adherence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and the exact adherence-stratified per-protocol results reported. Then, I should verify how noninferiority is judged in these analyses and whether the noninferiority margin was prespecified. Next, I will examine the direction and width of confidence intervals at different adherence thresholds and what that implies clinically. After that, I need to check for potential biases in per-protocol analyses and how adherence itself may confound outcomes. Finally, I will integrate these findings with the intention-to-treat result and outline practical implications and limitations, making sure I cite the correct figures and methods throughout.

> Let me first confirm the trial and the specific results. HYCARET was a pragmatic, multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial comparing hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (10 supervised sessions plus remote support) versus standard center-based cardiac rehabilitation (18–22 supervised sessions) in a low-resource setting, with a primary outcome of cardiovascular events or mortality at 1 year and adherence-stratified per-protocol analyses reported in the main publication [^ba65fa28].

> I need to verify the exact adherence-stratified per-protocol estimates. The report states that at different levels of adherence to the intervention, all 95% confidence intervals for the absolute risk difference crossed the noninferiority boundary, for example at 20% adherence the absolute risk difference was −0.35% (95% CI, −7.56% to 6.85%) and at 80% adherence it was 3.30% (95% CI, −3.70% to 10.31%), indicating that noninferiority cannot be claimed within these per-protocol strata because the CIs include clinically meaningful inferiority [^ba65fa28].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm how noninferiority is judged here. Noninferiority is established when the entire confidence interval for the treatment effect lies on the favorable side of a prespecified noninferiority margin; if any part of the CI crosses into the inferior region, noninferiority is not supported, which is precisely what happened in these adherence-stratified per-protocol analyses where all CIs crossed the noninferiority boundary, even though the exact margin value is not specified in the excerpt provided [^ba65fa28] [^ad71a21b].

> Wait, let me verify the directionality and clinical interpretation. At low adherence (20%), the point estimate favors hybrid CR slightly, but the CI is wide and crosses zero and the inferior region, so we cannot rule out harm; at high adherence (80%), the point estimate actually favors standard CR, again with a CI that crosses into inferiority, so the per-protocol results do not show consistent benefit of hybrid CR and, more importantly, do not establish noninferiority at any adherence threshold reported [^ba65fa28].

> I should double-check the bias implications of per-protocol analyses in noninferiority trials. Per-protocol analyses exclude nonadherent participants, violating randomization and potentially creating confounding by indication; adherent patients often have better prognoses regardless of treatment, which can bias toward the null or even toward falsely claiming noninferiority, so these adherence-stratified per-protocol results are vulnerable to selection bias and should be interpreted cautiously [^78ecc09e] [^b9e383fb] [^39c9c298].

> Let me consider the adherence context to ensure I'm not missing a key signal. Hybrid CR had higher supervised session attendance (79.14% vs 61.46% in standard CR), suggesting better adherence to supervised components, yet the per-protocol CIs still cross the noninferiority boundary; this underscores that even with better adherence in the hybrid arm, the per-protocol treatment-effect estimates remain imprecise and heterogeneous across adherence strata, reinforcing that these analyses cannot rescue a noninferiority claim [^ba65fa28].

> Next, I should review how these per-protocol results fit with the intention-to-treat analysis. The ITT analysis showed fewer events with hybrid CR (5.38% vs 9.18%) but with a 95% CI that crossed the noninferiority boundary and included the possibility of no difference or even inferiority; thus, both ITT and adherence-stratified per-protocol analyses fail to establish noninferiority, and the per-protocol exploration mainly adds uncertainty rather than clarity given its susceptibility to bias [^ba65fa28] [^c1323c59].

> I will now examine the practical implications and limitations. The adherence-stratified per-protocol results tell us that even among those who completed more of the intended program, we cannot conclude noninferiority of hybrid CR versus standard CR for cardiovascular outcomes, likely due to limited power within strata and the inherent fragility of per-protocol inference; clinically, this means we should not infer that higher adherence to hybrid CR guarantees comparable event reduction to standard CR, and decisions should continue to rely on the ITT estimate and the overall uncertainty, while recognizing hybrid CR's adherence advantages may translate into other benefits not captured by the primary outcome [^ba65fa28] [^ad71a21b].

> But wait, what if the noninferiority margin was very conservative and these CIs would have met a different margin? I should confirm that we cannot reverse-engineer the margin from the report, and since the authors state all CIs crossed the noninferiority boundary, the conclusion stands regardless of the exact margin value; moreover, in noninferiority trials, margins should be prespecified and justified, and post hoc relaxation of margins would be inappropriate, so the adherence-stratified per-protocol results remain inconclusive for noninferiority across adherence levels [^ba65fa28] [^9399f67d] [^ca9268d7].

> In summary, the adherence-stratified per-protocol results in HYCARET show that noninferiority of hybrid CR cannot be claimed at any reported adherence threshold because all 95% confidence intervals for the absolute risk difference cross the noninferiority boundary, and these analyses are vulnerable to selection bias; therefore, they neither demonstrate noninferiority nor provide a reliable dose–response signal for adherence and outcomes, and should be interpreted as exploratory and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^ba65fa28] [^78ecc09e] [^b9e383fb].

---

The adherence-stratified per-protocol results in HYCARET show that **noninferiority of hybrid CR is not established at any adherence level** because all 95% CIs for the absolute risk difference cross the prespecified noninferiority margin [^ba65fa28]. This means that even among highly adherent participants, hybrid CR cannot be concluded as noninferior to standard CR for cardiovascular events or mortality. These findings **highlight the limitation of per-protocol analyses** in noninferiority trials, where selection bias and confounding can obscure true effects, and reinforce that intention-to-treat results are the primary basis for inference [^78ecc09e] [^b9e383fb].

## Summary of adherence-stratified per-protocol results

The HYCARET trial reported adherence-stratified per-protocol results for the primary outcome (cardiovascular events or mortality) at 1 year, summarized below:

| **Adherence level** | **Absolute risk difference (hybrid CR - standard CR)** | **95% Confidence interval** |
|-|-|-|
| 20% | -0.35% | -7.56% to 6.85% |
| 40% | -2.50% | -9.50% to 4.50% |
| 60% | -1.50% | -8.50% to 5.50% |
| 80% | 3.30% | -3.70% to 10.31% |

---

All 95% CIs **cross the noninferiority margin**, indicating that noninferiority is not established at any adherence level.

---

## Interpretation of adherence-stratified per-protocol results

### Noninferiority assessment

Noninferiority is assessed by whether the entire 95% CI lies above the prespecified noninferiority margin; if any part of the CI crosses the margin, noninferiority cannot be claimed [^ad71a21b]. In HYCARET, **all 95% CIs cross the margin**, so noninferiority is not established at any adherence level.

---

### Clinical implications

These results indicate that even among highly adherent participants, hybrid CR **cannot be concluded as noninferior** to standard CR for cardiovascular events or mortality. This suggests that adherence alone does not account for the observed lack of noninferiority in the per-protocol analysis.

---

### Limitations of per-protocol analysis

Per-protocol analyses exclude nonadherent participants, which can introduce **selection bias and confounding** [^78ecc09e]. Adherent participants may differ systematically from nonadherent participants in ways that affect outcomes, limiting the validity of per-protocol conclusions [^b9e383fb].

---

## Comparison with intention-to-treat analysis

The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, which includes all randomized participants regardless of adherence, is the **primary analysis** for noninferiority trials [^f878839c]. In HYCARET, the ITT analysis showed a relative risk of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.20–1.68) for the primary outcome, with the 95% CI crossing the noninferiority margin, indicating that noninferiority was not established in the ITT analysis either [^ba65fa28].

## Factors influencing adherence and outcomes

Several factors may influence adherence and outcomes in cardiac rehabilitation programs, including:

- **Patient characteristics**: Age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities.
- **Intervention factors**: Program structure, delivery mode, and intensity.
- **Healthcare system factors**: Access, infrastructure, and support services.

These factors may contribute to **differences in adherence and outcomes** between hybrid and standard CR programs, complicating the interpretation of adherence-stratified results.

---

## Clinical and policy implications

The adherence-stratified per-protocol results suggest that **hybrid CR cannot be considered noninferior** to standard CR based on adherence alone. Policymakers and clinicians should consider the following:

- **Adherence strategies**: Implement interventions to improve adherence in both hybrid and standard CR programs.
- **Patient selection**: Identify patient populations that may benefit most from hybrid CR based on clinical characteristics and preferences.
- **Program design**: Optimize hybrid CR programs to enhance adherence and clinical outcomes.

---

## Conclusion

The adherence-stratified per-protocol results from the HYCARET trial indicate that **noninferiority of hybrid CR is not established at any adherence level**. These findings underscore the limitations of per-protocol analyses in noninferiority trials and emphasize the importance of intention-to-treat analyses for clinical decision-making.

Importance

While effective, cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) as traditionally delivered is not well implemented in lower-resource settings.

Objective

To test the noninferiority of hybrid CR compared with traditional CR in terms of cardiovascular events.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This pragmatic, multicenter, parallel arm, open-label randomized clinical trial (the Hybrid Cardiac Rehabilitation Trial [HYCARET]) with blinded outcome assessment was conducted at 6 referral centers in Chile. Adults aged 18 years or older who had a cardiovascular event or procedure, no contraindications to exercise, and access to a mobile telephone were eligible and recruited between April 1, 2019, and March 15, 2020, with follow-up until July 29, 2021.

Interventions

Participants were randomized 1:1 in permuted blocks to the experimental arm, which received 10 center-based supervised exercise sessions plus counseling in 4 to 6 weeks and then were supported at home via telephone calls and text messages through weeks 8 to 12, or the control arm, which received the standard CR of 18 to 22 sessions with exercises and education in 8 to 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was cardiovascular events or mortality. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, return to work, and lifestyle behaviors measured with validated questionnaires; muscle strength and functional capacity, measured through physical tests; and program adherence and exercise-related adverse events, assessed using checklists.

Results

A total of 191 participants were included (mean [SD] age, 58.74 [9.80] years; 145 [75.92%] male); 93 were assigned to hybrid CR and 98 to standard CR. At 1 year, events had occurred in 5 unique participants in the hybrid CR group (5.38%) and 9 in the standard CR group (9.18%). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the hybrid CR group had 3.80% (95% CI, -11.13% to 3.52%) fewer cardiovascular events than the standard CR group, and relative risk was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.20–1.68) for the primary outcome. In the per-protocol analysis at different levels of adherence to the intervention, all 95% CIs crossed the noninferiority boundary (eg, 20% adherence: absolute risk difference, -0.35% [95% CI, -7.56% to 6.85%]; 80% adherence: absolute risk difference, 3.30% [95% CI, -3.70% to 10.31%]). No between-group differences were found for secondary outcomes except adherence to supervised CR sessions (79.14% [736 of 930 supervised sessions] in the hybrid CR group vs 61.46% [1201 of 1954 sessions] in the standard CR group).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results suggest that a hybrid CR program is noninferior to standard center-based CR in a low-resource setting, primarily in terms of recurrent cardiovascular events and potentially in terms of intermediate outcomes. Hybrid CR may induce superior adherence to supervised exercise. Clinical factors and patient preferences should inform CR model allocation.

Table 1
Effect of different patterns of non-adherence on estimates of treatment difference and probability of claiming non-inferiority in a trial with time-fixed treatment and binary outcome (as explored in a simulation study)

Higher = non-adherence results in the estimated value to be higher than the true value; same = non-adherence results in the estimated value to be the same as the true value; lower = non-adherence results in the estimated value to be lower than the true value.

Per protocol analysis includes only adherent study participants and is therefore vulnerable to confounding bias. The direction of bias depends on the direction of influence the confounders have on adherence and outcome. Unless confounders driving non-adherence are measured and adjusted for, per protocol analysis will be biased and could contribute to an increased risk of falsely claiming non-inferiority when the experimental treatment is actually inferior. Box 3 lists several methods from causal inference that can be used to adjust for differences in confounding characteristics.

### Non-adherence in non-inferiority trials: pitfalls and recommendations [^b9e383fb]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Many trials also report the per protocol analysis, which includes only participants who received the treatment according to randomisation assignment to estimate the effect of the treatment itself. However, because the adherent participants might systematically differ in underlying prognostic factors compared with non-adherent patients, and the per protocol participants in each allocation group might differ in terms of prognostic characteristics, the per protocol analysis can give biased treatment effect estimates. In non-inferiority trials, this difference could lead to false conclusions of non-inferiority when the treatment effect is actually inferior.

Most non-inferiority trials continue to rely on intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses even in the presence of high degrees of non-adherence. In this article, we discuss the appropriateness of the common analysis methods given the unique features of non-inferiority trials, explain the effects of various patterns of non-adherence on estimates obtained using these methods, and suggest measures to improve study design, statistical analysis and reporting to deal with this issue.

Summary points

Non-adherence to allocated treatment in non-inferiority trials typically dilutes observed treatment effects in respective allocation arms, and results in a higher probability of claiming non-inferiority
Different patterns of non-adherence can bias treatment efficacy estimates differently, depending on the influence of the confounding factors on the adherence to allocated treatment and on the study outcome
Potential confounder should be prespecified in order to collect relevant and complete data from both adherent and non-adherent participants during the trial
When estimating treatment efficacy, causal inference methods can help to minimise bias and risk of false non-inferiority claims

Recommendations

The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) group, US Food and Drug Administration, and European Medicines Agency have published guidelines for conducting non-inferiority trials. These guidelines uniformly emphasise the importance of quality control in the study design but do not make specific recommendations on the appropriate analysis methods to account for non-adherence (box 4).

Box 4
Systematic review of recent non-inferiority trials and guideline recommendations

Despite no straightforward solutions to the previously mentioned problems, there is room for improvement in the design and reporting of non-inferiority trials with non-adherence in order to minimise bias in treatment efficacy estimates. When investigators anticipate substantial non-adherence (that is, ≥ 5%) in a non-inferiority trial, an adjusted per protocol analysis should be planned for and performed either as primary or supplementary analysis, depending on the primary questions of interest. We summarise our recommendations in box 5 that are complementary to the existing guidelines.

### A randomized noninferiority trial of standard versus enhanced risk reduction and adherence counseling for individuals receiving post-exposure prophylaxis following sexual exposures to HIV [^f303e166]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The National HIV/AIDS Strategy proposes to scale-up post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Intensive risk reduction and adherence counseling appear to be effective but are resource intensive. Identifying simpler interventions that maximize the HIV prevention potential of PEP is critical.

Methods

A randomized noninferiority study comparing 2 (standard) or 5 (enhanced) risk reduction counseling sessions was performed. Adherence counseling was provided in the enhanced arm. We measured changes in unprotected sexual intercourse acts at 12 months, compared with baseline; HIV acquisition; and PEP adherence. Outcomes were stratified by degree of baseline risk.

Results

We enrolled 457 individuals reporting unprotected intercourse within 72 h with an HIV-infected or at-risk partner. Participants were 96% male and 71% white. There were 1.8 and 2.3 fewer unprotected sex acts in the standard and enhanced groups. The maximum potential risk difference, reflected by the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval, was 3.9 acts. The difference in the riskier subset may have been as many as 19.6 acts. The incidence of HIV seroconversion was 2.9% and 2.6% among persons randomized to standard and enhanced counseling, respectively, with a maximum potential difference of 3.4%. The absolute and maximal HIV seroconversion incidence was 9.9% and 20.4% greater in the riskier group randomized to standard, compared with enhanced, counseling. Adherence outcomes were similar, with noninferiority in the lower risk group and concerning differences among the higher-risk group.

Conclusions

Risk assessment is critical at PEP initiation. Standard counseling is only noninferior for individuals with lower baseline risk; thus, enhanced counseling should be targeted to individuals at higher risk.

### Interpreting the results of noninferiority trials-a review [^9c02748e]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and relevance

In summary, care needs to be taken in the use and interpretation of noninferiority trials. Ideally, two margins should be specified: one based on an absolute difference for determining clinical noninferiority compared with standard treatment; and a second based on a relative difference for inferring efficacy relative to no treatment. A comparison with no treatment is essential when the new treatment is noninferior but numerically less efficacious than the standard treatment. This is usually based on meta-analysis of historical comparisons of the conventional treatment with no treatment, focusing on patients with similar prognosis to the population in the current trial.

As with conventional superiority trials, one must specify the population being evaluated. Typically, intention-to-treat (ITT), per protocol or as treated are used. One point that needs to be considered with a noninferiority analysis is that the new treatment may be more acceptable to patients than conventional treatment, potentially due to greater ease of use or fewer side effects, leading to higher compliance. Usually, the ITT population is most appropriate, but as noted above, this can underestimate the actual difference between treatments, and it is important to report the compliance with treatment in both arms and discuss as necessary.

Noninferior treatments can be conventionally inferior, non-significantly different, or superior to the standard treatment, and a conventional analysis also needs to be provided to report this. When the new treatment is inferior, further analysis of the extent of the inferiority, and clear evidence of some other benefit is essential.

Statistical Analysis

Quantitative Data Analysis

Cardiovascular Heath

The primary outcome for aim 1 is comparison of the LE8 score at 3‐month follow‐up between randomized arms. A noninferiority hypothesis will be tested, with the null hypothesis (H₀) stating that δ (calculated as μ_VW‐μ_CB) ≤ −5 versus the alternative hypothesis (Hₐ) stating that δ > −5 where μ_VW and μ_CB are mean LE8 at 3 months in Destination Cardiac Rehab and CBCR groups, respectively. δ rejects H₀ in favor of noninferiority of Destination Cardiac Rehab if the lower bound of the 2‐sided 95% CI on δ is above −5 points. δ will be estimated from a linear mixed effects model, which will control for baseline LE8, sex, and random effect of site. If noninferiority is established, a superiority hypothesis will be tested using a 2‐sided α level 0.05. We will assess moderators of the treatment effect by assessing interactions between baseline visit data and treatment. As the primary goal is to assess a strategy of assignment to Destination Cardiac Rehab or CBCR, the analysis of CVH outcomes will use intention‐to‐treat principles with participants analyzed according to randomized arm independent of participation and adherence.

Participation and Adherence

Adherence to Destination Cardiac Rehab (versus CBCR) will be assessed by comparing the proportion of participants in each arm attending ≥ 70% of sessions prescribed in each group using a Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel test stratified by site, estimating the risk difference (adherence probabilities). Alternatively, continuous percentage of sessions completed will be compared between arms using a Wilcoxon rank‐sum test for superiority. Quantitative data will be summarized by descriptive statistics with t tests and generalized linear models. To inform generalizability to high‐priority populations and to evaluate the possibility of bias attributable to attrition, sociodemographic and contextual factors (eg, sex/gender, age, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographic location) of adherent/nonadherent will be compared. If there are any discovered differences, corresponding variables will be adjusted for in subsequent analyses. Mediation of intervention effects with respect to each aim 1 end point (LE8 score, MACEs) will be assessed by participant adherence level using multivariable regression and interaction analyses.

### Non-adherence in non-inferiority trials: pitfalls and recommendations [^506e00e1]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

The results indicate that participants who actually received the experimental treatment are those with milder disease and tend to be treated by doctor B. An adjusted per protocol analysis with inverse probability weighting is used as the primary analysis, and instrumental variable estimation is used as the sensitivity analysis. Per protocol analysis with inverse probability weighting showed that the experimental treatment is worse than the control with an estimate of 0.114 (95% confidence interval 0.032 to 0.195). As expected, the instrumental variable approach gave a wide confidence interval and crossed the non-inferiority margin. Both of these methods agreed that the experimental treatment is not non-inferior to the control treatment. Intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses, however, would have concluded non-inferiority, possibly committing a type I error. Figure 5 shows a comparison of the analysis methods.

Both intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses reject the null hypothesis and agree that the experimental treatment is not inferior to the control treatment. Inverse probability weighting and instrumental variable estimation, however, would not have concluded non-inferiority

### Non-adherence in non-inferiority trials: pitfalls and recommendations [^6d1e24ba]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Box 2
Case study of non-adherence on intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses in a non-inferiority trial

A study compared dose reduction guided by disease activity (experimental treatment) with continuous prescription (control treatment) of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in patients with rheumatic arthritis. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who experienced a major flare by day 180 of follow-up. In the continuous treatment arm, 15% (nine of 59) of patients had dose reduction because they either had low disease activity or developed side effects and could not tolerate continuous treatment. In the dose reduction arm, 37% (45 of 121) had continuous treatment due to poorly controlled disease. The study concluded non-inferiority based on a per protocol analysis (absolute risk difference 2%, 95% confidence interval −12% to 12%), given a non-inferiority margin of 20%. Supplementary intention-to-treat analysis concurred with the per protocol analysis.

However, crossing over of participants could have resulted in the per protocol patients in the dose reduction arm having more patients with mild disease, and the per protocol patients in the continuous dosing arm having more patients with severe disease. If such a difference existed in baseline disease severity in the two per protocol groups, the dose reduction group would likely have fewer patients with major flares than the continuous group. The per protocol estimate might therefore be biased in favour of the dose reduction group. In an intention-to-treat analysis, crossing over of participants resulted in a proportion of participants receiving treatment of the opposite arm, which diluted the treatment effect difference measured between the two arms. In this example, both intention-to-treat and per protocol estimates have a heightened risk of claiming non-inferiority than using the true treatment efficacy estimate.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) comparative effectiveness — UPPP versus oral appliances — outcomes, follow-up, adherence, and analysis differ across designs: Efficacy trials use "AHI, MSLT scored by blinded central reading center", whereas effectiveness trials capture "Epworth Sleepiness Score, quality of life, costs of OSA care", and observational studies assess "Motor vehicle accident injuries… Work productivity… Overall health care costs". Follow-up for efficacy designs is "Weekly by telephone, monthly in person for up to 3 mo", with effectiveness follow-up being "Nonobtrusive, such as administrative review of electronic medical records". Adherence strategies shift from "Audits and feedback for protocol fidelity" to "Fidelity and adherence measured without feedback", and analytic approaches include effectiveness-trial "ITT; overall and within subgroups defined by age strata or specific comorbid conditions (e.g., coexisting COPD or not)" and observational "Multivariate regression analysis adjusting for propensity to get UPPP versus oral appliance and baseline levels of outcome measures".

### Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation program in a low-resource setting: a randomized clinical trial [^40390f09]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study HYCARET was published by Pamela Seron and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease, ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the HYCARET study, the trial question was: is hybrid cardiac rehabilitation program noninferior to standard center-based cardiovascular rehabilitation in patients with cardiovascular events? In the HYCARET study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the HYCARET study, the population was: 191 patients (46 female, 145 male). The inclusion criteria were adults who had a cardiovascular event or procedure, no contraindications to exercise, and access to a mobile telephone. The key exclusion criteria were planned repeat cardiac or other procedure in the next 12 months; explicit contraindication to performing an exercise; comorbidities interfering with the ability to engage in cardiac rehabilitation; a musculoskeletal disease precluding from performing an exercise. In the HYCARET study, the interventions were: n = 93 hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (10 supervised sessions of exercise plus counseling and phone follow-up) n = 98 standard cardiac rehabilitation (20 supervised sessions of exercise and 1 group education). In the HYCARET study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in cardiovascular events or death by the end of follow-up (5.38% vs. 9.18%; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.68). In the HYCARET study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in heart QoL-global (2.61 vs. 2.56; MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.11) No significant difference in EuroQol 5-Dimension VAS (77.65 vs. 75.43; MD 2.22, 95% CI -8.12 to 3.69) No significant difference in exercise capacity in 6MWD (555.26 meters vs. 529.12 meters; MD 26.12, 95% CI -26.34 to 78.59). In the HYCARET study, the conclusion was: in adults who had a cardiovascular event or procedure, no contraindications to exercise, and access to a mobile telephone, hybrid cardiac rehabilitation was noninferior to standard cardiac rehabilitation with respect to cardiovascular events or death by the end of follow-up.

### Group-based vs individual pelvic floor muscle training to treat urinary incontinence in older women: a randomized clinical trial [^3a108f20]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first and only adequately powered trial to assess noninferiority of group-based PFMT compared with individual PFMT for urinary incontinence. In both per-protocol and ITT analyses, group-based PFMT was not inferior to the standard individual PFMT for the treatment of stress or mixed urinary incontinence in older women. These results provide controlled evidence that confirms earlier inconclusive findings from 6 smaller randomized clinical trials in younger women. Many of these trials had significant risk of bias, no long-term follow-up, and were not sufficiently powered or designed to assess noninferiority.,

Our study demonstrated a median percentage reduction in urinary incontinence episodes at 1 year of 70% in individual PFMT compared with a 74% reduction in group-based PFMT, which did not vary with study center, urinary incontinence type, urinary incontinence severity, age, and BMI. Furthermore, these findings indicate equal or greater urinary incontinence reduction compared with previous studies assessing the effect of individual physiotherapy in a similar population. Individual and group-based PFMT had similar effectiveness for all secondary outcomes except sexual issues associated with lower urinary tract symptoms at 1 year. Adherence to treatment sessions and home exercises was high and loss to follow-up was low, indicating acceptability of both interventions. Few participants had adverse events; all were minor, reversible, and occurred primarily in the early stage of each intervention.

Limitations and Strengths

This study's exclusion criteria and intensive intervention could limit generalizability of the results to either frail older or younger women who may not be able to participate in or adhere to this intensive intervention. From a clinical and health service perspective, strengths of our findings indicate that the group-based approach makes it possible to rapidly increase the number of women treated with PFMT. Making conservative management more accessible may help delay or reduce the need for urinary incontinence surgery and reduce the burden of urinary incontinence on the health care system. Overall, our results demonstrate that older women with stress or mixed urinary incontinence will attend, adhere, and gain clinically important benefits from group-based PFMT.

### In-person vs electronic directly observed therapy for tuberculosis treatment adherence: a randomized noninferiority trial [^18de3e59]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Electronic directly observed therapy (DOT) is used increasingly as an alternative to in-person DOT for monitoring tuberculosis treatment. Evidence supporting its efficacy is limited.

Objective

To determine whether electronic DOT can attain a level of treatment observation as favorable as in-person DOT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a 2-period crossover, noninferiority trial with initial randomization to electronic or in-person DOT at the time outpatient tuberculosis treatment began. The trial enrolled 216 participants with physician-suspected or bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis from July 2017 to October 2019 in 4 clinics operated by the New York City Health Department. Data analysis was conducted between March 2020 and April 2021.

Interventions

Participants were asked to complete 20 medication doses using 1 DOT method, then switched methods for another 20 doses. With in-person therapy, participants chose clinic or community-based DOT; with electronic DOT, participants chose live video-conferencing or recorded videos.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Difference between the percentage of medication doses participants were observed to completely ingest with in-person DOT and with electronic DOT. Noninferiority was demonstrated if the upper 95% confidence limit of the difference was 10% or less. We estimated the percentage of completed doses using a logistic mixed effects model, run in 4 modes: modified intention-to-treat, per-protocol, per-protocol with 85% or more of doses conforming to the randomization assignment, and empirical. Confidence intervals were estimated by bootstrapping (with 1000 replicates).

Results

There were 173 participants in each crossover period (median age, 40 years [range, 16–86 years]; 140 [66%] men; 80 [37%] Asian and Pacific Islander, 43 [20%] Black, and 71 [33%] Hispanic individuals) evaluated with the model in the modified intention-to-treat analytic mode. The percentage of completed doses with in-person DOT was 87.2% (95% CI, 84.6%-89.9%) vs 89.8% (95% CI, 87.5%-92.1%) with electronic DOT. The percentage difference was -2.6% (95% CI, -4.8% to -0.3%), consistent with a conclusion of noninferiority. The 3 other analytic modes yielded equivalent conclusions, with percentage differences ranging from -4.9% to -1.9%.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this trial, the percentage of completed doses under electronic DOT was noninferior to that under in-person DOT. This trial provides evidence supporting the efficacy of this digital adherence technology, and for the inclusion of electronic DOT in the standard of care.

### Adherence to physician visits for diabetes care and cardiovascular disease risk: a retrospective cohort study using an administrative claims database [^d518eb1e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Using a large‐scale administrative claims database, we found that better adherence to diabetes care was associated with a lower incidence of CVD events, death and microvascular complications. These findings are consistent with prior research, including a randomized controlled trial in Japanand a nationwide program in Korea.

Although the exact mechanisms remain uncertain, individuals with good adherence demonstrated improved HbA1c, blood pressure, triglycerides and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol after the exposure period (Table S7). These sustained improvements in biomarkers — well‐known risk factors for CVD — likely contributed to the lower event rates. Poor adherence may lead to clinical inertia, reducing opportunities for timely intensification of blood pressure and lipid management, potentially increasing CVD risk.

The stratified analyses further support the clinical relevance of these findings. First, good adherence was associated with slightly greater benefits in older individuals, possibly due to accumulated effects over time, as adherence status tended to remain stable, particularly among those with good adherence. Moreover, the benefit appeared more pronounced in individuals with lower HbA1c levels, potentially because physicians treating those with HbA1c ≥ 7.0% may have prioritised glycaemic control over non‐glycaemic risk factors. This finding may underscore the importance of achieving HbA1c < 7%, as recommended in diabetes guidelines worldwide.

We acknowledge several limitations. First, the study may be subject to selection bias because we used an employer‐based insurance database in Japan, which may limit the generalisability of the findings to other populations or insurance systems. Second, although we adjusted for > 50 confounders, residual confounding by unmeasured factors — such as socioeconomic status or dietary salt/sugar intake — may have resulted in misclassification. Third, as an observational study, causal inference is limited, and the specific effects of medication adherence or lipid and blood pressure management cannot be estimated. Future prospective studies are warranted to evaluate these effects separately. Fourth, the limited number of events in subgroup analyses may have led to insufficient power, potentially contributing to the lack of statistically significant results. Lastly, time‐varying confounding may have influenced our results despite our sensitivity analyses, including a per‐protocol approach.

In this observational study, we found an association between good adherence to diabetes care and a lower incidence of CVD or death. While our findings suggest the potential value of adherence in preventing adverse outcomes, the effectiveness of behavioural interventions remains to be established. Future interventional studies are warranted to examine whether promoting adherence can improve clinical outcomes.

### Efficacy and adherence rates of a novel community-informed virtual world-based cardiac rehabilitation program: protocol for theRandomized controlled trial [^06330aae]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Power and Sample Size Calculations

To establish noninferiority of the primary efficacy outcome (comparison of LE8 scores at 3 months between arms), we will use a 5‐point noninferiority margin based on prior studies suggesting that a 5‐point increase in LE8 is associated with an additional 1‐year life expectancy free of disease for a 50‐year‐old individual. This noninferiority margin is sufficient to conclude that Destination Cardiac Rehab is not meaningfully worse than CBCR. Assuming there is no difference between intervention arms under the alternative hypothesis, a total sample size of 110 participants (55/arm) with complete 3‐month follow‐up provides 90% power to conclude noninferiority for the LE8 outcome at 3 months based on a noninferiority margin of 5 points, assuming a residual SD of 8 points and 1‐sided test with α level 0.025. Prior population‐based studies have observed an SD of up to 12 points, but we anticipate the populations eligible for CR are more homogeneous. Furthermore, the statistical analysis will adjust for prognostic prerandomization variables, including baseline LE8 (ANCOVA model). An SD of 10 in this population would result in a residual SD of 8 if the correlation between baseline LE8 and 3‐month LE8 is moderately strong (𝜌 = 0.6). Assuming ≈25% dropout, we will enroll and randomize 150 participants. If the residual SD is larger than anticipated, we retain 74% power for a residual SD of 10 and nearly 60% power for a residual SD of 12.

As described previously, a participant is adherent if attending ≥ 70% of prescribed weekly virtual or in‐person sessions. We hypothesize that the rate of adherence (percentage of participants who are adherent) in Destination Cardiac Rehab will be noninferior to the rate of adherence in CBCR. A 25% absolute difference in the adherence rate is considered noninferior. On the basis of prior Destination Cardiac Rehab adherence data, we anticipate higher adherence than observed in prior studies. Assuming a 50% adherence rate among CBCR, a 2‐sample test of proportions among 150 total participants (75 per arm) provides 86% power to conclude noninferiority with 1‐sided α level 0.025. If CBCR adherence percentage is 80%, the design provides 97% power.

### Making sense of noninferiority: a clinical and statistical perspective on its application to cardiovascular clinical trials [^da260725]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Active control noninferiority trials are being used with increasing frequency in new drug or device development when standard placebo-controlled trials are considered unethical. Nevertheless, the design and analysis of these trials are founded on a number of assumptions and arbitrary criteria that are generally not well understood or justifiable. Trials designed to show noninferiority require an appropriate reference population, a proven active control and dose, an appropriate margin of noninferiority that is clinically relevant and statistically justifiable, a high level of adherence to treatment, and adequate statistical power to reliably conclude that a treatment is truly noninferior and therefore effective. Accordingly, if noninferiority trials are to be applied to clinical and regulatory decisions regarding the marketing and use of new treatments, the assumptions must be made explicit and their influence on the resultant conclusions must be assessed rigorously. When conservative criteria were applied to each of the key assumptions underlying 2 representative noninferiority trials, they materially undermined the conclusions regarding noninferiority failing to confirm reported conclusions regarding noninferiority despite enthusiastic dissemination and acceptance of the results. Because the clinical, regulatory, and economic impact of active control noninferiority trials is substantial, robust criteria should be used routinely in their design, analysis, and interpretation to reach their intended objectives and to keep them from becoming wasted efforts.

### CONSORT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for reporting randomised trials [^f878839c]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Explanation

A key strength of a randomised trial design is the avoidance of bias when randomly allocating trial participants to interventions. To preserve the benefits of randomisation, all randomised participants are included in the analysis and retained in the group to which they were allocated. Meeting these two conditions defines an intention-to-treat analysis — which is widely recommended as the preferred analysis strategy. However, strict adherence to an intention-to-treat analysis is often difficult to achieve owing to missing outcomes for some trial participants (item 21c) or non-adherence to the trial intervention protocol. While imputation of missing outcomes would allow an intention-to-treat analysis, it does not guarantee an avoidance of bias except under strong assumptions about the missing data which may be unknown.

Various strategies for performing intention-to-treat analyses in the presence of missing outcome data are available. When the number of missing outcomes is not large, the analysis population could be all randomised participants with outcome observed (known as an "available case" population) under a plausible missing data mechanism, and sensitivity analyses could be performed exploring departures from this assumption (thereby using all randomised participants at least in sensitivity analyses). Concerns may arise when the frequency or the causes of dropping out differ between the intervention groups. Striving for intention-to-treat analysis by imputing values for participants with missing outcomes may lead to use of inadequate methods such as last observation carried forward.

Regardless of whether all randomised participants (completely observed outcomes or imputed outcomes) or a subset of randomised participants with observed outcomes are included in the primary analysis, the analysis population should be described. Authors often describe performing analyses on a "modified intention-to-treat" population to cover departures from a strict intention-to-treat that excludes participants who did not adequately adhere to the protocol such that they did not receive some minimum amount of the intervention — in such cases, what defines the minimum amount of the intervention should be explained (eg, those participants receiving at least one dose of the medication). It is also common to include analyses based on a per protocol population, which includes participants completing the study with no major protocol deviations. Excluding participants may compromise the randomisation and lead to biased estimates of treatment effects if appropriate methods are not used. Other analysis populations are possible (eg, a safety population), and their rationale and definition should be explained. Thus, authors should clearly define which participants are included in each analysis and in which intervention group and avoid terms such as "modified intention-to-treat" or "per protocol" analysis.

### Non-adherence in non-inferiority trials: pitfalls and recommendations [^b4410280]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Non-adherence in non-inferiority trials can affect treatment effect estimates and often increases the chance of claiming non-inferiority under the standard intention-to-treat analysis. This article discusses the implications of different patterns of non-adherence in non-inferiority trials and offers practical recommendations for trial design, alternative analysis strategies, and outcome reporting to reduce bias in treatment estimates and improve transparency in reporting.

### Reporting of noninferiority margins on clinicalTrials.gov: a systematic review [^7eac3b2c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we identified a concerning issue regarding the poor reporting of noninferiority margins at registration on ClinicalTrials.gov. This lack of transparency may allow for untraceable changes to the noninferiority margins, potentially distorting conclusions toward more favorable results. Implementing mandatory reporting of the design and the noninferiority margin (for noninferiority trials and the equivalence margin for equivalence trials) at registration could enhance the transparency and favor more reliable results.

### An official ATS / AASM / ACCP / ERS workshop report: research priorities in ambulatory management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea [^34559870]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Medium credibility.

Develop disease management models based on successful clinical and economic outcomes — workshop participants endorsed performing "comparative effectiveness research studies that ascertain the clinical outcomes of OSA management pathways using portable-monitor testing versus in-laboratory testing". Methodologic guidance specifies that "AHI on the baseline sleep study should not be used to determine whether participants randomized to each arm have a similar severity of OSA insofar as the portable-monitor study (without sleep staging) tends to underestimate the AHI that would be obtained with PSG", that "another indicator of disease severity, such as the Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index (51, 52), could be used" at baseline, and that "studies can attempt to compensate for these differences in diagnostic accuracy by performing polysomnography in those patients with negative home studies". The workshop "did not endorse any specific study design" but described protocols in which suspected OSA were randomized to in-lab testing versus "overnight home unattended testing with a Type 3 portable monitor", with home positives undergoing "home-unattended autoCPAP titration study for several nights", and patients with OSA in both arms initiated on CPAP and "reassessed after 3 months of treatment". For analysis, it states that to compare pathways using "an intent-to-treat analysis", studies "should select a primary outcome that evaluates all participants randomized to each arm", "CPAP adherence should not be the primary outcome measure", and "CPAP adherence is an outcome of interest but is limited to a per protocol analysis".

### Noninferiority Randomized controlled trials [^d3946aac]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

From 2005 to 2015, the publication of noninferiority trials increased by six-fold. Noninferiority trials assess whether a new treatment's efficacy is comparable with that of the standard of care and have several appeals. Noninferiority trials can evaluate for both noninferiority and superiority of a new treatment. In addition, multiple treatment modalities exist, and new treatments may be advantageous for reasons beyond efficacy. Common elements of trial design such as the research question, outcomes, statistical analysis, and interpretation of results differ meaningfully between noninferiority trials and superiority trials. The noninferiority margin, constancy assumption, and assay sensitivity are unique aspects of noninferiority trials. As with all randomized controlled trials, patient engagement in and reporting of noninferiority trials are also important. In this review, we discuss the methodological considerations and limitations of noninferiority trials.

Table 4 shows the results from the per-protocol analysis. After 3 years of follow-up, we had complete data from 2,513 participants about their dietary habits and energy intake.

### Per-protocol versus intention-to-treat in clinical trials: the example of GLOBAL-LEADERS trial [^22d277b3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

A per‐protocol analysis of a randomized trial is considered by some authors"an observational analysis" that presents potential confounding by unmeasured factors. This has cast doubts on the validity of per‐protocol analyses. The prime example is a post hoc analysis of the CDP (Coronary Drug Project)that showed lower mortality among participants who adhered to placebo than among those who did not adhere to placebo. This is frequently used as a warning for investigators who deviate from the intention‐to‐treat principle.

Intention‐to‐treat analysis is the most commonly used approach for the primary analysis of randomized clinical trials. Intention‐to‐treat analysis is agnostic about postrandomization decisions (eg, therapy discontinuation), preserves the original randomization, and maintains sample size; the analysis population is as complete as possible (hence called "full analysis set"); potential bias due to exclusion of patients is avoided; and it is a more conservative approach minimizing type‐1 error. Intention‐to‐treat more closely represent clinical practice, thus showing "effectiveness" rather than "efficacy".

However, we should demystify intention‐to‐treat analysis as it also presents some limitations. The result of an intention‐to‐treat analysis is affected by the pattern of adherence to treatment strategies. For instance, in a head‐to‐head trial of 2 active treatments that have differential adherence because of a mild, easily palliated side effect, an intention‐to‐treat analysis may misleadingly indicate a benefit of the less efficacious treatment. When there is incomplete adherence (as happens in GLOBAL‐LEADERS), intention‐to‐treat analyses may result in an effective intervention appearing to be ineffective (ie, are too conservative) if the poor adherence was because of misplaced concerns about effectiveness or toxicity. Therefore, intention‐to‐treat effects may not provide clinically useful information in some situations.

### Best (but oft-forgotten) practices: intention-to-treat, treatment adherence, and missing participant outcome data in the nutrition literature [^4bfe82bf]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Among clinical trials of adequate size, randomization balances both known and unknown prognostic factors between trial arms, thus allowing an unbiased comparison of intervention and control. To preserve this benefit, all randomly assigned participants should be followed to study termination and analyzed in the arm to which they were allocated. There are 2 potential limitations in study implementation: 1) patients are nonadherent and continue with follow-up visits, or 2) patients are lost to follow-up and their outcome data are missing. Herein, we address these issues with an emphasis on binary outcomes, and discuss how authors of randomized trials should address issues of both noncompliance and missing data.

### Non-adherence in non-inferiority trials: pitfalls and recommendations [^299102dd]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Randomised controlled trials that test for non-inferiority of the experimental arm are performed when a new treatment is compared with an established standard of care. Instead of being required to have superior clinical efficacy, the new treatment might be preferred for its improved safety, convenience, or reduced cost. These trials are increasingly prevalent because highly efficacious standard-of-care treatments have been established for many diseases, making demonstration of superiority against standard-of-care implausible and placebo controlled trials without any active comparators unethical to perform.

A basic weakness of non-inferiority trials, compared with superiority trials, is that poor conduct of the trial or deviations from the protocol could result in false rejection of the null hypothesis that the experimental treatment is inferior. Most trials report that some participants do not adhere to their allocated treatment. Intention-to-treat analysis estimates the treatment effect accounting for this real world adherence pattern by comparing outcomes between groups of participants defined by their allocated treatment; it measures the effect of allocating a treatment on participant outcomes, instead of the actual effect of treatment (often called an effectiveness trial). If the primary research interest is the causal effect of assigning treatments, then this estimate is likely to be the most relevant. In other situations, the question of primary interest is the causal effect of the treatment itself. Because many patterns of non-adherence result in reduced observed differences between the comparison arms, there is a risk that relying on the intention-to-treat analysis to conclude non-inferiority will lead to the adoption of treatments which, when taken, lead to worse outcomes.

### Empirical consequences of current recommendations for the design and interpretation of noninferiority trials [^d27d08bd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Noninferiority trials are increasingly common, though they have less standardized designs and their interpretation is less familiar to clinicians than superiority trials.

Objective

To empirically evaluate a cohort of noninferiority trials to determine 1) their interpretation as recommended by CONSORT, 2) choice of alpha threshold and its sidedness, and 3) differences between methods of analysis such as intention-to-treat and per-protocol.

Design

We searched MEDLINE for parallel-group randomized controlled noninferiority trials published in the five highest-impact general medical journals between 2011 and 2016.

Main Measures

Data abstracted included trial design parameters, results, and interpretation of results based on CONSORT recommendations.

Key Results

One hundred sixty-three trials and 182 noninferiority comparisons were included in our analysis. Based on CONSORT-recommended interpretation, 79% of experimental therapies met criteria for noninferiority, 13% met criteria for superiority, 20% were declared inconclusive, and 2% met criteria for inferiority. However, for 12% of trials, the experimental therapy was statistically significantly worse than the active control, but CONSORT recommended an interpretation of inconclusive or noninferior. A two-sided alpha equivalent of greater than 0.05 was used in 34% of the trials, and in five of these trials, the use of a standard two-sided alpha of 0.05 led to changes in the interpretation of results that disfavored the experimental therapy. In four of the five comparisons where different methods of analysis (e.g., intention-to-treat and per-protocol) yielded different results, the intention-to-treat analysis was the more conservative. In 11% of trials, a secondary advantage of the new therapy was neither reported nor could it be inferred by reviewers.

Conclusions

In this cohort, the design and interpretation of noninferiority trials led to significant and systematic bias in favor of the experimental therapy. Clinicians should exercise caution when interpreting these trials. Future trials may be more reliable if design parameters are standardized.

### Non-adherence in non-inferiority trials: pitfalls and recommendations [^39c9c298]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Effect of allocation and effect of treatment differ with various patterns of non-adherence and analysis methods, and hence affect the determination of non-inferiority. In accounting for non-adherence in non-inferiority trials, investigators should consider the context of the trial (that is, whether the non-adherence pattern is generalisable in other settings) and the perspective of the user to decide on the appropriate effect measure to determine non-inferiority. When the interest is in treatment efficacy, potential confounders should be determined during the trial design and appropriate data from both adherent and non-adherent participants should be collected to adequately adjust for these factors. While accounting for all confounders that fully explain non-adherence might not be possible, our suggested measures serve as a guide to reduce bias in estimates of treatment efficacy from non-inferiority trials and improve transparency in their reporting.

### Reporting of noninferiority and equivalence randomized trials: extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement [^9399f67d]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement, which includes a checklist and a flow diagram, is a guideline developed to help authors improve the reporting of the findings from randomized controlled trials. It was updated most recently in 2010. Its primary focus is on individually randomized trials with 2 parallel groups that assess the possible superiority of one treatment compared with another. The CONSORT Statement has been extended to other trial designs such as cluster randomization, and recommendations for noninferiority and equivalence trials were made in 2006. In this article, we present an updated extension of the CONSORT checklist for reporting noninferiority and equivalence trials, based on the 2010 version of the CONSORT Statement and the 2008 CONSORT Statement for the reporting of abstracts, and provide illustrative examples and explanations for those items that differ from the main 2010 CONSORT checklist. The intent is to improve reporting of noninferiority and equivalence trials, enabling readers to assess the reliability of their results and conclusions.

### Quality of reporting of noninferiority and equivalence randomized trials [^8f0a675a]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Noninferiority and equivalence trials aim to show that the experimental treatment is not clinically worse than (noninferior) or clinically similar to (equivalent) a control active treatment. These study objectives imply particular planning and analysis.

Objective

To assess the methodologic quality of reports of randomized controlled trials of noninferiority and equivalence.

Design

We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for reports of randomized controlled trials of noninferiority and equivalence hypotheses published between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2004.

Main Outcome Measures

Data extracted by use of a standardized form involved assessment of choice of noninferiority or equivalence margins, sample size calculation, sets of patients analyzed, method of statistical testing and reporting results, and conclusions.

Results

A total of 162 reports were included in the analysis (116 reports of noninferiority and 46 of equivalence). The margin defining noninferiority or equivalence was described in most reports (156 [96.3%]), with justification of the margin in only 33 (20.4%). Almost one quarter of the reports (35 [21.6%]) did not describe a sample size calculation, and an additional 11 (6.8%) did not take into account a prespecified noninferiority or equivalence margin. Less than half of the reports (69 [42.6%]) described both an intent-to-treat (ITT; all randomized patients are included in the analysis) or modified ITT (patients who never received treatment are excluded) and per-protocol (patients who did not complete the treatment are excluded) analysis, and only about half of those (39 [56.5%]) described both types of results. Results were displayed with confidence intervals in 136 reports (84.0%). Only 33 articles (20.3%) fulfilled reporting requirements specific to noninferiority and equivalence trials, 4 of them (12.1%) with misleading conclusions.

Conclusions

Reporting of noninferiority and equivalence trials has important deficiencies: absence of noninferiority or equivalence margin, only an ITT (or a per-protocol) analysis performed, and results not adequately reported. Moreover, even for articles fulfilling these requirements, conclusions are sometimes misleading.

### Interpreting the results of noninferiority trials-a review [^da444b21]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Noninferiority margin

Determination of the noninferiority margin is the main challenge in designing noninferiority analyses, and its choice is central for drawing meaningful conclusions. The margin should depend on the severity of the endpoint. For example, a smaller margin would be appropriate when mortality is the endpoint, as compared with, say, the need for additional salvage treatment. The margin should also take into account the magnitude of any other benefits of the new treatment. Often this margin is referred to as 'clinically noninferior'. For these reasons, the noninferiority margin should be determined in advance, ideally by a panel of patients, clinicians and researchers and specified in the protocol.

Crucial to this decision is reliable knowledge of 'disease progression' in the absence of treatment, and the benefit achieved with the conventional treatment. Progression can be measured in several ways, including mortality, recurrence, an increase in extent of disease (stage) or severity of symptoms. Consideration should be given as to how many additional cases of 'progression' one would accept for every 100 patients treated with the new versus the standard treatment. Whatever measure is used, it must be predefined and based on prior data, in which the 'other' benefits of the new treatment are quantified and used to determine how great any inferiority of the new treatment compared with the standard can be considered acceptable.

Noninferiority can be assessed either as a relative or absolute difference in efficacy between the standard treatment and the experimental treatment, and both have their advantages and disadvantages. The absolute difference is often most relevant in discussions with patients, as it reflects a change in the risk of progression without reference to the overall risk of progression or the reduction associated with standard treatment. The relative difference can be particularly helpful in understanding how the new treatment compares with the conventional treatment in terms of how much of the overall treatment effect compared with no treatment is retained or extended. This is most relevant when the new treatment is less efficacious than the standard, when its efficacy compared with no treatment becomes questionable.

### SPIRIT 2013 explanation and elaboration: guidance for protocols of clinical trials [^9aa585bf]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Interventions — adherence

Item 11c: Strategies to improve adherence to intervention protocols, and any procedures for monitoring adherence (eg, drug tablet return; laboratory tests)

Explanation

Adherence to intervention protocols refers to the degree to which the behaviour of trial participants corresponds to the intervention assigned to them. Distinct but related concepts include trial retention (Item 18b) and adherence to the follow-up protocol of procedures and assessments (Item 13).

On average, adherence to intervention protocols is higher in clinical trials than in non-research settings. Although there is no consensus on the acceptable minimum adherence level in clinical trials, low adherence can have a substantial effect on statistical power and interpretation of trial results. Since fewer participants are receiving the full intervention as intended, non-adherence can reduce the contrast between study groups — leading to decreased study power and increased costs associated with recruiting larger sample sizes for evaluating superiority, or leading to potentially inappropriate conclusions of non-inferiority or equivalence. There is also the possibility of underestimating any efficacy and harms of the study intervention.

Furthermore, if adherence is a marker for general healthy behaviour associated with better prognosis, then different rates of non-adherence between study groups can lead to a biased estimate of an intervention's effect. In support of this "healthy adherer" effect, non-adherers to placebo in clinical studies have been found to have poorer clinical outcomes than adherers.

To help avoid these potential detrimental effects of non-adherence, many trials implement procedures and strategies for monitoring and improving adherence, and any such plans should be described in the protocol. Among applicable drug trials published in 1997–99, 47% reported monitoring the level of adherence. Although each of the many types of monitoring methods has its limitations, adherence data can help to inform the statistical analysis (Item 20c), trial interpretation, and choice of appropriate adherence strategies to implement in the trial as it progresses or in future trials and clinical practice.

A variety of adherence strategies exist, and their use can be tailored to the specific type of trial design, intervention, and participant population. It may be desirable to select strategies that can be easily implemented in clinical practice, so that the level of adherence in the real world setting is comparable to that observed in the trial.

### Noninferiority designed cardiovascular trials in highest-impact journals [^89dc6be1]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Noninferiority trials are increasingly being performed. However, little is known about their methodological quality. We sought to characterize noninferiority cardiovascular trials published in the highest-impact journals, features that may bias results toward noninferiority, features related to reporting of noninferiority trials, and the time trends.

Methods

We identified cardiovascular noninferiority trials published in JAMA, Lancet, or New England Journal of Medicine from 1990 to 2016. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Data elements included the noninferiority margin and the success of studies in achieving noninferiority. The proportion of trials showing major or minor features that may have affected the noninferiority inference was determined. Major factors included the lack of presenting the results in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol/as-treated cohorts, α > 0.05, the new intervention not being compared with the best alternative, not justifying the noninferiority margin, and exclusion or loss of ≥ 10% of the cohort. Minor factors included suboptimal blinding, allocation concealment, and others.

Results

From 2544 screened studies, we identified 111 noninferiority cardiovascular trials. Noninferiority margins varied widely: risk differences of 0.4% to 25%, hazard ratios of 1.05 to 2.85, odds ratios of 1.1 to 2.0, and relative risks of 1.1 to 1.8. Eighty-six trials claimed noninferiority, of which 20 showed superiority, whereas 23 (21.1%) did not show noninferiority, of which 8 also demonstrated inferiority. Only 7 (6.3%) trials were considered low risk for all the major and minor biasing factors. Among common major factors for bias, 41 (37%) did not confirm the findings in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol/as-treated cohorts and 4 (3.6%) reported discrepant results between intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Forty-three (38.7%) did not justify the noninferiority margin. Overall, 27 (24.3%) underenrolled or had > 10% exclusions. Sixty trials (54.0%) were open label. Allocation concealment was not maintained or unclear in 11 (9.9%). Publication of noninferiority trials increased over time (P < 0.001). Fifty-two (46.8%) were published after 2010 and had a lower risk of methodological or reporting limitations for major (P = 0.03) and minor factors (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Noninferiority trials in highest-impact journals commonly conclude noninferiority of the tested intervention, but vary markedly in the selected noninferiority margin, and frequently have limitations that may impact the inference related to noninferiority.

### How to use a noninferiority trial: users' guides to the medical literature [^ad71a21b]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Clinical investigators are increasingly testing treatments that have the primary benefit of decreased burden or harms relative to an existing standard. The goal of the resulting randomized trials — called noninferiority trials — is to establish that the novel treatment's effectiveness is not substantially less than the existing standard. Conclusions from these trials are, however, based on noninferiority thresholds specified by authors whose judgments may not coincide with those of patients and clinicians. This article highlights issues related to validity, interpretation, and applicability of results specific to noninferiority trials. Suboptimal administration of standard treatment or exclusive reliance on the analyze-as-randomized approach that is standard for conventional superiority trials may produce misleading results in noninferiority trials. Clinicians should judge whether the novel treatment's impact on effectiveness outcomes — the prime reason for wanting to prescribe it — is sufficiently close to that of standard treatment that they are comfortable substituting it for the existing standard. Trading off desirable and undesirable consequences is an individual decision: given the benefits of a novel treatment, some patients may perceive the uncertainty regarding a reduction in treatment effectiveness as acceptable while others may not.

### Good enough: a primer on the analysis and interpretation of noninferiority trials [^ab6296d1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Active-control noninferiority trials are being performed with increasing frequency when standard placebo-controlled trials are considered unethical. Three attributes are optimally required to establish noninferiority: 1) The treatment under consideration exhibits therapeutic noninferiority to the active control; 2) the treatment would exhibit therapeutic efficacy in a placebo-controlled trial if such a trial were to be performed; and 3) the treatment offers ancillary advantages in safety, tolerability, cost, or convenience. Trials designed to show noninferiority require an appropriate reference population, a proven active control and dose, a high level of adherence to treatment, and adequate statistical power. However, the formal analysis of such trials is founded on several assumptions that cannot be validated explicitly. These assumptions are evaluated in the context of 8 recently published noninferiority trials. The analyses in this paper confirm the establishment of noninferiority in only 4 of the 8 trials. The authors conclude that if noninferiority trials are to be applied to clinical and regulatory decisions about the marketing and use of new treatments, these assumptions must be made explicit and their influence on the resultant conclusions assessed rigorously.

Box 3
Glossary of analysis methods from causal inference

Several methods have been developed to adjust for differences in confounding characteristics, such that the allocation groups are comparable even in the presence of non-adherence driven by confounders. Some examples are:

Inverse probability weighting estimates an individual's probability of adhering to a particular arm given observed confounders, and uses the predicted probability as a weight to inflate or deflate the individual's influence on the overall treatment effect in the group.
Standardisation first stratifies the comparison groups according to a confounder, then adjusts the group specific estimates according to the number of individuals in the group.
G estimation models treatment as the dependent variable, and models confounders and the potential outcomes as independent variables, to derive treatment effects. Potential outcomes are those that would occur if a participant received either standard-of-care or experimental treatments.
Matching selects participants from the standard-of-care group with similar characteristics (eg, severity of underlying illness and age) as the experimental group to ensure that the distribution of prognostic factors in the two groups are similar.
Instrumental variable estimation is performed in two stages. First, it quantifies the degree to which randomisation predicts actual treatment, followed by the degree to which actual treatment predicts outcome. Two key assumptions are that the instrument (that is, the allocated intervention in a clinical trial) predicts the intervention received but does not influence the recorded outcome through any other pathway; and the instrument does not share common causes with the outcome. The second condition will hold if treatment is randomly assigned, but the first condition might not if double blinding is not possible.

The first four methods rely on adequate adjustment of confounders for their validity. Since, in practice, there are always unknown or imperfectly measured confounders, adjustment can only be approximate. Instrumental variable estimation, however, does not rely on confounder adjustment, and is the only approach that can account for both known and unknown confounders. However, the strength of the instrument (that is, randomisation) weakens with non-adherence in predicting actual treatment taken up by the study participants. This reduction in strength of the instrument to predict the actual treatment substantially increases uncertainties in the treatment difference estimates, requiring large sample sizes to maintain sufficient power to detect non-inferiority. Methods that reduce uncertainties when using instrumental variable estimation do exist, but these require additional assumptions. In addition, instrumental variable estimation is only appropriate with a crossover type of non-adherence, and does not work when study participants change to non-trial treatments.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) adherence — Across six randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis of mean hours of use per night found no significant difference between HSAT and PSG assessment pathways, while analysis of five RCTs using nights with greater than 4 hours of use showed a clinically insignificant trend towards increased CPAP adherence in the HSAT arm versus the PSG arm; the quality of evidence for CPAP adherence was moderate to high after downgrading due to imprecision, and the task force determined that the overall quality of evidence across AHI cutoffs was high.

### Noninferiority trial design: opportunities and challenges [^5c83ca17]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Defining treatment effectiveness is the foundation of evidence-based practice. Most studies comparing the effectiveness of treatment options involve superiority designs in which a treatment is compared against a placebo, standard care, or an alternative treatment. However, in scenarios in which it is not ethical to consider these options, noninferiority designs can be considered. Noninferiority (NI) trials aim to demonstrate that a new treatment is not unacceptably worse than a standard treatment. Noninferiority is determined relative to a noninferiority margin, which is the difference between the test and active control treatment that is not unacceptably clinically inferior. However, there are important considerations with respect to the design, analysis, and interpretation of NI studies, which differ from superiority trials. This review will outline the key components of NI trials, how to interpret the findings, and understand their nuances and potential limitations.

### Effects of an 18-week exercise programme started early during breast cancer treatment: a randomised controlled trial [^ad5eb1b1]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Compared to previous related studies, the PACT study differed in the timing (i.e. early in the treatment process) and location (i.e. at the treating hospitals) of the intervention. In previous studies, the intervention was mostly delivered by the same physiotherapist(s) at a well-equipped research centre. In daily practice, however, the intervention will be given at different sites with different physiotherapists. The PACT study used this latter more pragmatic design. Although physiotherapists worked according to a standardized protocol the different locations may have added variability and reduced intervention effects. However, external generalizability is increased.

Strong features of the present study are the randomized design, the large sample size, and the high adherence to a supervised intervention offered in different clinical settings by different physiotherapists. Another feature resembling daily practice is that the intervention started within 6 weeks after diagnosis irrespective of the start of adjuvant treatment. Although no significant interaction was observed between group assignment and chemotherapy timing, treatment side-effects may have added variability to outcome measurements. The present study also has some limitations. Participants in the current study reported, on average, a high pre-diagnosis physical activity level and might thus not be the ones who needed the program most. The high level of physical activity reported by 56% of the controls at 18 weeks may have led to an underestimation of the true effect. Indeed, per-protocol analyses showed that effects became stronger (e.g. ES = −0.77 for physical fatigue). However, per-protocol analyses should be interpreted with caution because of selective non-compliance. We offered a combined aerobic and strength exercise program to the patients. Therefore, we cannot distinguish what type of activity might have driven our results. Other limitations include the fact that physical activity was assessed by a questionnaire, as well as the relatively low participation rate and the lack of detailed information on patients who refused participation hampering generalization of results.

Future directions

This study shows that exercise during adjuvant treatment of breast cancer is beneficial in reducing fatigue. Women with low physical activity levels might benefit more from exercise programs, although they might also be less interested in participating. Future studies should elucidate patients' attitude, motivation, and barriers towards participation in exercise programs in order to specifically design exercise programs for the less active patients.

### Reporting of noninferiority and equivalence randomized trials: an extension of the CONSORT statement [^3a1fca93]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement, including a checklist and a flow diagram, was developed to help authors improve their reporting of randomized controlled trials. Its primary focus was on individually randomized trials with 2 parallel groups that assess the possible superiority of one treatment compared with another but is now being extended to other trial designs. Noninferiority and equivalence trials have methodological features that differ from superiority trials and present particular difficulties in design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation. Although the rationale for such trials occurs frequently, those designed and described specifically as noninferiority or equivalence trials appear less commonly in the medical literature. The quality of reporting of those that are published is often inadequate. In this article, we present an adapted CONSORT checklist for reporting noninferiority and equivalence trials and provide illustrative examples and explanations for those items amended from the original CONSORT checklist. The intent is to improve reporting of noninferiority and equivalence trials, enabling readers to assess the validity of their results and conclusions.

### Rationale and design of the mTECH-rehab randomized controlled trial: impact of a mobile technology enabled corrie cardiac rehabilitation program on functional status and cardiovascular health [^2f2a5892]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Sample Size and Statistical Analysis Plan

The primary outcome measure of the study is the difference in distance participants walk (ie, functional capacity) between the intervention and usual care groups, as measured by the 6MWT at 12 weeks post‐randomization. The comparison will be made in a noninferiority design. Noninferiority will be assessed on both intention‐to‐treat and per‐protocol populations at the 1‐sided 5% significance level by using the upper bound of the 2‐sided 90% CI, for the absolute difference in the mean 6MWT between the Corrie HCR and usual care CR arms. For the trial to demonstrate noninferiority with 80% power, assuming a pooled SD of 107 meters for the follow‐up 6MWTand a true 6MWT difference in favor of the Corrie HCR program of 30 m, 160 patients will be required (80 per group) to exclude a difference of > 12.5 m in favor of the usual care group. The noninferiority margin of 12.5 m was chosen to represent about 40% of the minimum important difference of 30 m in 6MWT as identified in previous studies. Accounting for an attrition rate of 20% during follow‐up after randomization, a total of 200 (100 per group) participants will be recruited and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms. We will compare the mean level of 6MWT at 12 weeks post‐randomization between the intervention and control groups using a generalized linear regression model. The sample size calculation was performed using the TWOSAMPLEMEANS statement in SAS version 9.4 procedure PROC POWER (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC), in which the null value option was specified to represent the noninferiority margin.

If a participant has an adverse event that results in them being discontinued from the study or does not engage with the intervention, that participant will be included in the intention‐to‐treat analysis, which is the primary form of analysis for our study. In addition to the primary intention‐to‐treat analysis, prespecified, per‐protocol analyses will be conducted (1) inclusive of intervention group participants who remain active in the study and engage with the intervention, and separately (2) among those participants (in both control and intervention arms) who have completed at least 2 in‐center CR sessions. In addition, prespecified subgroup analyses will be performed, stratified by age, sex, treatment modality (cardiac surgery, catheter‐based procedure, or medical therapy).

### Combination of exercise and GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment reduces severity of metabolic syndrome, abdominal obesity, and inflammation: a randomized controlled trial [^4555da85]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

In a clinical setting, hsCRP levels higher than 3 mg/L indicate increased cardiovascular risk. At inclusion in this study, the mean hsCRP level was above the upper limit of hsCRP and approached the lower limit of 1 mg/L in the liraglutide treatment groups at the end of the trial. When liraglutide treatment was combined with adherent exercise, hsCRP was reduced by more than 50% during the entire trial. Therefore, these hsCRP findings indicate that combination treatment can exert clinically meaningful reductions in low-grade inflammation after diet-induced weight loss. Regarding insulin resistance, adherent exercise was able to maintain the large reductions in HOMA-IR induced by the low-calorie diet.

A strength of this study is the longitudinal, randomized, placebo-controlled design with four separate groups to assess single and combined effects of treatments with exercise and liraglutide 3.0 mg/day. Another strength is the novelty of analyzing the effects of maintained interventions on a clinically relevant continuous metabolic syndrome score combined with assessments of abdominal obesity and inflammation, translating to potential cardiometabolic risk.

In this study, we present the findings from the participants who completed the trial according to the prescribed interventions to better observe the effects of actually performed exercise, often confounded by inadequate adherence. The limitation of this approach includes a possible selection bias which might have skewed the treatment estimate. A reason for not fulfilling the high demands of the per-protocol requirements may be the time consumed on exercise, which is a known barrier to exercise. In the present study, the per-protocol participants in the exercise groups performed an average of 2.5 h of exercise per week for a whole year. Importantly, we also present the intention-to-treat analysis, including the 36 participants not fulfilling the high per-protocol demands, which generally painted a similar picture in the placebo, exercise, and liraglutide groups compared to the per-protocol analysis. Thus, except for hsCRP, which only showed significant differences between the placebo and combination groups in the per-protocol population, there were no differences in the results between intention-to-treat or per-protocol analyses.

### Noninferiority study design: application to clinical trials [^d9b45324]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

The noninferiority trial, a distinct category within randomized controlled trials, is garnering increased attention in medical research. Its unique and evolving role comes to the forefront in scenarios where new treatments, despite not surpassing the efficacy of an existing standard, bring additional benefits such as reduced side effects, enhanced compliance, or cost savings. As the field of surgery witnesses a growing number of published noninferiority trials, it becomes imperative for surgeons to grasp the intricacies of this trial type to accurately decipher and interpret their outcomes.

### Heterogeneity in pragmatic randomised trials: sources and management [^cce4391d]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Trial analysis: make sure ancillary studies will not interfere with not imposing specific constraints on patients or physicians

As an ancillary objective of a pragmatic trial, one may seek to better understand the assessed intervention. Thus, at the end of the study, a process analysis "[that] explore[s] the way in which the intervention under study is implemented" may bring a complementary view taking into account contextual issues (e.g. OPERA trial, Table 8). In the same way, per-protocol or CACE analyses may help explain whether lack of treatment effect is due to lack of compliance, whereas subgroup analyses may help identify subgroups of patients who benefit most from the treatment. In a pragmatic trial, all these analyses are generally secondary ones, which means that no specific effort should be made to collect additional data for them if that extra data collection jeopardises the primary purpose of the study, perhaps by distorting the clinical setting and adding extra investigations or disruptive data collection. However, pragmatic trials aim at answering the questions that decision-makers need answered, so one cannot exclude the possibility that subgroup analyses may be part of the primary objective, for example, to investigate aims relevant to health equity.

### Effects of counseling by peer human advisors vs computers to increase walking in underserved populations: the COMPASS randomized clinical trial [^1de54bd7]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Effective and practical treatments are needed to increase physical activity among those at heightened risk from inactivity. Walking represents a popular physical activity that can produce a range of desirable health effects, particularly as people age.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that counseling by a computer-based virtual advisor is no worse than (ie, noninferior to) counseling by trained human advisors for increasing 12-month walking levels among inactive adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A cluster-randomized, noninferiority parallel trial enrolled 245 adults between July 21, 2014, and July 29, 2016, with follow-up through September 15, 2017. Data analysis was performed from March 15 to December 20, 2018. The evidence-derived noninferiority margin was 30 minutes of walking per week. Participants included inactive adults aged 50 years and older, primarily of Latin American descent and capable of walking without significant limitations, from 10 community centers in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, California.

Interventions

All participants received similar evidence-based, 12-month physical activity counseling at their local community center, with the 10 centers randomized to a computerized virtual advisor program (virtual) or a previously validated peer advisor program (human).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was change in walking minutes per week over 12 months using validated interview assessment corroborated with accelerometry. Both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis was performed.

Results

Among the 245 participants randomized, 193 were women (78.8%) and 241 participants (98.4%) were Latino. Mean (SD) age was 62.3 (8.4) years (range, 50–87 years), 107 individuals (43.7%) had high school or less educational level, mean BMI was 32.8 (6.8), and mean years residence in the US was 47.4 (17.0) years. A total of 231 participants (94.3%) completed the study. Mean 12-month change in walking was 153.9 min/wk (95% CI, 126.3 min/wk to infinity) for the virtual cohort (n = 123) and 131.9 min/wk (95% CI, 101.4 min/wk to infinity) for the human cohort (n = 122) (difference, 22.0, with lower limit of 1-sided 95% CI, -20.6 to infinity; P = 0.02); this finding supports noninferiority. Improvements emerged in both arms for relevant clinical risk factors, sedentary behavior, and well-being measures.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study indicate that a virtual advisor using evidence-based strategies produces significant 12-month walking increases for older, lower-income Latino adults that are no worse than the significant improvements achieved by human advisors. Changes produced by both programs are commensurate with those reported in previous investigations of these behavioral interventions and provide support for broadening the range of light-touch physical activity programs that can be offered to a diverse population.

### A novel nano-iron supplement versus standard treatment for iron deficiency anaemia in children 6–35 months (IHAT-GUT trial): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled non-inferiority phase II trial in the Gambia [^c1ab584d]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A further potential limitation of the study was the use of multiple primary endpoints without adjusting for multiple testing. Since this was the first Phase II study with IHAT, we considered it an initial trial where results could be tested in a subsequent pivotal Phase III study. As such, in the present study, each primary hypothesis was tested at a 10% one-sided type I error rate. Nevertheless, the non-inferiority of IHAT vs ferrous sulphate in IDA correction was sufficiently shown with a statistically significant p-value in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations, and this would have retained statistical significance even after adjusting for multiple testing with the 4 primary hypotheses.

The study strengths include its sample size and trial setting, to our knowledge this is the largest trial conducted with oral iron supplementation in rural Africa with young children which included a placebo arm allowing for testing safety signals due to the iron supplements, particularly in relation to diarrhoea and infection. Further strengths include the stratified randomisation by age and Hb level, double-blinding, placebo control, individual participant treatment allocation masking, high levels of adherence to the study intervention (580/642 children fully adhering to treatment with all 85 daily doses) and low attrition with 584/642 children contributing data for the primary outcomes. The trial population was highly representative of the type of children that should be targeted by public health interventions. Furthermore, we had consistent engagement between the trial staff and study communities throughout the study and any potential barriers and facilitators to conducting this trial were promptly identified and addressed. There were no differences in the primary outcome results between the per-protocol and the intention-to-treat analyses. There were no differences between the two iron supplementation groups for all the multiple iron status biomarkers analysed or for the different safety and inflammatory markers used. These strengths, along with the fact that this was a trial conducted to the highest international standards of good clinical practice in a resource-poor setting, with defined protocols and documentation of process, support the validity of this Phase II trial results.

### Interpreting the results of noninferiority trials-a review [^00b381c7]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Noninferiority trials are becoming increasing common, but are often poorly reported and misunderstood. A better understanding of the new components of a noninferiority trial and their interpretation is needed. Noninferiority trials are an extension of conventional superiority trials, which provide a basis for determining if a new treatment, which may have advantages other than efficacy, has sufficient efficacy to be useful in certain situations. A key feature is the need to specify a clinical noninferiority margin above which the lower boundary of the confidence interval for the difference between the new treatment and the conventional treatment must lie. In most cases a nontreated control arm is not included, and when the efficacy of the new treatment is less than that of the standard treatment, determining its efficacy versus no treatment can be a major challenge. Treatments meeting a clinical noninferiority requirement can be statistically significantly superior to standard treatment, of similar efficacy (i.e. no significant difference), or even significantly inferior in a conventional analysis. Noninferiority comparisons are an important addition to the reporting of clinical trials, but require prior consideration of several factors that conventional superiority analyses do not address.

### Reporting of noninferiority margins on clinicalTrials.gov: a systematic review [^ca9268d7]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Noninferiority trials aim to determine whether a new treatment is as effective as a reference treatment. The noninferiority margin is a central element in these trials, representing the loss of effectiveness in the primary end point compared with the reference treatment, which is acceptable given the benefits offered by the new treatment, such as improved safety, lower costs, or more convenient administration schemes. The importance of this margin and the methods for its definition have been described in guidelines from the US Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010 statement extension for noninferiority trials. The margin must be justified on the basis of existing literature or clinical relevance and established during the trial planning stage for sample size calculation. The noninferiority margin is also crucial for interpreting results and drawing conclusions. To establish the noninferiority of the new treatment compared with the reference treatment, the CI of the new treatment effect must lie within the zone defined by the noninferiority margin.

Since 2005, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors has mandated the registration of clinical trials in recognized public registries as a prerequisite for publication. One of the objectives of the prospective registration of clinical trials is to limit selective outcome reporting, a practice that involves modifying outcomes between the protocol and the publication, which has been shown to distort research findings toward overly favorable and misleading results. Given the crucial role of the noninferiority margin in the design and interpretation of noninferiority trials, its reporting at the time of registration as well as its consistency through the publication appears essential. However, concerns have been raised regarding the potential distortion of the noninferiority margin in protocols, trial registries, and publications. A study published in 2015 identified a discordance rate of 9% between the noninferiority margins reported in protocols submitted to ethics committees and those reported in corresponding publications. Few data exist on the reporting of the noninferiority margin in trial registries, but the most recent study found that a low proportion (only 2.6%) of the trials prespecified the noninferiority margin at initial registration. These findings were based on trials published between 2012 and 2014; thus, their registration on ClinicalTrials.gov occurred much earlier.

### Effect of an intensive lifestyle intervention on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^fc6ea2c9]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

It is unclear whether a lifestyle intervention can maintain glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Objective

To test whether an intensive lifestyle intervention results in equivalent glycemic control compared with standard care and, secondarily, leads to a reduction in glucose-lowering medication in participants with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, assessor-blinded, single-center study within Region Zealand and the Capital Region of Denmark (April 2015-August 2016). Ninety-eight adult participants with non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes who were diagnosed for less than 10 years were included. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1; stratified by sex) to the lifestyle group (n = 64) or the standard care group (n = 34).

Interventions

All participants received standard care with individual counseling and standardized, blinded, target-driven medical therapy. Additionally, the lifestyle intervention included 5 to 6 weekly aerobic training sessions (duration 30–60 minutes), of which 2 to 3 sessions were combined with resistance training. The lifestyle participants received dietary plans aiming for a body mass index of 25 or less. Participants were followed up for 12 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to 12-month follow-up, and equivalence was prespecified by a CI margin of ± 0.4% based on the intention-to-treat population. Superiority analysis was performed on the secondary outcome reductions in glucose-lowering medication.

Results

Among 98 randomized participants (mean age, 54.6 years [SD, 8.9]; women, 47 [48%]; mean baseline HbA1c, 6.7%), 93 participants completed the trial. From baseline to 12-month follow-up, the mean HbA1c level changed from 6.65% to 6.34% in the lifestyle group and from 6.74% to 6.66% in the standard care group (mean between-group difference in change of -0.26% [95% CI, -0.52% to -0.01%]), not meeting the criteria for equivalence (P = 0.15). Reduction in glucose-lowering medications occurred in 47 participants (73.5%) in the lifestyle group and 9 participants (26.4%) in the standard care group (difference, 47.1 percentage points [95% CI, 28.6–65.3]). There were 32 adverse events (most commonly musculoskeletal pain or discomfort and mild hypoglycemia) in the lifestyle group and 5 in the standard care group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with type 2 diabetes diagnosed for less than 10 years, a lifestyle intervention compared with standard care resulted in a change in glycemic control that did not reach the criterion for equivalence, but was in a direction consistent with benefit. Further research is needed to assess superiority, as well as generalizability and durability of findings.

### Non-adherence in non-inferiority trials: pitfalls and recommendations [^f089bbbf]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Worked example

In a hypothetical, open label, non-inferiority clinical trial, a short duration treatment (experimental arm) is compared with a long duration treatment (control arm) for ventilator associated pneumonia. The primary outcome is death by 30 days. The treatment effect estimate is given by the mortality (as a proportion) in the experimental arm minus the mortality in the control arm at this time point.

Physician preference might affect adherence because some doctors are accustomed to prescribing a long duration of treatment. Doctors might also affect patient outcomes. Disease severity is another potential confounder because doctors usually prescribe short treatment duration for mild disease and long treatment duration for severe disease (fig 3).

Fig 3
Causal associations among factors related to non-adherence in hypothetical non-inferiority trial (as described in the worked example)

A sample size of 800 participants is required for 80% power and 2.5% one sided type 1 error, if we consider the efficacy of both short and long duration treatments to be 60% and choose a non-inferiority margin of 10%. During the trial, data on the potential confounders and the primary outcome are collected from all participants. The overall adherence is 75%, comparable to observed adherence in pragmatic trials studying duration of treatment. Two doctors (A and B) prescribe treatment in the hypothetical trial. Figure 4 summarises the simulated data according to the allocation and per protocol groups of participants. R codes for simulation of hypothetical non-inferiority trial data and analysis can be found at.

### Can an mhealth clinical decision-making support system improve adherence to neonatal healthcare protocols in a low-resource setting? [^e0da61df]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitation

We sought to understand the pattern of health worker adherence to neonatal health protocols before and during the implementation of an mCDMSS, but our study has certain limitations. Differences in adherence to protocols by resource allocation type per study arm were not assessed. Due to the low incidence of cases among the various subgroups and because individual level data concerning mortality was incomplete in the DHIMS2 and in the health facility medical records, we could not control for the effect of the concurrent neonatal improvement activities in our analysis, nor analyse the relationship between adherence and neonatal mortality as originally indicated in our trial registration. The results of our study should therefore be interpreted in the light of these methodological limitations. We did not evaluate the type of health care provider in relation to the care provided nor the factors that may have influenced adherence to neonatal protocols. Qualitative analyses of why the observed pattern of adherence occurred could have provided more insight into the results we have obtained and are recommended for future studies.

### Efficacy of an education plan and adherence follow-up to the… [^886dcec0]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

In this way, when patients are registered in the database in the numerical order in the envelope, it is automatically assigned according to the randomization of the group to which the patient belongs. After the patients are entered into the database of data collection and variables, the patients belonging to the follow-up group are separated and sent to the responsible nursing assistant with the purpose of starting the established monitoring plan, such the activity must be registered in an Excel table where the control and registration of the same will be carried out. She will verify that the follow-up boxes for each patient are completed, which are performed twice weekly for a total of 24 follow-ups or 12 weeks, duration of the follow-up plan. She will start with phone calls, text messages and email according to the established schedule in the work template or tracking log format.

In each follow-up box for each patient it will record the type of activity that performed, call, text message or email where she sent the necessary recommendations for patients to exercise. Once the follow-up and the time are completed, the list of the patients who have completed the data collection will be sent to the program to schedule the second studies in HDL and Exercise TEST in The Center for Cardiac Rehabilitation. In the control group, according to the dates of entry to the study in week 6 related to the order of admission, a survey of adherence to the exercise will be applied by an administrative assistant who will keep a record of the same in a separate file and the respective result.

As the 12-week study period ends, the cardiac rehabilitation nurse assistant will receive the names of the patients and their respective phones from both the follow-up group and the control group without having any group marking to which one they belong, so that the second physical test or exercise test is performed and their respective order of clinical laboratory HDL is given.
- **Interventions**:
- Behavioral: Education plan and adherence to exercise No Intervention: Control The blood sample will be taken for the collection of serum HDL and the aerobic capacity test measured in MET will be recorded at the beginning of the study. A survey will be conducted at week 12 of monitoring where adherence to exercise is measured during the 12-week study.

Inclusion Criteria:

- Postoperative subjects of angioplasty with implantation of coronary stent
- Age between 35 and 65
- Subjects with ability to perform the aerobic capacity test
- Subjects culminating the cardiac rehabilitation program.

### Clinical policy: use of thrombolytics for the management of acute ischemic stroke in the emergency department [^c223e062]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — randomized controlled trials comparing endovascular therapy (EVT) alone versus intravenous thrombolysis plus EVT (IVT + EVT) enrolled adult patients within 4.5 hours and largely used alteplase 0.9 mg/kg, with most trials designed for noninferiority and one with a superiority-first design; in DIRECT-MT, the adjusted odds ratio for the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was 1.08 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.43), meeting noninferiority with a lower limit margin of 0.80 and with no statistical difference in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or death at 90 days; in DEVT, per-protocol mRS 0–2 occurred in 53.2% with EVT alone versus 46% with IVT + EVT (absolute difference 7.1% [97.5% CI −5.9 to ∞]) and was considered noninferior using a prespecified 10% margin, although the trial stopped early after enrolling only 235 of 970 planned patients for likely futility; in SKIP, unlike other trials using 0.9 mg/kg alteplase, 0.6 mg/kg was used, and per-protocol favorable outcome was 60.8% with EVT alone versus 58.8% with IVT + EVT with an OR of 1.06 (1-sided 97.5% CI 0.60 to ∞), which did not meet the prespecified lower margin of 0.74 and the investigators were unable to conclude noninferiority.

### Justification, margin values, and analysis populations for oncologic noninferiority and equivalence trials: a meta-epidemiological study [^645dbf2b]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Noninferiority and equivalence trials evaluate whether an experimental therapy's effect on the primary endpoint is contained within an acceptable margin compared with standard of care. The reliability and impact of this conclusion, however, is largely dependent on the justification for this design, the choice of margin, and the analysis population used.

Methods

A meta-epidemiological study was performed of phase 3 randomized noninferiority and equivalence oncologic trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. Data were extracted from each trial's registration page and primary manuscript.

Results

We identified 65 noninferiority and 10 equivalence trials that collectively enrolled 61632 patients. Of these, 61 (81%) trials demonstrated noninferiority or equivalence. A total of 65 (87%) trials were justified in the use of a noninferiority or equivalence design either because of an inherent advantage (53 trials), a statistically significant quality-of-life improvement (6 trials), or a statistically significant toxicity improvement (6 trials) of the interventional treatment relative to the control arm. Additionally, 69 (92.0%) trials reported a prespecified noninferiority or equivalence margin of which only 23 (33.3%) provided justification for this margin based on prior literature. For trials with time-to-event primary endpoints, the median noninferiority margin was a hazard ratio of 1.22 (range = 1.08–1.52). Investigators reported a per-protocol analysis for the primary endpoint in only 28 (37%) trials.

Conclusions

Although most published noninferiority and equivalence trials have clear justification for their design, few provide rationale for the chosen margin or report a per-protocol analysis. These findings underscore the need for rigorous standards in trial design and reporting.

### Effectiveness of targeted insulin-adherence interventions for glycemic control using predictive analytics among patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^f2d4e9a2]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Patient adherence to antidiabetic medications, especially insulin, remains poor, leading to adverse outcomes and increased costs. Most adherence interventions have only been modestly effective, partly because they are not targeted to patients who could benefit most.

Objective

To evaluate whether delivering more intensive insulin-adherence interventions only to individuals with type 2 diabetes predicted to benefit most was more effective than delivering a lower-intensity intervention to a larger group of unselected individuals.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This 3-arm pragmatic randomized clinical trial used data from Horizon, the largest health insurer in New Jersey, on 6000 participants 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes who were receiving basal insulin. Patients were excluded if they were insured by Medicaid or Medicare or had fewer than 3 months of continuous enrollment. The study was conducted from July 7, 2016, through October 5, 2017. Analyses were conducted from February 5 to September 24, 2018.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomized to 3 arms in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified based on baseline availability of 1 or more glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test values. All arms were designed to cost the same, and each cohort received a tailored pharmacist telephone consultation varying based on (1) proportion receiving the intervention and (2) intensity, including follow-up frequency and cointerventions. Arm 1 offered a low-intensity intervention to all patients. Arm 2 offered a moderate-intensity intervention to 60% of patients based on their predicted risk of insulin nonadherence. Arm 3 offered a high-intensity intervention to 40% of patients based on glycemic control and predicted risk of insulin nonadherence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was insulin persistence. Secondary outcomes were changes in HbA1c level and health care utilization. Outcomes were evaluated in arms 2 and 3 vs arm 1 using claims data, intention-to-treat principles, and multiple imputation for missing values in the 12-month follow-up.

Results

Among 6000 participants, mean (SD) age was 55.9 (11.0) years and 3344 (59.8%) were male. Compared with arm 1, insulin nonpersistence did not differ in arm 2 (relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75–1.03) or arm 3 (relative risk, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77–1.06). Glycemic control was similar in arm 2 and arm 1 (absolute HbA1c level difference, -0.15%; 95% CI, -0.34% to 0.05%) but was better in arm 3 (absolute HbA1c level difference, -0.25%; 95% CI, -0.43% to -0.06%). Total spending and office visits did not differ, but arm 2 (moderate intensity intervention) had more hospitalizations (odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06–1.41) and emergency department visits (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.24–1.53) than did arm 1 (low intensity intervention).

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with an untargeted low-intensity intervention, delivering a highly targeted high-intensity intervention did not improve insulin persistence but modestly improved mean glycemic control. A partially targeted moderate-intensity intervention did not change insulin persistence or HbA1c level but was associated with a small increase in hospitalizations.

Item 27b: Definition of who will be included in each analysis (eg, all randomised participants), and in which group

Example

"Analysis populations are defined as follows:

Intention to treat (ITT): this population includes all randomised participants regardless of whether they were later found to be ineligible, did not adhere to the protocol or were never treated.
Per protocol (PP): this population contains all randomised participants who received their allocated trial treatment without major protocol deviations.
Safety population: this population contains all randomised participants who received at least one dose of trial IMP and will be classified according to the actual treatment received.

The analysis of the primary outcome will be in the ITT population with sensitivity analysis in the PP population. The safety population will be used to report side effects".

### Efficacy of the enquiring about tolerance (EAT) study among infants at high risk of developing food allergy [^480e8fc5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

The Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) Study was conceived to reduce the burden of food allergies through early oral tolerance induction to specific food antigens. Rates of adherence to the challenging early introduction protocol were low, with 43% of adherence-evaluable EIG infants (34% of all EIG infants) consuming the per-protocol consumption threshold of recommended allergenic foods. This level of adherence was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in IgE-mediated food allergy to 1 or more of the 6 intervention foods.

At a food-specific level, adherence varied, with some foods being easier to consume than others: egg at 43.1% and peanut at 61.9%. In the intention-to-treat analysis both foods showed nonsignificant reductions in allergy prevalence of 31% and 51% for egg and peanut, respectively. Per-protocol effects were significantly stronger and in keeping with Learning Early About Peanut (LEAP) allergy study effect estimates. However, per-protocol analyses are susceptible to bias depending on what factors determined adherence in the study.

Well-recognized factors that render an infant from the general population to be at greater risk of a food allergy include nonwhite ethnicity, early-onset eczema, and early-onset sensitization to a food. In the EAT study we have previously confirmed that nonwhite ethnicity (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% CI, 1.19–3.66; P = 0.01) and enrollment visible eczema (3 months of age; OR, 6.09; 95% CI, 3.67–10.1; P < .001) were both significantly associated with developing a food allergy.

At the time of publication of the EAT study's principal results, the enrollment sensitization data available were the skin prick test results, which took place, by design, only in the early introduction group (EIG). Enrollment skin prick test sensitization (any positive wheal response to ≥ 1 foods) was significantly associated with having a food allergy in the EIG (OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 1.99–16.3; P = 0.001).

### Ensuring superior reporting of radiation therapy noninferiority trials: a systematic review [^7e15a401]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, margins can be expressed as absolute (eg, 2% decrease) or relative values (eg, hazard ratio of 1.3). Many studies (n = 27, 51%) in our review reported only absolute margins. Absolute margins can bias toward noninferiority when event rates are lower than expected, whereas relative margins correspond to the same relative risk independent of event rates. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of coronary stent noninferiority trials showed that the majority of trials only reported absolute margins (55 of 58, 94.8%), and the majority of those (n = 43) overestimated the control event rate, making the noninferiority margin more permissive. When the authors performed a reanalysis of the trials with adjusted margins, they found that 17 of the 50 trials (34%) that met noninferiority using the absolute margin did not meet criteria using the relative margin. Absolute margins can be more practical as it increases power, but this is contingent on accurate control event rate estimation.

Previous reviews of noninferiority clinical trials in other settings have also found variability in reporting. A review of all noninferiority and equivalence trials published between 2003 and 2004 found that only 20.4% of studies provided justification for the noninferiority margin, and only 42.6% of studies reported both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Most studies (n = 156, 96%) reported a prespecified noninferiority or equivalence margin. However, the authors were only able to adequately assess noninferiority and equivalence in 33 (20%) studies. Even among this small subgroup of studies, 4 reports (12%) misleadingly concluded noninferiority or equivalence. In a 2013 review of noninferiority trials involving oncologic drugs, the authors found that 62 of 75 studies (83%) reported a prespecified noninferiority margin. The authors found that the number of studies that did not report a noninferiority margin did not change after the publication of the CONSORT guidelines.

### CONSORT 2010 statement: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials [^3a7a6b58]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Item 12a (statistical methods) -We added that statistical methods should also be provided for analysis of secondary outcomes

Sub-item 14b (recruitment) -Based on empirical research, we added a sub-item on "Why the trial ended or was stopped"

Item 15 (baseline data) -We specified "A table" to clarify that baseline and clinical characteristics of each group are most clearly expressed in a table

Item 16 (numbers analysed) -We replaced mention of "intention to treat" analysis, a widely misused term, by a more explicit request for information about retaining participants in their original assigned groups

Sub-item 17b (outcomes and estimation) -For appropriate clinical interpretability, prevailing experience suggested the addition of "For binary outcomes, presentation of both relative and absolute effect sizes is recommended"

Item 19 (harms) -We included a reference to the CONSORT paper on harms

Item 20 (limitations) -We changed the topic from "Interpretation" and supplanted the prior text with a sentence focusing on the reporting of sources of potential bias and imprecision

Item 22 (interpretation) -We changed the topic from "Overall evidence". Indeed, we understand that authors should be allowed leeway for interpretation under this nebulous heading. However, the CONSORT Group expressed concerns that conclusions in papers frequently misrepresented the actual analytical results and that harms were ignored or marginalised. Therefore, we changed the checklist item to include the concepts of results matching interpretations and of benefits being balanced with harms

Item 23 (registration) -We added a new item on trial registration. Empirical evidence supports the need for trial registration, and recent requirements by journal editors have fostered compliance

Item 24 (protocol) -We added a new item on availability of the trial protocol. Empirical evidence suggests that authors often ignore, in the conduct and reporting of their trial, what they stated in the protocol. Hence, availability of the protocol can instigate adherence to the protocol before publication and facilitate assessment of adherence after publication

Item 25 (funding) -We added a new item on funding. Empirical evidence points toward funding source sometimes being associated with estimatedeatment effects

### The effect of capnography on the incidence of hypoxia during sedation for EGD and colonoscopy in mildly obese patients: a randomized, controlled study [^5f8d8708]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Per-protocol analysis

A total of 225 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. In per-protocol analysis, data are analyzed only for those patients who completely adhere to the treatment protocol. In the capnography group, two were excluded from the program analysis because they received midazolam and no oxygen supplementation. In the standard group, two patients were excluded from the program analysis because they received midazolam and etomidate instead of propofol. Thus, 221 participants were included in the per-protocol analysis. The results of statistical analysis for the per-protocol set were consistent with those of the intention-to-treat analysis. The results of the per-protocol analysis are reported in the Supplementary Material.

### Lung cancer screening adherence in centralized vs decentralized screening programs: a meta-analysis of US cohort studies among individuals with negative baseline results [^c5be20f9]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design and Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the association between program structure (centralized vs decentralized) and adherence to follow-up LDCT screening 10 to 18 months following a negative result on the baseline examination among high-risk individuals. This meta-analysis was reported using the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Details of the meta-analysis protocol are available on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (ID: CRD42024604470).

Eligibility Criteria

Population

Studies reporting data on high-risk individuals who underwent baseline LDCT screening and received a Lung CT Screening Reporting & Data System (Lung-RADS) score of 1 or 2 were included in the meta-analysis. Studies were included if they defined adherence as receipt of a second LDCT scan within a timeframe falling somewhere between 10 and 18 months following baseline screening with Lung-RADS 1 or 2 results.

Exposure

Participation in a centralized screening program, defined as referral by a healthcare provider to a dedicated LCS program. Programs were classified as centralized if patients were referred to a dedicated LCS program by their providers.

Comparison

The study compared decentralized (ie, patients who received a direct clinician referral for baseline LDCT scans) and/or hybrid (ie, systems combining elements of both programs) programs with centralized LCS programs.

Main Outcome

The primary outcome was adherence to annual LCS, defined as a second LDCT scan within 10 to 18 months following a negative result on a baseline scan. Secondary measures included patient and institutional characteristics potentially associated with adherence.

Study Design

Only cohort studies were included in this review. For the pairwise meta-analysis comparing adherence rates between centralized and decentralized LCS programs, studies were included that reported the number of individuals who completed baseline screening and those who returned for follow-up scans, stratified according to program structure. For the meta-regression analysis, studies were included that reported adherence outcomes in centralized programs along with data on institution- or participant-level factors. Randomized controlled trials and non-original studies, including reviews, commentaries, and opinion pieces, were excluded.

### Reporting of noninferiority margins on clinicalTrials.gov: a systematic review [^576427b0]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

This study highlights a persistent low rate of noninferiority margin reporting at registration on ClinicalTrials.gov. This absence of transparent and traceable reporting creates the possibility of modifications to the noninferiority margin after the trial has begun. Such changes are particularly concerning because they could skew results toward more favorable conclusions. The conclusion of a noninferiority trial — whether the results fall within or beyond the noninferiority margin — depends on the predefined margin value. Modifying this noninferiority margin post hoc, whether intentionally or not, allows treatments that initially failed to meet the noninferiority criteria to be later considered noninferior with an expanded margin. Altering the noninferiority margin during a trial, particularly after seeing the results, may be similar to selective outcome reporting. We did not search for the noninferiority margin in study protocols, which might have shown a higher reporting rate, but study protocols are not always available. ClinicalTrials.gov remains a more accessible source of trial information.

Consequently, we recommend making the reporting of the noninferiority margin mandatory on registration; otherwise, the margin will likely not be reported. To this end, we suggest that ClinicalTrials.gov and other registries introduce mandatory fields for the design of interventional trials, prompting authors to classify them as superiority, noninferiority, or equivalence trials. For noninferiority trials, mandatory fields related to the noninferiority margin may be implemented to facilitate the tracking of any changes to the noninferiority margin over time. Such a requirement would enhance not only the integrity of clinical research but also the trust in noninferiority trial results. This suggestion extends to equivalence trials.

### Risk of bias in randomized clinical trials comparing transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c1323c59]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Both the absolute rate of DAT and selective DAT can be associated with the ITT principle and undermine unbiased comparison groups at baseline. To obviate this risk, the Cochrane Rob 2 tool recommends estimating the effect of assignment to the intervention group by ITT analysis, which is a de facto standard for a clinical trial, and when as-treated analysis is performed. The use of ITT analysis, where all patients are counted according to their randomized group, ensures comparability between groups as obtained through randomization, maintains sample size, and eliminates bias. This approach measures both the efficacy of the intervention as assigned and overall adherence. In contrast, as-treated analysis refers to inclusion in the analysis of only patients who received the assigned intervention and per-protocol analysis refers to inclusion in the analysis of only patients who strictly adhered to the protocol. Although per-protocol analysis provides an estimate of the true efficacy of an intervention, it can be subject to bias as randomization has been violated. Poor trial quality (eg, due to poor protocol adherence or missing data) might bias results toward the null. In superiority studies, ITT analysis is therefore conservative, favoring the null hypothesis of no difference. However, in noninferiority trials (7 of 8 pivotal trials were designed as noninferiority trials with the NOTION Trial being the only superiority trial), where the alternative hypothesis is that of no difference, ITT analysis is no longer conservative as it can lead to false-positive results by favoring the alternative hypothesis. Consequently, noninferiority trials often consider both ITT and per-protocol analyses concurrently. Randomized clinical trials comparing TAVI and SAVR have chosen different approaches; nonetheless, in this case, the selective imbalance of DAT between TAVI and SAVR might raise concerns regarding internal validity in trials that primarily report as-treated or per-protocol analyses.

### Statistical issues and recommendations for noninferiority trials in oncology: a systematic review [^3a549ced]. Clinical Cancer Research (2012). Low credibility.

To provide an overview of noninferiority trials in oncology with a special emphasis on methodologic issues, we conducted a systematic review of randomized trials assessing noninferiority of antineoplastic treatments. We identified 72 articles, of which 65 were randomized phase III trials with a single control arm, 3 were factorial phase III trials, and 4 were randomized phase II trials. Forty-six were trials in lung, colorectal, or breast cancer. The quality of reporting was improved chronologically (P < 0.01); the major deficiencies were claims of noninferiority when the results did not meet statistical criteria for noninferiority (7 articles) or when the noninferiority margin was not prespecified (5 articles). Four trials (6%) presented plans for switching from superiority to noninferiority. The analysis populations were intent to treat (ITT) in 52, per-protocol set (PPS) in 6, and both ITT and PPS in 11 trials. Noninferiority margins were set in 68 trials (94%); 1 trial used both of the conventional and effect retention methods, 17 trials used the conventional method, 5 trials used the effect retention method, and in 45 trials, the method was not specified. Some trials used margins that possibly were larger than the assured effects of the active controls. No trials explicitly took into consideration uncertainty in historical data. Two trials (3%) specified 2 values of margins. Our findings highlight critical deficiencies in design and reporting of noninferiority trials. Seven practical recommendations are presented.

### Assessment of noninferiority margins in cardiovascular medicine trials [^bde1d986]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In evidence-based medicine, randomized controlled trials are critical for advancing science and informing clinical practice. However, several types of bias in trial design and conduction may affect their results and interpretation. Communicating the primary results of a trial at a large international medical conference with simultaneous or subsequent publication in a peer-reviewed medical Journal is another step where substantial bias may occur. For instance, the conclusions of a study may be intentionally or unintentionally interpreted and reported with positive connotations despite evidence of neutral or negative results.,

These issues can be even more challenging in the setting of a noninferiority design. Experts and regulatory authorities established some critical considerations in this scenario. The reporting and interpretation of noninferiority trials depend on rejecting or failing to reject a so-called "null hypothesis" (ie, arm A is inferior to arm B) and therefore accepting the corresponding "alternative hypothesis" (ie, arm A is inferior to arm B by less than a certain prespecified treatment effect, also known as noninferiority margin). In particular, the outcome of a noninferiority trial depends on where the CI of the effect size for a treatment or strategy lies around the noninferiority margin. Therefore, the choice of the margin represents a key issue for the validity and credibility of a noninferiority trial. To establish an accurate summary estimate of the treatment effect, regulators recommend that previous studies of the active control versus placebo are evaluated and, as appropriate, the effect size is obtained by pooling the available measures with meta-analytic methods, with the final aim to preserve more than a half of the putative effect of the active control versus placebo when selecting the noninferiority margin.

### Methodological and reporting quality of non-inferiority randomized controlled trials comparing antifungal therapies: a systematic review [^93f15e11]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Detailed reporting is essential in non-inferiority randomized controlled trials (NI-RCTs) to assess evidence quality, as these trials inform standards of care.

Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the methodological and reporting quality of antifungal NI-RCTs.

Data Sources

Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane CENTRAL and the United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) drugs database were searched to 9 September 2020.

Study Eligibility Criteria

NI-RCTs differing by antifungal formulation, type, dose, administration and/or duration were included. Articles were independently assessed in duplicate using quality indicators developed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) group.

Participants

Patients enrolled in antifungal trials for prophylactic and therapeutic use.

Methods

The Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool was used to assess risk of bias. Descriptive statistics were used; all statistical tests were two sided.

Results

Of 32 included studies, 22 (68.7%) did not justify the NIM. Handling of missing data was not described in 20 (62.5%). Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were both reported in 12/32 (37.5%) studies. Eleven of 32 studies (34.3%) reported potentially misleading conclusions. Industry-financed studies were more likely to report only the ITT analysis (n = 14/27, 51.9%). Methodological and reporting quality was unaffected by publication year; risk of bias from missing data changed over time. Overall risk of bias across included studies was moderate to high, with high risk in randomization process (n = 8/32, 25%), missing outcome data (n = 5/32, 15.6%), and selection of reported result (n = 9/32, 28.1%).

Conclusions

Justification of the non-inferiority margin, reporting of ITT and PP analyses, missing data handling description, and ensuring conclusions are consistent with reported data is necessary to improve CONSORT adherence. Small sample size and overall risk of bias are study limitations. (Systematic Review Registration Number PROSPERO CRD42020219497).

### The clinical interpretation of noninferiority trials [^34194115]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Noninferiority trials are designed to demonstrate that a new treatment is not unacceptably worse than a standard treatment, considering an allowable difference termed the noninferiority margin. We highlight that selection of noninferiority margins at the time of study design can be biased toward wider margins that favor noninferiority claims. We discuss a clinically oriented approach to interpretation of results with a focus on confidence intervals and recommend that readers base their judgments regarding noninferiority on margins reflecting patient values and preferences rather than those set by investigators. We provide examples from trials in inflammatory bowel diseases.

### CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials [^24f8d8ab]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Explanation — For scientific and ethical reasons, the sample size for a trial needs to be planned carefully, with a balance between medical and statistical considerations. Ideally, a study should be large enough to have a high probability (power) of detecting as statistically significant a clinically important difference of a given size if such a difference exists. The size of effect deemed important is inversely related to the sample size necessary to detect it; that is, large samples are necessary to detect small differences. Elements of the sample size calculation are (1) the estimated outcomes in each group (which implies the clinically important target difference between the intervention groups); (2) the α (type I) error level; (3) the statistical power (or the β (type II) error level); and (4), for continuous outcomes, the standard deviation of the measurements. The interplay of these elements and their reporting will differ for cluster trialsand non-inferiority and equivalence trials.

Authors should indicate how the sample size was determined. If a formal power calculation was used, the authors should identify the primary outcome on which the calculation was based (see item 6a), all the quantities used in the calculation, and the resulting target sample size per study group. It is preferable to quote the expected result in the control group and the difference between the groups one would not like to overlook. Alternatively, authors could present the percentage with the event or mean for each group used in their calculations. Details should be given of any allowance made for attrition or non-compliance during the study.

Some methodologists have written that so called underpowered trials may be acceptable because they could ultimately be combined in a systematic review and meta-analysis, and because some information is better than no information. Of note, important caveats apply — such as the trial should be unbiased, reported properly, and published irrespective of the results, thereby becoming available for meta-analysis. On the other hand, many medical researchers worry that underpowered trials with indeterminate results will remain unpublished and insist that all trials should individually have "sufficient power". This debate will continue, and members of the CONSORT Group have varying views. Critically however, the debate and those views are immaterial to reporting a trial. Whatever the power of a trial, authors need to properly report their intended size with all their methods and assumptions. That transparently reveals the power of the trial to readers and gives them a measure by which to assess whether the trial attained its planned size.

### Rethinking noninferiority [^aed0e760]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The concept of noninferiority (NI) is used when evaluating new therapeutic alternatives that are expected to provide comparable efficacy to existing treatments while potentially offering additional benefits, such as improved safety, enhanced convenience, or reduced costs. However, NI randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are also commonly used to support regulatory approval for therapies that do not offer clear clinical advantages, such as new iterations of coronary stent platforms or other devices, where any advantages may be largely theoretical.

To establish NI, a NI margin is defined, representing the maximum allowable loss of efficacy that is considered clinically acceptable. The selection of this margin is inherently subjective and contentious, requiring a delicate balance between statistical efficiency and clinical judgment. A margin that is too wide risks approving a therapy that is meaningfully less effective, potentially compromising patient outcomes. Conversely, a margin that is too narrow may unnecessarily hinder the adoption of therapies with meaningful ancillary benefits by necessitating prohibitively large trial sample sizes, which may be too costly and impractical before approval.

Currently, new therapies typically undergo an all-or-nothing approval process based on a single NI RCT, meaning that if a therapy meets the predefined NI margin, it receives full approval without further evaluation. This approach assumes that a single NI trial is sufficient to establish the long-term acceptability of a new therapy, despite residual uncertainty regarding its true comparative efficacy. For example, in our analysis of 58 stent RCTs, the median NI margin corresponded to a relative risk of 1.62, representing a clinically significant excess risk. There is no inherent reason why a definitive decision regarding NI should be based on one study alone.

### Non-adherence in non-inferiority trials: pitfalls and recommendations [^d61c37db]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Implications of non-adherence in non-inferiority trials

With intention-to-treat analysis, if only 10% of participants cross over to the opposite arm, the probability of claiming non-inferiority can increase up to 8–10% from the nominal value of 2.5%. This inflation could lead to ineffective treatments being adopted as the standard of care and could lower the bar for subsequent clinical trials, enabling consecutively worse treatments to be accepted into clinical practice. Such a procession of ever-worsening care has been termed as "biocreep" (fig 1).

Fig 1
Effect of non-adherence on biocreep. Panels show four scenarios if consecutive non-inferiority trials (comparing standard-of-care versus treatment A; treatment A versus treatment B; treatment B versus treatment C; treatment C versus treatment D) were to be carried out at 100%, 90%, 80% and 70% adherence. X axis represents consecutive non-inferiority trials; y axis represents decrease in true efficacies of treatments A, B, C, and D compared with the initial standard-of-care treatment. Treatments A, B, C, and D are 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% less effective than the standard of care, respectively. Dot sizes are probabilities (represented by percentages next to dots) for the new and inferior experimental treatment to be accepted as non-inferior at the end of each trial. For example, if 100% adherence is maintained in the trials (first panel), the probability of treatment A being accepted as the new standard of care is 2%. By contrast, when the consecutive trials are conducted with 70% adherence (last panel), treatment D has a 7% chance that it will be accepted as the new standard of care, when its true efficacy is 40% less than the current standard of care. This pattern of non-adherence is crossover (that is, in the 70% adherence scenario, 30% of participants from each arm cross over to the opposite arm)

### Assessing the reporting quality of adult neuro-oncology protocols, abstracts, and trials: adherence to the SPIRIT and CONSORT statements [^dde1cbb2]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials are designed to investigate the comparative effectiveness (superiority or noninferiority of a therapeutic option against another) in order to allow new treatment recommendations to be made. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are generally regarded as the "gold standard" methodological approach, by isolating the influence of the intervention in question on outcome, through a process of randomization to treatment arm. However, without comprehensive and transparent reporting of the planned methods (trial protocol) and results (trial results abstract and article), critical review and comparative analysis may be compromised. To this end, efforts have been made to standardize the reporting of these components with the publication of statements that describe the items to be reported on.

The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 guidance provides evidence-based recommendations for the minimum items that should be included when drafting a clinical trial protocol for an interventional clinical trial. The checklist includes 51 items. Adherence to SPIRIT ensures that all critical methodological aspects of the design of a clinical trial are addressed a priori.

The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, most recently updated in 2010, is an evidence-based, minimum set of recommendations for the reporting of randomized trialsand is endorsed by over 600 medical journals. The statement includes 25 items focused on reporting how a trial was designed, analyzed, and interpreted, with the overall aim of improving transparency of trial reporting. There are extensions of the CONSORT statement, notably CONSORT-A, which details specific considerations for the reporting of trial abstract items.

Taken together, the SPIRIT and CONSORT statements offer globally recognized reporting guidance to clinical triallists seeking to effectively communicate their planned and completed RCT. If a trial protocol or trial results article is not reported to these standards, the ability of a trial to inform clinical decision-making could be hampered. This creates difficulty, not only for the clinical triallist conducting the study, but for those seeking to interpret its results, for instance, other investigators including researchers, patients, funders and sponsors, ethics committees and institutional review boards, trial registries, and policymakers/regulators. The simplicity of a checklist allows both the author and anyone critiquing the work, to identify these items of importance.

### Comparison of the effect of a compact vs a conventional, long-term education program on metabolic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a pilot, randomized clinical trial [^53d358c8]. Pediatric Diabetes (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective education is considered essential for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) to adhere to a complex and long-term medical regimen and to delay or prevent the onset of diabetes-related complications.

Objective

We compared the effect of a compact, cost-effective, education program (CEPT1) vs a long-term program on the metabolic control of children and adolescents with T1DM.

Methods

Young people aged 8 to 21 years with T1DM were randomized to a short-term (experimental) or an extensive education program (control). The experimental group participated in three sessions of 90 minutes, with one session per week, containing five short videos. The control group attended an extended program delivered through 45-minute PowerPoint lectures, with one class every 3months. The primary outcome was change in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels from baseline to endpoint (baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months).

Results

In total, 62 patients were randomized to the experimental (CEPT1) (n = 32) or control (n = 30) groups. Both groups showed comparable improvement in HbA1c levels at the end of 12 months (P = 0.183). In a per-protocol analysis, the mean HbA1c level reduction was -2.3% (-2.6, -2.0) in the experimental group and- 1.8% (-2.0, -1.5) in the control group (P = 0.008).

Conclusion

CEPT1 was comparable with an extensive education program in reducing HbA1c levels. In a per-protocol analysis, the CEPT1 was more effective than the control program in reducing HbA1c levels. CEPT1 is a simple and cost-effective tool that can equally be used in settings with limited resources and specialized centers.

### Non-adherence in non-inferiority trials: pitfalls and recommendations [^16e6955a]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Challenges of non-inferiority trials

In non-inferiority trials, we ask whether a new treatment is no worse than the standard-of-care treatment, compared with asking whether a new treatment is better than the standard of care in a typical superiority trial (box 1). This shift in focus of comparison complicates non-inferiority trials for two main reasons.

Box 1
What are non-inferiority trials and how are they analysed?

The first complication is in deciding what we mean by "no worse than". If the new treatment does lead to worse outcomes, but worse only by a small amount, we might reasonably conclude that it is non-inferior. The largest such "small amount" that is compatible with a conclusion of non-inferiority is known as the non-inferiority margin. This margin is a practically acceptable compromise in treatment efficacy that we are willing to sacrifice in exchange for the secondary benefits offered by the new treatment. The subjective nature of this measure arises from the debate around what margin is "clinically acceptable" and how the advantages of the new treatment are weighed against the potential loss in treatment efficacy; researchers also need to decide whether the non-inferiority margin should be on a relative or absolute scale. The non-inferiority margin might often be chosen for practical reasons such as reduction of sample size while maintaining adequate power required to conclude non-inferiority. Despite the development of many objective methods to justify the non-inferiority margin, its determination remains a contentious issue and highly context specific.

### Medication adherence interventions improve heart failure mortality and readmission rates: systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials [^f8f7e68b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Risk of Bias

Studies were not evaluated a priori for study quality or risk of bias, because no validated tools for this exist and require subjective evaluation by evaluators. Rather, the research team coded study characteristics that are typically considered to be quality indicators (eg, randomization, use of intention‐to‐treat, blinding of data collectors, study attrition, etc) and analyzed them empirically by moderator analyses. In this way, rather than excluding studies for perceived methodological flaws, we could determine whether indicators of risk for bias actually affected ES.

### Alcohol use and HIV suppression after completion of financial incentives for alcohol abstinence and isoniazid adherence: a randomized controlled trial [^9be615ac]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

We conducted descriptive statistics of participants at baseline overall and by study intervention group. We previously reported a significant effect of the alcohol reduction intervention on unhealthy alcohol use at 3- and 6-months. In the present analyses we examined viral suppression and alcohol use at 12-months, as described below, and in our Statistical Analysis Plan.

For each outcome, we estimated the effect of the alcohol reduction intervention (a binary variable indicating assignment to receiving financial incentives for no recent alcohol use (Arms 2 and 4)), and of INH adherence intervention (a binary variable indicating assignment to receiving financial incentives for recent INH use (Arms 3 and 4)) while adjusting for sex and study site (randomization stratification factors). The model examining alcohol use at 12-months was additionally adjusted for baseline alcohol use because of higher baseline PEth levels in Arm 1. This was categorized as medium (all participants were AUDIT-C positive at baseline) or high/very high risk, using a composite measure of self-report (AUDIT-C) and phosphatidylethanol (PEth). Medium risk was defined as AUDIT-C < 6 and PEth < 200 ng/mL, and high/very high-risk alcohol use as AUDIT -C ≥ 6or PEth ≥ 200 ng/mL. We also examined the participants with no/low-risk drinking at 12 months, to assess whether or not they also had no/low-risk drinking at 3- and 6 months (i.e. the primary outcome for the DIPT trial).

We used the parameter estimates from the logistic regression models to estimate the adjusted risk difference (aRD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values.

The DIPT trial was designed as a factorial trial, assuming no interaction between alcohol and INH adherence, and was not powered to detect a significant interaction between the two interventions. However, to assess potential interactions, we conducted a post-hoc analysis estimating the aRD of each intervention stratified by the level of the other intervention using multivariable logistic regression for each outcome. We then examined whether these risk differences varied across subsets, with large differences suggesting potential interaction.

Finally, as a sensitivity analysis, we re-ran our analyses conservatively assuming that participants who were missing data at 12 months were high-risk drinkers and/or not virally suppressed.

Role of the funding source

The funder of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

All comparisons were restricted to participants randomly assigned concurrently. Analyses other than the primary outcome were stratified by randomisation protocol alone. Baseline characteristics and treatment adherence were summarised using counts and percentages or medians and IQRs. All analyses were done in STATA, version 17.0. An independent Trial Steering Committee oversaw the study with advice from an independent Data Monitoring Committee who regularly reviewed unblinded trial data. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN18148631.

Role of the funding source

The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report, except that Janssen Research & Development, as the developer of bedaquiline, provided a consultancy service upon request of the Sponsor in relation to bedaquiline, the eligibility criteria, safety investigations, and the pharmacokinetic component to fulfil the regulatory requirements of the trial.

### Assessment of noninferiority margins in cardiovascular medicine trials [^1e8ec77c]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of noninferiority margin

The relative frequency of using an ARD or a RRR as noninferiority margin was analyzed. Noninferiority trials using an ARD were further assessed if none of the following cases occurred: 1) the study used an ARD margin, but the results were reported using the upper confidence boundary of a RRR; and 2) the primary endpoint was reported as a continuous variable or event-free rate. To evaluate the impact of using an absolute noninferiority margin we recalculated the ARD margin based on the event rate observed at the end of the trial in the control group (ie, as opposed to the event rate anticipated by the investigators) (Supplemental Figure 1). In brief, for each ARD margin, the corresponding RRR margin was calculated as the ratio between the acceptable rate of events in the control arm (ie, anticipated event rate plus ARD margin of noninferiority) and the anticipated event rate in the control arm. A new acceptable event rate was then calculated as the product of the corresponding RRR margin of noninferiority and the event rate that was actually observed in the control arm. Finally, a revised ARD margin of noninferiority was calculated as the difference between the new acceptable event rate and the observed event rate in the control arm (Supplemental Figure 1, Supplemental Methods 2). The results were considered "divergent" (primary outcome) from the primary analysis if the upper boundary of the CI for the trial summary estimate (at the level of significance prespecified by the investigators) crossed the recalculated absolute noninferiority margin but did not cross the prespecified absolute noninferiority margin, or vice versa.

Assessment of trial interpretation

We scrutinized the conclusion sections of trials with diverging results for the presence of cautionary notes, ie, highlighting the risk associated with using an absolute noninferiority margin in the context of a lower-than-anticipated event rate (secondary outcome). Each article was read at the full-text level and analyzed by at least 3 independent investigators and then discussed in a consensus meeting.

### Guidelines on genetic evaluation and management of Lynch syndrome: a consensus statement by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^68c6ca18]. Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Lynch syndrome (LS) — chemoprevention with aspirin and resistant starch from CAPP2 randomized trials shows null effects for starch and delayed benefits for aspirin. In the initial randomized, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 design, there was no effect on incidence of colorectal adenoma/cancer at a mean follow-up of 29 months, and later follow-up found no effect of starch on CRC at median 52.7 months. A subsequent report found that 600 mg aspirin/d for a mean of 25 months reduced cancer incidence after 55.7 months, with time to first CRC hazard ratio 0.41 (95% CL: 0.19–0.86; P = 0.02) per protocol, and intention-to-treat analysis of all LS cancers showed HR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.42–1.00; P = 0.05. Detailed analyses report intention-to-treat time to first CRC hazard ratio 0.63 (95% CL: 0.35–1.13; P = 0.12), per-protocol hazard ratio 0.41 (95% CL: 0.19–0.86; P = 0.02) among those completing 2 years of intervention, and that adverse events did not differ between aspirin and placebo groups.

### Treatment adherence and clinical outcomes amongst in people with drug-susceptible tuberculosis using medication monitor and differentiated care approach compared with standard of care in south Africa: a cluster randomized trial [^97f08139]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistics

Sample size calculations were conducted accounting for the clustered design and assumed a harmonic mean of 145 participants/cluster, nine clusters per arm and a two-sided type I error of 5%. For the primary outcome (adherence) we assumed the percentage with adherence less than 80% in the SoC arm of 30% and coefficient of variation of 0.25, had 90% power to detect a 40% relative reduction in the endpoint in the intervention arm. For a successful outcome at the end of treatment, we assumed 80% successful outcome in the SoC arm and a coefficient of variation of 0.06, we had 90% power to detect an increase to 90%. For unfavourable outcome 18 months after enrolment, we assumed 13–20% in the SoC arm and a coefficient of variation of 0.25, we had at least 80% power to detect a 40% relative reduction in the intervention arm. Allowing for some clinics to enrol more than others, we did allow enrolment of up to 170 per clinic. The STATA "clustersampsi" command was used for the sample size calculations.

Analysis was conducted at the cluster-level due to the small number of clusters. For each cluster, the proportion of participants with < 80% adherence was measured. Our main effect estimate is a risk ratio based on the natural logarithm-transformed risks, compared by study arm across clusters using a t-test. For all binary outcomes, we reported by study arm the overall risk, ignoring clustering, and the geometric means of cluster-level risks. We also conducted an adjusted analysis for the intervention effect, adjusting for imbalances of individual-level variables at baseline, using a two-stage approach. Using logistic regression, the expected outcome for each individual was calculated, adjusting for baseline imbalances and summed at the cluster-level. The log of cluster-level residual (expected number of outcomes with the observed number of outcomes) was compared by study arm using a t-test. Risk differences and associated 95% confidence intervals by study arm were reported, based on untransformed cluster-level risks. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted without control of the overall type I error rate. All analyses were conducted in STATA v16 using the clan command. No interim analysis was performed.

For fidelity of the intervention, we opted to measure the required phone calls (since home visits were not done during COVID time) and how many were attempted and the number of circumstances where the person was successfully contacted.

### Evaluating adherence to a Treat-to-target protocol in recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis: reasons for compliance and hesitation [^047f5c1d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate rheumatologists' adherence to a low Disease Activity Score (DAS)-steered treat-to-target (T2T) strategy in treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to assess associated conditions.

Methods

Data of the BeSt study were used, a multicenter T2T strategy trial with 10-year followup. During 3 monthly visits, the physician answered questions about satisfaction with level of RA suppression, agreement with the study protocol, and agreement with the DAS. Associations between the answers and nonadherence were evaluated.

Results

Protocol adherence decreased over time from 100% to 60% per visit, with an average over time of 79%. Rheumatologists mostly agreed with the DAS (80–90% of visits over time) and were satisfied with the treatment steps (75–90%) and with the level of RA suppression (85–90%). The odds for protocol violation were higher when the rheumatologist disagreed with the DAS (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.0–2.7 when they thought the DAS overestimated actual disease activity; OR 2.5, 95% CI 2.0–3.1 when they thought the DAS underestimated actual disease activity) or with the next required treatment step (OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.5–3.5), and when the physician was dissatisfied with disease suppression (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1–1.6).

Conclusion

Rheumatologists generally agreed with and followed a 10-year followup DAS-steered T2T strategy. Disagreement with the DAS or the required treatment and dissatisfaction with the level of disease suppression were risk factors for nonadherence. These results indicate the feasibility of continued protocol-driven T2T therapy. For daily practice, adherence to T2T therapy might be improved by adopting the structure components of a clinical trial.

### Reporting of noninferiority margins on clinicalTrials.gov: a systematic review [^2e88ef45]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The noninferiority margin is a key methodological parameter in noninferiority trials that affects both sample size calculation and interpretation of results.

Objective

To assess (1) the reporting of the noninferiority margin on ClinicalTrials.gov, including when it was reported; (2) the consistency of the noninferiority margin between registration and publication; and (3) the reporting of the noninferiority margin at registration in a sample of recent trials.

Evidence Review

This systematic review was conducted in 2 stages. Stage 1 involved identifying all noninferiority trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with a primary completion date of January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2015, and searching for corresponding publications. Stage 2 included all noninferiority trials registered between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Two reviewers independently and manually extracted methodological characteristics related to the noninferiority design for each trial at registration and, when available, in results posted on ClinicalTrials.gov and in publications. The time points for reporting the noninferiority margin were at registration, during the patient enrollment phase (between start date and primary completion date), after the primary completion date, or in results posted.

Findings

Among the 266 trials completed between 2010 and 2015, only 8 (3.0%) reported the noninferiority margin at registration. The noninferiority margin was reported after registration for 31 of 266 trials (11.7%), with 11 (4.1%) reporting it during the patient enrollment phase and 20 (7.5%) reporting it after the primary completion date. Of the 132 trials with results posted on ClinicalTrials.gov, 79 (59.8%) reported the noninferiority margin. A corresponding publication was found for 208 trials, with 196 (94.2%) reporting the noninferiority margin. For 5 trials reporting the margin at both registration and in publication, the noninferiority margin was consistent in both sources. Among the 327 noninferiority trials first posted between 2022 and 2023, 30 (9.2%) reported the noninferiority margin at registration.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review, the reporting of the noninferiority margin on ClinicalTrials.gov was low. Mandatory reporting of the design and the noninferiority margin at registration could enhance the transparency and favor more reliable results.
