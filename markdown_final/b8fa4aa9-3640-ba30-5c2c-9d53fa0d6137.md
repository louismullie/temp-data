## Question

What is the antibiotic choice for acute diverticulitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antibiotic choice for acute diverticulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying disease severity and whether antibiotics are indicated at all. Then, I should verify patient-specific risk factors that modify decisions. Next, I will review the microbiology and empiric coverage targets. After that, I need to check evidence-based antibiotic options and durations for uncomplicated disease, followed by complicated disease. Finally, I should confirm special populations, stewardship principles, and a practical decision framework with follow-up and safety netting, making sure I cite the highest-quality guidelines and pivotal trials throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundational step: classify uncomplicated versus complicated diverticulitis because this determines whether antibiotics are routinely indicated or not. Uncomplicated disease is localized colonic inflammation without abscess, perforation, obstruction, fistula, or diffuse peritonitis, whereas complicated disease includes abscess, free perforation, fistula, obstruction, or diffuse peritonitis, and this classification is consistently used across contemporary guidelines and reviews [^ace902df] [^117c9a3a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics in uncomplicated disease. I need to check the highest-quality evidence and guidelines. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show no clear benefit of routine antibiotics for immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis, and major guidelines recommend selective rather than routine antibiotic use in this setting, including AGA, ACP, ASCRS, and WSES, with Cochrane concluding uncertainty and low-certainty evidence for benefit of antibiotics in uncomplicated disease [^337c5213] [^e7d0ced9] [^09aa4638] [^1921cced] [^b53e32e5] [^a6ce8159] [^2dda6be5].

> Wait, let me verify the patient selection criteria for withholding antibiotics. The ACP defines "select" patients as immunocompetent, without systemic inflammatory response, not medically frail, able to follow up as an outpatient with support, and without recent antibiotic exposure. AGA similarly advises selective use in immunocompetent patients with mild disease, and WSES recommends no antibiotics in immunocompetent patients without systemic inflammation, while ESCP reserves antibiotics for immunocompromised or septic patients, so I should ensure these boxes are checked before omitting antibiotics [^81b90ac7] [^9810e181] [^b53e32e5] [^9070f7c7].

> I should double-check the practical implementation details. Outpatient management with clear liquids, analgesia, and close follow-up is appropriate for most immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated disease, and patients should have clear return precautions and access to care if symptoms worsen. This approach is supported by ACP and contemporary reviews emphasizing outpatient care and selective antibiotic omission in low-risk patients [^95ef38c6] [^1618d37c].

> Next, I will examine when antibiotics are indicated despite uncomplicated disease. I need to ensure I capture the scenarios where benefits likely outweigh harms: immunocompromised hosts, significant frailty or comorbidity, refractory symptoms or vomiting, marked inflammatory markers such as CRP greater than 140 mg/L or WBC greater than 15 × 10⁹/L, or CT features like a small fluid collection or longer segment of inflammation. These are highlighted by AGA and WSES as situations where antibiotics are reasonable even in otherwise uncomplicated presentations [^1c5eecb0] [^e60a88e7] [^b53e32e5].

> Now, for complicated disease, I should confirm that antibiotics are mandatory. All major guidelines agree that complicated diverticulitis requires antibiotics, typically with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage, and management may also require source control such as percutaneous drainage for abscesses or surgery for perforation with diffuse peritonitis, with WSES and EAES/SAGES emphasizing early source control and stewardship-aligned durations once source control is achieved [^53d65fb8] [^7064a95f] [^ed0b4330] [^1618d37c].

> Let me think about microbiology and empiric coverage. The predominant organisms are gram-negative rods such as Escherichia coli and anaerobes like Bacteroides species, so empiric therapy should cover both, with attention to local resistance patterns and risk factors for ESBL-producing organisms. IDSA guidance for complicated intra-abdominal infections supports obtaining cultures when source control is performed to tailor therapy, which I should remember for abscess drainage or operative cases [^1618d37c] [^36d33b2d].

> For uncomplicated disease when antibiotics are chosen, I should verify oral options and duration. Common outpatient regimens include amoxicillin-clavulanate monotherapy or a fluoroquinolone combined with metronidazole, with typical durations of 4–7 days, and WSES advises using oral therapy whenever feasible to shorten length of stay. Importantly, there is no evidence that longer courses improve outcomes and they may increase harm, so I should avoid extending therapy beyond 7 days in uncomplicated cases [^f627c32c] [^ed1bf9ff] [^8a148620].

> For complicated disease, I need to ensure appropriate initial IV coverage and timely step-down. Reasonable empiric choices include piperacillin-tazobactam, a third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, or a carbapenem if ESBL risk is high, with early transition to oral therapy once clinically improved and total durations often 4–7 days after adequate source control, aligning with WSES and STOP-IT trial principles for intra-abdominal infection [^ace902df] [^ed1bf9ff].

> But wait, what about special populations and stewardship nuances. In older or frail adults, evidence for omitting antibiotics is limited, so a lower threshold for antibiotics and closer follow-up is prudent. In pregnancy, I should avoid fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines and favor beta-lactams with anaerobic coverage. In penicillin allergy, a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole or a carbapenem can be considered depending on severity and local resistance, and I should always reassess at 48–72 hours to de-escalate or stop if improving [^d66821be] [^f627c32c] [^ace902df].

> I should confirm abscess-specific management. Small abscesses less than 4–5 cm often resolve with antibiotics alone, whereas larger abscesses generally warrant percutaneous drainage plus antibiotics, and after adequate source control, prolonged antibiotics beyond 4–5 days are not supported. WSES and contemporary reviews consistently support this approach and remind me to obtain cultures when draining to guide therapy [^7064a95f] [^ed0b4330] [^1618d37c].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision framework to ensure nothing is missing. First, classify uncomplicated versus complicated. Second, screen for immunocompetence, frailty, severity markers, and reliability of follow-up. Third, if uncomplicated and low risk, manage without antibiotics with supportive care and close follow-up. Fourth, if uncomplicated but higher risk or if complicated, start antibiotics with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage and address source control when indicated. Fifth, choose oral therapy when possible, limit duration to 4–7 days, and reassess at 48–72 hours to de-escalate or stop if improving [^81b90ac7] [^b53e32e5] [^f627c32c].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient counseling and safety netting are explicit. Patients should understand that many cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis resolve without antibiotics, know the red flags that warrant urgent reassessment such as escalating pain, fever, vomiting, or new abdominal distension, and have a plan for follow-up within 48–72 hours. This aligns with guideline emphasis on shared decision-making and watchful waiting in appropriately selected patients [^81b90ac7] [^549aeb7a].

For acute diverticulitis, **antibiotics are not routinely required** for uncomplicated cases in immunocompetent patients [^337c5213] [^e7d0ced9]; **selective use is advised** based on clinical judgment and patient factors [^9810e181] [^11e82e20]. For complicated disease (abscess, perforation, sepsis), **antibiotics are mandatory** and should cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria [^53d65fb8] [^1618d37c]. Common regimens include amoxicillin-clavulanate, metronidazole plus a fluoroquinolone or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or metronidazole plus a cephalosporin; duration is typically 4–7 days, shorter if source control is achieved [^f627c32c] [^ace902df]. In elderly or frail patients, use a lower threshold for antibiotics and consider shorter courses (3–5 days) after source control [^4cc249ad] [^d66821be].

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy is determined by disease severity, patient factors, and the presence of complications [^1618d37c].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Antibiotic therapy recommended?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated diverticulitis in immunocompetent patients | No (selective use) | - RCTs show no benefit of routine antibiotics [^337c5213] [^a6ce8159] <br/> - Guidelines recommend selective use [^e7d0ced9] [^11e82e20] |
| Complicated diverticulitis (abscess, perforation, sepsis) | Yes | - Mandatory to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria [^53d65fb8] [^1618d37c] |
| Immunocompromised patients | Yes | - Higher risk of complications <br/> - Antibiotics recommended [^9070f7c7] [^51e3b6f0] |
| Elderly or frail patients | Yes (lower threshold) | - Increased risk of adverse outcomes <br/> - Lower threshold for antibiotics [^d66821be] [^1c5eecb0] |

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

When antibiotics are indicated, **regimens should cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria** [^53d65fb8] [^1618d37c].

| **Regimen** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | Uncomplicated or complicated | - Monotherapy <br/> - Convenient oral option [^f627c32c] |
| Metronidazole + fluoroquinolone (e.g. ciprofloxacin) | Uncomplicated or complicated | - Oral combination <br/> - Avoid fluoroquinolones in patients with QT prolongation or tendon disorders [^notfound] |
| Metronidazole + trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | Uncomplicated or complicated | - Oral combination <br/> - Alternative to fluoroquinolones [^notfound] |
| Metronidazole + cephalosporin (e.g. ceftriaxone) | Complicated | - IV combination <br/> - Suitable for hospitalized patients [^notfound] |
| Piperacillin-tazobactam | Complicated | - IV monotherapy <br/> - Broad-spectrum coverage [^notfound] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Duration varies with disease severity and whether source control is achieved. Uncomplicated cases are treated for **4–7 days** [^f627c32c]; complicated cases with adequate source control also receive **4–7 days**, whereas cases without source control may require **10–14 days**. Elderly or frail patients may benefit from **shorter courses (3–5 days)** after source control [^4cc249ad].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Routine antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis do not improve recovery, prevent complications, or reduce recurrence [^337c5213] [^a6ce8159]. Selective use yields **comparable outcomes** to routine use, with no significant differences in complications, recurrence, or surgery [^ffb71495] [^a3133387].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Antibiotics carry risks, including gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, and C. difficile infection [^8a148620]. Routine use in uncomplicated cases may cause **unnecessary adverse effects** without clinical benefit [^337c5213] [^a6ce8159].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Antibiotics are recommended due to higher risk of complications [^9070f7c7] [^51e3b6f0].
- **Elderly or frail patients**: Lower threshold for antibiotics; consider shorter courses (3–5 days) after source control [^4cc249ad] [^d66821be].
- **Pregnancy**: Avoid fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines; prefer beta-lactams [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **selective antibiotic use** in uncomplicated diverticulitis and mandatory therapy for complicated disease [^e7d0ced9] [^11e82e20] [^53d65fb8]. They also call for regimen selection based on local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors [^7c1e9cab] [^ace902df].

---

Antibiotics are **not routinely required** for uncomplicated diverticulitis; use them selectively based on clinical judgment and patient factors [^337c5213] [^e7d0ced9]. For complicated disease, antibiotics are mandatory and should cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, with duration tailored to severity and source control [^53d65fb8] [^1618d37c].

The treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (UD) with antibiotics remains common despite substantial evidence supporting the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic outpatient management. In the past 15 years, there have been two landmark randomized-controlled clinical trials, follow-up studies, and numerous retrospective studies that have supported the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic management of UD. Multiple medical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Physicians recommend using antibiotics selectively rather than routinely in UD. We aim to raise physician awareness of the latest guideline recommendations through our article, potentially improving antibiotic stewardship and reducing related healthcare costs.

Background

Diverticulitis is a complication of the common condition, diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics, as diverticulitis has been regarded as an infectious disease. Risk factors for diverticulitis, however, may suggest that the condition is inflammatory rather than infectious which makes the use of antibiotics questionable.

Objectives

The objectives of this systematic review were to determine if antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis affects the risk of complications (immediate or late) or the need for emergency surgery.

Search Methods

For this update, a comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform on February 2021.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including all types of patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of left-sided uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Comparator and interventions included antibiotics compared to no antibiotics, placebo, or to any other antibiotic treatment (different regimens, routes of administration, dosage or duration of treatment). Primary outcome measures were complications and emergency surgery. Secondary outcomes were recurrence, late complications, elective colonic resections, length of hospital stay, length to recovery of symptoms, adverse events and mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors performed the searches, identification and assessment of RCTs and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of the third author. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or for preliminary results of ongoing trials. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was used to assess the methodological quality of the identified trials. The overall quality of evidence for outcomes was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Effect estimates were extracted as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed with the Mantel-Haenzel method.

Main Results

The authors included five studies. Three studies compared no antibiotics to antibiotics; all three were original RCTs of which two also published long-term follow-up information. For the outcome of short-term complications there may be little or no difference between antibiotics and no antibiotics (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.30 to 2.62; 3 studies, 1329 participants; low-certainty evidence). The rate of emergency surgery within 30 days may be lower with no antibiotics compared to antibiotics (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.13, 1.71; 1329 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). However, there is considerable imprecision due to wide confidence intervals for this effect estimate causing uncertainty which means that there may also be a benefit with antibiotics. One of the two remaining trials compared single to double compound antibiotic therapy and, due to wide confidence intervals, the estimate was imprecise and indicated an uncertain clinical effect between these two antibiotic regimens (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.11 to 4.58; 51 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). The last trial compared short to long intravenous administration of antibiotics and did not report any events for our primary outcomes. Both trials included few participants and one had overall high risk of bias. Since the first publication of this systematic review, an increasing amount of evidence supporting the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics has been published, but the total body of evidence is still limited.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence on antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis suggests that the effect of antibiotics is uncertain for complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, elective colonic resections, and long-term complications. The quality of the evidence is low. Only three RCTs on the need for antibiotics are currently available. More trials are needed to obtain more precise effect estimates.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^74395565]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The decision to treat patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis with antibiotics or not does not depend on a single outcome measure. All reasons in favour of using antibiotics and all reasons in favour of omitting them should be taken into account. Omitting antibiotics did not increase the risk of ongoing diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis or sigmoid resection, and is therefore a safe treatment strategy. Insufficient statistical power to detect small differences in complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection may leave some room for discussion if these small differences are considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics should be limited as much as possible to minimize the global threat of rising microbial resistance and to prevent antibiotic‐related morbidity (8.3 per cent of all patients in DIABOLO 2), including potentially life‐threatening allergic reactions. In the end, individual‐patient characteristics or preferences may be deciding factors in the decision‐making process. However, in subgroups of patients with independent risk factors for adverse outcome (high pain scores, high WBC and a history of acute diverticulitis at presentation) no beneficial role for antibiotics in the prevention of such adverse outcomes was found.

### Outcome variation in the use and duration of antibiotic therapy in patients presenting with acute diverticulitis [^96f61aeb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

With some institutions adopting a no-antibiotics approach to patients with acute diverticulitis, our data suggest comparable or even improved outcomes in patients who are selected for this approach. Among those who receive antibiotics, shorter- vs. longer-durations of treatment do not seem to reduce episodes of recurrent disease. Indeed, those given longer courses were more likely to require eventual surgery than those with shorter durations. These data support institutional consideration for antibiotic-sparing protocols in appropriately selected patients with diverticulitis. Further, they suggest that longer courses of antibiotics are associated with worse outcomes, including higher rates of subsequent antibiotic use and surgery. Finally, there is a persistent need for investigation into obese, older, and comorbid individuals and the viability of antibiotic sparing approaches in these cohorts that increasingly represent the US population.

Acute diverticulitis — antibiotic regimen and coverage guidance notes no preferred regimen or route/duration, indicates antibiotics for all complicated cases, and advises spectrum based on stewardship principles. There is no evidence to support a particular antibiotic regime, route, or duration for complicated acute diverticulitis. Antibiotics are indicated in all complicated acute diverticulitis cases. If a drainage procedure is indicated, there is no evidence to support a prolonged course of antibiotics after source control is achieved. Our expert panel recommended that antibiotic use covers gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria based on institutional protocols and antibiotic stewardship principles. (LoE: very low. Strength of recommendation: strong).

Acute diverticulitis — antibiotic use and generalizability of evidence are described: Two recent randomized trials and 2 systematic reviews have reported no clear benefit and questioned the routine use of antibiotics, as does this guideline, suggesting selective and individualized use. Further, the patients studied were inpatients with uncomplicated disease confirmed by computed tomography (CT); therefore, the results should not be generalized to complicated patients (those with abscesses or fistulas), those with severe infection or sepsis, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with significant comorbidities. Outpatient management without antibiotics has not been studied, although we would expect these patients to have generally milder disease and logically equal or better outcomes.

### Antibiotics versus No antibiotics for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ffb71495]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are routinely used for diverticulitis irrespective of severity. Current practice guidelines favor against the use of antibiotics for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Objective

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the role of antibiotic use in an episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Data Sources

PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane were used.

Study Selection

Eligible studies included those with patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis receiving any antibiotics compared with patients not receiving any antibiotics (or observed alone).

Main Outcome Measures

Pooled odds rate of total complications, treatment failure, recurrent diverticulitis, readmission rate, sigmoid resection, mortality rate, and length of stay were measured.

Results

Of 1050 citations reviewed, 7 studies were eligible for the analysis. There were total of 2241 patients: 895 received antibiotics (mean age = 59.1 y; 38% men) and 1346 did not receive antibiotics (mean age = 59.4 y; 37% men). Antibiotics were later added in 2.7% patients who initially were observed off antibiotics. Length of hospital stay was not significantly different among either group (no antibiotics = 3.1 d vs antibiotics = 4.5 d; p = 0.20). Pooled rate of recurrent diverticulitis was not significantly different among both groups (pooled OR = 1.27 (95%, CI 0.90–1.79); p = 0.18). Rate of total complications (pooled OR = 1.99 (95% CI, 0.66–6.01); p = 0.22), treatment failure (pooled OR = 0.68 (95% CI, 0.42–1.09); p = 0.11), readmissions (pooled OR = 0.75 (95% CI, 0.44–1.30); p = 0.31). and patients who required sigmoid resection (pooled OR = 3.37 (95% CI, 0.65–17.34); p = 0.15) were not significantly different among patients who received antibiotics and those who did not. Mortality rates were 4 of 1310 (no-antibiotic group) versus 4 of 863 (antibiotic group).

Limitations

Only 2 randomized controlled studies were available and there was high heterogeneity in existing data.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis of current literature shows that patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis can be monitored off antibiotics.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^913d93b4]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis has been treated routinely with antibiotics for decades, although several guidelines have adapted their recommendations meanwhile. These now state that antibiotics should not be used routinely or can be avoided 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Some guidelines, however, state that antibiotics 'should be used selectively' (American Gastroenterological Association Institute guideline 11), antibiotics 'should be given to patients with risk indications of a complicated course' (German guideline 9), or antibiotics 'on a case‐by‐case basis should possibly be considered' (Italian guideline 8).

Little is known, however, about risk factors for a complicated course of initially uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Therefore, guidelines cannot recommend antibiotics for specific patient subgroups, besides subgroups that were excluded from studies on this topic such as immunocompromised patients and women. The present meta‐analysis identified several risk factors for one or more adverse outcomes that can guide the selection of patients who may benefit from antibiotics. However, the results showed that omitting antibiotics does not increase the risk of adverse outcomes in these high‐risk patients. Therefore, prevention of these adverse outcomes with antibiotic treatment may not be warranted.

Conclusion

This joint EAES and SAGES collaborative consensus conference updates surgeons on current and best evidence and provides a set of recommendations that can guide clinical practice on the management of acute diverticulitis. Strong membership engagement helped to highlight the clinical relevance of consensus recommendations and shed light on ongoing controversies related to diagnosis and management of acute diverticulitis.

### Outcome variation in the use and duration of antibiotic therapy in patients presenting with acute diverticulitis [^270e7727]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis is an inflammatory condition of pouch-like protrusions of the inner layer of the bowel, most commonly in the sigmoid colon. In 2021, diverticulitis was associated with nine billion dollars in health care costs in the United States (US), and nearly 300,000 emergency department (ED) visits. While the incidence of diverticulitis is increasing, management is in the midst of a paradigm shift with an increasing emphasis on conservative, outpatient management of uncomplicated disease.

Related to this change in management is a gradual adoption of an antibiotic-sparing approach for uncomplicated disease in select patients. This approach may be acceptable to patients and has the potential to significantly reduce the associated health care costs and the overuse of antibiotics. While this antibiotic-sparing approach is supported by data from randomized control trials and has been incorporated into guidelines from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, up to 24% of individuals experience treatment failure. These same guidelines caution that data are limited to uncomplicated disease in immunocompetent patients without significant comorbidities, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension, which dramatically limits the generalizability of this management strategy. Further, a recent Cochrane review cautions that the overall body of evidence regarding this practice remains limited in part due to wide confidence intervals and associated uncertainty regarding the potential benefits of antibiosis.

Overall, the widespread adoption of antibiotic-sparing approaches has not occurred, and prognosticating which patients may benefit from antibiotics remains understudied. Finally, optimal duration of treatment in patients who are offered antibiotic management without procedural source control is unknown. Given this complex and evolving landscape, exploring the patterns of antibiotic use and their associated outcomes in diverticulitis is warranted. Here, we employ a large commercial insurance claims database to examine the relationship between antibiotic use/duration and outcomes, including: subsequent antibiotic use, repeat ED visits, and surgery.

### Randomized clinical trial of observational versus antibiotic treatment for a first episode of CT-proven uncomplicated acute diverticulitis [^2dda6be5]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are advised in most guidelines on acute diverticulitis, despite a lack of evidence to support their routine use. This trial compared the effectiveness of a strategy with or without antibiotics for a first episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.

Methods

Patients with CT-proven, primary, left-sided, uncomplicated, acute diverticulitis were included at 22 clinical sites in the Netherlands, and assigned randomly to an observational or antibiotic treatment strategy. The primary endpoint was time to recovery during 6 months of follow-up. Main secondary endpoints were readmission rate, complicated, ongoing and recurrent diverticulitis, sigmoid resection and mortality. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were done.

Results

A total of 528 patients were included. Median time to recovery was 14 (i.q.r. 6–35) days for the observational and 12 (7–30) days for the antibiotic treatment strategy, with a hazard ratio for recovery of 0.91 (lower limit of 1-sided 95 per cent c.i. 0.78; P = 0.151). No significant differences between the observation and antibiotic treatment groups were found for secondary endpoints: complicated diverticulitis (3.8 versus 2.6 per cent respectively; P = 0.377), ongoing diverticulitis (7.3 versus 4.1 per cent; P = 0.183), recurrent diverticulitis (3.4 versus 3.0 per cent; P = 0.494), sigmoid resection (3.8 versus 2.3 per cent; P = 0.323), readmission (17.6 versus 12.0 per cent; P = 0.148), adverse events (48.5 versus 54.5 per cent; P = 0.221) and mortality (1.1 versus 0.4 per cent; P = 0.432). Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the observation group (2 versus 3 days; P = 0.006). Per-protocol analyses were concordant with the intention-to-treat analyses.

Conclusion

Observational treatment without antibiotics did not prolong recovery and can be considered appropriate in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Registration number: NCT01111253 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).

### Recent advances in the treatment of colonic diverticular disease and prevention of acute diverticulitis [^83735300]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Prevention of acute diverticulitis

Primary prevention of acute diverticulitis is a very important topic. Acute diverticulitis, defined as acute inflammation of a colonic diverticulum, is a common emergency presentation managed by both surgeons and physicians. Factors predisposing to the development of acute diverticulitis include obesity, smoking, lack of physical activity and medication use such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

There have been advances in the medical treatments offered to patients in recent years. Patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis are generally treated as outpatients with a clear liquid diet and antibiotics. In outpatients, broad-spectrum antibiotics are usually given for 7–10 days. If opioid analgesics are required for pain control, meperidine is the preferred option since morphine causes colonic spasm and may accentuate colonic hyper-segmentation.

Outpatient treatment is effective in most cases, and less than 10% of patients are readmitted at the emergency room for diverticulitis within 60 days of the initial evaluation. Hospitalization with intravenous antibiotic treatment is usually recommended by current guidelines if the patient: is unable to take oral therapy; is affected by severe comorbidity; fails to improve with outpatient therapy; or is affected by complicated diverticulitis. Clinical improvement in patients affected by acute diverticulitis is generally observed within 3–4 days. If patients are hospitalized, a 7–10 day course of oral antibiotics is usually given following discharge. However, results of studies investigating such prevention are often conflicting.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^81b90ac7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — initial care without antibiotics in select patients: ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). "Select" patients are defined as immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis, with no systemic inflammatory response or immunosuppression, who are not medically frail, do not require hospitalization, and can follow up as an outpatient under medical supervision with social and family support. For these patients, low-certainty evidence showed that there may be no differences in diverticulitis-related complications, quality of life, need for surgery, or long-term recurrence between those receiving and those not receiving antibiotics; initial management without antibiotics should be coupled with watchful waiting and ability to continue monitoring patient status, and this recommendation does not apply to patients with complicated diverticulitis, systemic inflammatory response, immunosuppression, or ongoing or recent antibiotic treatment. Implementation does not require a CT-confirmed diagnosis, but clinicians should err on the side of imaging in patients with signs and symptoms consistent with perforation, bleeding, obstruction, or abscess; the included studies did not report how many patients randomly assigned to watchful waiting needed antibiotics at follow-up (6, 12, 24 months and 11 years).

### International, expert-based, consensus statement regarding the management of acute diverticulitis [^b5e6ad93]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

This Delphi study provides consensus related to many aspects of acute diverticulitis and identifies other areas in need of research.

Objective

To generate an international, expert-based, consensus statement to address controversies in the management of acute diverticulitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study was conducted using the Delphi technique from April 3 through October 21, 2014. A survey website was used and a panel of acute diverticulitis experts was formed via the snowball method. The top 5 acute diverticulitis experts in 5 international geographic regions were identified based on their number of publications related to acute diverticulitis.

Interventions

The Delphi study used 3 rounds of questions, after which the consensus statement was collated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

A consensus statement related to the management of acute diverticulitis.

Results

Twenty items were selected for inclusion in the consensus statement following 3 rounds of questioning. A clear definition of uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis is provided. In uncomplicated diverticulitis, consensus was reached regarding appropriate laboratory and radiological evaluation of patients as well as nonsurgical, surgical, and follow-up strategies. A number of important topics, including antibiotic treatment, failed to reach consensus. In addition, consensus was reached regarding many nonsurgical and surgical treatment strategies in complicated diverticulitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Controversy continues internationally regarding the management of acute diverticulitis. This study demonstrates that there is more nonconsensus among experts than consensus regarding most issues, even in the same region. It also provides insight into the status quo regarding the treatment of acute diverticulitis and provides important direction for future research.

### SAGES white paper on antibiotic omission in the management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis: why, when, who, and most importantly, how [^aa89f7e1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Historically, the management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was centered on antibiotics. However, modern theories regarding the pathogenesis of diverticulitis have challenged the notion that antibiotics are necessary in all cases. Despite major reform in many societal guidelines, the adoption of non-antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated diverticulitis has been limited, especially in North America. The purpose of this SAGES White Paper was to review the available evidence on antibiotic omission in uncomplicated diverticulitis and to explore methods of safe implementation.

Methods

A task force within the SAGES Colorectal Surgery Committee was formed to work on this White Paper. The committee and its leadership approved an outline that would focus on the following topics: (1) Defining the problem with unnecessary antibiotic exposure; (2) Evaluating the evidence on antibiotic omission in uncomplicated diverticulitis; (3) Identifying the appropriate patient for antibiotic omission; (4) Outlining how to counsel patients who are treated without antibiotics; (5) Reviewing methods to safely implement this practice in both the hospital and community setting. These topics were divided up among members of the task force who performed a structured literature search in preparation for their assignments.

Results

Antibiotics are associated with several patient and societal adverse effects, including the rising problem of antimicrobial resistance. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated no superiority to the routine administration of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Appropriate patients for antibiotic omission include those who are immunocompetent, non-septic, and have mild symptoms/disease severity on imaging. Existing frameworks for the safe implementation of new practices can be referenced to help increase adoption of non-antibiotic therapy.

Conclusion

The existing body of evidence supports antibiotic omission in appropriate cases of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. In order to increase the widespread adoption of this practice, buy-in from key stakeholders (both healthcare professionals and patients) is necessary.

Our approach to the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis has evolved over the past 20 y. Routine use of antibiotics has decreased with recent studies suggesting simple cases of diverticulitis can be selectively managed without antibiotics. The criteria necessitating surgical intervention have also been amended as our understanding of the natural history of diverticulitis has grown. We favor selective use of antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, and surgery depending on the severity of the disease, patient factors, and clinical context.

### Treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a3133387]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite low-quality and conflicting evidence, the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland recommends the routine use of antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Recent studies have shown that treatment without antibiotics did not prolong recovery. Some new guidelines currently recommend selective use of antibiotics.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the safety, effectiveness, and outcomes in treating uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics with treatment with antibiotics.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library were searched with the key words antibiotics and diverticulitis.

Study Selection

All studies published in English on treating uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics and containing > 20 individuals were included.

Intervention

Treatment without antibiotics versus treatment with antibiotics were compared.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the percentage of patients requiring additional treatment or intervention to settle during the initial episode. The secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay, rate of readmission or deferred admission, need for surgical or radiological intervention, recurrence, and complication.

Results

Search yielded 1164 studies. Nine studies were eligible and included in the meta-analysis, composed of 2505 patients, including 1663 treated without antibiotics and 842 treated with an antibiotic. The no-antibiotics group had a significantly shorter hospital stay (mean difference = -0.68; p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients requiring additional treatment or intervention to settle during the initial episode (5.3% vs 3.6%; risk ratio = 1.48; p = 0.28), rate of readmission or deferred admission (risk ratio = 1.17; p = 0.26), need for surgical or radiological intervention (risk ratio = 0.61; p = 0.34), recurrence (risk ratio = 0.83; p = 0.21), and complications (risk ratio = 0.70–1.18; p = 0.67–0.91).

Limitations

Only a limited number of studies were available, and they were of variable qualities.

Conclusions

Treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics is associated with a significantly shorter hospital stay. There is no significant difference in the percentage of patients requiring additional treatment or intervention to settle in the initial episode, rate of readmission or deferred admission, need for surgical or radiological intervention, recurrence, or complications.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^1e42fae6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

What is the best treatment for patients with a small diverticular abscess (< 4–5 cm)? What is the best treatment for patients with large diverticular abscess?

For patients with a small (< 4–5 cm) diverticular abscess, we suggest an initial trial of non-operative treatment with antibiotics alone (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

We suggest to treat patients with large abscesses with percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment; whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, we suggest to initially treat patients with large abscesses with antibiotic therapy alone, clinical conditions permitting. Alternatively, an operative intervention is required (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. The treatment of abscess always requires antibiotic therapy. If the abscess is limited in size, systemic antibiotic therapy alone is considered safe and effective in removing the abscess and solving acute inflammation with a pooled failure rate of 20% and a mortality rate of 0.6%.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^a95d911b]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis has been treated routinely with antibiotics for decades, although evidence in favour of antibiotic treatment has always been lacking. Recently two RCTs 1, 2 demonstrated the safety of omitting antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis up to 1 year of follow‐up. First, the AVOD Antibiotics in Acute Uncomplicated Diverticulitis trial 1 showed comparable rates of complicated diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis and sigmoid resection between observational and antibiotic treatment. Second, the DIABOLO (Diverticulitis: Antibiotics or Close Observation) trial 2 found no significant differences regarding time to recovery, complicated diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis and sigmoid resection. However, both RCTs reported somewhat – by and large non‐significant – higher rates of complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resections in the non‐antibiotic group. As neither of the studies was powered to analyse these secondary outcomes, uncertainty remained whether these small differences could potentially be true causal associations, the consequence of patient selection or findings by chance in accordance with statistical non‐significance. A regular meta‐analysis of the two RCTs would not be able to account for different follow‐up times and different outcome definitions that were provided in the results papers of these studies. In contrast, a meta‐analysis of individual‐patient data can not only account for these differences but additionally provide an opportunity to use the increased sample size of both trials combined. The aim was to identify patients at risk of complications who may benefit from antibiotic treatment.

### Randomized clinical trial of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [^a6ce8159]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The standard of care for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis today is antibiotic treatment, although there are no controlled studies supporting this management. The aim was to investigate the need for antibiotic treatment in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, with the endpoint of recovery without complications after 12 months of follow-up.

Methods

This multicentre randomized trial involving ten surgical departments in Sweden and one in Iceland recruited 623 patients with computed tomography-verified acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis. Patients were randomized to treatment with (314 patients) or without (309 patients) antibiotics.

Results

Age, sex, body mass index, co-morbidities, body temperature, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level on admission were similar in the two groups. Complications such as perforation or abscess formation were found in six patients (1.9 per cent) who received no antibiotics and in three (1.0 per cent) who were treated with antibiotics (P = 0.302). The median hospital stay was 3 days in both groups. Recurrent diverticulitis necessitating readmission to hospital at the 1-year follow-up was similar in the two groups (16 per cent, P = 0.881).

Conclusion

Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerates recovery nor prevents complications or recurrence. It should be reserved for the treatment of complicated diverticulitis.

### It's actually a little complicated: antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis [^664648ff]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The assumption that acute uncomplicated diverticulitis requires antibiotics has been challenged. In this issue, the Dutch Diverticular Disease Collaborative Study Group report the 2-year follow-up to their trial of observation vs. treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The new study provides useful insights on the natural history of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The most intriguing data compared rates of elective sigmoid resection between the groups. There was a trend toward more elective surgery in the observation group compared to those in the antibiotic group. It might be too soon to abandon antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### Antibiotics versus no antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ecd6b616]. Colorectal Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (AUD) is common and antibiotics are the cornerstone of traditional conservative management. This approach lacks clear evidence base and studies have recently suggested that avoidance of antibiotics is a safe and efficacious way to manage AUD. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the safety and efficacy of treating AUD without antibiotics.

Methods

A systematic search of Embase, Cochrane library, MEDLINE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and ClinicalTrials. gov was performed. Studies comparing antibiotics versus no antibiotics in the treatment of AUD were included. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model with the primary outcome measure being diverticulitis-associated complications. Secondary outcomes were readmission rate, diverticulitis recurrence, mean hospital stay, requirement for surgery and requirement for percutaneous drainage.

Results

Eight studies were included involving 2469 patients; 1626 in the non-antibiotic group (NAb) and 843 in the antibiotic group (Ab). There was a higher complication rate in the Ab group however this was not significant (1.9% versus 2.6%) with a combined risk ratio (RR) of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.25 to 1.57, p = 0.32). There was a shorter mean length of hospital stay in the Nab group (standard mean difference of -1.18 (95% CI, -2.34 to -0.03 p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in readmission, recurrence and surgical intervention rate or requirement for percutaneous drainage.

Conclusion

Treatment of AUD without antibiotics may be feasible with outcomes that are comparable to antibiotic treatment and with potential benefits for patients and the NHS. Large scale randomised multicentre studies are needed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

### Patient and physician preferences for antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis: a Delphi consensus process to generate noninferiority margins [^7cd4b8d8]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the existing evidence, the omission of antibiotics in the management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis has not gained widespread acceptance.

Objective

This study aims to incorporate the input of both patients and physicians on the omission of antibiotics in uncomplicated diverticulitis to generate noninferiority margins for 3 outcomes.

Design

This was a mixed-methods study, including in-person interviews with patients and a Delphi process with physicians.

Settings

North American patients and physicians participated.

Patients

Consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy, 40% of whom had a previous history of diverticulitis, were selected.

Interventions

Informational video (for patients) and evidence summaries (for physicians) regarding antibiotics in diverticulitis were reviewed.

Main Outcomes Measures

Noninferiority margins were generated for time to reach full recovery, persistent diverticulitis, and progression to complicated diverticulitis in the context of a nonantibiotic strategy. Consensus was defined as an interquartile range < 2.5.

Results

Fifty patients participated in this study. To avoid antibiotics, patients were willing to accept up to 5.0 (3.0–7.0) days longer to reach full recovery, up to an absolute increase of 4.0% (4.0–6.0) in the risk of developing persistent diverticulitis, and up to an absolute increase of 2.0% (0–3.8) in the risk of progressing to complicated diverticulitis. A total of 55 physicians participated in the Delphi (round 1 response rate = 94.8%; round 2 response rate = 100%). Consensus noninferiority margins were generated for persistent diverticulitis (4.0%, 4.0–5.0) and progression to complicated diverticulitis (3.0%, 2.0–3.0), but could not be generated for time to reach full recovery (5.0 days, 3.5–7.0).

Limitations

Patients were recruited from a single institution, and Delphi participants were invited and not randomly selected.

Conclusion

Noninferiority margins were generated for 3 important outcomes after the treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis in the context of a nonantibiotic strategy.

### EAES and SAGES 2018 consensus conference on acute diverticulitis management: evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice [^1e7058df]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Consensus was reached with no further voting.

Statement: There is no evidence to support a particular antibiotic regime, route, or duration for complicated acute diverticulitis. Antibiotics are indicated in all complicated acute diverticulitis cases. If a drainage procedure is indicated, there is no evidence to support a prolonged course of antibiotics after source control is achieved.

Recommendation: Our expert panel recommended that antibiotic use covers gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria based on institutional protocols and antibiotic stewardship principles. (LoE: very low. Strength of recommendation: strong).

Membership survey results: Yes 767 (99.1%).

644 members (83.2%) agreed that this recommendation was already their current practice; 67 (8.66%) agreed that this recommendation was likely to change their practice while 63 (8.14%) disagreed that it was likely to change their practice.

Consensus was reached with no further voting.

Statement: Percutaneously drained abscesses > 4 cm successfully resolved in 80% of patients with a low complication and re-intervention rate.

Recommendation: Our expert panel recommends that percutaneous drainage be considered for larger abscesses, those that do not resolve on antibiotics, and/or in the presence of patient deterioration. (LoE: low, Strength of recommendation: weak).

Membership survey results: Yes 655 (86.3%).

540 members (71.15%) agreed that this recommendation was already their current practice; 78 (10.28%) agreed that this recommendation was likely to change their practice while 141 (18.58%) disagreed that it was likely to change their practice.

### Use of antibiotics in uncomplicated diverticulitis [^edfe8bb8]. The British Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The value of antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis is not well established. The aim of this review was to assess whether or not antibiotics contribute to the (uneventful) recovery from acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis, and which types of antibiotic and route of administration are most effective.

Methods

Medline, the Cochrane Library and Embase databases were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective or retrospective cohort studies addressing conservative treatment of mild uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis and use of antibiotics were included.

Results

No randomized or prospective studies were found on the topic of effect on outcome. One retrospective cohort study was retrieved that compared a group treated with antibiotics with observation alone. This study showed no difference in success rate between groups. Only one RCT of moderate quality compared intravenous and oral administration of antibiotics, and found no differences. One other RCT of very poor quality compared two different kinds of intravenous antibiotic and also found no difference. A small retrospective cohort study comparing antibiotics with and without anaerobe coverage showed no difference in group outcomes.

Conclusion

Evidence on the use of antibiotics in mild or uncomplicated diverticulitis is sparse and of low quality. There is no evidence mandating the routine use of antibiotics in uncomplicated diverticulitis, although several guidelines recommend this. Copyright © 2011 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^549aeb7a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — initial management of acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis: "ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)". For select patients with abdominal tenderness, "it is reasonable to initially manage them by observation with supportive care (for example, bowel rest and hydration) and without the use of antibiotics", and "Select patients are defined as immunocompetent patients with mild, uncomplicated disease who are not medically frail, do not require hospitalization, and can follow up as an outpatient under medical supervision with social and family support". Evidence cited states there "may be no differences in diverticulitis-related complications (such as abscess, fistula, stenosis, and obstruction), quality of life, need for surgery, or long-term recurrence between those receiving and those not receiving antibiotics", though "antibiotic treatment may slightly decrease treatment failure rates (defined as "ongoing diverticulitis" within 3 months of treatment) compared with no antibiotic treatment". Clinical considerations specify this "does not apply to patients with complicated diverticulitis, systemic inflammatory response, immunosuppression, or ongoing or recent antibiotic treatment", and that "Initial management without antibiotics should be coupled with watchful waiting and ability to continue monitoring patient status, based on individual clinical judgment".

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^fc24199f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis in adults. This guideline is based on current best available evidence about benefits and harms, taken in the context of costs and patient values and preferences.

Methods

The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) developed this guideline based on a systematic review on the use of computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis and on management via hospitalization, antibiotic use, and interventional percutaneous abscess drainage. The systematic review evaluated outcomes that the CGC rated as critical or important. This guideline was developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with suspected or known acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis.

Recommendation 1

ACP suggests that clinicians use abdominal CT imaging when there is diagnostic uncertainty in a patient with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP suggests that clinicians manage most patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in an outpatient setting (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

### Contemporary review of risk-stratified management in acute uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis [^7e20a7cb]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a common clinical condition. Severity of the disease is based on clinical, laboratory, and radiological investigations and dictates the need for medical or surgical intervention. Recent clinical trials have improved the understanding of the natural history of the disease resulting in new approaches to and better evidence for the management of acute diverticulitis.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Library (years 2004–2015), MEDLINE (years 2004–2015), and EMBASE (years 2004–2015) databases. We used the search terms "diverticulitis, colonic" or "acute diverticulitis" or "divertic" in combination with the terms "management", "antibiotics", "non-operative", or "surgery". Registers for clinical trials (such as the WHO registry and the https://clinicaltrials.gov/) were searched for ongoing, recruiting, or closed trials not yet published.

Results

Antibiotic treatment can be avoided in simple, non-complicated diverticulitis and outpatient management is safe. The management of complicated disease, ranging from a localized abscess to perforation with diffuse peritonitis, has changed towards either percutaneous or minimally invasive approaches in selected cases. The role of laparoscopic lavage without resection in perforated non-fecal diverticulitis is still debated; however, recent evidence from two randomised controlled trials has found a higher re-intervention in this group of patients.

Conclusions

A shift in management has occurred towards conservative management in acute uncomplicated disease. Those with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis may be treated without antibiotics. For complicated diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis, the use of peritoneal lavage appears to be non-superior to resection.

What is the optimal antibiotic therapy for patients with diffuse peritonitis due to diverticular perforation? What is the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy after surgical source control in diffuse peritonitis due to diverticular perforation?

We suggest to choose the empirically designed antibiotic regimen on the basis of the underlying clinical condition of the patient, the pathogens presumed to be involved, and the risk factors for major antimicrobial resistance patterns (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B).

We suggest a 4-day period of postoperative antibiotic therapy in complicated ALCD if source control has been adequate (weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B).

Antibiotic therapy plays an important role in the management of complicated acute diverticulitis. Typically, it is an empiric antibiotic treatment. The regimen should depend on the severity of infection, the pathogens presumed to be involved, and the risk factors indicative of major resistance patterns. Several recommendations have been recently published in literature. However, consideration of local epidemiological data and resistance profiles is essential for antibiotic selection.

Considering intestinal microbiota of large bowel acute diverticulitis requires antibiotic coverage for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as for anaerobes. Most of the complicated acute diverticulitis is mainly a community-acquired infection. The main resistance threat in IAIs is posed by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which are becoming increasingly common in community-acquired infections worldwide. The most significant risk factors for ESBL-producing pathogens include prior exposure to antibiotics and comorbidities requiring concurrent antibiotic therapy. Anti-ESBL-producer coverage should be warranted for patients with these risk factors. Discontinuation of antibiotic treatment should be at 4 days from source control as this has been demonstrated as non-inferior to longer therapy based on the STOP IT trial.

The recent prospective trial by Sawyer et al. demonstrated that in patients with complicated IAIs undergoing an adequate source-control procedure, the outcomes after approximately 4 days fixed-duration antibiotic therapy were similar to those after a longer course of antibiotics that extended until after the resolution of physiological abnormalities. Patients who have signs of sepsis beyond 5 to 7 days of adequate antibiotic treatment warrant aggressive diagnostic investigation in search of a reservoir of infection.

Acute diverticulitis is a common condition that has been increasing in incidence in the United States. It is associated with increasing age, but the pathophysiology of acute diverticulitis is still being elucidated. It is now believed to have a significant contribution from inflammatory processes rather than being a strictly infectious process. There are still many questions to be answered regarding the optimal management of acute diverticulitis because recent studies have challenged traditional practices, such as the routine use of antibiotics, surgical technique, and dietary restrictions for prevention of recurrence.

### Management of colonic diverticulitis [^1618d37c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Left sided colonic diverticulitis is a common and costly gastrointestinal disease in Western countries, characterized by acute onset of often severe abdominal pain. Imaging is necessary to make an initial diagnosis and determine disease severity. Colonoscopy should be done six to eight weeks after diagnosis to rule out a missed colon malignancy. Antibiotic treatment is used selectively in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The clinical course of diverticulitis commonly includes unpredictable recurrences and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, which are a detriment to quality of life. A better understanding of prognosis has prompted a shift toward non-operative approaches. The decision to undergo prophylactic colon resection should be individualized to consider the severity of diverticulitis, the patient's health and immune status, and the patient's preferences and values, as well as benefits and risks. Because only a section of colon is removed, recurrent diverticulitis remains a risk. Acute diverticulitis with an abscess is treated with antibiotics that cover Gram negative and anaerobic bacteria, with or without percutaneous drainage. Acute diverticulitis with purulent or feculent contamination of the peritoneal cavity is managed with surgery; primary resection and anastomosis is the procedure of choice in stable patients.

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis [^d56ecf39]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis is an inflammatory complication to the very common condition diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics with reference to the microbiology, extrapolation from trials on complicated intra-abdominal infections and clinical experience.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotic interventions for uncomplicated diverticulitis on relevant outcome.

Search Methods

Studies were identified by computerised searches of the The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Ongoing trials were identified and reference lists of identified trials and relevant review articles were screened for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs including all types of patients with a radiological confirmed diagnosis of left-sided uncomplicated diverticulitis. Interventions of antibiotics compared to any other antibiotic treatment (different regime, route of administration, dosage or duration of treatment), placebo or no antibiotics. Outcome measures were complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, late complications and duration of hospital stay and recovery of signs of infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors performed the searches, identification of RCTs, trial assessment and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of a third part. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or were contacted for preliminary results of ongoing trials. Effect estimates were extracted as relative risks (RR).

Main Results

Three RCTs were identified. A qualitative approach with no meta analysis was performed because of variety in interventions between included studies. Interventions compared were antibiotics to no antibiotics, single to double compound antibiotic therapy and short to long IV administration. None of the studies found significant difference between the tested interventions. Risk of bias varied from low to high. The newest RCT overall had the best quality and statistical power.

Authors' Conclusions

The newest evidence from one RCT says there is no significant difference between antibiotics versus no antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Previous RCTs have only suggested a non-inferiority between different antibiotic regimes and treatment lengths. This new evidence needs confirmation from more RCTs before it can be implicated safely in clinical guidelines. Ongoing RCTs will be published in the years to come and more are needed. The role of antibiotics in the treatment of complicated diverticulitis has not been investigated yet.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^d66821be]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Uncomplicated Diverticulitis

Little data exists to support optimal medical management of diverticulitis in older or frail adults. Historically, management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis involved inpatient admission with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Following several large randomized controlled trials of younger patients (mean age ~57) with few, if any comorbidities, outpatient management with omission of antibiotics has become the recommendation for young patients with mild uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, this treatment strategy has not been evaluated in older or frail adults. As such, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guidelines recommend selected use of antibiotics in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients who are frail or have significant comorbidities. Close clinical follow‐up is essential in older adults, and antibiotics and/or inpatient observation should be considered in older, frail patients with systemic symptoms, fever, leukocytosis, multiple comorbidities, or unreliable follow‐up.

The AGA suggests that colonoscopy be performed after resolution of acute diverticulitis in appropriate candidates to exclude the misdiagnosis of a colonic neoplasm if a high-quality examination of the colon has not been recently performed. The AGA suggests against elective colonic resection in patients with an initial episode of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, and states that the decision to perform elective prophylactic colonic resection in this setting should be individualized. The AGA suggests a fiber-rich diet or fiber supplementation in patients with a history of acute diverticulitis. The AGA suggests against routinely advising patients with a history of diverticulitis to avoid consumption of seeds, nuts, and popcorn. The AGA suggests against routinely advising patients with a history of diverticulitis to avoid the use of aspirin. The AGA suggests advising patients with a history of diverticulitis to avoid the use of nonaspirin NSAIDs if possible. The AGA recommends against the use of mesalamine after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The AGA suggests against the use of rifaximin after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The AGA suggests against the use of probiotics after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The AGA suggests advising patients with diverticular disease to consider vigorous physical activity.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update — management principles and patient counseling: Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course, and in patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively, rather than routinely, in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, while antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first presentation, and an elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of episodes; instead, a discussion of elective segmental resection should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis.

Colonic diverticulitis is a painful gastrointestinal disease that recurs unpredictably and can lead to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastroenterologists commonly care for patients with this disease. The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide practical and evidence-based advice for management of diverticulitis. We reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies to develop 14 best practices. In brief, computed tomography is often necessary to make a diagnosis. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis. Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course. In patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively rather than routinely in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. At the same time, patients should understand that genetic factors also contribute to diverticulitis risk. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first presentation. An elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of episodes. Instead, a discussion of elective segmental resection should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits.

Diverticulitis

Patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated with antibiotic therapy to address gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens (Recommendation 2C).

The routine use of antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is a point of controversy in the medical community.

In 2011, a systematic review was published overviewing antibiotic use in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Relevant data regarding the use of antibiotics in mild or uncomplicated cases of diverticulitis were sparse and of poor methodological quality. There was no concrete evidence to support the routine use of antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Recently a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial involving 10 surgical departments in Sweden and 1 in Iceland investigated the use of antibiotic treatment in cases of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerated recovery nor prevented complications or recurrence.

However, even in the absence of evidence supporting the routine use of antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, we recommend adequate antimicrobial coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic microorganisms.

Mild cases of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated in an outpatient setting. Outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis depends on the condition and compliance of the patient as well as his or her availability for follow-up analysis. The treatment involves orally administered antibiotics to combat gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria. If symptoms persist or worsen, the patient should be admitted for more aggressive inpatient treatment.

Hospitalized patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotic infusion.

The clinical value of antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis is poorly understood by the medical community and therefore merits further study.

### Antibiotics Do not reduce length of hospital stay for uncomplicated diverticulitis in a pragmatic double-blind randomized trial [^7752293e]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Antibiotic treatment is the standard care for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. However, this practice is based on low-level evidence and has been challenged by findings from 2 randomized trials, which did not include a placebo group. We investigated the non-inferiority of placebo vs antibiotic treatment for the management of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.

Methods

In the selective treatment with antibiotics for non-complicated diverticulitis study, 180 patients hospitalized for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis (determined by computed tomography, Hinchey 1a grade) from New Zealand and Australia were randomly assigned to groups given antibiotics (n = 85) or placebo (n = 95) for 7 days. We collected demographic, clinical, and laboratory data and answers to questionnaires completed every 12 hrs for the first 48 hrs and then daily until hospital discharge. The primary endpoint was length of hospital stay; secondary endpoints included occurrence of adverse events, readmission to the hospital, procedural intervention, change in serum markers of inflammation, and patient-reported pain scores at 12 and 24 hrs.

Results

There was no significant difference in median time of hospital stay between the antibiotic group (40.0 hrs; 95% CI, 24.4–57.6 hrs) and the placebo group (45.8 hrs; 95% CI, 26.5–60.2 hrs) (P = 0.2). There were no significant differences between groups in adverse events (12% for both groups; P = 1.0), readmission to the hospital within 1 week (1% for the placebo group vs 6% for the antibiotic group; P = 0.1), and readmission to the hospital within 30 days (11% for the placebo group vs 6% for the antibiotic group; P = 0.3).

Conclusions

Foregoing antibiotic treatment did not prolong length of hospital admission. This result provides strong evidence for omission of antibiotics for selected patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^95ef38c6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — outpatient care: ACP suggests that clinicians manage most patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in an outpatient setting (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). In the absence of evidence suggesting a benefit of routine hospitalization, the initial (default) management can be as an outpatient and applies to most immunocompetent patients who have no evidence of systemic inflammatory response and can continue treatment at home under medical supervision with adequate family and social support and follow-up. Low-certainty evidence showed that there may be no differences in risk for elective surgery or long-term diverticulitis recurrence for outpatient compared with inpatient management, and this recommendation does not apply to patients with suspected complicated diverticulitis, recent antibiotic use, concomitant unstable comorbid conditions, immunosuppression, or signs of sepsis.

Should antibiotics be recommended in immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis?

In immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis without signs of systemic inflammation, we recommend to not prescribe antibiotic therapy (strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A).

In patients requiring antibiotic therapy, we recommend oral administration whenever possible, primarily, because an early switch from intravenous to oral therapy may facilitate a shorter inpatient length of stay (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B).

The definition of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is often vague and poorly defined. Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is defined as localized diverticular inflammation without any abscess or perforation. A universally accepted classification divides intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) into complicated and uncomplicated. In uncomplicated IAIs, the infection only involves a single organ and does not extend to the peritoneum, while in complicated IAIs, the infectious process extends beyond the organ, causing either localized or diffuse peritonitis. For a better definition of acute diverticulitis in these guidelines, we use the term complicated and uncomplicated according to the classification of IAIs.

Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is an anatomically confined inflammatory process. CT findings include diverticula, thickening of the wall, and increased density of the pericolic fat. Patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis usually have an indolent course with a low incidence of subsequent complications.

The utility of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated acute diverticulitis has been a point of controversy. In recent years, several studies demonstrated that antimicrobial treatment was not superior to withholding antibiotic therapy, in terms of clinical resolution, in patients with mild unperforated diverticulitis. The current consensus is that uncomplicated acute diverticulitis may be a self-limiting condition in which local host defenses can manage the inflammation without antibiotics in immunocompetent patients. In this context, antibiotics are not necessary in the treatment of uncomplicated disease.

A multicenter randomized trial was published in 2012 by Chabok et al. involving ten surgical departments in Sweden and one in Iceland recruiting 623 patients with computed tomography-confirmed acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis. Patients were randomized to treatment with (314 patients) or without (309 patients) antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerated recovery nor prevented complications or recurrence. Therefore, antibiotics should be reserved for the treatment of complicated diverticulitis.

### Recent advances in the treatment of colonic diverticular disease and prevention of acute diverticulitis [^8bfba48c]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of diverticulosis and diverticular disease of the colon is increasing worldwide. Although the majority of patients remains asymptomatic long-life, the prevalence of diverticular disease of the colon, including acute diverticulitis, is substantial and is becoming a significant burden on National Health Systems in terms of direct and indirect costs. Focus is now being drawn on identifying the correct therapeutic approach by testing various treatments. Fiber, non-absorbable antibiotics and probiotics seem to be effective in treating symptomatic and uncomplicated patients, and 5-aminosalicylic acid might help prevent acute diverticulitis. Unfortunately, robust evidence on the effectiveness of a medical strategy to prevent acute diverticulitis recurrence is still lacking. We herein provide a concise review on the effectiveness and future perspectives of these treatments.

Discussion

In this large, retrospective claims-based cohort, we find favorable outcomes in individuals managed with antibiotic-sparing approaches, recapitulating evidence that has been incorporated into society guidelines. Despite this evidence base, we report that it is still a minority of individuals who are being managed with an antibiotic-sparing approach – only about 15% in these data. The rationale behind this is likely multifaceted and driven by both patient and provider factors. In a mixed methods survey attempting to identify barriers to trial enrollment for antibiotic-sparing approaches to diverticulitis, a major theme that emerged was hesitancy to undergo a treatment that did not involve antibiotics, based on a belief that antibiotics were "necessary for recovery"; conversely, some patients espoused a hesitancy to take antibiotics, or medications in general. Regarding provider factors, in a survey of Canadian providers, including both general surgeons and ED providers, 42% reported that they "never" omit antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis, citing discomfort with this modality and/or a lack of awareness of updated guidelines. Overall, changes in both patient and provider attitudes are necessary if adoption of antibiotic-sparing approaches is to become widespread.

Despite enthusiasm in the literature for antibiotic-sparing approaches, available data have rather limited generalizability amongst the US population, with its high prevalence of obesity and comorbidity burden. Specifically, individuals with more comorbidities appear to have higher rates of treatment failure with antibiotic-sparing approaches. This is concerning given the high comorbidity burden in the US population, especially as diverticulitis incidence is evolving toward a younger, but more comorbid population. Further, while obesity has been strongly linked both to development of diverticulitis and to worse diverticulitis-related outcomes, data regarding antibiotic-sparing management has been limited in obese individuals, with the median body mass index in randomized trials being 26 kg/m². Further, results from a recent Cochrane review suggest that there may be benefits to antibiosis that have not been captured with existing literature, given the wide confidence intervals in reported data.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^bb288ce5]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

SIS intra-abdominal infection guidelines — uncomplicated acute sigmoid diverticulitis: Prospective studies and an RCT indicate many patients can be treated entirely without antibiotic agents, with no differences in outcomes versus IV hydration alone; a Cochrane review suggests antibiotic agents may not be necessary, so omitting antimicrobial therapy appears reasonable in selected lower-risk patients, but it would be premature to apply this approach to higher-risk patients such as those receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

### Diverticulosis and acute diverticulitis [^5423a87c]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Colonic diverticulosis is a common, usually asymptomatic, entity of Western countries, with an incidence that increases with age. When these diverticula become infected and inflamed, patients can present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Management of acute, uncomplicated diverticulitis can often be treated successfully with antibiotics alone and the decision to proceed with more aggressive measures such as surgical intervention is made on a case-by-case basis. The treatment algorithm for diverticular disease continues to evolve as the pathophysiology, etiology, and natural history of the disease becomes better understood.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^ce5c5876]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

This individual‐patient data meta‐analysis included 1109 patients, 545 in the observational group and 564 in the antibiotics group. Duration of follow‐up was comparable between the groups: 12.3 (i.q.r. 12.1–13.0) months in the observational group and 12.4 (12.1–13.0) months in the antibiotics group. Baseline characteristics were mostly comparable; however, primary diverticulitis was slightly but significantly more common in the antibiotics group (Table 2).

Observational versus antibiotic treatment

The duration of stay for the initial hospital admission was slightly but non‐significantly shorter in the observational group compared with the antibiotics group (median 2 versus 3 days respectively; P = 0.037) (Table 3). Some 33 of 1109 patients (3.0 per cent) were treated as outpatients from the start of treatment. The rate of ongoing diverticulitis differed somewhat, but this difference failed to reach statistical significance: 7.2 per cent (39 of 545) in observational group versus 5.0 per cent (28 of 564) in the antibiotics group (P = 0.062). The rates of recurrent diverticulitis were comparable: 8.6 per cent (47 of 545) versus 9.6 per cent (54 of 564) respectively (P = 0.610). Complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection rates were recorded during the acute disease stage (within 1 month) and at 1‐year follow‐up. Rates of complicated diverticulitis within 1 month were comparable between groups: 1.8 per cent (10 of 545) in the observational group versus 1.1 per cent (6 of 564) in antibiotics group (P = 0.204); at 1‐year follow‐up they differed somewhat (by 10 patients), but non‐significantly: 4.0 per cent (22 of 545) versus 2.1 per cent (12 of 564) respectively (P = 0.079). Rates of sigmoid resection were no different between the groups at 1 month (0.6 per cent (3 of 545) versus 0.7 per cent (4 of 564); P = 0.818) or 1 year (5.0 per cent (27 of 545) versus 2.5 per cent (14 of 564); P = 0.214).

Background on imaging use and management uncertainty notes that computed tomography (CT) imaging is widely used to evaluate suspected diverticulitis, but questions exist about diagnostic accuracy, effects on management and diverticulitis-related outcomes, downstream consequences of incidental findings, and costs; management of uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally included bowel rest, fluids, and antibiotics, although there is uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of the routine use of antibiotics and the role of hospitalization in managing most episodes.

Values and preferences — patient and caregiver considerations: For abdominal computed tomography (CT) in diagnosing acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis, the guideline notes variability and drivers of choice, stating "Feedback from the CGC Public Panel showed variability in preferences about abdominal CT imaging for the diagnosis of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis", that "This variability was influenced by physician diagnostic uncertainty, risks and costs associated with CT imaging, and the low certainty of the evidence for benefits and harms of CT", and that "A trend was observed toward a preference for outpatient management of acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis". It further reports, "Geographic location and caregiver support at home were identified as important factors in a choice for outpatient treatment" and "A strong preference for management without antibiotics was also seen".

### EAES and SAGES 2018 consensus conference on acute diverticulitis management: evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice [^5802c5ad]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute diverticulitis (AD) presents a unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for general surgeons. This collaborative project between EAES and SAGES aimed to summarize recent evidence and draw statements of recommendation to guide our members on comprehensive AD management.

Methods

Systematic reviews of the literature were conducted across six AD topics by an international steering group including experts from both societies. Topics encompassed the epidemiology, diagnosis, management of non-complicated and complicated AD as well as emergency and elective operative AD management. Consensus statements and recommendations were generated, and the quality of the evidence and recommendation strength rated with the GRADE system. Modified Delphi methodology was used to reach consensus among experts prior to surveying the EAES and SAGES membership on the recommendations and likelihood to impact their practice. Results were presented at both EAES and SAGES annual meetings with live re-voting carried out for recommendations with < 70% agreement.

Results

A total of 51 consensus statements and 41 recommendations across all six topics were agreed upon by the experts and submitted for members' online voting. Based on 1004 complete surveys and over 300 live votes at the SAGES and EAES Diverticulitis Consensus Conference (DCC), consensus was achieved for 97.6% (40/41) of recommendations with 92% (38/41) agreement on the likelihood that these recommendations would change practice if not already applied. Areas of persistent disagreement included the selective use of imaging to guide AD diagnosis, recommendations against antibiotics in non-complicated AD, and routine colonic evaluation after resolution of non-complicated diverticulitis.

Conclusion

This joint EAES and SAGES consensus conference updates clinicians on the current evidence and provides a set of recommendations that can guide clinical AD management practice.

### Current diagnosis and management of acute colonic diverticulitis: what you need to know [^117c9a3a]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a common disease treated by acute care surgeons. Acute uncomplicated colonic diverticulitis involves thickening of the colon wall with inflammatory changes and less commonly requires the expertise of a surgeon; many cases may be treated as an outpatient with or without antibiotics. Complicated diverticulitis involves phlegmon, abscess, peritonitis, obstruction, stricture, and/or fistula and usually requires inpatient hospital admission, treatment with antibiotics, and consideration for intervention including operative management. This review will discuss what the acute care surgeon needs to know about diagnosis and management of acute colonic diverticulitis.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^8a572a50]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the longtime prevalence of diverticulitis as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, its etiology, prevention, and treatment remain hotly contested. Once viewed as a disorder of primarily older people in western populations, diverticulitis has rapidly increased its presence in all age groups worldwide, prompting researchers to reexamine the pathophysiology of the disease process. Clinicians continue to push the envelope with novel approaches to management, from avoiding antibiotics for uncomplicated cases to identifying subsets of patients with complicated diverticulitis who may not require an operation. Here, we review the most recent literature on a wide array of topics in diverticulitis, with an emphasis on publications within the last 5 years.

### Outcome variation in the use and duration of antibiotic therapy in patients presenting with acute diverticulitis [^8a148620]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Alternatively, it may be the case that longer durations of antibiotics are actually related to worse outcomes. Our observation that shorter courses of antibiotics in diverticulitis are associated with acceptable outcomes, when compared to longer courses, is of significant potential benefit. Longer antibiotic durations have been significantly associated with higher risk of Clostridioides difficile infections, increased microbiota disruption, and the development of antibiotic resistance. Each of these represent significant potential for disease burden on patients and dramatic increases in health-care expenditure. If reducing antibiotic duration may mitigate these deleterious outcomes, without increasing adverse diverticulitis-related outcomes, there is a valid need to pursue this management strategy. This also supports a general trend towards shorter duration of antibiotic therapy across disciplines. This, combined with a growing appreciation that diverticulitis may have a significant inflammatory component, versus an infectious one alone, again argues for antibiotic avoidance or shorter courses of antibiotics in appropriately selected individuals.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. Despite its large size, it is retrospective and non-randomized, and therefore subject to limitations inherent in studies of this nature. Further, in this cohort we are unable to assess why antibiotics were or were not prescribed, and whether this was the result of provider judgement or other factors. As such, antibiotic prescriptions, or longer durations of prescriptions, might represent a surrogate marker for more severe disease that we are unable to account for, which may influence our findings. As this database captured only reimbursed prescriptions, a proportion of patients who did not receive antibiotics may have been prescribed them, but for unknown reasons did not fill this prescription. Further, data may be subject to a diluting effect as we are unable to assess if individuals who filled a prescription actually completed any or all of their prescribed course.

While we report significant differences between groups for repeat ED-visits as well as subsequent antibiotic prescriptions, the absolute difference between groups is rather small: 1.9% and 5.8% respectively. Though these findings are statistically significant, the corresponding clinical impact may be small. Further prospective work may be needed to delineate the clinical meaning of findings with greater certainty.

Additionally, while we have attempted to control for baseline differences between groups with adjusted analysis, unaccounted for differences may partially explain observed results, including aforementioned differences in disease severity. Finally, we are limited to patients within the US who have commercial insurance, and unable to assess those patients who are uninsured or using government-sponsored insurance, limiting generalizability both within the US as well as to other countries that utilize single-payer systems.
