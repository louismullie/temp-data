## Question

How to manage chronic wound in elderly

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage chronic wounds in older adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and etiologic classification. Then, I should verify vascular status and how it directs therapy. Next, I will review wound bed preparation using TIME, followed by nutrition and systemic optimization. After that, I need to consider etiology-specific treatments, pain control, and when to escalate to advanced therapies. Finally, I should integrate geriatric-specific issues, monitoring and reassessment, and multidisciplinary and palliative considerations, while double-checking the strength of evidence for each recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities: I need to classify the wound type (pressure, venous, arterial, diabetic), document location, size, depth, tissue quality, exudate, odor, and infection signs, and screen for atypical features that might suggest malignancy or vasculitis, because misclassification leads to ineffective therapy and delays healing. I should also remember that chronic wounds in older adults are best viewed as a geriatric syndrome with multifactorial drivers, so I must not jump to conclusions before I complete a full systems review and medication reconciliation [^116RNJpm] [^114ET9YB] [^112DP96H].

> Wait, let me verify the vascular assessment steps before committing to compression or offloading: I should palpate pulses, measure ABI, and if abnormal or if I suspect arterial disease, obtain arterial Doppler or toe pressures, because arterial insufficiency changes everything. If ABI is less than 0.5 or there is critical limb ischemia, compression could be harmful and revascularization may be indicated, whereas a normal ABI supports proceeding with compression for venous disease. I need to ensure I do not conflate mixed etiologies, as many older adults have both venous and arterial disease [^114ET9YB] [^116RNJpm].

> Hold on, I should verify the TIME-based wound bed preparation steps and their hierarchy: Tissue management with debridement to remove nonviable tissue and biofilm, Infection/bioburden control with antiseptics and targeted antibiotics only when clinically indicated, Moisture balance tailored to exudate level, and Edge assessment to ensure the periwound is healthy and the wound margins are advancing. I need to check that I am not over-debriding ischemic tissue, and I should consider maintenance debridement between visits when appropriate [^112D4ig1] [^114ET9YB] [^114KP65U].

> I will now examine nutrition and systemic optimization, because I should assume many older adults with chronic wounds are malnourished until proven otherwise. I need to check albumin, prealbumin, and a complete nutritional assessment, then address protein intake (often 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day), calories, and micronutrients such as zinc and vitamin C, while also optimizing comorbidities like diabetes, heart failure, and renal disease, and I should confirm that protein supplementation has evidence for improving healing in some older adults, even if high-quality trials are limited [^116RNJpm] [^115N2RLn] [^111otYyN].

> Next, I should review etiology-specific management, but let me first confirm the vascular status again to avoid iatrogenic harm: for venous leg ulcers, sustained graduated compression is the cornerstone and I should reinforce patient education and adherence. For diabetic foot ulcers, offloading with total contact casting or equivalent is essential and I must also screen and treat peripheral arterial disease. For pressure injuries, offloading and pressure redistribution are primary, with support surfaces and repositioning every 1–2 hours. For arterial ulcers, I should not delay vascular consultation and potential revascularization when indicated. I need to ensure I tailor each intervention to the patient's tolerance and comorbidities [^113egUxK] [^115b5KAw] [^114ET9YB] [^112mBriZ].

> But wait, what if pain is driving nonadherence or masking infection? I should double-check my pain plan: chronic wound pain is common in older adults and can limit offloading and dressing changes, so I need scheduled analgesia, consider topical agents for procedural pain, and reassess for occult infection or ischemia if pain persists. I should confirm that pain control is integrated into the care plan and not treated as an afterthought [^115VHkhk].

> I need to ensure I escalate appropriately if there is inadequate progress. Let me reconsider the 4-week checkpoint: if there is less than about 50% reduction in wound area by 4 weeks despite adherence to standard care, I should reassess the diagnosis, vascular status, infection/biofilm, nutrition, and adherence, and then consider advanced therapies such as biologics, negative pressure wound therapy, or hyperbaric oxygen in selected cases. I should verify that advanced modalities are adjuncts to, not replacements for, the basics, and I must align choices with etiology and patient goals [^113uZAcT] [^116UWDw4].

> Hold on, I should verify geriatric-specific issues that can derail healing: frailty, multimorbidity, cognitive impairment, and social determinants like isolation or limited access to care all impact outcomes. I should screen for frailty and functional status, simplify regimens, and coordinate home services or caregiver training. I also need to check for elder abuse or neglect when wounds are unexplained or recurrent, and maintain a low threshold for safeguarding interventions [^113PnLBT] [^115Fxbrz].

> Next, I should review monitoring and reassessment cadence. I will now examine whether weekly early visits are feasible to track area reduction, edge quality, exudate, and infection control, and to recalibrate therapy. I need to ensure objective measurements are captured consistently, and I should double-check that early trajectory informs prognosis and guides escalation decisions at the 4-week mark [^114ET9YB] [^113uZAcT].

> Let me think about the care setting and team. Multidisciplinary wound care centers can reduce healing time and improve experience, so I should coordinate with vascular surgery, podiatry, physical therapy, nutrition, and home health. I should confirm that team-based care is especially critical for diabetic foot disease and complex ulcers, and that telemedicine can support home-based follow-up when access is limited, though I must verify that local resources and patient preferences are aligned [^115H4vwP] [^115sLdSF] [^116xttAp].

> I should confirm goals-of-care alignment. For some older adults with limited life expectancy or severe frailty, palliative wound management focused on comfort, odor control, and pain relief may be more appropriate than aggressive healing targets, so I need to have early conversations and document preferences to avoid overtreatment [^116RNJpm].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated the evidence for hyperbaric oxygen. I should double-check guideline positions: while HBOT may be considered for selected diabetic foot ulcers after standard care, it is not recommended for limb salvage in CLTI with severe uncorrected ischemia, so I must not generalize its use without addressing perfusion first [^114Yzwym].

> Finally, I need to ensure infection control is precise and stewardship-minded. I should avoid reflexive systemic antibiotics in the absence of clinical infection and instead prioritize debridement, topical antiseptics, and moisture control, reserving systemic therapy for spreading cellulitis, systemic signs, or osteomyelitis. I should confirm that biofilm management is an ongoing process rather than a one-time intervention [^116Jyc1S] [^116BE2ee].

Management of chronic wounds in the elderly centers on **early identification of etiology** [^114ET9YB] and **multidisciplinary care** [^115H4vwP] to address modifiable risk factors and comorbidities [^115iHexM]. Apply the **TIME principles** (tissue, infection/inflammation, moisture, edge) [^112D4ig1] with regular debridement, infection control, and moisture-balanced dressings [^114ET9YB]; use compression for venous ulcers [^114ET9YB], offloading for pressure/diabetic ulcers [^114ET9YB], and revascularization for arterial insufficiency [^112D4ig1]. Optimize nutrition (especially protein) [^116RNJpm], manage pain [^115VHkhk], and reassess at 2–4 weeks to escalate care if healing is < 50% [^113uZAcT]. Palliative care is appropriate when healing is unlikely, focusing on comfort and infection control [^116RNJpm].

---

## Assessment and diagnosis

- **Etiology**: Identify venous, arterial, diabetic, or pressure etiologies [^114ET9YB] through clinical evaluation and vascular assessment (ABI, Doppler) [^116RNJpm].

- **Wound characteristics**: Document size, depth, exudate, tissue type, and infection signs [^114ET9YB].

- **Comorbidities**: Evaluate diabetes, vascular disease, malnutrition, and frailty [^113PnLBT], as these impair healing [^1174GGPc].

---

## General principles of management

- **TIME principles**: Tissue debridement, infection/inflammation control, moisture balance, and edge management [^112D4ig1] [^114ET9YB].

- **Debridement**: Regular removal of necrotic tissue [^112D4ig1] to reduce bioburden and promote healing [^114ET9YB].

- **Infection control**: Use topical antiseptics [^116Jyc1S]; reserve systemic antibiotics for systemic infection or osteomyelitis [^116BE2ee].

- **Moisture balance**: Select dressings based on exudate level to maintain optimal moisture [^116KSKss] [^114ET9YB].

---

## Specific interventions by wound type

| **Wound type** | **Key interventions** |
|-|-|
| Venous ulcers | - Compression therapy (stockings/bandages) [^114ET9YB] <br/> - Leg elevation <br/> - Exercise <br/> - Address venous insufficiency [^113egUxK] |
| Arterial ulcers | - Vascular assessment (ABI, Doppler) [^114ET9YB] <br/> - Revascularization if indicated [^114ET9YB] <br/> - Avoid compression if severe ischemia [^notfound] |
| Diabetic foot ulcers | - Offloading (total contact casting, boots) [^115b5KAw] <br/> - Glycemic control <br/> - Infection management <br/> - Vascular assessment [^115sLdSF] |
| Pressure ulcers | - Pressure redistribution (specialized mattresses, repositioning) [^112mBriZ] <br/> - Nutritional support <br/> - Infection control [^115gdkcY] |

---

## Nutritional support

Protein intake of **1.2–1.5 g/kg/day** supports tissue repair [^111otYyN]; consider supplements if dietary intake is inadequate [^112mBriZ]. Ensure adequate intake of vitamin C, zinc, and vitamin D to support collagen synthesis and immune function [^notfound].

---

## Pain management

Assess pain regularly, especially during dressing changes and debridement [^115gdkcY]. Use **topical and systemic analgesics**, and consider nonpharmacologic measures such as relaxation and distraction [^115gdkcY].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess every 2–4 weeks; if healing is **< 50% at 4 weeks**, reconsider diagnosis and escalate care [^113uZAcT]. Track wound size, exudate, and tissue quality to guide ongoing management [^114ET9YB].

---

## Advanced therapies

Consider **negative pressure wound therapy** for large, complex wounds or when standard care fails [^113hmTWF]. Use bioengineered tissue or growth factors for recalcitrant ulcers after standard care [^116pjS8G]. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be considered for selected diabetic or ischemic wounds [^notfound].

---

## Palliative care

Palliative care is appropriate for patients with limited prognosis or severe frailty; prioritize **comfort, pain control, and infection management** [^notfound].

---

## Patient and caregiver education

Teach caregivers to recognize infection, manage dressings, and offload pressure [^114ET9YB]. Provide resources and connect patients with support groups to improve adherence and outcomes [^116xttAp].

---

Effective management of chronic wounds in the elderly requires a **multidisciplinary approach** [^115iHexM] that addresses etiology, comorbidities, nutrition, and pain, with regular reassessment and escalation as needed [^113uZAcT].

Introduction

An estimated 12the population in developed countries will experience a chronic wound in their lifetimeand the incidence of wounds continues to rise as the population ages and comorbidities mount. As a result, management of chronic wounds accounts for > 5% of total health care expenditures in the United States and United Kingdom.

Chronic wounds fail to progress through a timely sequence of repair. It is known that increased microbial load is a key predictor of nonhealing wounds. Proliferation of bacteria resulting in moderate-to-heavy loads (> 10⁴ colony-forming units [CFU]/g) delays healingand increases the risk of wound complications, including infection, sepsis, and amputation. Guidelines advise that early diagnosis of high bacterial burden is essential to prevent the wound from progression to local or systemic infection. To reduce bacterial burden, clinicians choose from an armamentarium of antiseptic wound cleansers, debridement techniques, and antimicrobial options. This is done without objective information on bacteria at point-of-care and without information on treatment efficacy.

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^1118R4cL]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance: Chronic wounds are associated with significant morbidity, marked loss of quality of life, and considerable economic burden. Evidence-based risk prediction to guide improved wound prevention and treatment is limited by the complexity in their etiology, clinical underreporting, and a lack of studies using large high-quality datasets. Recent Advancements: The objective of this review is to summarize key components and challenges in the development of personalized risk prediction tools for both prevention and management of chronic wounds, while highlighting several innovations in the development of better risk stratification. Critical Issues: Regression-based risk prediction approaches remain important for assessment of prognosis and risk stratification in chronic wound management. Advances in statistical computing have boosted the development of several promising machine learning (ML) and other semiautomated classification tools. These methods may be better placed to handle large number of wound healing risk factors from large datasets, potentially resulting in better risk prediction when combined with conventional methods and clinical experience and expertise. Future Directions: Where the number of predictors is large and heterogenous, the correlations between various risk factors complex, and very large data sets are available, ML may prove a powerful adjuvant for risk stratifying patients predisposed to chronic wounds. Conventional regression-based approaches remain important, particularly where the number of predictors is relatively small. Translating estimated risk derived from ML algorithms into practical prediction tools for use in clinical practice remains challenging.

Take-Home Messages
- Chronic wounds require a systematic approach, including both patient and wound assessment, no matter what the underlying etiology of the wound.
- The care of chronic wounds relies upon basic tenets that aim to remove or ameliorate the etiological causes and to address systemic and metabolic perturbations.
- Basic tenets include vascular examination, followed by appropriate interventions, management of wound-related infection, wound debridement, and offloading.
- Wound bed preparation plays a key role in providing the proper environment in which tissue repair can take place.
- In addition to offloading with the purpose of eliminating excessive pressure, the term surgical offloading has been introduced, meaning the surgical management of foot deformities underlying chronic ulcerations.
- Most wound care protocols advocate the use of advanced therapies after 4 weeks for nonhealed wounds.
- There are a number of advanced therapies for chronic wounds. However, most do not have a high level of evidence or even nonrandomized prospective studies assessing their efficacy. Selection of advanced therapies should be based on the evidence available.

Specific wound care or wound bed preparation commences concurrently with the aforementioned interventions when feasible. Revascularization, however, often follows control of infection and initiation of wound care procedures. The acronym TIME has been used over the last decade or so to facilitate an organized approach to wound bed preparation and has been summarized nicely by Leaper et al. This acronym refers to Tissue assessment and management, Infection/Inflammation management, Moisture imbalance management, and Edge of wound observation and management (Table 2). The TIME principles are an integral, although incomplete, part of this discussion and incorporate the basic tenets of wound care that are critical for managing chronic wounds.

Table 2.
TIME principles of wound bed preparation

Debridement has long been recognized as a critical component for wound care and has been shown by several investigators to expedite healing. Sharp debridement removes nonviable tissue and slough along with bacterial biofilms that prolong the inflammatory response in the chronic wound. In effect, thorough debridement converts the chronic wound from one that is excessively inflamed, as previously described, to more of an acute profile that can jump-start the wound toward a healing trajectory. While sharp debridement is considered to be the most efficient way to debride a wound (with scalpel, curette, tissue nippers, etc.), hydrosurgical or ultrasonic debridement can also be used in this regard. The term ulcerectomy has been used to denote complete excision of ulcers down to healthy bleeding tissue, resulting in expedited healing of DFUs. Maintenance debridement with enzymes (collagenase) is frequently used between clinic visits to gently remove slough or to enzymatically debride thick crusts (especially in neuroischemic wounds). Biodebridement with maggots has been used for many years in patients not suitable for surgical debridement and has shown some promise in removing slough and necrotic tissue while promoting granulation tissue development. Simple hydrogels or hydrocolloid dressings can provide for slow autolytic debridement of slough and dried crusts, especially in ischemic patients or those who cannot undergo surgical debridement. Regardless of the method used, effective debridement of chronic wounds is accepted as an essential component of care throughout the wound healing continuum. Nonetheless, healing can be delayed if debridement is performed too frequently and/or extensively. Development of diagnostic tools, including biomarker analysis and noninvasive imaging, is necessary to better distinguish viable from nonviable tissues in the wound and guide debridement practices.

Advanced therapies

All currently published guidelines and consensus reviews on the management of chronic DFUs, VLUs, and PUs support the belief that all such wounds should initially be treated with standard wound care principles as have been discussed. In most cases, these basic tenets of wound care should be carried out before consideration of the use of more advanced therapies. Most wound care protocols now advocate the use of such standard measures for an initial period of 4 weeks, after which an assessment of wound area reduction should be made. While the 1999 American Diabetes Association publication was one of the first consensus documents on DFU assessment and treatment, it only mentioned that wounds failing to heal by 4 weeks were associated with worse outcomes, including amputation. In 2003, however, Sheehan et al. published the often quoted article supporting the ability of the 4-week healing rate to predict complete healing by 12 weeks. Using data from another large, multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT), it was determined that the midpoint (median) percent wound area reduction from baseline at 4 weeks between those that healed and those that remained unhealed at 12 weeks was 53%. Those who exceeded this midpoint healed in 58% of cases by 12 weeks. In contrast, those that did not achieve 53% wound area reduction by 4 weeks only healed in 9% of cases (p < 0.001). Even more striking, the mean 4-week percent change in ulcer area was 82% in healers versus 25% in the nonhealing group regardless of the treatment arm. Subsequently, the 4-week 50% wound area reduction has been widely adopted and confirmed as a robust indicator for predicting healing at 3 months. Consistent with this premise, wounds failing to achieve a 50% area reduction at this time point need to be reassessed and subsequently considered for advanced therapies in the absence of underlying disease or nonadherence to prescribed basic treatment. Figure 3 illustrates a fairly common algorithm for DFU treatment incorporating these principles. Figure 4 similarly illustrates an algorithm for VLU treatment.

### Emergency management of chronic wounds [^115rZrCW]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

As America's emergency departments witness an increase in care provided to an aging population, the emergency physician increasingly evaluates and treats manifestations of chronic disease. Nonhealing wounds are often a presenting manifestation of chronic disease. They are a source of pain and disability for this population. Emergency physicians should possess a fundamental knowledge in the management of chronic wounds. This article familiarizes the emergency physician with the epidemiology of chronic wounds, the physiology of tissue repair, the pathophysiology involved in wound healing failure, the common types of chronic wounds, and specific management strategies.

### Reliance on clinical signs and symptoms assessment leads to misuse of antimicrobials: analysis of 350 chronic wounds [^116BE2ee]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the availability of advanced therapies, less than half of chronic wounds achieve closure within 12 weeks. Patients with chronic wounds experience a decreased quality of life, loss of function and in some cases, significant morbidity. The accumulation of bacteria at concentrations > 10⁴ colony-forming units per gram of tissue (CFU/g) has been associated with an increased risk of delayed wound healing. In a 228-patient randomized controlled trial, presence of bacterial loads > 10⁴ CFU/g had a significant negative effect on healing. Similarly, others have shown delayed healing when bacterial loads > 10⁵ CFU/g are present. Therefore, reducing this clinically significant level of bacterial burden is a rational approach to improve healing.

Wound clinicians must work efficiently to identify and appropriately reduce bioburden in wounds to facilitate healing and treat or prevent infection. Treatment methods employed to reduce bioburden and facilitate wound healing vary depending on the type and size of wound, patient history, and other comorbidities, but typically include debridement, pressure off-loading, application of appropriate dressings, and increasingly the use of antimicrobials.

Antimicrobials, which include antiseptics as well as antimicrobial dressings (e.g. silver impregnated dressings), topical, oral and intravenous antibiotics, are a routine part of management of bacterial burden; however, across specialties up to 50% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary or inappropriate.

Chronic wound patients receive significantly more antibiotic prescriptions than age- and gender-matched patients without wounds. Physicians concerned with failing to detect infection in a timely manner may prescribe antimicrobial agents in the absence of evidence supporting critical levels of bacteria. Analysis of antibiotic prescribing behaviors in the United Kingdom between 2013 and 2015 revealed that wounds accounted for 16.5% of all systemic antibiotic prescriptions.

Clinicians are often pressured by patients to prescribe antibiotics as they are viewed as the safe option. However, unlike most drug therapies, antibiotics become less effective with use; chronic wounds including diabetic foot, venous, arterial and pressure ulcers, often harbor multiple drug-resistant bacteria, and form biofilms blocking access to antibiotic and topical antimicrobial access.

### The impact of underlying conditions on quality-of-life measurement among patients with chronic wounds, as measured by utility values: a review with an additional study [^113SzKaF]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

Despite the popularity of PROMs, it will be difficult to find a useful role for them in day-to-day wound management. In a large proportion of cases, it is likely that QoL may be dominated by one or two major underlying medical conditions, which impact the patient even more than their chronic wound(s).

### Optimal perioperative management of the geriatric patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons NSQIP and the American Geriatrics Society [^112mBriZ]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2016). Medium credibility.

Pressure ulcer prevention and treatment — Health care teams should implement multicomponent interventions to prevent and treat pressure ulcers in the postoperative patient at risk for developing pressure ulcers, with measures to Reduce/minimize pressure, friction, humidity, shear force including Turning patient every one to two hours, Avoid sliding patients, Use of lower pressure air mattress or air-fluidized chronic pressure- shifting bed, Higher specification foam mattresses, and Consultation with physiatry and/or physical therapy. Restoration of nutrition includes Evaluate nitrogen exchange and food choices to estimate requirements and adequacy of current intake, Vitamin, essential mineral, or meal supplements (for example, protein shakes), Consider pharmacologic enhancement of appetite (for example, megestrol)*, Tube feeding or parenteral nutrition, if indicated, and Evaluate and treat other chronic illnesses, including anemia, diabetes, heart failure, HIV, kidney/ liver disease; regarding appetite stimulants, the evidence of benefit is limited, and there are important adverse effects to these drugs, including venous thromboembolism and CNS side effects. Wound care involves Recognize and debride nonviable and/or devascularized tissue, Allow healing by secondary intention with dressing changes, negative pressure therapy, and Indwelling/sheath catheter or colostomy in incontinent patients, to increase likelihood of healing.

### Approach to chronic wound infections [^116Jyc1S]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Infection is the likeliest single cause of delayed healing in healing of chronic open wounds by secondary intention. If neglected it can progress from contamination to colonization and local infection through to systemic infection, sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and it can be life-threatening. Infection in chronic wounds is not as easy to define as in acute wounds, and is complicated by the presence of biofilms. There is, as yet, no diagnostic for biofilm presence, but it contributes to excessive inflammation - through excessive and prolonged stimulation of nitric oxide, inflammatory cytokines and free radicals - and activation of immune complexes and complement, leading to a delay in healing. Control of biofilm is a key part of chronic wound management. Maintenance debridement and use of topical antimicrobials (antiseptics) are more effective than antibiotics, which should be reserved for treating spreading local and systemic infection. The continuing rise of antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics should lead us to reserve their use for these indications, as no new effective antibiotics are in the research pipeline. Antiseptics are effective through many mechanisms of action, unlike antibiotics, which makes the development of resistance to them unlikely. There is little evidence to support the theoretical risk that antiseptics select resistant pathogens. However, the use of antiseptic dressings for preventing and managing biofilm and infection progression needs further research involving well-designed, randomized controlled trials.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^1169E5WV]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Treatment of diabetic ulcers: guiding principles — "The primary treatment goal for diabetic foot ulcers is to obtain wound closure as expeditiously as possible". Resolving ulcers and decreasing recurrence "can lower the probability of lower extremity amputation in the diabetic patient". The Wound Healing Society "defines a chronic wound as one that has failed to proceed through an orderly and timely repair process to produce anatomic and functional integrity", and a chronic wound is further defined as one where "the healing cascade has been disrupted at some point, leading to prolonged inflammation and failure to re-epithelialize and allowing for further breakdown and infection". Early advanced or appropriate practices "may be more cost-effective than standard care practices for decreasing the incidence of lower extremity amputations". Essential therapeutic areas are listed as "management of comorbidities; evaluation of vascular status and appropriate treatment; assessment of lifestyle/psychosocial factors; ulcer assessment and evaluation; tissue management/wound bed preparation; and pressure relief".

### Wound healing – a practical algorithm [^115ZPoUQ]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

The decision-making process involved in the management of diabetic foot wounds is complex but hinges on certain simple principles. The first is to agree the actual aim of management with the patient or their representative - and healing of an open wound may be only a part of this. The agreed plan should be discussed and reviewed if the wound is unresponsive to intervention. Management depends otherwise on regular debridement and cleansing, treatment of any infection, consideration of revascularisation and protection of the wound by dressings and off-loading. The evidence to justify the use of advanced wound care therapies is not strong, and outcome depends more on the organisation of the wound care process than on the choice of a particular wound care product. The introduction of an expert multidisciplinary team has been shown to lead to a very significant reduction in the incidence of major amputation and it is likely that it is the availability or otherwise of prompt expert advice which is the principal explanation of the major variations that are known to exist in the incidence of amputation even within single countries.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^115Fxbrz]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Elder abuse acute traumatic, medical, and psychological care — Focus first on treating and stabilizing acute traumatic, medical, and psychological issues in cases of suspected abuse and have a low threshold for admission to the hospital. Even with a seemingly minor mechanism of injury, significant fractures, brain injury, spine injury and bleeding can occur in the older adult, and small derangements in physiology can cause profound shock, tissue injury, and organ failure. Rapidly triage, diagnose, and stabilize the injured older adult. As in other abuse, attention must also focus on management of old or chronic traumatic injuries and chronic medical conditions, and management of old wounds, ulcers, burns, or other manifestations of neglect is important. Treatment of acute exacerbations of underlying medical conditions is needed because the older adult has not received appropriate care or all prescribed medications, and pay particular attention to medication levels, such as anticoagulants and cardiovascular medications. Even when traumatic injuries are minor, maintain a low threshold for admission to the hospital due to the social and medical issues.

### Clinical approach to chronic wound management in older adults [^116RNJpm]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Older adults are at high risk of developing chronic wounds due to numerous changes that occur with aging. It is reasonable to consider chronic wounds as a geriatric syndrome-highly prevalent, multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Due to the morbidity and cost associated with chronic wounds, prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment are important. The most common chronic wounds presenting in older adults are pressure and vascular wounds, including those associated with diabetes. Atypical wounds are also common and should raise the suspicion for skin malignancy. Diagnosis is primarily clinical and assessment should include documentation of wound characteristics, such as location, size and depth, presence of slough, drainage, odor, and infection. The mainstay of treatment is based on the TIME principle: Tissue debridement, Infection control, Moisture balance, and optimal wound Edges. The use of protein supplements has been shown to improve wound healing in subsets of older adults. In addition to wound care and optimizing nutrition, disease-specific wound therapy forms an integral part of wound management. Pressure reduction for pressure injury, compression therapy for venous wounds, evaluation of arterial circulation with ABI or arterial Doppler and iCC for diabetic ulcers form the mainstays of therapy. Atypical wounds may present as chronic ulcers and should be biopsied. The goals of treatment should be realistic and for some older adults, palliative wound management may be more appropriate.

### Best practice offloading treatments for diabetic foot ulcer healing, remission, and better plans for the healing-remission transition [^115b5KAw]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Diabetes-related foot disease is arguably the world's least known major health problem and causes a disease burden larger than most well-known diseases, such as stroke and breast cancer. This burden is driven by people developing more severe stages of foot disease, such as foot ulcers and infections, and with that worsening quality of life. To reduce this burden, we need treatments that prevent more severe stages of foot disease and improve quality of life. Best practice offloading treatments have been found to be arguably the most effective existing treatments to heal and prevent diabetes-related foot ulcers and infections, but can worsen quality of life. Furthermore, high re-ulceration rates still occur with best practice offloading treatments after healing. This may be because of the gap in guideline recommendations on the transition from ulcer healing to ulcer remission when it comes to offloading treatments. In this paper, we review why we need offloading treatments and what are the best offloading treatments recommended by the latest international guidelines for healing and remission. Further, we propose plans for future best practice offloading treatments for the transition from healing-to-remission to help reduce re-ulceration rates and improve longer-term ulcer remission. These plans could be the catalyst for better transitioning patients from first ulcer presentation through healing and into long-term remission, and in turn delivering better quality of life, and lower diabetes-related foot disease burdens on patients, nations, and the globe in future.

### Best practices for postoperative management of posterior sacroiliac joint fusion [^113wjoo4]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Monitoring the incision for infection is critical. Patients should be instructed to watch for signs of infection including increased pain, localized swelling, excessive drainage, warmth or redness at the incision site or surrounding skin, as well as fevers or chills. If any of these symptoms occur, patients should contact their provider promptly.

Surgical incision site infections are most likely to arise two to four weeks out of surgery. Any condition reducing immune response in the preoperative period can increase risk of a surgical site infection, which can include uncontrolled diabetes, chemotherapy, autoimmune diseases, chronic steroid use and smoking. Attaining an early definitive diagnosis and initiating appropriate management is crucial in mitigating risks and reducing morbidity.

Summary of Best Practices for Wound Care

Class 1 wound should remain dry for at least 48 hours.
Bathing or submerging the wound should be avoided for at least 3 weeks.
Patient may wait 7–10 days prior to showering, though current evidence does not suggest that early showering causes increased surgical site infections.

Medication Usage

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory (NSAID)

In addition to surgical wound care, the immediate post-operative phase must promote fusion of the posterior SIJ for the procedure to be successful. In novel posterior intra-articular SIJ fusion systems, an allograft is used with demineralized bone matrix (DBM) which creates an osteoinductive environment. Spinal fusion models have confirmed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have an inhibitory effect on healing of a fusion. Although data are limited, it appears this effect is most significant when NSAIDS are administered in the early postoperative period. Goodman et alconducted a study with non-spinal models suggesting early administration of NSAIDS resulted in greater inhibition of bone formation. One study showed that patients who continued to take NSAIDs for more than 3 months postoperatively showed significantly lower fusion success rates.

The length of the inflammatory phase in humans is not clearly defined. Additionally, the data on NSAIDS inhibitory effect on bone healing are not consistent. Certain animal studies have noted inhibitory effects of NSAIDS during the first 8 weeks, but recommendations for avoidance of NSAIDs in practice may be as long as six months following spinal fusion. The authors recommend a shared physician-patient decision taking into account the risk and benefits of resuming or starting postoperative NSAIDS, although NSAIDS are best avoided when possible.

### Nutrition and chronic wounds: improving clinical outcomes [^115N2RLn]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

There is increasing awareness that chronic wound healing is very dependent on the patient's nutritional status, but there are no clearly established and accepted assessment protocols or interventions in clinical practice. Much of the data used as guidelines for chronic wound patients are extrapolated from acutely wounded trauma patients, but the 2 groups are very different patient populations. While most trauma patients are young, healthy, and well-nourished before injury, the chronic wound patient is usually old, with comorbidities and frequently malnourished. We suggest the assumption that all geriatric wound patients are malnourished until proved otherwise. Evaluation should include complete history and physical and a formal nutritional evaluation should be obtained. Laboratory studies can be used in conjunction with this clinical information to confirm the assessment. While extensive studies are available in relation to prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers and perioperative nutrition, less is known of the effect of nutritional deficits and supplementation of the diabetic foot ulcer and venous stasis ulcer patient. This does not necessarily mean that nutritional support of these patients is not helpful. In the pursuit of wound healing, we provide systemic support of cardiac and pulmonary function and cessation of smoking, improve vascular inflow, improve venous outflow, decrease edema, and treat with hyperbaric oxygen. If we address all of these other conditions, why would we not wish to support the most basic of organismal needs in the form of nutrition?

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^113mKjzz]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

SCOPE

Chronic wounds are associated with a diverse range of etiologies and complex interactions of risk factors. There is an urgent need for reliable, validated risk prediction tools that can better target an individual patient's unique set of predisposing factors that influence both their risk of disease progression and response to treatment once chronic wounds develop. The aim of this review is to summarize recent advancements in computing technologies to support risk prediction in other diseases and describe both the challenges in transferring these tools into clinical support for chronic wounds (Table 1).

### The impact of underlying conditions on quality-of-life measurement among patients with chronic wounds, as measured by utility values: a review with an additional study [^112VZ5em]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

As wound care experts, we place the wound at the center of our concerns, but such wounds are more often a consequence of other conditions and not a root cause later affected by other conditions. In addition, many patients have multiple wounds. Thus, among patients with serious comorbid conditions, it may be unrealistic to expect a "wound-specific" QoL to be capable of measuring meaningful changes in response to the outcome of a specific wound. The point is that the best QoL tool should not target very specific conditions (such as wounds), but use a more realistic, holistic approach. Alternatively, additional questions regarding wounds should be added to the tools used to calculate health utility values based on various comorbid conditions.

In wound care research, W-QoL scores are used as surrogate endpoints for healing. Randomized, controlled trials tend to exclude patients with major comorbidities, and so, the trial design is not accurately capturing the general health state of the real-world patient population in wound care. Thus, practical limitations of the wound-centric QoL instrument hold true in trial settings, and current W-QoL assessments are an inappropriate use of time and resource utilization.

This study additionally provides proof of concept that even elderly patients with serious diseases (Fig. 1) can successfully utilize an electronic tablet to complete a standardized questionnaire, and that the results can be electronically transmitted to a quality registry where they can be seamlessly integrated into the patient's EHR. Unfortunately, a year after the completion of this study, CMS rejected the USWR-developed quality measure focused on the assessment of QoL among patients with chronic wounds. CMS officials stated that merely evaluating QoL was insufficient as a physician "quality activity" and that for a QoL process to be a valuable part of clinical care, it would be necessary to demonstrate a specific, measurable improvement in QoL in response to wound care.

Given the overriding impact of underlying disease on QoL, it will be difficult to develop a QoL assessment for chronic wound patients, which meets the CMS requirement. Since the measurement of QoL is time consuming to perform, expensive to implement, and wholly uncompensated, it is not likely to become part of routine clinical care among patients with chronic wounds. These findings do serve to emphasize the extreme level of illness among typical outpatients with chronic, nonhealing wounds.

### Human wound and its burden: updated 2020 compendium of estimates [^1138RsA3]. Advances in Wound Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Significance: Chronic wounds impact the quality of life (QoL) of nearly 2.5% of the total population in the United States and the management of wounds has a significant economic impact on health care. Given the aging population, the continued threat of diabetes and obesity worldwide, and the persistent problem of infection, it is expected that chronic wounds will continue to be a substantial clinical, social, and economic challenge. In 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic dramatically disrupted health care worldwide, including wound care. A chronic nonhealing wound (CNHW) is typically correlated with comorbidities such as diabetes, vascular deficits, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. These risk factors make persons with CNHW at high risk for severe, sometimes lethal outcomes if infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (pathogen causing COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted several aspects of the wound care continuum, including compliance with wound care visits, prompting alternative approaches (use of telemedicine and creation of videos to help with wound dressing changes among others), and encouraging a do-it-yourself wound dressing protocol and use of homemade remedies/substitutions. Recent Advances: There is a developing interest in understanding how the social determinants of health impact the QoL and outcomes of wound care patients. Furthermore, addressing wound care in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of telemedicine options in the continuum of care. Future Directions: The economic, clinical, and social impact of wounds continues to rise and requires appropriate investment and a structured approach to wound care, education, and related research.

Nevertheless, such novel ML methods should be taken with caution and should not be universally applied to any research question, despite demonstrated superiority in specific areas. A 2020 review of 453 articles published between 2015 and 2019 on ML predictive models for the diagnosis of chronic diseases noted the large variety of ML methods employed and the lack of standard methods for determining the optimal approach. This may, in part, reflect the recency and novelty of many of these ML approaches.

Venous leg ulcers account for approximately 70% of all leg ulcers and affect 2.2 million Americans annually. After a comprehensive patient and wound assessment, compression therapy remains the cornerstone of standard care. Adjuvant care with topical or systemic agents is used for wounds that do not heal within 4 weeks. Once healed, long-term compression therapy with stockings or surgical intervention will reduce the incidence of recurrence. This continuing medical education article aims to outline optimal management for patients with venous leg ulcers, highlighting the role of a multidisciplinary team in delivering high quality care.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — electrical stimulation for pressure ulcers: ACP recommends that clinicians use electrical stimulation as adjunctive therapy in patients with pressure ulcers to accelerate wound healing. (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) Moderate-quality evidence supports the use of electrical stimulation in addition to standard treatment because it has been shown to accelerate the healing rate of stage 2 to 4 ulcers, though data are insufficient to comment on complete wound healing and the relationship between reduction in wound size or rate of healing and eventual complete healing has not been well-defined. The most common adverse effect for this treatment was skin irritation, and frail elderly patients were more susceptible to adverse events associated with electrical stimulation.

Materials and Methods

Dataset

The data for our analyses came from the EMRs of a large network of wound care centers in 46 states and cover the timeframe from January 1, 2014 to September 25, 2018. A detailed description of the staffing and skill mix of these centers has been published elsewhere. In short, these centers are run by a wound care management company and staffed by combination of employed and contracted physicians, supported by specialized nurses and program managers. All clinicians are required to attend a 1-week specialty wound care training course and are provided evidence based algorithmic clinical practice guidelines. The clinicians subsequently receive ongoing education, monthly conference calls, and have access to regional and local medical directors for case management support. The centers are hospital-based and most have access to specialty consultants and advanced treatment modalities, like hyperbaric oxygen. Standardized treatment protocols promote adherence to evidence-based care.

The data contain detailed patient level information such as age, sex, smoking status, body mass index, comorbid conditions, and wound level measurements such as length, width, and depth in addition to categorical descriptors such as wound etiology, location, and appearance. Each wound is assessed at intake and every subsequent visit, and treatment modalities are documented. At the end of each visit, the outcome for each wound is documented as healed or not healed.

Our starting sample consisted of EMRs for 356,649 patients with 914,878 unique wounds. We excluded 202,842 (22%) wounds that were caused by radiation, acute wounding events such as surgery and trauma, and 71,414 (8%) wounds in patients, who were only seen in the clinic for initial consultation. We removed 20,266 (2%) wounds with implausible dimensions, such as surface areas > 100 cm² for arterial ulcer and 150 cm² for other wound types and wounds from patients with missing age and sex.

The final dataset included 620,356 unique wounds from 261,398 patients from 532 wound care clinics. We only used information that was collected during the initial intake for the prediction model and tracked wound outcomes regardless of therapeutic interventions. We selected a training dataset containing a randomly drawn subset of 70% (n = 434,249) of the wounds to develop the model, leaving a validation set with the remaining 30% (n = 186,107) of the wounds for validation of model parameters (Supplementary Fig. S1).

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^1132XqQJ]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The PROGRESS consortium defined stratified medicine as the targeting of treatments (pharmacological or nonpharmacological) according to the biological or clinical characteristics shared by subgroups of patients. They highlight the distinction between purely prognostic factors (that affect outcome irrespective of treatment) and those predictive of treatment response. However, recently introduced "patient-centric medicine" has a much broader scope defined as "individual's specific health needs and desired health outcomes" as "the driving force behind all health care decisions and quality measurements" in which "patients are partners with their health care providers, and providers treat patients not only from a clinical perspective, but also from an emotional, mental, spiritual, social, and financial perspective".

The risk prediction models typically include clinical, genetic, and care-related factors and environmental, demographic, and other factors of importance for patient-related outcomes. Although judging based on the spectrum of factor, category, and outcome measures used in the risk prediction models, they can be described in certain situations as developments under the scope of patient-centric medicine. However, still, the majority of risk prediction models has a humbler approach and can be instead described under the scope of stratified/precision medicine. Even today, we lack a consistent analytical approach that can account for multiple patient attributes combined to inform treatment decisions adequately at the individual level.

Access to high-quality and representative data is just the first of several key phases in the development of clinically meaningful risk prediction models. Ideally, models balance statistical performance with clinical usefulness, achieving a satisfactory level of discrimination, calibration, and face validity. Current best practice guidelines highlight the importance of appropriate variable selection strategies, assessment of model performance, and external validation as three of the key steps in the development of good risk prediction. Variable selection, the identification of which combination of strong risk or prognostic factors best predicts the clinical outcome of interest, is a key determinant of both model performance and its ultimate utility in clinical or value-based payment settings. Although conventional selection methods generalized from linear regression analyses such as forward selection and backward elimination remain popular, such approaches have many disadvantages, such as instability of the selection and suboptimal model performance.

The Japanese Dermatological Association prepared the clinical guidelines for the "Wound, pressure ulcer and burn guidelines", second edition, focusing on treatments. Among them, "Guidelines for wounds in general" is intended to provide the knowledge necessary to heal wounds, without focusing on particular disorders. It informs the basic principles of wound treatment, before explanations are provided in individual chapters of the guidelines. We updated all sections by collecting references published since the publication of the first edition. In particular, we included new wound dressings and topical medications. Additionally, we added "Question 6: How should wound-related pain be considered, and what should be done to control it?" as a new section addressing wound pain, which was not included in the first edition.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^115DFE9J]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot — predictors and recurrence: Infection is a significant risk factor in the causal pathway to amputation, and chronic hyperglycemia is another frequently described risk factor for amputation. Amputation has also been associated with diabetes-related comorbidities such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease. The best predictor of amputation is a history of previous amputation, and a past history of a lower extremity ulceration or amputation increases the risk for further ulceration, infection, and subsequent amputation. Up to 34% of patients develop another ulcer within 1 year after healing an index wound, and the 5-year rate of developing a new ulcer is 70%. Aggressive glucose control, management of associated comorbidities, and appropriate lower extremity care coordinated in a team environment may indeed lower overall risk for amputation.

INTRODUCTION

Complex wounds that fail to progress through expected healing phases in a timely manner are classified in the group of hard-to-heal wounds or chronic wounds. Chronic wounds are associated with significant morbidity, marked loss of quality of life and utility, and considerable economic and societal burden, both within the United States and globally. Recent US estimates across all wound types put Medicare spending alone at USD 28–97 billion annually. Data from other countries further support the considerable costs of chronic wounds. Canadian expenditure on diabetic foot ulcers alone is estimated at $509 million annually, while chronic wound expenditure in the United Kingdom is estimated to be € 4.5–5.3 billion.

A 2017 systematic review of 36 international cost-of-illness studies covering payer, hospital, patient, and societal perspectives estimated mean 1-year costs to the public payer ranging from $11,000 (USD) per chronic venous leg ulcer up to $44,200 for every diabetic foot ulcer. Current projections suggest that these costs will continue to increase into the future.

Despite chronic wounds representing a major public health challenge, current cost estimates likely underestimate the true burden of disease due to underreporting, and a lack of quality prevalence studies, particularly at the global level. Critically, the timely identification, intervention, and personalized management of complex chronic wounds are further limited by a lack of reliable, validated risk prediction and prognostic tools. This is, in part, secondary to the complexity and range of comorbidities associated with chronic, often treatment-refractory wounds. These include such diverse chronic conditions as diabetes, chronic renal disease, venous insufficiency, peripheral vascular disease, and hypertension, in addition to pressure injuries secondary to lack of mobility and/or poor nutrition.

This complexity in etiology, variability in the underlying pathophysiology, and the attendant risk factors that each condition imparts are reflected in the large number of different guidelines currently available for the treatment and management of chronic wounds. The objective of this review is to summarize the key components and challenges in the development of personalized risk prediction tools for the prevention and management of chronic wounds, and highlight several promising innovations in the development of better risk stratification and prognosis tools, including machine learning (ML) and other broader artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications.

### Challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds [^1163wVgi]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Significance: Chronic wounds include, but are not limited, to diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. They are a challenge to wound care professionals and consume a great deal of healthcare resources around the globe. This review discusses the pathophysiology of complex chronic wounds and the means and modalities currently available to achieve healing in such patients. Recent Advances: Although often difficult to treat, an understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and specific attention toward managing these perturbations can often lead to successful healing. Critical Issues: Overcoming the factors that contribute to delayed healing are key components of a comprehensive approach to wound care and present the primary challenges to the treatment of chronic wounds. When wounds fail to achieve sufficient healing after 4 weeks of standard care, reassessment of underlying pathology and consideration of the need for advanced therapeutic agents should be undertaken. However, selection of an appropriate therapy is often not evidence based. Future Directions: Basic tenets of care need to be routinely followed, and a systematic evaluation of patients and their wounds will also facilitate appropriate care. Underlying pathologies, which result in the failure of these wounds to heal, differ among various types of chronic wounds. A better understanding of the differences between various types of chronic wounds at the molecular and cellular levels should improve our treatment approaches, leading to better healing rates, and facilitate the development of new more effective therapies. More evidence for the efficacy of current and future advanced wound therapies is required for their appropriate use.

### Seeking effective interventions to treat complex wounds: an overview of systematic reviews [^114g98J5]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Protocol

A protocol for our overview of reviews was developed using the Cochrane Handbook for overviews of reviews. The draft protocol was circulated for feedback from systematic review methodologists, policy-makers, and clinicians with expertise in wound care. It was revised as necessary and the final version is available from the corresponding author upon request.

Eligibility criteria

We included systematic reviews that focused on interventions to treat complex wounds (including venous and arterial ulcers due to chronic illness, diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, and infected surgical wounds) amongst adults aged 18 years and older. We used the definition for a systematic review put forth by the Cochrane Collaboration, " A systematic review attempts to collate all empirical evidence that fits pre-specified eligibility criteria in order to answer a specific research question. It uses explicit, systematic methods that are selected with a view to minimizing bias, thus providing more reliable findings from which conclusions can be drawn and decisions made ".

A list of the 14 different intervention categories can be found in Additional file 1. All comparators, such as other wound care interventions, no treatment, placebo, and usual care were eligible for inclusion. To be included, a systematic review also had to report on our outcomes of interest as identified by decision-makers, including healing (e.g. number of ulcers healed, improvement of ulcers, and time to ulcer healing) or admission to hospital (including readmissions). Systematic reviews that were published or unpublished and conducted at any point in time were included. Due to resource limitations, only systematic reviews written in English were included. However, authors were contacted to obtain translations of reviews written in languages other than English.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^112wixaM]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain physiology — transition from acute to chronic pain in trauma care is described, noting this transition is most common in patients with direct injury to nerves or with complex injuries that are slow to heal, but it can also occur after relatively trivial injuries in otherwise healthy patients. In trauma care, the transition from acute to chronic pain is a common complication, leading to significant long-term functional impairment, the potential for development of a substance use disorder (SUD), and diminished long-term health. Search for evidence of chronic pain during patient follow-up visits. Carefully assess patients with continued dependence on opioid medications or obvious functional limitations despite evidence of anatomic recovery for undiagnosed injuries or other occult causes of pain, such as deep wound infection. If none are found, it is appropriate to refer the patient to a pain specialist for ongoing treatment of chronic pain syndrome, including supervised tapering from opioid medications.

### Chronic wound repair and healing in older adults: current status and future research [^112ybb6v]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

Older adults are more likely to have chronic wounds than younger people, and the effect of chronic wounds on quality of life is particularly profound in this population. Wound healing slows with age, but the basic biology underlying chronic wounds and the influence of age-associated changes on wound healing are poorly understood. Most studies have used in vitro approaches and various animal models, but observed changes translate poorly to human healing conditions. The effect of age and accompanying multimorbidity on the effectiveness of existing and emerging treatment approaches for chronic wounds is also unknown, and older adults tend to be excluded from randomized clinical trials. Poorly defined outcomes and variables; lack of standardization in data collection; and variations in the definition, measurement, and treatment of wounds also hamper clinical studies. The Association of Specialty Professors, in conjunction with the National Institute on Aging and the Wound Healing Society, held a workshop, summarized in this article, to explore the current state of knowledge and research challenges, engage investigators across disciplines, and identify research questions to guide future study of age-associated changes in chronic wound healing.

### Assessment of frailty in elderly patients attending a multidisciplinary wound care centre: a cohort study [^113PnLBT]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient multimorbidity, the presence of two or more chronic conditions, and frailty which represent a global syndrome of decreased physiologic reserve, lead to increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. Additionally, multimorbidity increases the likelihood of being frail by around twofold. When multimorbidity is associated with frailty, a special situation is created where the proposed care model is based on situational diagnosis, shared decision-making, and designing an individualized therapeutic plan. Frailty evaluation is currently used as a tool for determining healthcare for complex patients and to assist in decision-making. Multimorbidity is currently the most prevalent chronic disorder, also confirmed in elderly patients with non-healing wounds, that poses a challenge for the management of these patients.

Globally, there are two types of instruments for assessing frailty: frailty phenotype instruments and deficit accumulation indexes. Frailty phenotype instruments, which are based on the Fried model measure physical parameters. The Fried model is mostly used in situations of disability prevention and scores robust to frail patients. An example of this model is the SHARE-Frailty Instrument (SHARE-FI). On the other hand, the model of deficit accumulation is focus on frailty indexes. Frailty indexes evaluate co-morbidities, functional and cognitive decline, social factors, and geriatric syndromes. The more conditions patients present, the higher the frailty score. Frailty indexes are used as a clinical decision-making instrument. An example of this instrument is Frail-VIG index ("VIG" is the Spanish/Catalan abbreviation for Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment). Frailty can be determined by using several tools, in this study we used the Frail-VIG index because it allows a rapid geriatric assessment and we compared it with the SHARE-FI which is well validated in the outpatient population.

We hypothesize that patients' clinical condition is essential to be considered in addition to wound local wound characteristic determination for a better wounds' management. In this work, we determined the frailty index in elderly patients requiring complex wound treatment at a regional MWCC for better characterization of this patient population. In addition, we evaluated the correlation between the degree of frailty and wound healing outcomes as a potential clinical marker with a prognostic value for cure that could help professionals in clinical decision-making for wound management.

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^112WSFew]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL USEFULNESS

Routine clinical practice requires simple, interpretable models of risk that use predictors that are easy to measure and not overly time-consuming. Although ML methods are attractive, they are very data dependent. Those models can lack the interpretability of predictor models grounded in subject matter knowledge. Furthermore, the clinical utility of algorithmic predictions needs to consider the benefit-harm consequences for patients of false positive and false negatives. For example, a higher rate of false positives may be acceptable in real-world clinical practice if it avoids undue harm. The trade-off between these choices should therefore be balanced with practical clinical needs. ML may play an important role for identifying complex combinations and/or interactions between various risk factors if large data sets are available.

However, the ultimate tool for use in real-world clinical practice needs to be pragmatic, intuitive, and actionable. Some performance measures have been proposed recently to quantify the ability of a prediction model to improve decision making. These measures consider the differential clinical consequences of false-positive versus true-positive classifications in a summary measure for clinical usefulness. ML-based risk prediction is not in itself sufficient to establish causal relationships between risk factors and wound outcomes and the general lack of standards or best practice in the development and application of the reviewed ML-based risk prediction has likely contributed to this lack of transparency and the relatively poor uptake of such technology in the clinical setting.

In terms of future work assessing the clinical usefulness of ML in wound management, this study group is currently undertaking a formal study applying ML methods to real-world data from the Swedish RiksSår quality registry for patients with difficult-to-heal wounds, to identify clusters of predictive factors that best predict wound class (healable vs maintenance vs nonhealable) in clinical practice.

### Best practices for elderly hip fracture patients. A systematic overview of the evidence [^1174CQ5h]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine evidence-based best practices for elderly hip fracture patients from the time of hospital admission to 6 months postfracture.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, PEDro, Ageline, NARIC, and CIRRIE databases were searched for potentially eligible articles published between 1985 and 2004.

Review Methods

Two independent reviewers determined studies appropriate for inclusion using standardized selection criteria, extracted data, evaluated internal validity, and then rated studies according to levels of evidence. Only Level 1 or 2 evidence was included in our summary of clinical recommendations.

Results

Spinal anesthesia, pressure-relieving mattresses, perioperative antibiotics, and deep vein thromboses prophylaxes had consistent evidence of benefit. Routine preoperative traction was not associated with any benefits and should be abandoned. Types of surgical management, postoperative wound drainage, and even "multidisciplinary" care, lacked sufficient evidence to determine either benefit or harm. There was little evidence to either determine best subacute rehabilitation practices or to direct ongoing medical issues (e.g., nutrition). Studies conducted during the subacute recovery period were heterogeneous in terms of treatment settings, interventions, and outcomes studied and had no clear evidence for best treatment practices.

Conclusions

The evidence for perioperative practices is relatively robust and evidence-based perioperative treatment guidelines can be easily established. Conversely, more evidence is required to better guide the care of elderly patients with hip fracture during the subacute recovery period and convalescence.

### Management of diabetic foot ulcers [^117GKHhy]. Diabetes Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The management of diabetic foot ulcers remains a major therapeutic challenge which implies an urgent need to review strategies and treatments in order to achieve the goals and reduce the burden of care in an efficient and cost-effective way. Questions remain as to which types of intervention, technology, and dressing are suitable to promote healing, and whether all therapies are necessary and cost-effective as adjunctive therapies. The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot has conducted two systematic reviews of the evidence and effectiveness of interventions to enhance the healing of chronic diabetic foot ulcers. The preliminary results are promising, but large randomized controlled trials are necessary in order to establish the cost-effectiveness of the new therapies.

Prevention of diabetic foot ulceration is critical in order to reduce the associated high morbidity and mortality rates, and the danger of amputation. It is essential to identify the "foot at risk", through careful inspection and physical examination of the foot followed by neuropathy and vascular tests.

Regular foot examination, patient education, simple hygienic practices, provision of appropriate footwear, and prompt treatment of minor injuries can decrease ulcer occurrence by 50% and eliminate the need for major amputation in nonischemic limbs. Diabetic foot ulcers should be carefully evaluated and the gold-standard treatments should be strictly applied in order to prevent amputation. Further clinical studies are needed to support the existing evidence regarding the clinical benefit of new approaches for the treatment of diabetic ulcers, and these approaches should be used only as add-on therapies to the gold-standard wound care.

### Nutrition and chronic wounds [^112aj9MK]. Advances in Wound Care (2014). Low credibility.

Significance: Nutrition is one of the most basic of medical issues and is often ignored as a problem in the management of our chronic wound patients. Unfortunately, malnutrition is widespread in our geriatric patients even in nursing homes in developed countries. Attention to basic nutrition and providing appropriate supplements may assist in the healing of our chronic wounds. Recent Advances: Recent research has revealed the epidemiology of malnutrition in developed countries, the similarities to malnutrition in developing countries, and some of the physiologic and sociologic causes for this problem. More information is now available on the biochemical effects of nutrient deficiency and supplementation with macronutrients and micronutrients. In some cases, administration of isolated nutrients beyond recommended amounts for healthy individuals may have a pharmacologic effect to help wounds heal. Critical Issues: Much of the knowledge of the nutritional support of chronic wounds is based on information that has been obtained from trauma management. Due to the demographic differences of the patients and differences in the physiology of acute and chronic wounds, it is not logical to assume that all aspects of nutritional support are identical in these patient groups. Before providing specific nutritional supplements, appropriate assessments of patient general nutritional status and the reasons for malnutrition must be obtained or specific nutrient supplementation will not be utilized. Future Directions: Future research must concentrate on the biochemical and physiologic differences of the acute and chronic wounds and the interaction with specific supplements, such as antioxidants, vitamin A, and vitamin D.

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^117RdEDQ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Global vascular guidelines — avoid revascularization without significant ischemia — Do not perform revascularization in the absence of significant ischemia (WIfI ischemia grade 0), unless an isolated region of poor perfusion in conjunction with major tissue loss (eg, WIfI wound grade 2 or 3) can be effectively targeted and the wound progresses or fails to reduce in size by ≥ 50% within 4 weeks despite appropriate infection control, wound care, and offloading. Good practice statement.

### The impact of underlying conditions on quality-of-life measurement among patients with chronic wounds, as measured by utility values: a review with an additional study [^113D2F8x]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE

The ultimate goal of wound care physicians is to heal chronic wounds. However, since chronic wounds are almost always a symptom of underlying comorbid disease(s), clinicians must approach patient care holistically by addressing the impact of these diseases on the wound healing process. Whether impaired mobility, social distress, pain, depression, and restricted lifestyle contribute to the development of a chronic wound or are the result of them, these underlying conditions significantly lower QoL. Not only can these problems, such as depression, possibly reduce wound healing (perhaps through psychoimmunological effects) but also pain, immobility, and older age can override the wound status (healed or active) as the driver for QoL, rendering the use of wound-related QoL instruments inappropriate in clinical practice.

### Challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds [^116bZVde]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Relevance

Understanding and addressing the challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds will lead to a better clinical outcome (faster and more durable wound closure), resulting in improved patient quality of life and reduced healthcare costs. This review provides a current expert opinion and can be used as a guideline for evaluation and appropriate treatment selection for nonhealing wounds.

### Topical negative pressure for treating chronic wounds [^113hmTWF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic wounds mainly affect the elderly and those with multiple health problems. Despite the use of modern dressings, some of these wounds take a long time to heal, fail to heal, or recur, causing significant pain and discomfort to the person and cost to health services. Topical negative pressure is used to promote healing of surgical wounds by using suction to drain excess fluid from wounds.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of topical negative pressure (TNP) in treating people with chronic wounds and to identify an optimum TNP regimen.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Trials Register was searched until July 2000. Experts in the field and relevant companies were contacted to enquire about ongoing and recently completed relevant trials. In addition citations within obtained papers were scrutinised to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials which evaluated the effectiveness of TNP in treating chronic wounds were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eligibility for inclusion, data extraction and details of trial quality was conducted by two reviewers independently. A narrative synthesis of results was undertaken as only two small trials fulfilled the selection criteria and they used different outcome measures.

Main Results

Two small trials with a total of 34 participants evaluated the effectiveness of TNP on chronic wound healing. Trial 1 considered patients with any type of chronic wound; Trial 2 considered patients with diabetic foot ulcers only. The trials compared TNP (as open cell foam dressing with continuous suction) for the first 48 hours with saline gauze dressings. Trial 1 reported a statistically significant reduction in wound volume at 6 weeks in favour of TNP. Trial 2 (continuous suction, followed by intermittent suction after 48 hours) reported a reduction in the number of days to healing and a reduction in wound surface area at 2 weeks in favour of TNP, - although no statistical analysis was reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The two small trials provide weak evidence suggesting that TNP may be superior to saline gauze dressings in healing chronic human wounds. However, due to the small sample sizes and methodological limitations of these trials, the findings must be interpreted with extreme caution. The effect of TNP on cost, quality of life, pain and comfort was not reported. It was not possible to determine which was the optimum TNP regimen.

### Pressure ulcers: prevention, evaluation, and management… [^115gdkcY]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

The management of pressure ulcers is interdisciplinary, including primary care physicians, dermatologists, infectious disease consultants, social workers, psychologists, dietitians, podiatrists, home and wound-care nurses, rehabilitation professionals, and surgeons. The basic components of pressure ulcer management are reducing or relieving pressure on the skin, debriding necrotic tissue, cleansing the wound, managing bacterial load and colonization, and selecting a wound dressing. Pain assessment should be completed, especially during repositioning, dressing changes, and debridement. Patients at the highest risk of pressure ulcers may not have full sensation or may require alternate pain assessment tools to aid in communication. The goal is to eliminate pain by covering the wound, adjusting pressure-reducing surfaces, repositioning the patient, and providing topical or systemic analgesia.

Small randomized controlled trials show that topical opioid and nonopioid preparations reduce pain during dressing changes and debridement. 8, 16 Debridement methods include sharp, mechanical, enzymatic, and autolytic. Sharp debridement using a sterile scalpel or scissors may be performed at bedside, although more extensive debridement should be performed in the operating room. Sharp debridement is needed if infection occurs or to remove thick and extensive eschar. Healing after sharp debridement requires adequate vascularization; thus, vascular assessment for lower extremity ulcers is recommended. 22 Anticoagulation is a relative contraindication for sharp debridement. 23 Wet-to-dry dressings adhere to devitalized tissue, which is removed with dressing changes. However, viable tissue may also be removed and the process may be painful.

24 Hydrotherapy via whirlpool bath debridement or irrigation may loosen debris. Enzymatic debridement is useful in the long-term care of patients who cannot tolerate sharp debridement; however, it takes longer to be effective and should not be used when infection is present. 25, 26. Hydrogels can be used for deep wounds with light exudate. Alginates and foams are highly absorbent and are useful for wounds with moderate to heavy exudate. Hydrocolloids retain moisture and are useful for promoting autolytic debridement. Dressing selection is dictated by clinical judgment and wound characteristics; no moist dressing is superior.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy for the healing and management of venous leg ulcers [^114Feab5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Leg ulcers are chronic wounds of the lower leg, caused by poor blood flow, that can take a long time to heal. The pooling of blood in the veins can damage the skin and surrounding tissues, causing an ulcer to form. Venous leg ulcers are associated with impaired quality of life, reduced mobility, pain, stress and loss of dignity. The standard treatment for venous leg ulcers is compression bandages or stockings. Shock wave therapy may aid the healing of these wounds through the promotion of angiogenesis (the formation and development of blood vessels) and reduction of inflammation, though this process is poorly understood at present.

Objectives

To assess the effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on the healing and management of venous leg ulceration.

Search Methods

In April 2018 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. We applied no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the healing and management of venous leg ulceration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection. We planned that two review authors would also assess the risk of bias of included studies, extract study data and rate the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We found no RCTs that met the inclusion criteria for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no RCTs assessing the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the healing and management of venous leg ulceration. The lack of high-quality evidence in this area highlights a gap in research and may serve to justify the need for further research and evidence to provide guidance concerning the use of this treatment option for this condition. Future trials should be of clear design and include concomitant use of the current best practice treatment, multilayer compression therapy. Recruitment should aspire to best represent patients seen in clinical practice and patient-related outcome measures should be included in study design.

### Systematic approach to wound dressings [^116KSKss]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic wounds are a major source of morbidity and mortality within the United States. Wound dressings remain a cornerstone of dermatologic therapy. Selection of the proper wound dressing proves difficult given the range of wounds encountered and the numerous dressing options available to the clinician. Nevertheless, selection of a proper wound dressing is a crucial step in management that can significantly alter the course of wound healing. There are a variety of wound dressings available, including moisture retentive/occlusive dressings as well as dressings impregnated with antimicrobial agents. Here we outline the characteristics and indications of specific wound dressings in order to provide clinicians with a basic understanding of the types of dressings available. This review provides a tool for dermatologists to better assess and treat chronic wounds. Using the algorithm provided, clinicians will be able to select the appropriate dressing in order to accelerate wound healing, prevent infection and improve health outcomes.

### Seeking effective interventions to treat complex wounds: an overview of systematic reviews [^115Jfw6d]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic wounds are those that have not progressed through the ordered process of healing to yield a functional result. Recently, the terminology for chronic wounds has changed. The preferred term to refer to a chronic wound is a "complex wound". One of the following characteristics is necessary for a wound to be classified as being complex: i) has not healed in 3 months, ii) infection is present, iii) compromised viability of superficial tissues, necrosis, or circulation impairment, and iv) association with systemic pathologies, impairing normal healing. The main types of complex wounds include diabetic leg/foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, chronic venous ulcers, infected wounds, and those related to vasculitis and immunosuppressive therapy that have not healed using simple care.

Complex wounds are a significant burden on society. It has been estimated that complex wounds cost the healthcare system $10 billion annually in North America alone. These estimates often fail to capture indirect costs, including patient/caregiver frustration, economic loss, and decreased quality of life.

Healthcare providers and patients have numerous regimens available for treating wounds, including dressings, wound cleansing agents, skin replacement therapy, biologic agents, stockings, nutritional supplementation, complementary and alternative medicine, bandages, and surgery, to name a few. Furthermore, wound care is often multi-faceted, and several interventions may be used concurrently. Some of these interventions have been examined in overviews of Cochrane reviews. As the evidence of these interventions is recondite across the literature, we sought to elucidate optimal treatment strategies for complex wounds through an overview of all available systematic reviews, including Cochrane reviews and non-Cochrane reviews.

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^116AUFui]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE

Improved risk prediction is essential for the early identification of patients at highest risk for progressing to chronic wounds. This may enable early intervention in clinical practice to both prevent disease progression and support targeted, personalized management of disease once progressed, accounting for an individual patient's unique set of risk factors.

### Prevention and management of pressure ulcers [^115JvwnB]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Pressure ulcers represent a major health problem causing a considerable amount of suffering for patients and a high financial burden for healthcare systems. The geriatric population with an increased risk of pressure ulcer development is rising constantly as a result of chronic degenerative diseases that can lead to prolonged immobilization and poor nutrition. Evidence clearly indicates that preventive measures are essential to reduce the prevalence rates of pressure ulcers; therefore healthcare professionals must be able to identify the appropriate strategies to adopt, in order to meet the individual patient's requirements. Important advances have taken place in the world of pressure ulcer treatment during the past decade. These advances are reflected in the high rate of cures being obtained. This, together with the implementation of prevention guidelines, the excellent cost/effectiveness relationship of the techniques described, and other factors, means that the field of pressure ulcers management is no more an isolated and self-administered issue in medical practice. The areas discussed here are those in which there will be linear or, in some cases, exponential growth in the decades to come.

### Venous leg ulcers: a review of published assessment and treatment algorithms [^114ouX1Y]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE

VLUs are the most common leg ulcers, with a prevalence of 1.69% in the elderly population. Their economic burden in the United States has been estimated at $14.9 billion annually.VLUs are linked to venous insufficiency, a slow-progressing chronic disease. They are chronic and recurrent by nature, with associated morbidity and reduced quality of life. Cases are often complex because as patients advance in age, they are likely to have concomitant health conditions, which also negatively impact wound healing, such as diabetes and arterial disease. Therefore, multiple factors need to be considered for proper assessment and treatment.

### Prediction of healing trajectory of chronic wounds using a machine learning approach [^112oC229]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective: New treatment options are emerging for chronic wounds, which represent a growing problem because of population ageing and increasing burden of chronic disease. While promising, the existing evidence for advanced modalities is commonly derived from small and/or poorly controlled studies and clear criteria for selecting patients, who are likely to benefit from these expensive options are lacking. In this study, we develop and validate a machine learning model to predict if a chronic wound, independent of etiology, is expected to heal within 12 weeks to identify cases in potential need of advanced treatment options. Approach: Retrospective analysis of electronic health record data from 2014 to 2018 covering 532 wound care clinics in the United States and 261,398 patients with 620,356 unique wounds. Prediction of 12-week healing trajectories with a machine learning model. Results: The best-performing model in a training dataset of a randomly drawn 75% subset of wounds contained variables for patient demographics, comorbidities, wound characteristics at initial presentation, and changes in wound dimensions over time, with the latter group being the most influential predictors. The final machine learning model had a high predictive accuracy with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.9 and 0.92 after 4 and 5 weeks of treatment, respectively. Innovation: A machine learning model can identify chronic wounds at risk of not healing by week 12 with high accuracy in the early weeks of treatment. Conclusions: If embedded in real-world care, the generated information could be able to guide effective and efficient treatment decisions.

### Nutrition and cutaneous wound healing [^111otYyN]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Wound healing is a complex and energy-demanding process. The relationship between nutrition and wound healing has been recognized for many centuries. Several studies have indicated that nutritional deficiencies are more prevalent among patients with chronic wounds. Malnutrition may alter the inflammatory response, collagen synthesis, and wound tensile strength, all of which are crucial for wound healing. Although the specific role of nutrition and supplementation in wound care remains uncertain, it is necessary to identify and correct nutritional imbalances to avoid any potential deterioration of the healing process. It is also important to recognize the differences in pathophysiology between acute and chronic wounds. A burn, surgical, or a traumatic wound is different from a diabetic foot ulcer, which is different from a pressure ulcer. Chronic wounds are more prevalent in the aging population, and patients often have underlying comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, connective tissue disease, or other systemic illnesses that may alter energy metabolism and contribute to impaired healing. Management approaches to acute wound care may not apply universally to chronic wounds. In this review, we discuss the available data and possible roles for nutrition in wound healing.

### Expert advice provided through telemedicine improves healing of chronic wounds: prospective cluster controlled study [^116xttAp]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Telemedicine is widely considered as an efficient approach to manage the growing problem of chronic wounds. However, to date, there is no convincing evidence to support the clinical efficacy of telemedicine in wound management. In this prospective cluster controlled study, we tested the hypothesis that advice on wound management provided by a team of wound-care specialists through telemedicine would significantly improve the likelihood of wound healing compared with the best available conventional practice. A total of 90 chronic wound patients in home care met all study criteria and were included: 50 in the telemedicine group and 40 in the conventional group. Patients with pressure ulcers, surgical wounds, and cancer wounds were excluded. During the 1-year follow-up, complete wound healing was achieved in 35 patients (70%) in the telemedicine group compared with 18 patients (45%) in the conventional group. After adjusting for important covariates, offering advice on wound management through telemedicine was associated with significantly increased healing compared with the best available conventional practice (telemedicine vs. conventional practice: adjusted hazard ratio 2.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.15–4.17; P = 0.017). This study strongly supports the use of telemedicine to connect home-care nurses to a team of wound experts in order to improve the management of chronic wounds.

### Assessment of frailty in elderly patients attending a multidisciplinary wound care centre: a cohort study [^115H4vwP]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Aging is frequently associated with multimorbidity, and along with multiple diseases the occurrence of non-healing ulcers is relevant. Most non-healing wounds are associated with some of the most common conditions among older patients, such as vascular disease, venous insufficiency, disability, unrelieved pressure, and diabetes. Patients suffering from non-healing wounds are mostly in the aging population presenting with multimorbidity. Tissue repair capacity worsens with age and wound healing has been described as being reduced in older patients (> 70 years) in comparison with younger ones. Slower healing increases the risk of infection and the likelihood of the wound becoming chronic. These factors lead to more complex wound management in the elderly.

Multidisciplinary wound care centres (MWCC) have emerged to care for patients with complex wounds that require specific advanced therapies due to large wound size, delayed healing time, complex aetiology, and patient systemic disease. These centres are staffed by professionals from different disciplines, trained in devising individualized therapeutic plans and guarantying care continuity. In comparison with other levels of care, MWCC have been shown to decrease healing time and improve the patient care experience. MWCC care for a variety of non-healing wounds, the main therapeutic strategies focus rather on the treatment of local wound factors, however the introduction of comprehensive assessment could help in considering the patient as a whole. The implication of local factors (desiccation, infection, maceration, necrosis, pressure) in wound healing progression has been studied in depth. However, it is less known how the general factors act in healing, i.e. type of treatment, systemic disease, multimorbidity, age, etc. Given patients' local and systemic condition, it becomes essential to characterize the profiles of older patients to ensure proper management of non-healing wounds in the context of multidisciplinary wound units.

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^115desdH]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Barriers to targeted chronic wounds management

Current standard of care for the management of chronic wounds covers multiple stages, including debridement, surgical drainage (where indicated), wound bed preparation, dressings and antimicrobial management of infection, and wound bioburden. Many conventional local therapies, growth factors, and dressing and biomaterial technologies for the management and treatment of chronic wounds remain generic. These interventions are commonly used in wound management irrespective of etiology or underlying risk factors that may impair wound healing. Moreover, the large number of available treatments for which evidence of effectiveness across the various phases of chronic wound disease is limited.

This lack of validated, primary evidence is more pronounced in the biotechnological sphere, where promising technologies such as functional biomaterials and dressings are often insufficiently tested and trialled, making it difficult to establish causative associations between wound management technology and improved clinical and/or cost outcomes. These limitations extend to the economic evaluation of treatments for chronic wounds, both pharmaceutical and technological. A recent systematic review of model-based economic evaluations of venous leg ulcer treatments found that the reporting quality was generally low, particularly with regard to the reporting of evidence supporting the structure of each model used to translate the efficacy favoring a chronic wound intervention reported in the clinical trial setting into an economic cost-benefit or cost-utility.

The heterogenous nature of chronic wounds makes personalized ulcer management challenging. A key component of personalized treatment of chronic wounds is better risk prediction. Being able to reliably predict which patients are likely to experience impaired ulcer healing would be a critical step in the tailoring of wound therapies to the individual patient and being able to respond in a timely manner when chronic wounds prove refractory to initial treatment. Predictive diagnostics have been identified as a critical component in the targeted prevention of various pathologies that characteristically drive poor wound healing. Risk prediction may also need to appreciate systematic differences in health care delivery across different settings.

Of the various etiologies or underlying disease that may present as chronic wounds, diabetes is one area that has seen recent advancements in personalized diabetes care. The development of risk prediction models that combine clinical and phenotypic data with biomarkers and genetic data to estimate individualized risk of diabetic complications have be used to risk-stratify and monitor patients to prevent or delay the development of such complications. However, while analytical tools for the development of robust risk prediction for the prevention or targeted management of chronic wounds are evolving rapidly, their application in real-world clinical practice remains limited.

### Pressure ulcers: prevention and management [^1135Xn85]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Prevention has been a primary goal of pressure ulcer research. Despite such efforts, pressure ulcers remain common in hospitals and in the community. Moreover, pressure ulcers often become chronic wounds that are difficult to treat and that tend to recur after healing. Especially given these challenges, dermatologists should have the knowledge and skills to implement pressure ulcer prevention strategies and to effectively treat pressure ulcers in their patients. This continuing medical education article focuses on pressure ulcer prevention and management, with an emphasis on the evidence for commonly accepted practices.

### Challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds [^111VrCtV]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

Complex wounds represent a major challenge for the clinician and wound care specialist. Despite all the recent advances in wound care therapies and our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying chronic wounds, nothing can supplant the need for adhering to the basic tenets of wound care: thorough assessment with medical and nutritional optimization, debridement (including surgery), offloading (or compression), management of ischemia, management of infection, and appropriate wound bed preparation. Following these principles and established wound care guidelines should often lead to satisfactory outcomes. In addition, the rational use of advanced wound care therapies is encouraged when wounds do not respond sufficiently to good standard care after 4 weeks or sooner as circumstances dictate. In most cases, selection of advanced therapies should be based on the evidence available to help facilitate their most appropriate use.

### What Do patients want? Patient preference in wound care [^1164CFUV]. Advances in Wound Care (2014). Low credibility.

Patient preferences are statements made or actions taken by consumers that reflect their desirability of a range of health options. The concept occupies an increasingly prominent place at the center of healthcare reform, and is connected to all aspects of healthcare, including discovery, research, delivery, outcome, and payment. Patient preference research has focused on shared decisions, decisional aids, and clinical practice guideline development, with limited study in acute and chronic wound care populations. The wound care community has focused primarily on patient focused symptoms and quality of life measurement. With increasing recognition of wound care as a medical specialty and as a public health concern that consumes extensive resources, attention to the preferences of end-users with wounds is necessary. This article will provide an overview of related patient-centered concepts and begin to establish a framework for consideration of patient preference in wound care.

### Management of the skin and soft tissue in the geriatric surgical patient [^1174GGPc]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Aging has significant effects on the healing ability of the geriatric population. When the elderly suffer injuries, they have a decreased metabolic reserve to handle the stress required to recover. Diseases of the elderly, such as malnutrition, diabetes mellitus, treatment of malignancies, and vascular disease, all impair tissue repair. The geriatric population is more prone to pressure ulcers, venous stasis ulcers, and other chronic wounds. This review discusses how changes in the elderly lead to impaired healing or chronic wounds. Prevention of these problems and their treatment are also discussed.

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^116BmT2H]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

One well-publicized example involved the Framingham Risk Score (FRS), commonly used in risk prediction for cardiovascular endpoints, whereas an FRS-based risk prediction model of coronary artery disease (CAD) returned similar levels of discrimination in Asian and non-Asian cohorts; only on subsequent external validation was it apparent that the same model markedly overestimated the absolute risk of CAD, by 276% in men and 102% in women. Similarly, an American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) risk model overestimated CAD risk by 75% to 150% in validation cohorts. These examples highlight the common problem of poor calibration of absolute risk predictions.

The emergence of large, high-quality national wound registries provides further opportunities to optimize the performance of chronic wound risk prediction by dividing these large databases into meaningful training and testing datasets, including by region or health care provider. Similarly, electronic medical records (EMRs) are proving an increasing valuable resource for both developing and validating risk prediction in chronic wounds. A 2020 study of 620,356 chronic wounds (various etiologies) from the EMRs of 261,398 patients in the United States was able to predict wound healing with an area under the curve of 0.72, although this was less than the accuracy observed in other studies. Whatever the data source or stage of model development, it is essential that the future of risk prediction in chronic wounds follows best practice recommendations both in terms of model development, and in reporting.

Innovative methods for improving risk prediction in chronic wounds

What is broadly acknowledged is that risk prediction in chronic wounds is challenging, given the high level of heterogeneity in patient, disease, monitoring, treatment, and health care system factors that correlate with the various clinical outcomes. Conventional risk prediction models based on linear combinations of risk factors remain an important cornerstone of any attempt to quantify a patient's individual risk status. Decision tree models are also well established in risk stratification and can be useful for both clinical outcome prediction and ranking the relative importance of competing risk factors to that prediction, may result in adequate risk prediction relative to conventional linear regression.

Risk prediction studies in chronic wound research employing conventional or algorithmic classification schemes generally tend to focus on three main outcomes: (1) wound healing; (2) in-hospital adverse events; and (3) wound management decision making (for example, specialist referral or optimal treatment recommendation). Characteristics of a selection of risk prediction studies for each of these outcomes are summarized in Tables 2–4, respectively.

Nonrevascularization treatments of the limb in chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) — Consider spinal cord stimulation to reduce the risk of amputation and to decrease pain in carefully selected patients (eg, rest pain, minor tissue loss) in whom revascularization is not possible (2 (Weak) B (Moderate)). Do not use lumbar sympathectomy for limb salvage in CLTI patients in whom revascularization is not possible (2 (Weak) C (Low)). Consider intermittent pneumatic compression therapy in carefully selected patients (eg, rest pain, minor tissue loss) in whom revascularization is not possible (2 (Weak) B (Moderate)). Do not offer prostanoids for limb salvage in CLTI patients, and consider offering selectively for patients with rest pain or minor tissue loss and in whom revascularization is not possible (2 (Weak) B (Moderate)). Do not offer vasoactive drugs or defibrinating agents (ancrod) in patients in whom revascularization is not possible (1 (Strong) C (Low)). Do not offer HBOT to improve limb salvage in CLTI patients with severe, uncorrected ischemia (eg, WIfI ischemia grade 2/3) (1 (Strong) B (Moderate)). Continue to provide optimal wound care until the lower extremity wound is completely healed or the patient undergoes amputation (Good practice statement).

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^114RTsAf]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance:

Chronic wounds are associated with significant morbidity, marked loss of quality of life, and considerable economic burden. Evidence-based risk prediction to guide improved wound prevention and treatment is limited by the complexity in their etiology, clinical underreporting, and a lack of studies using large high-quality datasets.

Recent Advancements:

The objective of this review is to summarize key components and challenges in the development of personalized risk prediction tools for both prevention and management of chronic wounds, while highlighting several innovations in the development of better risk stratification.

Critical Issues:

Regression-based risk prediction approaches remain important for assessment of prognosis and risk stratification in chronic wound management. Advances in statistical computing have boosted the development of several promising machine learning (ML) and other semiautomated classification tools. These methods may be better placed to handle large number of wound healing risk factors from large datasets, potentially resulting in better risk prediction when combined with conventional methods and clinical experience and expertise.

Future Directions:

Where the number of predictors is large and heterogenous, the correlations between various risk factors complex, and very large data sets are available, ML may prove a powerful adjuvant for risk stratifying patients predisposed to chronic wounds. Conventional regression-based approaches remain important, particularly where the number of predictors is relatively small. Translating estimated risk derived from ML algorithms into practical prediction tools for use in clinical practice remains challenging.

### Office-based wound care [^114pGX5Y]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Wounds may be acute or chronic, and wound care can be straightforward or exceedingly complex. While the care of surgical wounds begins in the hospital setting, current management of both acute and chronic wounds favors outpatient treatment modalities. Although there has been an increase in the availability of specialized wound care centers, they are not available in all communities and surgeons will be called upon to assist in management of both complex and chronic wounds. An overview of wound care priorities and management of specific wound challenges is provided.

### Management of chronic wounds-2018… [^112DP96H]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Tissue repair following a wound occurs along a spectrum ranging from underhealing, as occurs in chronic wounds, to overhealing, as is seen in fibrosis. 1 In the United States, it is estimated that as many as 4. 5 million people have chronic wounds, resulting in substantial economic and psychosocial costs. Various pathologic states result in chronic wound development, including arterial or venous insufficiency, diabetes, undue skin pressure, presence of a foreign body, and infection.

### Human wound and its burden: updated 2022 compendium of estimates [^1137jLKT]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance: Chronic wounds affect 10.5 million (up 2.3 million from the 2014 update) of U.S. Medicare beneficiaries. Chronic wounds impact the quality of life of nearly 2.5% of the total population of the United States. This fraction is larger in the elderly. These wounds can lead to a range of complications and health care costs. Given the aging population, the continued threat of diabetes and obesity worldwide, and the persistent problem of infection, it is expected that chronic wounds will continue to be a substantial clinical, social, and economic challenge. Disparities in the prevalence and management of chronic wounds exist, with underserved communities and marginalized populations often facing greater challenges in accessing quality wound care. These disparities exacerbate the public health burden. Recent Advances: U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had proposed revision of its local coverage determination limiting the use of skin substitute grafts/cellular and/or tissue-based products for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers in the U.S. Medicare population. In response to the comment phase, this proposal has been put on hold. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has renewed its focus on addressing nonhealing chronic wounds and has outlined efforts to address identified barriers to product development for nonhealing chronic wounds. The new approach places emphasis on engaging key wound healing stakeholders, including academia, professional associations, patient groups, reimbursement organizations, and industry. Finally, recent advances demonstrating that wounds closed by current FDA definition of wound closure may remain functionally open because of deficiencies in restoration of barrier function warrant revisiting the wound closure endpoint. Such "closed" wounds that are functionally open, also known as invisible wounds, are likely to be associated with high wound recurrence. Future Directions: Addressing the public health problem of chronic wounds will require a multifaceted approach that includes prevention, improved wound care management, and addressing the underlying risk factors.

### Treatment of diabetic ulcers [^116pjS8G]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Diabetic ulcers are chronic wounds that are the result of repetitive trauma in the insensate foot. The presence of infection and peripheral vascular disease makes the treatment of these wounds demanding and requires a multidisciplinary approach. The main principles of the management include adherence to the principles of good wound care, such as aggressive debridement of all non-viable tissue, adequate off-loading of pressure, prompt treatment of infection and moist wound dressings. Over the last decade, new therapeutic modalities, including growth factors and living skin equivalents, have been available to the practicing physicians. Judicious use of advanced wound care products may provide the best means of treating these challenging wounds in an efficient and cost-effective way.

### Wound care in geriatrics [^112pLEtt]. Dermatologic Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Wound care is a crucial aspect in caring for the geriatric population. It is important to recognize a wound when it begins and know the proper treatment once a wound develops. First, it is important to assess the wound and determine the type of wound that is being dealt with. One must establish whether the wound is acute of chronic. Then a proper treatment plan must be devised. This article will take you through step by step process of different types of wounds and the proper treatment of those wounds that commonly occur within the geriatric population.

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^113d8WeN]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Conventional regression-based approach to risk prediction will remain important, particularly where the number of predictors is relatively small, and assumptions underlying the chosen model form such as linearity are carefully assessed. Furthermore, translating estimated risk derived from ML algorithms into practical, standalone prediction tools for use in everyday clinical practice (such as personalized risk calculators or nomograms) can be challenging. Where the number of predictors is large and heterogenous (as is characteristic of chronic wounds), the relationships and correlations between various risk factors are complex, and very large data sets are available, ML may prove a powerful adjuvant for risk-stratifying patients predisposed to or living with chronic wounds.

### Management of acute wounds-expert panel consensus statement [^115g8wSD]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Significance: The Wound Healing Foundation recognized the need for consensus-based unbiased recommendations for the treatment of wounds. As a first step, a consensus on the treatment of chronic wounds was developed and published in 2022. The current publication on acute wounds represents the second step in this process. Acute wounds may result from any number of conditions, including burns, military and combat operations, and trauma to specific areas of the body. The management of acute wounds requires timely and evidence-driven intervention to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. This consensus statement provides the clinician with the necessary foundational approaches to the causes, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of acute wounds. Presented in a structured format, this is a useful guide for clinicians and learners in all patient care settings. Recent Advances: Recent advances in the management of acute wounds have centered on stabilization and treatment in the military and combat environment. Specifically, advancements in hemostasis, resuscitation, and the mitigation of infection risk through timely initiation of antibiotics and avoidance of high-pressure irrigation in contaminated soft tissue injury. Critical Issues: Critical issues include infection control, pain management, and the unique considerations for the management of acute wounds in pediatric patients. Future Directions: Future directions include new approaches to preventing the progression and conversion of burns through the use of specific gel formulations. Additionally, the use of three-dimensional bioprinting and photo-modulation for reconstruction is a promising area for continued discovery.

### Chronic wounds: evaluation and management [^114ET9YB]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic wounds are those that do not progress through a normal, orderly, and timely sequence of repair. They are common and are often incorrectly treated. The morbidity and associated costs of chronic wounds highlight the need to implement wound prevention and treatment guidelines. Common lower extremity wounds include arterial, diabetic, pressure, and venous ulcers. Physical examination alone can often guide the diagnosis. All patients with a nonhealing lower extremity ulcer should have a vascular assessment, including documentation of wound location, size, depth, drainage, and tissue type; palpation of pedal pulses; and measurement of the ankle-brachial index. Atypical nonhealing wounds should be biopsied. The mainstay of treatment is the TIME principle: tissue debridement, infection control, moisture balance, and edges of the wound. After these general measures have been addressed, treatment is specific to the ulcer type. Patients with arterial ulcers should be immediately referred to a vascular surgeon for appropriate intervention. Treatment of venous ulcers involves compression and elevation of the lower extremities, plus exercise if tolerated. Diabetic foot ulcers are managed by offloading the foot and, if necessary, treating the underlying peripheral arterial disease. Pressure ulcers are managed by offloading the affected area.

### 2025 SCAI clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic venous disease: this statement was endorsed by the Society for Vascular Medicine (SVM) [^116CcbGf]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2025). High credibility.

SCAI chronic venous disease — background and methods state that chronic venous disease (CVD) affects over 25 million adults in the United States with quality-of-life symptoms, and treatments range from compression and wound care to invasive options. These guidelines are based on original systematic reviews with support from the Evidence Foundation and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and formulate recommendations. The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong (the guideline panel recommends…) or conditional (the guideline panel suggests…), and two algorithms for the management of symptomatic varicose veins and venous ulcer disease were created to facilitate implementation.

### Management of diabetic wounds: expert panel consensus statement [^115sLdSF]. Advances in Wound Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Significance: The Wound Healing Foundation recognized the need for consensus-based unbiased recommendations for the treatment of wounds. Consensus statements on the treatment of chronic wounds and acute wounds have been developed and published previously. The current publication on diabetic wounds represents the next step in this process. Diabetic wounds constitute a major problem. Population-based and meta-analytic studies indicate that the presence of foot wounds in patients with diabetes increases their mortality risk by more than twofold. The management of diabetic wounds requires consistent and evidence-driven intervention to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. This consensus statement provides the clinician with the necessary foundational approaches to the causes, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of diabetic wounds. Presented in a structured format, this is a useful guide for clinicians and learners in all patient care settings. Recent Advances: Continuous glucose monitoring and other new tools have facilitated better diabetes management and the management of associated wounds. Diabetic limb salvage should focus on achieving and optimizing function for the patient with diabetes rather than preserving limb tissue at all costs. Critical Issues: Successful management of diabetic wounds requires a multidisciplinary approach encompassing comprehensive assessment, timely intervention, and collaborative care by the wound clinician with providers who can address critical aspects to achieve healing, including careful management of blood glucose levels, optimization of off-loading and physical therapy, assessment and treatment of limb ischemia, control and prevention of wound infection, and optimal pain management. Future Directions: Emerging treatments offer hope and promise, but the heterogenicity of diabetic wounds poses a challenge to performing good studies, which will be necessary to advance new treatments for diabetic wounds.

### The science of skin: measuring damage and assessing risk [^114fqun9]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

These studies provide specific examples of noninvasive, quantitative, objective skin measurements that may serve as an early predictor of increased risk of skin injury for individually optimized treatment in clinical settings.

Our focus in this article is to consider applications related to patients in health care settings. Based on our experience developing technologies to improve and repair the barrier function of the skin, we recommend the skin hydration (electrical conductance) and TEWL as being the most relevant and easiest to implement clinically for the assessment of skin integrity in patients with risk factors for MARSI. We propose a decision chart (Fig. 5) to incorporate these tests (and potentially a few others as suggested by the literature review mentioned previously) in the clinical setting.

Figure 5.
Proposed clinical evaluation algorithm incorporating quantitative test methods as appropriate.

Further studies are necessary to examine the benefits of these assessments to clinical practice. Such methods are likely to highlight larger differences between susceptible patients than between healthy individuals typically tested in research settings. Noting that variability between test methods and between subjects in the response to various insults is significant, it is likely that clinical measurements should focus on relative values instead of absolute, one-time measurements. Monitoring over time will likely be the best way to assess the evolution of a condition and the effectiveness of an intervention.

Another condition increasing risk for skin injury is the presence of a chronic wound. In a way, the skin is already injured because a wound is present, but the health of the periwound skin is important to promote healing and avoid further enlargement of the wound. From that perspective, periwound skin is at risk for further injury and for MARSI because it is exposed to chronic wound fluid and adhesive products from dressings used on the wound. A best practice recommendation for the prevention and management of periwound skin complications was recently published. The evaluation of the wound microbiome should also be considered, as discussed previously.

### Chronic wounds [^1138kLmj]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2022). High credibility.

Chronic wounds are characterized by their inability to heal within an expected time frame and have emerged as an increasingly important clinical problem over the past several decades, owing to their increasing incidence and greater recognition of associated morbidity and socio-economic burden. Even up to a few years ago, the management of chronic wounds relied on standards of care that were outdated. However, the approach to these chronic conditions has improved, with better prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Such improvements are due to major advances in understanding of cellular and molecular aspects of basic science, in innovative and technological breakthroughs in treatment modalities from biomedical engineering, and in our ability to conduct well-controlled and reliable clinical research. The evidence-based approaches resulting from these advances have become the new standard of care. At the same time, these improvements are tempered by the recognition that persistent gaps exist in scientific knowledge of impaired healing and the ability of clinicians to reduce morbidity, loss of limb and mortality. Therefore, taking stock of what is known and what is needed to improve understanding of chronic wounds and their associated failure to heal is crucial to ensuring better treatments and outcomes.

### Assessment and management of chronic venous, arterial, and diabetic wounds in older adults [^115iHexM]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Nonhealing wounds are increasingly prevalent, present in 1% to 2% of the global population, with higher incidence in geriatric patients. These chronic wounds pose challenges to older adult patients owing to physiologic changes that hinder healing, common medical comorbidities that promote inflammation and damage microcirculation, poor nutritional status and mobility, and psychosocial barriers to receiving care. In this literature review, the epidemiology, pathophysiology, systems costs, and management of chronic venous leg ulcers, arterial ulcers, and diabetic foot wounds in older adult patients are investigated. Evolving skin structure, pro-inflammatory cellular changes, and propensity for infection place the geriatric population at risk for all wound types. Strategies to differentiate between nonhealing wounds through physical examination, standardized tools, and patient-specific characteristics are outlined. Optimal wound care management principles for each wound type, including wound bed debridement, moisture optimization, biofilm control, and management of edema are addressed. Venous leg ulcers secondary to venous insufficiency are particularly common in older adults and often recur, requiring innovative techniques in compression and tissue substitutes. Emerging therapies, including skin grafts, hyperbaric and topical oxygen, and bedside imaging devices, are discussed. Finally, older adult patients are susceptible to social circumstances that place them at risk for suboptimal wound care and poor healing. The combination of access gaps to regular caretakers, immobility, nociceptive and neuropathic pain, and frailty must be acknowledged and addressed in older adult patients with wounds. The aims of this literature review were to clarify these factors to consolidate awareness and to advocate for a multidisciplinary approach to wound care management.

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^1159rV6P]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Global vascular guidelines — nonrevascularization pharmacotherapy and wound care in chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) advise against pharmacologic limb-salvage strategies and emphasize ongoing wound care. Do not offer prostanoids for limb salvage in CLTI patients (Grade 2 [Weak], Level of evidence B [Moderate]); consider offering selectively for patients with rest pain or minor tissue loss and in whom revascularization is not possible. Do not offer vasoactive drugs or defibrinating agents (ancrod) in patients in whom revascularization is not possible (Grade 1 [Strong], Level of evidence C [Low]). Do not offer hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to improve limb salvage in CLTI patients with severe, uncorrected ischemia (eg, WIfI ischemia grade 2/3) (Grade 1 [Strong], Level of evidence B [Moderate]). Continue to provide optimal wound care until the lower extremity wound is completely healed or the patient undergoes amputation (Good practice statement).

### Lower-extremity ulcers: diagnosis and management [^1168Zj4u]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic wounds of the lower extremities are occurring with increasing prevalence. They affect millions of individuals annually, representing both a significant health risk and a large economic burden. Chronic wounds are associated with increased mortality and substantial morbidity due to infection, pain, limitation of daily activities, and psychosocial consequences. To manage these wounds effectively, clinicians must be able to diagnose and manage their aetiology. Diagnosis starts with determining whether the wound is one of the four most common chronic wounds: venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers and arterial ulcers. Moreover, despite many recent advances in wound care, the challenge of managing chronic wounds is complicated by the lack of consistently accepted diagnostic methods and wound-care standards. We present a comprehensive yet condensed approach to managing lower-extremity ulcers, from diagnosis to basic management.

### Review of the current management of pressure ulcers [^115ZxBR6]. Advances in Wound Care (2018). Low credibility.

Significance: The incidence of pressure ulcers is increasing due to our aging population and the increase in the elderly living with disability. Learning how to manage pressure ulcers appropriately is increasingly important for all professionals in wound care. Recent Advances: Many new dressings and treatment modalities have been developed over the recent years and the goal of this review is to highlight their benefits and drawbacks to help providers choose their tools appropriately. Critical Issues: Despite an increased number of therapies available on the market, none has demonstrated any clear benefit over the others and pressure ulcer treatment remains frustrating and time-consuming. Future Directions: Additional research is needed to develop products more effective in prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers.

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^1116XeVM]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

RISK PREDICTION AND CHRONIC WOUNDS

Personalized medicine and wound healing

As knowledge and treatments for the management of chronic wounds evolve, treatment guidelines are increasingly emphasizing a more targeted approach that combines personalized medicine with evidence-based risk prediction for better patient-level and health care usage cost outcomes. Specifically, better tailoring of treatment to individual patients means a broader consideration of the factors that drive disease, including patient-related factors (pathology, comorbidity, allergy, medications, psychosocial, and pain); wound-related factors (duration/senescence and size, area and depth, wound bed condition, ischemia, inflammation/infection, anatomical site, and treatment response); health care professional skills and knowledge; and resource treatment-related factors (health care system, availability, suitability, effectiveness, and cost/reimbursement). The development and application of predictive tools for risk stratification may aid both targeted prevention of chronic wounds or improved, personalized treatment and management once wounds develop.
