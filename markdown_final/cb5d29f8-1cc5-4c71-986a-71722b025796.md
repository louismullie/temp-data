## Question

does subacute thyroiditis present with fevers

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fever is a recognized symptom of subacute thyroiditis, how common it is, and how it helps in the differential diagnosis of painful thyroid disorders. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what defines subacute thyroiditis clinically and biochemically. Then, I should verify whether fever is included among typical manifestations and how frequently it occurs. Next, I will review patterns of fever severity and timing. After that, I need to check for exceptions, such as afebrile or atypical presentations. Finally, I will consider how the presence or absence of fever guides the distinction between SAT and mimics like acute suppurative thyroiditis or Hashimoto thyroiditis and synthesize a practical conclusion [^111njwau] [^115Szv29].

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct of subacute thyroiditis before anchoring on fever. Classically, SAT (de Quervain's or granulomatous thyroiditis) follows a viral prodrome and presents with an exquisitely tender thyroid, pain radiating to the jaw or ear, suppressed TSH with elevated free T4/T3 from follicular disruption, high ESR/CRP, and low thyroid radioisotope uptake, which together distinguish it from causes of increased synthesis such as Graves' disease [^111njwau] [^115Szv29]. Hold on, I should verify diagnostic criteria nuances: "fever" has been listed among additional supportive criteria in some frameworks, though reliance solely on checklists without ultrasound or clinical context can misclassify mimics, so I need to be cautious about overinterpreting any single sign [^114f4zBY].

> Next, I should review whether fever is a recognized symptom in SAT. Fever is indeed reported as a common systemic manifestation in typical SAT descriptions and contemporary series, including COVID-19–associated SAT collections where fever was the second most frequent symptom after neck pain, which reinforces that fever belongs in the canonical symptom set rather than being an anomaly [^111njwau] [^111rFbYX] [^113CVXt3]. Wait, let me verify with case-level data as well: multiple reports document fever during SAT episodes, including post–SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination cases and unusual presentations initially misattributed to meningitis, which were ultimately confirmed as SAT and improved with standard therapy [^114Utk9Z] [^112c8p4J] [^11486f7q].

> I will now examine how often fever occurs and what its typical pattern is. Aggregated case series suggest fever occurs in roughly half to two‑thirds of reported SAT cases; most fevers are low‑grade to moderate and coincide with the early inflammatory and thyrotoxic phase, although higher temperatures can occur, reflecting the intensity of the inflammatory response rather than increased hormone synthesis per se from the thyroid gland [^111rFbYX] [^113CVXt3]. I should double‑check severity outliers: immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated SAT and some vaccine‑related cases document spikes approaching 39–40 °C, confirming that high fever, while less common, does occur in SAT contexts [^112SW5zd]. Hmm, wait a minute, classic imaging narratives also describe "low‑grade fever" as typical, which aligns with the general expectation that marked systemic toxicity is atypical for uncomplicated SAT [^113oGxBx].

> But wait, what if there is no fever at all? Afebrile presentations do happen. Localized or atypical SAT can present with focal pain and tenderness yet normal temperature and even modest inflammatory markers, so the absence of fever does not exclude SAT when other features fit [^115tou2c]. Hold on, I should verify my terminology: I initially thought "painless SAT" might be the same entity, but that term usually refers to subacute lymphocytic (silent) thyroiditis, which is pathophysiologically distinct; however, the painless thyroiditis literature illustrates that thyroid inflammatory syndromes can be minimally symptomatic or afebrile, so I should not overweigh fever in isolation when assessing suspected SAT [^116g76vq].

> Next, I should review how fever helps differentiate SAT from other etiologies of a painful thyroid. A modest fever accompanying a tender thyroid, high ESR/CRP, suppressed uptake on scintigraphy, and a recent viral prodrome points toward SAT rather than Hashimoto thyroiditis, which is typically painless and afebrile, or Graves' disease, which has high uptake and no gland tenderness unless concurrent thyroiditis is present [^111njwau] [^115Szv29]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: very high fever with systemic toxicity, marked leukocytosis, and imaging or drainage evidence of abscess should trigger concern for acute suppurative thyroiditis, a bacterial emergency that overlaps clinically with SAT early on but diverges by microbiology and course, warranting urgent antibiotics and source control rather than anti‑inflammatory therapy alone [^113bqLDk] [^111va8vo] [^113VPQn9]. I need to ensure vigilance for malignant mimics, too, because rapidly enlarging, painful thyroid tumors can masquerade as SAT; ultrasound and, when appropriate, cytology can prevent dangerous delays in diagnosis [^117XLkFf] [^114aUeLL].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: fever is common in subacute thyroiditis and often accompanies the early inflammatory and thyrotoxic phase, appearing in approximately half to two‑thirds of cases, usually as a low‑grade to moderate rise, but occasionally higher in select contexts; its presence supports the diagnosis when integrated with neck pain, tenderness, high ESR/CRP, and low uptake, yet its absence does not rule out SAT, especially in localized or atypical presentations, so fever should inform but not determine the diagnosis [^111rFbYX] [^113CVXt3] [^111njwau] [^115tou2c].

Yes, subacute thyroiditis **commonly presents with fever** [^113oGxBx], typically low-grade (37.5–38.5°C) and often accompanied by malaise, fatigue, and myalgia [^113oGxBx] [^114f4zBY] [^notfound]. Fever is frequent but not universal; it is usually mild to moderate and self-limited, resolving with anti-inflammatory therapy [^111njwau]. High or persistent fever should prompt evaluation for **acute suppurative thyroiditis** or other infections [^113bqLDk].

---

## Clinical presentation of subacute thyroiditis

Subacute thyroiditis is characterized by a **typical constellation of symptoms**, including:

- **Neck pain and tenderness**: Typically radiating to the jaw, ears, or upper chest [^115covMJ] [^113GwwCb].

- **Thyroid gland enlargement**: Diffuse and tender on palpation [^115Szv29] [^113GwwCb].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Malaise [^111njwau], fatigue, myalgia [^113GwwCb], and fever [^114X232G].

- **Thyrotoxic symptoms**: Palpitations, tremors, anxiety, and heat intolerance due to transient hyperthyroidism [^115covMJ] [^114X232G].

---

## Frequency and characteristics of fever in subacute thyroiditis

Fever is a common clinical feature in subacute thyroiditis, **present in approximately 50–70% of patients**, though its frequency and severity vary. The fever associated with subacute thyroiditis typically has the following characteristics:

- **Temperature range**: Usually low-grade, ranging from 37.5°C to 38.5°C (99.5°F to 101.3°F) [^113oGxBx].

- **Duration**: Fever typically persists for several days to weeks, correlating with the inflammatory phase of the disease [^115covMJ].

- **Associated symptoms**: Fever is often accompanied by malaise [^114X232G], fatigue, myalgia, and other systemic inflammatory symptoms [^111njwau] [^113GwwCb].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying fever in subacute thyroiditis

The fever observed in subacute thyroiditis is primarily attributed to inflammation triggered by viral infection or post-viral immune reactions [^115covMJ]. Key mechanisms include **cytokine release**, wherein inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) are released during thyroid inflammation, leading to systemic inflammatory responses and fever; and **thyroid hormone release**, which occurs when destruction of thyroid follicles liberates preformed thyroid hormones, causing transient hyperthyroidism that can further contribute to fever and systemic symptoms [^114X232G].

---

## Clinical significance of fever in subacute thyroiditis

In subacute thyroiditis, fever has important clinical implications. As a diagnostic indicator, fever accompanied by neck pain and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) **strongly supports the diagnosis** of SAT [^113GwwCb] [^113ZHsYN]. Higher fever together with elevated inflammatory markers may signal more severe inflammation and a prolonged disease course. Fever also aids the differential diagnosis by helping distinguish SAT from typically afebrile conditions such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^115Szv29].

---

## Differential diagnosis: distinguishing SAT from other thyroid conditions

Fever is a useful feature for **differentiating subacute thyroiditis** from other thyroid conditions:

| **Thyroid condition** | **Fever presence** | **Other distinguishing features** |
|-|-|-|
| Subacute thyroiditis | Common (50–70%) | - Painful <br/> - Tender thyroid <br/> - Elevated ESR/CRP <br/> - Transient hyperthyroidism [^113GwwCb] [^115covMJ] |
| Hashimoto's thyroiditis | Rare | - Painless goiter <br/> - Hypothyroidism <br/> - Positive thyroid antibodies [^115Szv29] |
| Acute suppurative thyroiditis | - Common <br/> - Often high fever | - Severe pain <br/> - Abscess formation [^111va8vo] <br/> - Bacterial infection [^113bqLDk] |
| Graves' disease | Rare | - Hyperthyroidism <br/> - Diffuse goiter <br/> - Ophthalmopathy [^115covMJ] |

---

## Management of fever in subacute thyroiditis

Management of fever in subacute thyroiditis primarily involves **symptomatic treatment** and control of inflammation:

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: First-line treatment for mild to moderate fever and inflammation [^115covMJ].

- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone (5–60 mg daily) is indicated for moderate to severe cases or when NSAIDs are ineffective [^111RJtzy].

- **Supportive care**: Antipyretics, hydration, and rest are recommended to manage fever and systemic symptoms [^111njwau].

---

## Prognosis and clinical course

Fever in subacute thyroiditis typically resolves within a few days to weeks with appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment [^111njwau]. The overall **prognosis of SAT is favorable** [^115covMJ], with most patients recovering fully within a few months, though a subset of patients may develop transient or permanent hypothyroidism requiring long-term thyroid hormone replacement therapy [^116sZiHr] [^114X232G].

---

## Conclusion

Subacute thyroiditis **commonly presents with fever**, typically low-grade and self-limited, reflecting the underlying inflammatory process. Fever, along with neck pain and elevated inflammatory markers, is a key diagnostic feature that helps differentiate SAT from other thyroid conditions. Management involves symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs or corticosteroids, and the prognosis is generally favorable [^115covMJ].

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^114f4zBY]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), also known as de Quervain thyroiditis or granulomatous thyroiditis, is an inflammatory disease of supposed viral origin. Susceptibility to the disease is associated with the occurrence of certain types of human leukocyte antigens, which can influence the course of the disease. The prevalence of SAT is highest in middle-aged women; female patients account for 75–80% of individuals with the disease.

For several decades, diagnosis has been based on the presence of a painful or tender, palpable thyroid nodule or goitre and a significant increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); these two parameters are considered the main diagnostic criteria. The pain typically radiates to the ears, mandible, and upper part of the chest. It has been believed that both main criteria plus any two additional criteria should be met to confirm the diagnosis. Additional criteria include significantly reduced iodine uptake (RAIU), transient thyrotoxicosis, fever, typical ultrasound (US) image, typical image of cytological material in fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), and low concentration of anti-thyroid antibodies.

Proceeding in accordance with the above-mentioned criteria may lead to an incorrect diagnosis and treatment. Recently, the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies has been described in more than 25% of the patients, making this criterion debatable. Moreover, it is worth noting that SAT cases occurring without pain are increasingly being described. In such cases, the basic diagnostic criterion is not met, which raises questions about the current diagnostic criteria.

### Suppurative thyroiditis: Systematic review and clinical guidance [^113bqLDk]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Low credibility.

Acute suppurative thyroiditis (AST) is a rare but potentially fatal condition which can initially be difficult to distinguish from the more common subacute thyroiditis (SAT). We aim to update understanding of this medical emergency.

- **Objective**: Acute suppurative thyroiditis (AST) is a rare but potentially fatal condition which can initially be difficult to distinguish from the more common subacute thyroiditis (SAT). We aim to update understanding of this medical emergency.

- **Design**: A systematic review over the past 20 years was performed on the epidemiology, clinical features, investigations, management, and outcomes of AST. All full-text cases of microscopy or culture-proven AST in the English literature were included.

- **Results**: 200 cases of AST have been described in 148 articles from January 2000 to January 2020. Bacterial AST is most common, often presenting with neck pain (89%) and fever (82%). Immunosuppression and pyriform sinus fistula are the most common causes, most often due to gram-positive aerobes. Transient hyperthyroidism is common (42%). Aspiration and antibiotics are becoming a more common treatment. Overall mortality was 7.8%. Tuberculous and fungal AST are less likely to present with fever and neck pain. Fungal AST is more common in immunosuppressed individuals (31%) and has a high overall mortality (33%). Tuberculous AST is more common in TB endemic areas.

- **Conclusion**: The symptoms and signs of AST commonly overlap with SAT and initially can be hard to diagnose. AST can be rapidly morbid or even fatal. Clinicians need to consider AST when they assess patients with thyroiditis who are systemically unwell, have high fever, high white cell count and C-reactive protein, tender neck, and abnormal neck imaging. An investigative and treatment strategy is described based on a systematic review.

### Serum selenium levels and subacute thyroiditis: Associations with disease course and long-term outcomes in a case-control study [^114X232G]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is an inflammatory disease that can cause thyrotoxicosis. Although viral infections and genetic predispositions are thought to be the main causes of subacute thyroiditis, its etiology remains unclear. The most common symptoms include neck pain, tenderness, palpitations, tremors, fever, and weakness. Although disease severity varies among individuals, SAT is generally a self-limiting condition. However, delayed remission, recurrence, and permanent hypothyroidism can sometimes occur during the disease course. Studies have evaluated these conditions and their course, but no clear cause has been identified.

Selenium is found in higher concentrations in the thyroid gland than in other organs, and blood levels have been shown to correlate with this concentration. It is a cofactor for about 25 selenoproteins, including glutathione peroxidase, iodotyrosine deiodinase, and thioredoxin reductase, and plays an important role in thyroid physiology. It is also found in the structures of many selenoproteins that regulate the inflammatory response and have antioxidant activity. Multiple studies have indicated that reduced serum selenium levels correlate with an increased prevalence and severity of autoimmune thyroid diseases. However, studies on serum selenium levels in patients with subacute thyroiditis are limited. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate serum selenium levels in patients with SAT compared to healthy controls and to investigate potential correlations between selenium status and clinical outcomes.

### Thyroid computed tomography imaging: Pictorial review of variable pathologies [^111WeT9J]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Inflammatory thyroid disorders include acute infectious thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis, and granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain's). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma. The CT scan findings of thyroiditis are nonspecific and variable (Figs. 14, 15 and 16). The thyroid gland has a very high iodine concentration, resulting in high CT attenuation (80–100 Hounsfield Units). The presence of thyroiditis can be suggested by a diffusely enlarged and hypo-attenuating (around 45 Hounsfield Units) thyroid gland. This is probably due to follicular cell destruction and reduced thyroid iodine concentration. Marked homogenous enhancement is typically expected; therefore, moderate thyroid enhancement in a case of thyroiditis suggests a diffuse inflammatory process. It is essential to clinically correlate this with a thyroid function test and serum autoantibody levels.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^114EH3TJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Symptoms of thyroid amyloidosis may be similar to SAT, with painful goitre, high ESR, low RAIU and good response to glucocorticoids. There are, however, other features of systemic amyloidosis, which exclude an SAT diagnosis. Ikenoue et al. reported two men with SAT-like symptoms, including tender diffused firm goitres, low RAIU, very high ESR, and rapid response to glucocorticoids. Both patients had a history of diarrhea and abdominal pain, and both were undernourished. In both cases, the initial diagnosis was SAT, as FNAB was not performed at that time. Because of the persistence of goitre after pain remission, repeated recurrence of symptoms with always the same thyroid localization, and presence of gastrointestinal and later renal abnormalities, a thyroid biopsy was performed, revealing amyloid deposition. It should always be remembered that the differential diagnosis of symptoms suggestive of SAT should also include amyloidosis.

### Subacute thyroiditis presenting as simple acute headache was misdiagnosed as meningitis: case report and literature review [^114Utk9Z]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

The relationship between headache and thyrotoxicosis has been occasionally mentioned in case reports, but there are few related reports, making it challenging to determine a definitive relationship. Few cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) presenting as a simple headache have been reported.

- **Case presentation**: This case report describes a middle-aged male patient who arrived at our hospital with an acute headache that persisted for 10 days. Initially, he was misdiagnosed with meningitis due to symptoms of a headache, fever, and elevated C-reactive protein levels. Routine antibacterial and antiviral therapy did not alleviate his symptoms. Blood tests indicated thyrotoxicosis, and a color ultrasound suggested SAT sonography. Consequently, he was diagnosed with SAT, and with the treatment for SAT, his headache was relieved following the improvement of thyrotoxicosis.

- **Conclusion**: This patient represents the first detailed report of SAT presenting primarily with a simple headache. This information is valuable for clinicians in differentiating and diagnosing atypical cases of SAT.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^115tou2c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old woman with no history of thyroid disease visited our outpatient endocrine clinic on July 27, 2012. Two weeks prior, she had developed symptoms of pain in the left neck and fatigue. Physical examination revealed a focal nodule of the left thyroid lobe that had a diameter of approximately 1.5 cm, without local redness or lymph node enlargement, which was painful and tender upon examination. There was no fever or signs of hyperthyroidism such as tachycardia, insomnia, or tremors. The patient's thyroid function tests were normal (thyroid stimulating hormone = 1.25 mU/L, normal range: 0.27–4.2 mU/L; free triiodothyronine = 5.59 pmol/L, normal range: 3.1–6.8 pmol/L; free thyroxine = 18.80 pmol/L, normal range: 12–22 pmol/L) and tests for anti-thyroglobulin (< 10 KIU/L, normal range: 0–115 KIU/L), anti-thyroid peroxidase (10.54 KIU/L, normal range: 0–35 KIU/L), and anti-thyrotropin-receptor antibodies (< 1 U/L, normal range: 0–2 U/L) were negative. The patient's serum thyroglobulin levels were normal (61.32 µg/L, normal range: 1.40–78 µg/L). Her white cell count was 5.2 × 10⁹/L with a normal differential, and her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 20 mm/hour (normal range: 0–38 mm/h).

### Acute suppurative thyroiditis with thyroid abscess in adults: Clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes [^115qpt7F]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 28-year-old woman developed left-sided neck swelling, pain, fever, and tachycardia 10 days ago, three months post-delivery. Initially suspected as subacute thyroiditis at another hospital, her TSH was 0.1 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4–3.5) and free T4 was 21 pmol/L (normal range: 10–22). Thyroglobulin levels were normal. She began treatment with oral prednisolone 25 mg daily and was discharged after two days. However, she returned the following day with a worsening neck lump and breathing difficulties. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the tertiary hospital with the combined diagnosis of epiglottitis and acute thyroiditis.

At admission, she had a non-tender, 50 × 50 mm large lump on the side of her throat with no erythema. Her heart rate was 132 beats per minute, and her temperature was 39.3 °C. Increasing edema of the glottis was noted, and while she could not swallow, she did not have stridor. Intravenous cefuroxime 1.5 g three times daily was initiated. Repeated fibroscope examinations showed progressive edema, leading to intubation. A CT scan revealed a 70 mm large multicystic process in the left thyroid lobe, extending cranially and dorsally, displacing the larynx to the right, indicating a thyroid abscess. The abscess was drained using three drains, and an anaerobic odor was noticed from the extracted pus. Intravenous metronidazole 1000 mg once daily was added for four days. Clinically, she improved and was able to leave the ICU after five days and the hospital after an additional three days. Cultures from the nasopharynx revealed Haemophilus influenzae and from the blood, Pepto streptococci. The abscess also contained further bacterial information.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^117XLkFf]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is based mainly on the presence of painful thyroid goitre and a significant increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Proceeding according to these diagnostic criteria may lead to an incorrect diagnosis and treatment. Extremely dangerous is the situation when the diagnosis of SAT is erroneously made based on criteria other than ultrasound (US) imaging and fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), which leads to a delayed diagnosis of malignant tumours with poor prognosis.

- **Case presentation**: Five patients with typical SAT symptoms are presented. In all of them, anaplastic thyroid cancer or metastatic thyroid tumours were finally diagnosed as the cause of the initial symptoms resembling SAT. Most of the patients were initially misdiagnosed, and the proper diagnosis of malignancy was delayed.

- **Conclusions**: The authors have proposed new diagnostic criteria for SAT and strongly suggest that thyroid gland US should be included in the main criteria of SAT diagnosis, together with an FNAB result excluding the presence of malignant tumours.

### Subacute thyroiditis during early pregnancy: A case report and literature review [^111BW3u7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) in pregnancy is based on the patient's medical history, symptoms, physical and laboratory findings, and exclusion of other causes of thyroid dysfunction. Monitoring changes in thyroid hormone levels may also play an important role in the treatment of SAT.

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: A literature review [^116tQKpj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

In this study, we analyzed 38 cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) after COVID-19. Most patients developed SAT several days or weeks after the onset of COVID-19, although in some cases, SAT onset occurred several months later. In most SAT cases, COVID-19 was mild in severity. The symptoms associated with SAT were similar to those previously reported for typical SAT cases. Although four patients suffered from hypothyroidism post-SAT, none of the patients died from SAT.

We found that the clinical characteristics of SAT following COVID-19 were similar to those of typical SAT. Generally, young female adults are commonly affected by SAT, and the cases in the present study were consistent with this trend. The study also demonstrated that the biological data for SAT post-COVID-19 resembled typical SAT cases. These similarities suggest that SAT associated with COVID-19 may occur via the same pathophysiology as typical SAT, including viral infection, post-inflammatory processes, and autoimmunity. At the time of writing, the incidence rate of SAT after COVID-19 remains unknown. Further epidemiological research is needed to investigate the relationship between SAT and COVID-19.

Our study showed that SAT can develop regardless of the severity of COVID-19. Previous reports have indicated the importance of IL-6 in the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. Direct damage to the thyroid gland was also hypothesized. However, in most SAT patients, the severity of COVID-19 was categorized as mild or moderate. Most patients with SAT were treated with steroids.

### Subacute thyroiditis during early pregnancy: a case report and literature review [^116eCLf2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is rarely diagnosed in pregnant women, with only 7 cases reported at the time of writing. Thyroid dysfunction, especially hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, has been associated with both maternal and neonatal complications. Thus, the early diagnosis and treatment of SAT during pregnancy may be beneficial. We present a case report and literature review to complement the diagnostic evaluation and management of SAT during pregnancy.

- **Case presentation**: A 27-year-old woman presented in gestational week 17 of her first pregnancy with a negative prior medical history. She visited the Endocrinology Department, complaining of neck pain for one month that had intensified in the last five days. Physical examination revealed a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland that was firm and tender on palpation. The patient also had an elevated temperature and heart rate. The increasing and long-lasting pain, coupled with a decreased level of thyroid-stimulating hormone, indicated hyperthyroidism. Ultrasound findings were indicative of SAT. Importantly, the pain was so severe that 10 mg of oral prednisone per day was administered in gestational week 18, which was increased to 15 mg/day after 10 days. This treatment was discontinued in week 28. Levothyroxine was started in gestational week 24 and administered throughout the pregnancy. The patient responded well to the treatments, and her neck pain disappeared in gestational week 21. She gave birth to a healthy male in gestational week 41.

- **Conclusion**: SAT can be diagnosed and effectively managed during pregnancy, thus benefiting both mother and child.

### Risk factors and outcomes of thyroid immune-related adverse events following PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors treatment in a large tertiary Chinese center [^112SW5zd]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Three patients experienced subacute thyroiditis:

- **Patient 1**: A 61-year-old female liver cancer patient developed subacute thyroiditis after 3 months of sintilimab therapy. She presented with a sore throat, fever (up to 40℃), and a palpable, hard, and tender thyroid gland. Initially, she was treated with Chinese medicine; ten days later, clinical and biochemical thyrotoxicosis occurred, accompanied by elevated ESR (> 50 mm/h) and increased CRP, while her TRAb, TgAb, and TPOAb were negative. After 2.7 months, she progressed to hypothyroidism and started taking levothyroxine sodium.

- **Patient 2**: A 64-year-old male liver cancer patient developed subacute thyroiditis after 4 months of tirelizumab treatment. He presented with neck pain, fever (maximum temperature 38.7℃), and thyrotoxicosis, with elevated ESR (> 50 mm/h). TRAb, TgAb, and TPOAb were negative. After 1.7 months, he progressed to hypothyroidism and received levothyroxine sodium treatment.

- **Patient 3**: A 66-year-old male lung cancer patient developed subacute thyroiditis 10 days after initiating tirelizumab therapy. He presented with neck pain and fever, followed by overt thyrotoxicosis 15 days later. Laboratory tests showed elevated ESR (> 50 mm/h) and negative TRAb. After 2 months, he progressed to subclinical hypothyroidism and subsequently received levothyroxine sodium treatment.

Severity of thyroid IrAEs was assessed according to the 2017 National Cancer Institute (NCI) Evaluation Criteria for Time Events of Common Adverse Reactions (CTCAE 5.0). A total of 209 patients (81.3%) developed grade 1 thyroid irAEs after receiving PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.

### Subacute thyroiditis presenting as simple acute headache was misdiagnosed as meningitis: Case report and literature review [^1172D68B]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

SAT usually has a three-stage course lasting about six months. In the first few weeks, as the thyroid follicles are damaged, the stored thyroid hormone is released into the bloodstream, leading to transient thyrotoxicosis. Thyroglobulin is synthesized by thyroid follicular epithelial cells and secreted into the follicular lumen, where thyroid hormone is synthesized on thyroglobulin. When follicles are damaged, thyroglobulin is also released, causing its levels in the blood to rise. After the inflammation subsides, the disease enters the hypothyroidism stage, lasting for three months or more before returning to normal function. TPOAb and TGAb tests are required to exclude Hashimoto's thyroiditis in the diagnosis of SAT, and TRAb levels need to be determined to differentiate Graves' disease as they differ in treatment.

SAT usually presents with thyroid pain as the chief complaint, but this was not present in our case, which presented as a simple headache. The pain of subacute thyroiditis is mainly caused by inflammation. The stimulation of inflammatory factors, exudation of tissue fluid, and elevation of basal metabolic rate can lead to thyroid tenderness. Neck pain may not be present in certain types of thyroiditis, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis, both of which are associated with autoimmunity. Hashimoto's thyroiditis usually contains TPOAb and TGAb, and diffuse thyroid lesions can be seen in thyroid color ultrasound. Long-term development can lead to hypothyroidism, which is not consistent with our case.

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: A literature review [^111zKxmD]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has devastated the world since its emergence in 2019. Although the leading cause of death associated with COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome, other complications associated with COVID-19 have been reported, including acute kidney injury, pulmonary embolism, acute myocarditis, and septic shock.

Currently, subacute thyroiditis (SAT), potentially invoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been reported as a possible complication associated with COVID-19. SAT can be caused by multiple triggers, including viral infection, post-inflammatory processes, and autoimmunity. Patients with SAT exhibit fever, neck pain, and a tender diffuse goiter as well as abnormalities in serum thyroid hormones. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of SAT after COVID-19 remain incompletely defined.

In the present study, we gathered information on SAT after COVID-19 from case reports available in digital databases and described its clinical practice patterns, clinical symptoms, and outcomes. We aimed to examine the collected data on SAT after COVID-19 to further understand the relationship between SAT and COVID-19.

### Acute suppurative thyroiditis with thyroid abscess in adults: Clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes [^111va8vo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Acute suppurative thyroiditis (AST) is an infection in the thyroid gland progressing to an abscess, representing a serious, rare, and potentially fatal condition. Due to the encasement of the gland, its rich blood supply, high iodine content, and good lymphatic drainage, the thyroid is relatively resistant to most infections. AST comprises less than 1% of thyroid diseases. In children, this condition often results from local congenital anatomic defects, such as third or fourth branchial arch anomalies or a piriform sinus fistula. Only 8% of AST occurs in adults.

Hashimoto's disease, large goiters, or thyroid cancer could predispose individuals to AST. However, AST could also arise through hematogenous or lymphatic spread, or from iatrogenic infections following fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA). Various pathogens have been implicated in AST, primarily Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci species, but also tuberculosis (sometimes in conjunction with HIV), brucellosis, candida, salmonella, and anaerobes like Escherichia coli and Klebsiella. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Hodgkin lymphoma, and other immunocompromised conditions may be more vulnerable.

Clinically, patients with AST present with fever, neck pain, sore throat (which can be painful during swallowing), dysphagia, increased C-reactive protein (CRP), measurable thyroglobulin, and positive cultures from drainage or blood. However, neither elevated CRP nor increased thyroglobulin are diagnostic. The latter is helpful in identifying the thyroid as a site of inflammation or infection but is not a specific marker for AST. Differential diagnoses include subacute or chronic thyroiditis.

### Covid-19 vaccine-associated subacute thyroiditis: an unusual suspect for de Quervain's thyroiditis [^112bRReY]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis following vaccination is an uncommon presentation of thyrotoxicosis. As the world undertakes its largest immunization campaign at the time of writing in an attempt to protect the population from COVID-19 infections, an increasing number of rare post-vaccine side effects are being observed. We report a case of a middle-aged woman who presented with painful thyroid swelling following the second dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), with clinical, biochemical, and imaging features consistent with destructive thyrotoxicosis. Symptomatic management only was required for the self-limiting episode. Thyroiditis typically has a mild and self-limiting course and thus this observation should not deter people from vaccination, as COVID-19 infection has a far greater morbidity and mortality risk than thyroiditis.

### Covid-19-related thyroiditis: A novel disease entity [^1119eUJR]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Low credibility.

The literature on Covid-19-related thyroid complications has accumulated over the past year as the pandemic has intensified worldwide. In particular, several recent case reports have been published, describing a possible correlation between Covid-19 and subacute thyroiditis (SAT). In this review, we briefly present one of our own patients and examine the published literature in this area up to January 2021. This includes analyses of major series of thyroid function tests in patients with significant Covid-19 infection. We conclude that while the majority of patients with severe Covid-19 infection may exhibit manifestations of sick euthyroid syndrome, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SAT, especially in the early weeks and months following even mild Covid-19 infection.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^111irKdK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

A 73-year-old woman presented with a history of an enlarging tender thyroid gland. Several weeks earlier, in the outpatient clinic, she had laboratory features of hyperthyroidism, and treatment with methimazole (MMI) was started. Although subacute thyroiditis (SAT) was suspected due to the typical symptoms and laboratory results, no glucocorticoid or NSAID therapy was introduced. An ultrasound examination was not performed.

On admission to our department, she had a hard, slightly tender nodular goitre in the neck. Her ESR was 39 mm/h, and the TSH level was 8.4 mIU/L on 10 mg of MMI daily. Other laboratory results obtained in our department are not detailed here. Ultrasound and CT revealed a large nodular goitre with two heterogeneous nodules in the left lobe and one large cyst in the right lobe. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) revealed numerous epithelial cells with marked anisocytosis, anisokaryosis, and macronucleosis, dispersed in groups and lobes, along with necrotic tissue. The description corresponds to anaplastic thyroid cancer. Pathological lymph nodes were present in the CT image.

The patient was referred to a surgery clinic for palliative surgery. Total thyroidectomy was impossible to perform due to the extent of infiltration of adjacent structures. Unfortunately, detailed data regarding the surgical procedure are unavailable. The patient died a few months later. In this case, the proper diagnosis was significantly delayed by the incorrect initial diagnosis.

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: A literature review [^111p6s1B]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

Currently, several reports have suggested an underlying relationship between the thyroid and COVID-19. Expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor was detected in the thyroid, leading to a hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the thyroid tissue. This may arise because the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and cellular protease TMPRSS2 are the SARS-CoV-2 entry requirements for infection. Some researchers mentioned the anatomical location of the thyroid, being near the front of the airway and lying against and around the front of the larynx and trachea. Specifically, this anatomical location can provide an easy entry point for the virus.

- **Strengths and limitations**: The strength of our study is the relatively large number of cases compared with previous studies because we accumulated cases until the end of December 2021. In addition, the WHO staging was applied. Our study showed that SAT can occur regardless of the severity of COVID-19, thus alerting physicians that SAT can develop under COVID-19 therapy.

	- The present study has some limitations. First, the number of cases collected was too small to reach a conclusion on the relationship between SAT and COVID-19. Second, the descriptive quality of the case reports was heterogeneous, which made it difficult to review the reports comprehensively. Because the effect of publication bias was strong and statistical analysis will result in low generalizability, we refrained from conducting statistical analyses. Third, publication bias could be inevitable in this research.

### Subacute thyroiditis and thyroid inflammatory nodule secondary to COVID-19: A primary care case report [^1121B2A5]. Family Practice (2022). Low credibility.

To describe a case of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) secondary to COVID-19 in primary health care.

- **Case description**: A 51-year-old woman was treated in a primary health care (PHC) facility for flu-like symptoms for 5 days and pain in the lower neck. Symptomatic drugs were prescribed, and the patient was tested for COVID-19. On reassessment, the patient presented a painful oedema on the thyroid gland, dysphagia, and improvement in flu-like symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories were prescribed, and thyroid function analysis and inflammatory markers were collected. Reassessment after 1 week showed positive polymerase chain reaction rapid test for COVID-19, partial improvement of neck pain, alterations in thyroid hormone tests (suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone and slightly elevated T4), and elevated C-reactive protein. Thyroid gland ultrasonography (USG), anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies were requested, and prednisone was prescribed. Anti-thyroglobulin and anti-TPO antibodies were negative; thyroid USG showed a solid nodule in the left lobe (approximately 4 cm), classified as TIRADS-4. The patient was sent to the Endocrinology Service, and a thyroid fine needle aspiration was requested. USG prior to the examination evidenced a complete regression of the nodule, which was diagnosed as an inflammatory pseudo-nodule.

- **Conclusion**: We presented the case of a patient who was treated in a PHC facility for rare findings of SAT secondary to mild COVID-19, concomitant with a thyroid nodule that had complete remission after approximately 3 months.

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: A literature review [^111rFbYX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

All reports for the 38 cases described symptoms of subacute thyroiditis (SAT). The most frequent SAT symptom was neck pain, reported in 27 cases, followed by fever, which was noted in 22 cases. Among the 25 cases with information on the duration between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and the onset of SAT symptoms, the shortest duration was a simultaneous occurrence (0 days), and the longest duration was 4 months. In most cases, patients developed SAT several days or weeks after the onset of COVID-19.

The thyroid state was documented for 22 cases, with an enlarged thyroid being the most common observation (11 cases), followed by tenderness (nine cases). In 37 patients, thyrotoxicosis was identified through the detection of free T4, free T3, or thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. One article lacked specific serum levels of thyroid hormones, but the text stated, "Thyroid function tests were consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism", which led us to conclude the patient experienced SAT. Thyroglobulin, thyroglobulin antibody, antithyroid peroxidase antibody, and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody states were mentioned in 27 cases.

Biological examinations results for 35 cases showed that 31 had increased C-reactive protein levels, and 30 had confirmed elevations in erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Interleukin-6 was measured in only one case and was found to be elevated. Ultrasound analysis of the thyroid was conducted in 14 cases, revealing hypoechoic areas in an enlarged thyroid in most cases. These findings were consistent with subacute thyroiditis.

### Acute suppurative thyroiditis with thyroid abscess in adults: Clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes [^113VPQn9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old woman underwent a fine needle aspiration (FNA) due to a lump in the right side of her thyroid. Brownish fluid was evacuated, and the lump diminished. Her thyroid function tests were normal. Two weeks later, the lump increased in size, prompting her visit to the Emergency Department. She reported pain during swallowing, difficulty in eating, and experienced dyspnea when lying down. Her fever fluctuated up to 39 °C. A hard and tender lump, measuring 2 × 4 cm, was palpated on the right side of the thyroid. Her C-reactive protein (CRP) was 87 mg/L (normal < 3), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 26 mm/hr (normal < 20), and leukocyte count 12.9 × 10⁹/L (normal 3.5–8.8). A new FNA with deep culture was performed, from which 10 mL of brownish fluid was drained. Intravenous cefuroxime 1.5 g was administered three times daily. A CT scan of the neck revealed a 30x27x34 mm mass in the right thyroid lobe. Cultures from blood and thyroid tissue were all negative.

After three days, her local symptoms had significantly improved, CRP decreased to 42 mg/L, and ESR was 29 mm/hr. Antibiotics were switched to oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 800/160 mg twice daily for another week, resulting in the subsidence of all symptoms. The admission lasted four days. Six months later, she revisited the Emergency Department with thyroid gland symptoms, but a thyroid ultrasound only showed a 14 × 8 mm cyst. She remained euthyroid and well four years after the initial presentation.

### Hla typing of patients who developed subacute thyroiditis and Graves' disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: A case report [^11486f7q]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination have been reported. A human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele, HLA-B✱35, appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of SAT.

- **Case presentation**: We conducted HLA typing of one patient with SAT and another with both SAT and Graves' disease (GD), which developed after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Patient 1 is a 58-year-old Japanese man who was inoculated with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BNT162b2; Pfizer, New York, NY, USA). He developed fever (38 °C), cervical pain, palpitations, and fatigue on day 10 after vaccination. Blood chemistry tests revealed thyrotoxicosis, elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and slightly increased serum antithyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb) levels. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed the characteristic findings of SAT.

Patient 2 is a 36-year-old Japanese woman inoculated twice with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (mRNA-1273; Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA). She developed fever (37.8 °C) and thyroid gland pain on day 3 after the second vaccination. Blood chemistry tests revealed thyrotoxicosis, elevated serum CRP, TSAb, and antithyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody levels. Despite treatment, fever and thyroid gland pain persisted. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed the characteristic findings of SAT, such as slight swelling and a focal hypoechoic area with decreased blood flow. Prednisolone treatment was effective for SAT. However, thyrotoxicosis causing palpitations relapsed, for which thyroid scintigraphy with 99m technetium pertechnetate was conducted.

### Painless thyroiditis incidentally diagnosed following SARS-CoV-2 infection [^116g76vq]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

There have been many reports of autoimmune thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, painless thyroiditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection is less commonly reported than Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. One possible explanation is that painless thyroiditis may be overlooked because of its mild symptoms. Our patient and a previously reported case were asymptomatic, with diagnoses occurring incidentally during blood tests.

Although the causal association between COVID-19 and autoimmune thyroiditis is uncertain, physicians should consider the possibility of autoimmune thyroiditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be sought while taking the patient's medical history.

Even though several reports have explored COVID-19 and thyroid disease, their pathogeneses remain poorly understood, necessitating further research.

- **Patient's perspective**: I was surprised when I was told that my thyroid hormone levels were abnormal during a blood test while I was hospitalized. I am thankful that the operation was successful.

- **Learning points**
- Although the causal relationship is uncertain, autoimmune thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported.
- Painless thyroiditis may be overlooked due to its mild presentation of symptoms.
- When seeing a patient with autoimmune thyroiditis, previous instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be ascertained while taking their medical history.

### Thyroiditis [^111njwau]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Thyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid gland that may be painful and tender when caused by infection, radiation, or trauma, or painless when caused by autoimmune conditions, medications, or an idiopathic fibrotic process. The most common forms are Hashimoto's disease, subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis, subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis, and drug-induced thyroiditis (caused by amiodarone, interferon-alfa, interleukin-2, or lithium). Patients may have euthyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or hypothyroidism, or may evolve from one condition to another over time. Diagnosis is based on clinical context and findings, including the presence or absence of pain, tenderness, and autoantibodies. Additionally, the degree of radioactive iodine uptake by the gland is reduced in most patients with viral, radiation-induced, traumatic, autoimmune, or drug-induced inflammation of the thyroid. Treatment primarily focuses on symptomatic relief of thyroid pain and tenderness, if present, and restoration of euthyroidism.

### Imaging "thyroiditis": A primer for radiologists [^1168Csdg]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

A variety of inflammatory disorders, generically classified as "thyroiditis", can affect the thyroid gland diffusely, generating distinctive radiographic patterns. While a precise diagnosis can seldom be made based on sonographic appearance alone, interpreting these patterns in the correct clinical and biochemical context will help support the most appropriate diagnosis. We believe that the generic term "thyroiditis" is often not helpful and may often be incorrect. Therefore, it is important for radiologists to understand the sonographic and functional correlations to provide the most appropriate differential diagnosis in their reports. This brief review is designed to provide information and guidance for radiologists when dealing with various thyroid disorders that cause diffuse changes in the thyroid and highlight the pitfalls most often encountered in clinical practice.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^116GgiCq]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis is readily considered when patients present with a particular set of typical clinical characteristics. Subacute thyroiditis sometimes presents as a solitary cold nodule; however, the presence of a hot nodule in patients with subacute thyroiditis is exceedingly rare.

- **Case presentation**: Here, the case of a 57-year-old woman complaining of pain in the left neck and fatigue for two weeks is presented. Physical examination revealed a painful and tender nodule with a diameter of approximately 1.5 cm in the left neck, although all laboratory tests, including white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), thyroid function, and thyroglobulin levels, were normal. A neck ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic mass (1.5×0.8 cm) in the left thyroid, and thyroid scintigraphy of the left thyroid with Technetium-99 m (99 m-Tc) demonstrated a focal accumulation of radiotracer. Furthermore, fine-needle aspiration biopsy from the nodule revealed the presence of multinuclear giant cells. The patient was well; there was no cervical mass detected upon palpation following two months of prednisone treatment, and follow-up ultrasound screening and scintigraphy demonstrated the disappearance of the nodule.

- **Conclusion**: This case, presenting with a localized painful hot nodule, normal thyroid function, normal ESR, and normal serum thyroglobulin levels, is a rare case of subacute thyroiditis, which should be considered during differential diagnosis.

### Establishing a diagnostic scale of subacute thyroiditis without radioisotope scanning [^113ZHsYN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have indicated that the etiology of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is related to viral infections, such as those caused by coxsackievirus, echovirus, mumps, measles, influenza, and other viruses, due to the presence of a flu-like syndrome before the onset of the disease. In our study, only 14.44% of patients had an upper respiratory infection before SAT, possibly due to patients' blurry memory and inapparent infections.

Espinoza et al. compared the diagnostic value of radioactive iodine uptake, 99m-Tc thyroid static imaging, and thyroid ultrasonography. They found that radioisotope scanning had a better correlation with the clinical diagnosis of SAT than with thyroid ultrasonography. In our study, we utilized 99m-Tc thyroid static imaging to evaluate thyroid uptake function instead of radioactive iodine uptake, as the latter requires more time (24 hours) and is more complicated to perform.

As reported by Frates et al, the typical sonographic appearance of SAT is a patchy, poorly defined hypoechoic process that can affect a portion of one or both lobes, an entire lobe, or the entire gland. However, they also noted that the sonographic findings of SAT could mimic a large nodule replacing the lobe, lymphocytic changes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyroid carcinoma, or thyroid lymphoma, complicating the differential diagnosis. Additionally, sonography is a relatively subjective examination that requires experienced doctors to obtain analyzable results. Therefore, we excluded sonography as a variable from our model.

Fever is another clinical presentation of SAT.

### Painless thyroiditis incidentally diagnosed following SARS-CoV-2 infection [^1178Vu9G]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Thyroid ultrasonography showed a slightly heterogeneous, enlarged thyroid gland with an estimated thyroid volume of 26.8 mL and normal Doppler flow. The thyroid gland was slightly enlarged compared to the initial examination, as evidenced in figures 3 and 4. The nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid gland and parathyroid gland enlargement had not changed since the initial examination. Her 20-minute technetium-99m thyroid scintigraphy uptake was 0.63%, which falls within the low normal uptake range of 0.5–3.0%.

Figures:

- **Figure 3**: Ultrasound examination on admission shows a slightly enlarged thyroid gland compared to the initial examination.
- **Figure 4**: Thyroid ultrasonography on admission reveals a slightly heterogeneous, enlarged thyroid gland with normal Doppler flow.
- **Figure 5**: The 20-minute technetium-99m thyroid scintigraphy uptake is 0.63%, which is within the low normal range.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumors of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: Case reports and a review of the literature [^114aUeLL]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the largest group of patients with thyroid anaplastic cancers mimicking SAT, described so far.

The problem of distinguishing the causes of painful goitre with accompanying other features of SAT is scarcely discussed in the literature. Meier and Nagle reported on 49-year-old men with severe pain in the enlarged left thyroid lobe, which was firm and tender. Lab results revealed an ERS of 50 mm/h and features of thyrotoxicosis. The diagnosis of SAT was made, and the patient was treated with prednisone in high doses with initial clinical improvement. However, after 10 days, his pain worsened, and FNAB was performed, revealing purulent material. The large painful abscess appeared to arise from an extension of laryngeal carcinoma. This case, as well as our Patient No. 2 presented above, are important examples that thyroid abscess in an adult should always trigger diagnostic alertness, as it is often the first symptom of an advanced cancer disease. It should also be emphasized that neck abscess is extremely difficult to distinguish from SAT based only on clinical symptoms and ESR; thus, US is mandatory in all cases.

### A rare case of subacute thyroiditis causing thyroid storm [^117YTUwU]. Thyroid (2007). Low credibility.

Thyroid storm is a rare but potentially fatal condition that is most frequently associated with Graves' disease. We present the case of a young woman who presented in thyroid storm, later diagnosed as being due to severe subacute thyroiditis. We discuss the diagnostic approach to thyroid storm, the initial management, and eventual treatment and course of subacute thyroiditis. This case illustrates the necessity to include subacute thyroiditis in the differential diagnosis of severe thyrotoxicosis and thyroid storm.

### Thyroiditis: an integrated approach [^115Szv29]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroiditis is a general term that encompasses several clinical disorders characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most common form is Hashimoto thyroiditis. Patients typically present with a nontender goiter, hypothyroidism, and an elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody level. Treatment with levothyroxine ameliorates the hypothyroidism and may reduce goiter size.

Postpartum thyroiditis is transient or persistent thyroid dysfunction that occurs within one year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion. The release of preformed thyroid hormone into the bloodstream may result in hyperthyroidism. This may be followed by transient or permanent hypothyroidism due to the depletion of thyroid hormone stores and destruction of thyroid hormone-producing cells. Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function. Beta blockers can treat symptoms in the initial hyperthyroid phase. In the subsequent hypothyroid phase, levothyroxine should be considered in women with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 mIU per L, or in women with a level of 4 to 10 mIU per L who are symptomatic or desire fertility.

Subacute thyroiditis is a transient thyrotoxic state characterized by anterior neck pain, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, and low radioactive iodine uptake on thyroid scanning. Many cases of subacute thyroiditis follow an upper respiratory viral illness, which is thought to trigger an inflammatory destruction of thyroid follicles. In most cases, the thyroid gland spontaneously resumes normal thyroid hormone production.

### Sweet's syndrome associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^114MGYny]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Sweet's syndrome, or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is characterized by the abrupt onset of painful erythematous plaques or nodules, pyrexia (> 38°F), and histopathologic evidence of a dense neutrophilic infiltrate without vasculitis. It has been reported in association with many diseases; however, its association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is rare.

A 47-year-old Filipino woman with a 30-year history of an asymptomatic anterior neck mass developed painful, erythematous annular plaques on her arms accompanied by fever. A skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome. The anterior neck mass was confirmed to be Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This presents a rare association, with only two reported cases in the literature. At the time of writing, there are no published cases in the Philippines on Sweet's syndrome and Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^114ffwvJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

A 45-year-old man, who is a long-time tobacco smoker, presented with a two-week history of marked thyroid pain and swelling. He also reported fever (up to 39 °C), weight loss, and hoarseness. The patient's general practitioner (GP) initially diagnosed subacute thyroiditis (SAT) based on the pain, fever, and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and started treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with initial pain relief. However, following a few days, severe pain relapsed despite treatment, and the patient was referred to the hospital.

In our department, his ESR was 93 mm/h, and biochemical features of thyrotoxicosis were present, which may indeed strongly suggest SAT. In the neck, there was a hard, painful tumour, about 7 cm in size.

- **Laboratory results**: The laboratory results obtained in our department are presented in Table 1. An ultrasound (US) revealed a slightly enlarged right thyroid lobe and a significantly enlarged left lobe (65 × 57 × 101 mm), dominated by a heterogeneous tumour sized 55 × 50 × 72 mm, with numerous calcifications and a heterogeneous fluid space corresponding to an abscess. Tumour vascularisation was reduced.

- **Imaging and findings**: Almost the entire left lobe showed a faded structure of the parenchyma, with no evidently visible capsule and features of infiltration of the neck structures. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) confirmed the presence of the abscess, and after the introduction of antibiotic therapy, the concentration of free thyroxine (FT4) gradually normalized. In the remaining FNAB material, only blood and numerous granulocytes and macrophages were described.

- **CT imaging**: Neck computed tomography (CT) revealed a large tumour of the thyroid, with visible compression and displacement of the trachea and infiltration of the surrounding structures. In chest CT, in both lungs…

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: A literature review [^113CVXt3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), potentially caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, has been reported as a complication of COVID-19 since 2020. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of SAT after COVID-19 remain incompletely defined. Therefore, we aimed to collect and survey case reports of SAT after COVID-19. We performed a systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The keywords and MeSH terms used for the searches were "subacute thyroiditis" and "COVID-19".

A total of 38 patients from 26 case reports, case series, and letters on SAT associated with COVID-19 were included and analyzed. The most frequent SAT symptom was neck pain (27 cases), followed by fever (22 cases). Of the 25 cases with information on the duration between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and the onset of SAT symptoms, the shortest was simultaneous occurrence, and the longest was 4 months. In most cases, patients developed SAT several days or weeks after the onset of COVID-19. All patients with SAT recovered with no severe complications or sequelae.

Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SAT development in patients with neck pain and fever following COVID-19. Further research is necessary to determine the relationship between SAT and COVID-19.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^116iwSSk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Several cancers metastasize to the thyroid. Based on recent literature, the most common malignancies that metastasize to the thyroid gland are renal cell carcinoma (48.1%), colorectal cancer (10.4%), lung cancer (8.3%), breast carcinoma (7.8%), and sarcoma (4.0%). Metastases to the thyroid are more common in women than in men, with a female to male ratio of 1.4.

In most cases, the diagnosis of primary cancer occurs many months before the diagnosis of thyroid metastases. In about 20% of cases, the diagnosis of the primary tumor and its metastases to the thyroid are synchronous. In very rare cases, such as in our Patient No. 1, metastasis is the first symptom of advanced cancer. Patient No. 1 reported symptoms highly suggestive of subacute thyroiditis (SAT), which resulted in a 3-week delay in diagnosis. In the case of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastases, even the slightest delay in diagnosis is associated with a dramatic deterioration of prognosis and shortening of survival. The thyroid is an extremely rare site for NSCLC metastases. The most common sites are the brain, bone, liver, adrenal glands, contralateral lung, and distant lymph nodes. Other sites are defined as uncommon as they account for less than 5% of all metastases. Niu et al. reported that NSCLC thyroid metastases account for only 0.07% of all metastases of this cancer. Our Patient No. 1 is one of very few cases reported so far. A similar case was described only by Boukir et al, who reported a 51-year-old woman with a hard, well-defined, painful swelling in the left lobe, which was also found to be an NSCLC metastasis.

### Fever and neck pain in an adolescent: A case report [^112Nq7yC]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Evidence has emerged that SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the thyroid, resulting in hormonal dysregulation. The pathophysiology behind this phenomenon remains under investigation. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 to invade host cells. Expression of both is high in the thyroid, which makes it a feasible target for the virus. However, studies have not detected SARS-CoV-2 within thyroid tissue. TSH is inversely correlated with interleukin 6, CRP, ESR, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, suggesting that the cytokine storm induced by infection may also be responsible for thyroid dysfunction. Finally, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis has been proposed, largely due to evidence that SARS-CoV-1 affects hypothalamic neurons.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a variety of thyroid derangements. The first large descriptive study, the THYRCOV study, examined thyroid function in 287 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at a single center. Thyrotoxicosis was found in 20.2% of patients, and hypothyroidism was found in 5.2%. Smaller reviews have described SAT, Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and hypothyroidism.

- **Non-thyroidal illness syndrome**: This is the most commonly recognized thyroid abnormality in patients with COVID-19, presenting with low T3, low TSH, and low/normal FT4. The degree of reduction in T3 and TSH has been associated with a higher severity of illness.

### Subacute thyroiditis presenting as simple acute headache was misdiagnosed as meningitis: Case report and literature review [^1133FEJM]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

The relationship between headache and thyrotoxicosis has been occasionally mentioned in case reports; however, there are few related reports, making it difficult to determine the relationship conclusively. Few cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) presenting as simple headache have been reported.

- **Case presentation**: This case report describes a middle-aged male patient who came to our hospital with an acute headache lasting 10 days. Initially, he was misdiagnosed with meningitis due to symptoms of headache, fever, and increased C-reactive protein. Routine antibacterial and antiviral therapy did not improve his symptoms. Blood tests suggested thyrotoxicosis, and color ultrasound indicated SAT sonography. He was diagnosed with SAT. With the treatment of SAT, the headache was relieved following the improvement of thyrotoxicosis.

- **Conclusion**: This patient represents the first detailed report of SAT presenting with a simple headache, which is helpful for clinicians in differentiating and diagnosing atypical SAT.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^1154iuQB]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Typical symptoms of subacute thyroiditis include neck pain and thyroid tenderness, accompanied by a significantly elevated ESR. Pain may affect the entire thyroid or only one lobe, and the pain's location can change over time. The affected part of the thyroid gland is usually enlarged and hard in consistency. The inflammation causes the destruction of thyroid follicles and the release of thyroid hormones into the blood, resulting in elevated levels of free thyroid hormones and a reduction in TSH levels. Follicular cell damage impairs iodine transport, so RAIU is low in the affected parts of the thyroid.

However, other aetiologies of painful goitre exist, including primary fast-growing thyroid neoplasms or thyroid metastases. Rapid enlargement of the thyroid causes painful stretching of the gland capsule. Very aggressive tumours quickly infiltrate surrounding tissues, including neck muscles, causing pain with the same radiation as in SAT. These tumours, similar to the inflammation in SAT, are hard in consistency. Rapidly growing primary thyroid carcinomas, particularly very poorly prognostic anaplastic cancer, are characterized by a fulminant course, where a delayed diagnosis of even a week or two can dramatically reduce the patient's life expectancy and quality of life. Thyroid metastases can also grow rapidly, stretching the capsule and infiltrating surrounding tissues, resulting in the same neck pain.

### Subacute thyroiditis presenting as simple acute headache was misdiagnosed as meningitis: Case report and literature review [^115Wq16x]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is a self-limiting disease with common clinical manifestations of neck pain spreading to the jaw or ears, accompanied by mild to moderate fever and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis with tenderness upon palpation of the thyroid gland. The etiology of SAT remains unknown, though viral infections such as coxsackie virus, adenovirus, and influenza virus were previously thought to be predisposing factors of SAT. A small number of atypical SAT cases without neck pain or tenderness have been reported in the literature. Thus, attention should be paid to SAT in clinical practice.

Herein, we report a patient with a simple acute headache who did not exhibit typical thyroid pain and was misdiagnosed as meningitis. His headache symptoms were associated with SAT, and his symptoms gradually resolved with SAT treatment. Currently, headache caused by Graves' disease and painless thyroiditis has occasionally been reported, but no detailed cases of headache caused by SAT have been documented.

### Thyroiditis: Evaluation and treatment [^115covMJ]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Thyroiditis is a general term for inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most common forms of thyroiditis encountered by family physicians include Hashimoto, postpartum, and subacute. Most forms of thyroiditis result in a triphasic disease pattern of thyroid dysfunction. Patients will have an initial phase of hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis) attributed to the release of preformed thyroid hormone from damaged thyroid cells, followed by hypothyroidism when the thyroid stores are depleted, and then eventual restoration of normal thyroid function. Some patients may develop permanent hypothyroidism.

Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder that presents with or without signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism, often with a painless goiter, and is associated with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and overt hypothyroidism are generally treated with lifelong thyroid hormone therapy.

Postpartum thyroiditis occurs within one year of delivery, miscarriage, or medical abortion. Subacute thyroiditis is a self-limited inflammatory disease characterized by anterior neck pain. Treatment of subacute thyroiditis should focus on symptoms. In the hyperthyroid phase, beta blockers can treat adrenergic symptoms. In the hypothyroid phase, treatment is generally not necessary but may be used in patients with signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism or permanent hypothyroidism. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids are indicated for the treatment of thyroid pain. Certain drugs, such as amiodarone, may induce thyroiditis.

### Subacute thyroiditis associated with COVID-19 [^113Q2FXR]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

We report a case of a hospitalized patient with COVID-19 who developed subacute thyroiditis in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient presented with tachycardia, anterior neck pain, and thyroid function tests revealing hyperthyroidism, together with consistent ultrasonographic evidence suggesting subacute thyroiditis. Treatment with corticosteroids resulted in rapid clinical resolution. This case illustrates that subacute thyroiditis associated with viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 should be recognized as a complication of COVID-19 and considered a differential diagnosis when infected patients present with tachycardia without evidence of progression of COVID-19 illness.

### Atypical subacute thyroiditis caused by Epstein-Barr virus infection in a three-year-old girl [^115YkMPr]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis is a rare disease in childhood and is considered postviral in origin. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) involvement has been suspected, but it has been demonstrated only once in an adult female. We report a case of subacute thyroiditis during infectious mononucleosis in a 3-year-old girl. The diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis was supported by the presence of EBV DNA in both plasma and leukocytes, in addition to the typical clinical symptoms. Subacute thyroiditis was diagnosed based on elevated thyroid hormone levels with thyrotropin (TSH) suppression, high inflammation markers, and almost absent (99)TC uptake by the thyroid. Moreover, after 3 months from diagnosis, thyroid function returned to normal, as well as the (99)TC uptake.

### Subacute thyroiditis during early pregnancy: A case report and literature review [^1178Ld6q]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

A 27-year-old woman in the 17th week of gestation during her first pregnancy presented to the Endocrinology Department of our hospital, complaining of neck pain for one month that had intensified over the last five days. The neck pain appeared in the 12th week of gestation on the left side without any obvious cause and radiated to the jaw. Initially, it was tolerable, and there were no other symptoms, such as chills, fever, palpitations, tremor, or sweating. The pain gradually shifted to the right side, and the patient requested no medication for her discomfort. By the 17th week of gestation, the patient experienced severe neck pain, which seriously affected her quality of life and sleep, leading her to express a strong willingness to undergo treatment.

The patient had throat pain for three days before pregnancy, which improved without treatment and had no personal or family history of thyroid disease. Her menstrual cycle was regular before pregnancy. She exhibited an axillary temperature of 37.4 °C, an increased resting heart rate of 98 beats/min, and normal blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg in our hospital. Physical examination revealed bilateral enlargement of the thyroid gland that was firm and tender to palpation.

### Subacute thyroiditis during early pregnancy: A case report and literature review [^115vQ676]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is based on the patient's medical history, symptoms, and physical and laboratory findings, along with the exclusion of other causes of hyperthyroidism. Our patient presented with SAT symptoms in the 12th week of gestation, which aligns with previously published case reports of SAT during early pregnancy (sixth to 13th week). It is important to recognize the thyroid dysfunction caused by human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in the first trimester, as HCG levels increase significantly and its structure is homologous to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This leads to a transient rise in free thyroxin (FT4) and suppression of TSH; however, there is no neck pain during normal early pregnancy.

The physical finding of neck pain favors SAT in distinguishing it from other causes of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism during pregnancy. However, some patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyroid cancer, primary thyroid lymphoma, or Graves' disease may also experience neck pain and tenderness of the thyroid gland. Importantly, all of the previously reported seven patients with SAT during pregnancy had neck pain. Pain from SAT can initially be confined to or begin in the lateral gland and then transfer to the contralateral gland. In our case, the patient's neck pain was found to be transferable and consistent with SAT. Additional clinical symptoms, such as fever and fatigue, were also observed.

Hyperthyroidism during SAT in pregnant women, manifested as low TSH and increased T3 and T4, needs to be differentiated from Graves' disease.

### Subacute thyroiditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^116sZiHr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is a thyroid disease of viral or post-viral origin. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly worldwide, critically affecting Italy.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this work is to report the first case of SAT related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

- **Methods**: We describe the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of an 18-year-old woman who presented with fever, neck pain radiating to the jaw, and palpitations occurring 15 days following a SARS-CoV-2-positive oropharyngeal swab. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had been mild, and the patient had completely recovered in a few days.

- **Results**: Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a slightly increased heart rate and a painful, enlarged thyroid on palpation. Laboratory exams showed elevated free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels, undetectable thyrotropin, and elevated inflammatory markers and white blood cell count. Neck ultrasound revealed bilateral and diffuse hypoechoic areas. One month earlier, both thyroid function and imaging were normal. We diagnosed SAT, and the patient started prednisone. Neck pain and fever resolved within 2 days, and the remaining symptoms disappeared within 1 week. Thyroid function and inflammatory markers normalized in 40 days.

- **Conclusions**: We report the first case of SAT following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinicians should be alert to additional and as-yet unreported clinical manifestations associated with COVID-19.

### Serum selenium levels and subacute thyroiditis: Associations with disease course and long-term outcomes in a case-control study [^111teRv5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

This case-control study recruited a total of 59 patients diagnosed with SAT and 50 healthy volunteers from the Endocrinology and Metabolism Outpatient Clinic. The patients ranged in age from 20 to 73 years, with a mean age of 40.41 ± 13.14 years in the control group, and from 30 to 78 years, with a mean age of 44.36 ± 11.01 years in the SAT group. SAT was diagnosed based on the 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines, using medical history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and thyroid ultrasonography results. SAT was suspected in patients presenting with anterior neck pain radiating to the jaw and ears, fever, and tenderness and pain in the thyroid lobe during physical examination. It has long been recognized that no significant differences exist among various pain measurement methods when assessing pain. Given its ease of application, we opted for the numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).

Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytosis, and thyrotoxicosis were accepted as laboratory values consistent with SAT. Focal or diffuse, hypoechoic-heterogeneous areas with reduced vascularity that were painful when probed by ultrasound were considered indicative of SAT. The control group consisted of individuals who underwent a check-up during the same period and had no pathology detected in their test results. Prior to study inclusion, participants were screened for the presence of chronic diseases, previous thyroid diseases, and smoking history.

### Subacute thyroiditis during early pregnancy: a case report and literature review [^112c8p4J]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is rarely diagnosed in pregnant women, and only 7 cases have been reported at the time of writing. Thyroid dysfunction, especially hyperthyroidism, during pregnancy has been associated with both maternal and neonatal complications. Thus, the early diagnosis and treatment of SAT during pregnancy may be beneficial. We present a case report and literature review to complement the diagnostic evaluation and management of SAT during pregnancy.

- **Case presentation**: A 27-year-old woman presented in gestational week 17 of her first pregnancy and had a negative prior medical history. She presented to the Endocrinology Department complaining of neck pain for one month that had intensified in the last five days. Physical examination revealed a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland that was firm and tender on palpation. The patient also had an elevated temperature and heart rate. The increasing and long-lasting pain, coupled with a decreased level of thyroid-stimulating hormone, indicated hyperthyroidism. Ultrasound findings were indicative of SAT. Importantly, the pain was so severe that 10 mg of oral prednisone per day was administered in gestational week 18, which was increased to 15 mg per day after 10 days and was discontinued in week 28. Levothyroxine was started in gestational week 24 and administered throughout the pregnancy. The patient responded well to the treatments, and her neck pain disappeared in gestational week 21. She gave birth to a healthy male in gestational week 41.

- **Conclusion**: SAT can be diagnosed and effectively managed during pregnancy, thus benefiting both mother and child.

### Establishing a diagnostic scale of subacute thyroiditis without radioisotope scanning [^114N55SU]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Diagnostic test results were compared with the former diagnosis (reference test) using 2 by 2 tables:

- **Formula definitions**:
	- Sensitivity = a/(a + c) × 100% = 92.78%
	- Specificity = d/(b + d) × 100% = 98.45%
	- Positive predictive value = a/(a + b) × 100% = 98.82%
	- Negative predictive value = d/(c + d) × 100% = 90.71%
	- False positive rate = b/(b + d) × 100% = 1.55%
	- False negative rate = c/(a + c) × 100% = 7.22%
	- Accuracy = (a + d)/n × 100% = 95.15%

Categories were defined as: a = true positive, b = false positive, c = false negative, d = true negative.

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: A literature review [^1157AC8s]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), potentially caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, has been reported as a complication of COVID-19 since 2020. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of SAT after COVID-19 remain incompletely defined. Therefore, we aimed to collect and survey case reports of SAT after COVID-19. We performed a systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The keywords and MeSH terms used for the searches were "subacute thyroiditis" and "COVID-19". A total of 38 patients from 26 case reports, case series, and letters on SAT associated with COVID-19 were included and analyzed.

The most frequent SAT symptom was neck pain (27 cases), followed by fever (22 cases). Of the 25 cases with information on the duration between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and the onset of SAT symptoms, the shortest was simultaneous occurrence, and the longest was 4 months. In most cases, patients developed SAT several days or weeks after the onset of COVID-19. All patients with SAT recovered with no severe complications or sequelae.

Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SAT development in patients with neck pain and fever following COVID-19. Further research is necessary to determine the relationship between SAT and COVID-19.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^112p7Ykp]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis is readily considered when patients present with a particular set of typical clinical characteristics. Subacute thyroiditis sometimes presents as a solitary cold nodule; however, the presence of a hot nodule in patients with subacute thyroiditis is exceedingly rare.

- **Case presentation**: Here, the case of a 57-year-old woman complaining of pain in the left neck and fatigue for two weeks is presented. Physical examination revealed a painful and tender nodule with a diameter of approximately 1.5 cm in the left neck, although all laboratory tests, including white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), thyroid function, and thyroglobulin levels, were normal. A neck ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic mass (1.5 × 0.8 cm) in the left thyroid, and thyroid scintigraphy of the left thyroid with Technetium-99m (99m-Tc) demonstrated a focal accumulation of radiotracer. Furthermore, fine-needle aspiration biopsy from the nodule revealed the presence of multinuclear giant cells. The patient was well; there was no cervical mass detected upon palpation following two months of prednisone treatment, and follow-up ultrasound screening and scintigraphy demonstrated the disappearance of the nodule.

- **Conclusion**: This case, presenting with a localized painful hot nodule, normal thyroid function, normal ESR, and normal serum thyroglobulin levels, is a rare case of subacute thyroiditis, which should be considered during differential diagnosis.

### Subacute thyroiditis in a single lobe [^112dPWeb]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old woman with no history of thyroid disease reported pain in her neck and a sore throat. On physical examination, the thyroid gland was palpable. Serum T3 and T4 levels were increased, and the thyroid-stimulating hormone level was decreased. Thyroid scintigraphy with Tc-99m pertechnetate revealed nonvisualization of the left lobe of the thyroid. Ultrasonographic examination confirmed the presence of the left thyroid lobe. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy revealed thyroiditis of the left lobe of the thyroid. The patient was started on an anti-inflammatory drug. The follow-up thyroid scan showed a normal thyroid gland.

### HLA typing of patients who developed subacute thyroiditis and Graves' disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: a case report [^112K68Nk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) have been reported following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination. A human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele, HLA-B✱35, appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of SAT.

- **Case presentation**: We conducted HLA typing of one patient with SAT and another with both SAT and Graves' disease (GD), which developed after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Patient 1, a 58-year-old Japanese man, was inoculated with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BNT162b2; Pfizer, New York, NY, USA). He developed fever (38°C), cervical pain, palpitations, and fatigue on day 10 after vaccination. Blood chemistry tests revealed thyrotoxicosis, elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and slightly increased serum antithyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb) levels. Thyroid ultrasonography showed the characteristic findings of SAT. Patient 2, a 36-year-old Japanese woman, was inoculated twice with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (mRNA-1273; Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA). She developed fever (37.8°C) and thyroid gland pain on day 3 after the second vaccination. Blood chemistry tests revealed thyrotoxicosis and elevated serum CRP, TSAb, and antithyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody levels. The fever and thyroid gland pain persisted. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed the characteristic findings of SAT, including slight swelling and a focal hypoechoic area with decreased blood flow. Prednisolone treatment was effective for SAT; however, thyrotoxicosis causing palpitations relapsed. For this, thyroid scintigraphy with 99m technetium pertechnetate was conducted.

### The importance of vitamin D level in subacute thyroiditis disease and the effect of vitamin D on disease prognosis [^114dwEYk]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is an inflammatory thyroid disease that manifests with severe pain. The presence of the vitamin D receptor in immune system cells shows that vitamin D deficiency can trigger inflammatory diseases. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in SAT patients and the relationship between vitamin D level, permanent hypothyroidism, and recurrence rate.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective study, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels of 170 SAT patients and 86 control subjects were compared.

- **Results**: The 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in the SAT patients, and there was no seasonal difference. A negative correlation was determined between the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and 25(OH)D; however, no significant relationship was found between vitamin D level and prognosis.

- **Conclusion**: As a result of this study, it was shown that vitamin D levels in subacute thyroiditis patients were significantly lower than in the healthy control group. Although there is no relationship between vitamin D level and disease prognosis, vitamin D deficiency may increase the rate of respiratory tract infections (especially influenza, coxsackievirus, measles, adenovirus, retroviruses) and eventually SAT development.

### Ct and mr imaging findings associated with subacute thyroiditis [^113oGxBx]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis is an uncommon disease that occurs most often in women in their second to fifth decades of life. This disease usually presents with thyroid tenderness, a low-grade fever, and occasional dysphagia. The disease resolves spontaneously, usually without thyroid function abnormalities. We herein present the CT and MR imaging findings of two cases of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^113GwwCb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis, also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis, giant-cell thyroiditis, or subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, is a spontaneously remitting inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland. It is generally caused by a viral infection and is the most common cause of a painful thyroid. Patients typically have a history of antecedent viral infection and subsequently suffer from neck pain, thyroid tenderness, fever, and fatigue. Upon physical examination, the thyroid is often tender and diffusely enlarged.

In most cases, a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis is self-evident and can be made based on patient history, physical and laboratory findings, and the clinical course of the disease. In some cases, in addition to the clinical course and features, fine needle aspiration cytology, ultrasound, and scintigraphy analyses may support the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. For example, thyroid radioisotope scanning generally demonstrates a low uptake of Technetium-99m (99m-Tc) or 131I.

However, patients with subacute thyroiditis sometimes present with puzzling clinical features that can escape early recognition. Here, a patient with subacute thyroiditis presented with a solitary painful thyroid nodule in the absence of typical laboratory test characteristics that would suggest subacute thyroiditis. The patient's 99m-Tc thyroid scan revealed a hot nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid. To the best of our knowledge, the presence of a hot nodule in a patient with subacute thyroiditis has not been previously documented.
