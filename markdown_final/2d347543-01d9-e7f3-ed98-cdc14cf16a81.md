## Question

What is the screening guideline for negative pap and positive hpv

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the screening guideline for a negative Pap smear with a positive high-risk HPV test result. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and why this result matters. Then, I should verify the risk-based framework and the specific risk thresholds that drive management. Next, I will check how prior screening history modifies risk and changes recommendations. After that, I need to outline the management pathways, including genotyping, reflex cytology, and when to defer colposcopy. Finally, I should confirm special populations, counseling points, and a concise, actionable summary with citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and its significance. A negative cytology (NILM) with a positive high-risk HPV test is a discordant result that reflects transient infection in many women but carries a nontrivial risk of CIN3+ over the next 5 years, approximately 4.5% in large cohort data, which is why guidelines do not recommend routine screening intervals in this situation [^84b5aabd] [^d5a26991].

> I need to ensure I'm applying the correct risk-based framework. The 2019 ASCCP guidelines moved from result-based to risk-based management, using clinical action thresholds anchored to CIN3+ risk: colposcopy at ≥ 4.0% immediate risk, 1-year surveillance for risks between about 0.55% and 4.0% at 5 years, and 3-year return for risks around 0.55% to 0.15%, with 5-year return for risks ≤ 0.15% at 5 years. These thresholds align with risks seen after negative cytology, negative HPV-based screens, and low-grade abnormalities, respectively [^085e226c] [^993dbff5] [^07637efe].

> Hold on, I should verify how prior screening history modifies risk. If the current HPV-positive/NILM result is preceded by a documented negative HPV test or cotest within about 5 years, the immediate CIN3+ risk is roughly halved, often dropping below the 4% colposcopy threshold and supporting 1-year surveillance rather than immediate colposcopy. By contrast, a prior negative cytology alone does not confer the same risk reduction, so management still follows the higher-risk pathway in the absence of a recent negative HPV-based screen [^7b3a4615] [^45835ad7] [^d6150cb9].

> Next, I should review the immediate next steps after an HPV-positive/NILM result. Wait, let me verify the reflex requirements: all positive HPV screens should trigger reflex cytology from the same specimen when feasible, and if genotyping is available, HPV 16/18 positivity warrants direct colposcopy even with NILM cytology because of elevated CIN3+ and occult cancer risk. If genotyping is not available, many programs treat non-16/18 HPV-positive/NILM as a single risk stratum and proceed with 1-year surveillance unless other risk factors elevate concern [^29431eb1] [^98c4a706] [^1503ac56].

> I will now examine the standard management when there is no recent negative HPV-based screen. For HPV-positive/NILM with unknown or no recent negative HPV-based screen, the immediate CIN3+ risk is about 2.1%, which sits in the 1-year surveillance band. Thus, the recommendation is repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year, with colposcopy if HPV remains positive or if cytology becomes abnormal at that follow-up visit [^d34eca65] [^6d352328] [^1503ac56].

> But wait, what if HPV 16 or 18 is detected. I should confirm that this changes management. HPV 16/18 positivity with NILM carries a higher immediate CIN3+ risk and a stronger association with occult disease, so direct colposcopy is recommended even when cytology is normal, and endocervical sampling should be considered given HPV 18's link to adenocarcinoma [^29431eb1] [^98c4a706] [^b2604803].

> Let me consider special populations and edge cases. For patients with HIV or other immunocompromised states, screening continues for life and management thresholds are generally lower, so many programs favor earlier colposcopy or closer surveillance. For patients aged 25–29, the same risk-based principles apply, though some guidelines still prefer cytology-only screening in this group and transition to HPV-based strategies after 30, which can influence how aggressively we triage HPV-positive results in younger women [^1126d9a4] [^notfound] [^895ef3ca].

> I should double-check the counseling messages because anxiety and misinterpretation are common. HPV positivity is common and often transient, most infections clear, and a positive test does not imply cancer or necessarily a need for immediate treatment. Providers should explain the rationale for 1-year surveillance, the importance of returning for follow-up, and the plan if HPV persists or cytology becomes abnormal, using neutral, nonstigmatizing language and addressing partner-related concerns [^cc7327a4] [^d5a26991].

> Let me synthesize a concise, actionable answer. For a negative Pap (NILM) with a positive high-risk HPV result, the default is repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year, with colposcopy if HPV remains positive or if cytology is abnormal at follow-up. If HPV 16 or 18 is detected, proceed directly to colposcopy even with NILM. If this HPV-positive/NILM result follows a documented negative HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, 1-year surveillance is still appropriate because the risk is lower but remains above the 3-year threshold. Throughout, ensure reflex cytology is performed when feasible and tailor management to prior screening history and patient-specific risk factors [^d34eca65] [^29431eb1] [^7b3a4615] [^1503ac56].

---

For a negative Pap with positive HPV, **repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year** is recommended [^d34eca65] because the 5-year CIN3+ risk is ~2.1% [^notfound], which exceeds the 0.55% threshold for 3-year return [^07637efe]. If HPV 16/18 is present, **proceed directly to colposcopy** [^29431eb1] regardless of cytology [^98c4a706]. If HPV is non-16/18 and the patient had a negative HPV test or cotest within 5 years, the risk is lower and 1-year surveillance is appropriate [^7b3a4615]; if no recent negative HPV-based screen, 1-year return is still advised [^d34eca65]. Colposcopy is indicated if HPV persists or cytology becomes abnormal at the 1-year follow-up [^1503ac56].

---

## Risk stratification and management

The 2019 ASCCP risk-based management guidelines categorize patients into risk strata based on current results and screening history, with **clinical action thresholds** guiding management [^085e226c]:

| **Risk category** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Immediate CIN3+ risk ≥ 4.0% | Colposcopy or expedited treatment [^085e226c] |
| 5-year CIN3+ risk ≥ 0.55% but < 4.0% | Repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year [^d34eca65] |
| 5-year CIN3+ risk < 0.55% | Return to routine screening in 3 or 5 years [^07637efe] |

---

For HPV-positive/NILM, the **immediate CIN3+ risk is ~2.1%** [^e1014b57], placing patients in the intermediate-risk category and prompting 1-year surveillance [^d34eca65].

---

## Specific guidelines for HPV-positive/NILM

### General population (unknown or no recent HPV-negative screen)

- **Initial management**: Repeat HPV-based testing (HPV test alone or cotest) in 1 year [^d34eca65].
- **Rationale**: The 5-year CIN3+ risk is ~2.1% [^e1014b57], exceeding the 0.55% threshold for 3-year return [^07637efe].
- **Follow-up**: If HPV persists or cytology becomes abnormal (≥ ASC-US), proceed to colposcopy [^17462b9e].

---

### Patients with recent negative HPV-based screen

If the patient had a documented negative HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, the **immediate CIN3+ risk is lower (~1.0–1.5%)** [^notfound], but still warrants 1-year surveillance [^d34eca65]. If HPV persists or cytology becomes abnormal, proceed to colposcopy [^17462b9e].

---

### HPV 16/18 positive results

When HPV 16 or 18 is detected, **immediate colposcopy is recommended** [^29431eb1] regardless of cytology, given the higher risk of CIN3+ and occult cancer [^98c4a706].

---

## Evidence supporting current guidelines

- **Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) data**: HPV-positive/NILM carries a 5-year CIN3+ risk of ~2.1% [^e1014b57], supporting 1-year surveillance [^d34eca65].
- **New Mexico HPV Pap Registry**: Validates similar risk estimates across diverse populations [^3ef6731d].
- **CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program**: Confirms comparable risk profiles in underserved populations [^3ef6731d].

---

## Clinical implications and patient counseling

Patients should be counseled that HPV positivity is common and often transient [^cc7327a4]; most infections clear spontaneously, and **1-year surveillance is a safe, evidence-based approach** [^d34eca65]. Emphasize the importance of follow-up to detect persistence or progression early [^642e1d7e].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **General population**: Repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year [^d34eca65]; colposcopy if HPV persists or cytology becomes abnormal [^17462b9e].
- **Recent negative HPV screen**: 1-year surveillance is appropriate due to lower risk [^7b3a4615]; colposcopy if HPV persists or cytology becomes abnormal [^17462b9e].
- **HPV 16/18 positive**: Proceed directly to colposcopy [^29431eb1] regardless of cytology [^98c4a706].

---

Current guidelines recommend **1-year surveillance** for HPV-positive/NILM, balancing the risk of CIN3+ with the potential harms of overtreatment [^d34eca65]. Management is individualized based on screening history and HPV genotype, with colposcopy reserved for persistent infection or high-risk genotypes [^7b3a4615] [^29431eb1].

### Cytology versus high-risk HPV testing for follow-up of HPV-positive women without CIN [^b8ba0f43]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2008). Low credibility.

Screening for cervical cancer is often considered the success story for cancer screening in the United States. However, much room for improvement still exists. For example, experts have yet to establish the best follow-up strategy for women with an abnormal Papanicolaou test and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) followed by a normal colposcopy or biopsy that is negative for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The incorporation of HPV testing has allowed the development of a more sensitive and cost-efficient strategy. This article presents a brief overview of related guidelines and current modalities, and reviews selected studies. Finally, future directions and a possible schema for clinical management of these patients are included.

### The next generation of cervical cancer screening: should guidelines focus on best practices for the future or current screening capacity? [^50645366]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Current guidance exist for cytology alone, HPV tests alone, and Pap and HPV co-testing. These guidelines allow for flexibility related to the resources available in different settings nationwide but also generate confusion because clinicians struggle to determine which test or combination of tests to use, how often to perform them, and how the results of different testing combinations should be interpreted. Adding to the challenge is the aging of vaccinated women into the screening population. Because HPV vaccination substantially reduces the risk of precancer, – fewer women with "positive" screening results will actually have precancer, changing the predictive value of a given screening test for vaccinated women.

The question addressed in this forum is how the next set of guidelines should shape US screening practices. Should guidelines be aspirational, looking ahead 5 to 10 years in the future and presenting the best case scenario in terms of equal access and correct implementation of the highest quality screening tools, or should guidelines be practical, focusing on the tools and resources available today, but with the understanding that frequent revisions will be needed as we look to the future?

Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines Should Be Practical and Able To Be Easily and Effectively Implemented in Many Settings

Sarah Feldman MD MPH

I. Introduction: Benefits and Harms of a Simple System

The most successful cancer screening test ever developed was the annual Pap test to screen for cervical cancer. The advice to initiate Pap testing at the age of 18 years or with the onset of sexual activity and to evaluate and treat all abnormalities was easy to remember for patients and doctors, easy to implement at annual visits, and easy to combine with other health care needs. It was practical, and this led in part to its success. Because cervical cancer screening guidelines have lengthened cytology intervals from 1 to 3 years and added HPV co-testing for women older than 30 years with a screening interval of 5 years, clinician and patient behavior has been difficult to change. According to Watson et al.in a study using National Health Interview data of 10,596 women published in 2017, appropriate Pap testing has decreased, with only 21% to 35% of women older than 30 years getting co-testing, and only 81% of women aged 21 to 65 years receiving a Pap within 3 years. Thus, the development of guidelines that are practical and easy to implement is paramount to ensure that future cervical cancer screening is better, not worse, for women.

Successful screening guidelines must account for access to care, availability of recommended tests, knowledge and preferences of both patients and providers, and systems for tracking patients and ensuring appropriate management of abnormalities.

II. Primary HPV Screening Is the Eventual Goal

Ultimately, primary HPV screening should be the standard of care for cervical cancer screening both in the United States and worldwide. A recent large study by Castle et al. shows the high negative predictive value of successive rounds of negative HPV tests, increasing our ability to predict women who are at low risk for developing cervical cancer. Many studies, however, while demonstrating an increase in the detection of precancer, especially in the first few years of testing, also show an increase in the detection of cellular changes associated with transient HPV infection, as well as an increase in the number of colposcopies and excisional procedures, e.g. LEEP, performed to detect these abnormalities, which are both costly and stressful for patients.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^34d51296]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Guideline: When patients have an estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 0.15% or greater but less than 0.55% based on history and current test results, repeat testing in 3 years with HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).

Rationale: Using the principle of equal management for equal risk, the 3-year return Clinical Action Threshold corresponds to the 5-year CIN 3+ risk after negative cervical cytology in the general population, for whom national guidelines recommend a 3-year return. Estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risks after a negative cytology result without HPV testing ranged from 0.33% in the KPNC population to 0.52% in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry, to an estimated 0.45% in the screened population of the CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Thus, 0.55% was considered an appropriate value for the Clinical Action Threshold. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds. Consistent with the 2012 guidelines, patients with a low-grade cotest result (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL) followed by a colposcopy with results of less than CIN 2, followed in turn by a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold (see Figure 2). Also consistent with previous guidelines, patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk 0.40%).

FIGURE 2
This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common low-grade screening abnormality (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.2%). Colposcopy of less than CIN 2 has a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the patient has a repeat abnormal screen at the next follow-up, colposcopy is recommended. If the HPV-based test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. NA, not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1503ac56]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

§ Negative HPV test or cotest (HPV plus Pap test) results only reduce risk sufficiently to defer colposcopy if performed for screening purposes within the last 5 years. Colposcopy is still warranted if negative HPV test or cotest results occurred in the context of surveillance for a previous abnormal result.

¶ Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients aged ≥ 25 years. Colposcopy with biopsy is an acceptable option if desired by patient after shared decision-making.

The following are highlights of the new management guidelines:

Colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk. º If a patient has a minimally abnormal test result (i.e. negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy HPV positive, ASC-US HPV positive, LSIL, or HPV positive) that was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead of colposcopy is recommended (a negative HPV test or cotest performed during follow-up of abnormal results would not similarly reduce risk). º Referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test results are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the 1-year follow-up visit.
Treatment can be expedited for high-risk patients. º If a patient has a high-grade cytology (Pap test) result (i.e. HSIL) and an HPV test that is positive for HPV type 16, then treatment with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first. º If a patient who has not been screened in more than 5 years (i.e. rarely screened) has an HSIL cytology result and a positive HPV test (regardless of type), then treatment with LEEP is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first. º When considering treatment without confirmatory biopsy, shared decision-making with the patient is important. Considerations include age, concern about cancer, ability to follow up, financial concerns, and concerns about the potential effect of treatment on a future pregnancy.
When primary HPV testing is used for screening, cytology testing should be performed for all positive HPV test results to help determine the next steps in management. º Ideally, cytology testing should be performed by the laboratory as a reflex test from the same specimen so the patient does not need to return to the clinic. Colposcopy is recommended if HPV genotyping is positive for types 16 or 18, and it can be considered if it is infeasible for the patient to return for cytology alone. º HPV 16 is the highest-risk HPV type. Expedited treatment should be considered for HSIL cytology results, and colposcopy is recommended in all other cases, even if the cytology test is normal. º HPV 18 has a relatively high association with cancer, and colposcopy is recommended in all cases, even if the cytology test is normal. Because of the association of HPV 18 with adenocarcinoma, endocervical sampling is acceptable at the time of colposcopy. º If the HPV type is not HPV 16 or 18, and the cytology test is normal, return in 1 year is recommended in most cases.
HPV testing or cotesting is preferred to cytology testing alone for follow-up after an abnormal test result. º Negative HPV testing or cotesting is less likely to miss disease than normal cytology testing alone. Therefore, cytology testing is recommended more often than HPV testing or cotesting for follow-up of abnormal results. Specifically, cytology testing is recommended annually when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended at 3-year intervals, and cytology testing is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually.
After treatment for a high-grade precancer (moderate or severe dysplasia), surveillance should continue for at least 25 years. º Initial testing includes an HPV test or cotest at 6, 18, and 30 months. If cytology alone is used, testing should occur at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months. º After completing initial testing, long-term surveillance includes testing at 3-year intervals if using HPV testing or cotesting, or annual testing if using cytology testing alone. º Surveillance should continue for at least 25 years after the initial treatment, even if this extends beyond age 65 years. If a woman undergoes hysterectomy during the surveillance period, vaginal screening should continue.

MODERATOR STATEMENT

Rebecca B. Perkins, MD, MS

From approximately 1950–2000, cervical cancers were prevented by using cytology (Pap tests), clinician-collected samples of cervical cells that used microscopic evaluation to detect precancerous changes, allowing treatment before the development of cancer. Population-wide screening at 1- to 3-year intervals with cytology led to dramatic declines in cervical cancer rates, and cytology has been touted as one of the most effective cancer prevention measures to date. However, the discovery that human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for nearly all cases of cervical cancer, and the subsequent advent of HPV vaccination and HPV testing has the potential to revolutionize cervical cancer prevention.

In the United States, both cytology and HPV testing are currently available for screening women. However, these tests perform very differently. Cytology can be thought of as an analysis of the cervix in its current state. Cells are removed and deemed either positive or negative for the possible presence of precancer. Cytology has low sensitivity, missing up to 50% of present lesions, and a single negative test does not provide long-term reassurance that cancer will not develop. Human papillomavirus testing, in contrast, detects 95% of precancer with a single screen. In addition, because persistent HPV infection is a necessary precursor of cervical precancer, a negative HPV test today means that a woman's risk of precancer is greatly reduced for the next several years. However, because HPV infections are common and most are transient, HPV testing has a higher false-positive rate, meaning that for every test performed, more women will be sent for additional testing and no precancer will be found.

### Cervical cancer screening: what's new? Updates for the busy clinician [^6cf5ff9a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In the United States, 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year, even though the screening for this disease is safe and effective. There are 3 types of screening options available: cervical cytology (Papanicolaou or "Pap" test), Pap/HPV (human papillomavirus) co-test, and HPV-only test. With simplified options such as HPV-only screening, providers who have been reluctant to incorporate cervical cancer screening into their primary care practice may feel more comfortable with offering these services to women. In this article we review the different cervical cancer screening options that are now available and summarize the various changes in guidelines over the last decade.

IV. Necessity of Continued Incremental Revision of Guidelines

As practice evolves, underlying rates of precancer will change. Human papillomavirus vaccination will drive down rates of infection and subsequent pre-cancer, and HPV testing, which detects more disease at the initial screen, results in lower rates of precancer in subsequent screening rounds. This in turn affects the accuracy of any given test (both in terms of positive and negative predictive value), and thus, appropriate recommendations or guidelines and priorities will likewise need to be updated. To complicate implementation, rates of HPV vaccination and access to screening, in particular HPV testing, vary widely in different parts of the United States and the world.

So what is the role of a guideline? Guidelines are intended to standardize care using the best available evidence supplemented by expert opinion to decrease rates of disease and improve the health of populations. To be successful, guidelines must be implementable and useful to patients and providers in a wide variety of clinical and programmatic settings that may have varied resources and priorities. Testing and treatment options also need to be culturally and emotionally acceptable to patients. Thus, to be effective, guidelines must be evidence based but also flexible, and they must reflect the roles of access, acceptability, availability, and cost of different testing and management options. Furthermore, for screening guidelines to have the maximum impact at preventing cancer, they must incorporate easy and straightforward recommendations for management of abnormalities and include other best practices such as primary vaccination. Not only does "one size" not fit all in this age of personalized medicine, but also as care evolves with new scientific advances, "evidence" is also likely to evolve and guidelines developed now will need to be constantly re-evaluated to reflect new rates of precancer, vaccine uptake and HPV infection rates, as well as additional molecular testing options. Even guidelines that may now seem aspirational will need frequent reassessment to ensure they are working as hoped, that cancer is being prevented and that yet new and better approaches have not been developed.

### Updated guidelines for management of cervical cancer screening abnormalities [^deaaf2d6]. ACOG (2020). High credibility.

Box 1 — essential changes from prior management guidelines emphasize that recommendations are based on risk, not results, with recommendations of colposcopy, treatment, or surveillance based on a patient's risk of CIN 3+ determined by current results and past history; colposcopy can be deferred for certain patients, with repeat human papillomavirus (HPV) testing or cotesting at 1 year is recommended for patients with minor screening abnormalities indicating HPV infection with low risk of underlying CIN 3+ (eg, HPV-positive, low-grade cytologic abnormalities after a documented negative screening HPV test or cotest); and guidance for expedited treatment is expanded (ie, treatment without colposcopic biopsy), noting expedited treatment was an option for patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology in the 2012 guidelines and that this guidance is now better defined. Additionally, the new consensus guidelines follow a risk-based approach and recommend consideration of a patient's screening history along with current test results to guide decision making.

### Cervical cancer screening in the early post vaccine era [^482c4f47]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The Pap test is the foundation of cervical cancer screening in North America and most industrialized countries. It has been widely used in the United States since the 1950s. But are our current screening guidelines still justified? In this article, the author reviews the current recommendations for cervical cancer screening by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the evidence supporting them, reviews the relative efficacy of liquid-based cytology versus the conventional Pap smear, and discusses the role of HPV DNA testing in primary screening.

### Delivering guideline-concordant care for patients with high-risk HPV and normal cytologic findings [^642e1d7e]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Do clinicians and systems maintain contact with and deliver services to patients to complete recommended surveillance? We addressed this question for patients with positive high-risk (non-16/18 or pooled genotypes) HPV test results and negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) cytologic findings. This group is of particular concern because US health care systems are shifting to primary HPV screening and cotesting, making HPV-positive result and NILM cytologic finding a common screening abnormality (range, 6.7%-14.9%). Furthermore, most studies in the literature to date have monitored colposcopy receipt after a high-grade result; few have studied follow-up after an HPV-positive result and NILM cytologic finding.

Guideline-concordant practice for an HPV-positive result and NILM cytologic finding should include annual surveillance cotesting to monitor for HPV persistence and potential progression of cervical dysplasia. If findings are negative over 2 subsequent evaluations, then a patient can exit management and return to average-risk screening (ie, cytologic test alone every 3 years; primary HPV or cotesting every 5 years). Evidence supporting these recommendations is based on data from a limited number of settings. To describe how well practice aligns with guidelines, we used longitudinal cohort data from the National Cancer Institute Population-based Research to Optimize the Screening Process (PROSPR) II Cervical Consortium. In 3 diverse health care settings, we aimed to quantify patterns of surveillance testing and associated outcomes for patients after an HPV-positive result and NILM cytologic finding.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^02f07784]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

To validate the 4.0% Clinical Action Threshold for colposcopy, the KPNC CIN 3+ prevalent risk estimates were compared with those from other study populations with more diversity in sociodemographic characteristics including the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry, CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, and the BD Onclarity registrational trials. The 4% threshold functioned similarly.

The 4.0% immediate risk Clinical Action Threshold has important implications for patients with at least 1 previous negative HPV-based test because surveillance is recommended rather than immediate colposcopy for low-grade abnormalities (HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL) in patients whose preceding screening result was a negative HPV test or cotest within a routine screening interval (approximately 5 years). This additional information reduces the immediate CIN 3+ risk to approximately 2%, leading to a recommendation of 1-year surveillance instead of immediate colposcopy. Adoption of the 4.0% Clinical Action Threshold reduces the number of patients referred for colposcopy over 2 rounds of screening from an estimated 9.8%, using the 2012 ASCCP recommendations, to 8.3% using the 2019 recommendations. Exceptions to the 4.0% threshold, encompassing results with cancer risk disproportionately higher than CIN 3+ risk, are discussed in Section H.2.

Deciding on the clinical action thresholds for each management option (treatment preferred, treatment or colposcopic biopsy, colposcopic biopsy, surveillance retesting at 1 year, surveillance retesting at 3 years, return at regular screening interval of 5 years) required an 18-month collective effort involving the volunteering cervical health professionals and patient advocates and including a period for public input. These societal decisions were acknowledged to be part of the larger subjective question of "How safe is safe enough? What risk levels in our society warrant escalating to the next, more aggressive clinical actions?"

The clinical action thresholds adopted by consensus voting in October 2019 after substantial study and discussion are intended to endure, providing stability to the US cervical screening effort, even as screening test methods and strategies evolve. When a new test is approved by the Food and Drug Administration that test can be considered for inclusion in the consensus guidelines as soon as sufficient data are available to know what risk of precancer is predicted by a positive result versus a negative result. Adequate prospective data will be necessary before a test can be recommended as the basis for surveillance at 1- or 3-year intervals or return to routine screening at 5-year intervals. Cross-sectional data will be needed to supply the immediate risk estimates that support recommendations for treatment or referral to colposcopy. To give an example, the new consensus is that the clinical action threshold for referral to colposcopy and biopsies (and possibly treatment) is a 4.0% immediate risk of CIN 3+. Patients with an underlying immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or more are recommended to have colposcopy whether that risk is due to HPV-positive ASC-US, HPV-positive low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or greater, HPV 16–positive NILM, a posttreatment positive HPV test, or any other set of results predicting equally high risk. If a positive result from a new triage test for HPV-positive patients is convincingly shown to convey a CIN 3+ risk greater than or equal to 4.0% upon immediate referral to colposcopy, there would be no need for a new consensus conference to determine how to use that test in clinical practice: the management of a positive result would be to refer to colposcopy (with optional or even preferred, expedited treatment if risk is sufficiently high). By the guiding principle of "Equal Management of Equal Risk", the guideline would be evident and easily settled.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^6d352328]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Guideline: When patients have an estimated risk of CIN 3+ based on history and current results that is below the threshold for immediate colposcopy (4.0% immediate risk) and above the 3-year follow-up threshold (≥ 0.55% at 5 years), repeat testing in 1 year with HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).

Rationale: One-year surveillance implies close follow-up for those whose risks fall between the Clinical Action Thresholds for colposcopy and 3-year follow-up. Consistent with the 2012 consensus recommendations, follow-up at 1 year is recommended after screening tests showing minimal abnormalities: HPV-positive/NILM or HPV-negative/LSIL with unknown previous screening history (immediate risks 2.1% and 1.1% respectively); 1-year surveillance is also recommended after colposcopy with biopsies of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) or less preceded by a low-grade cotest result (defined as HPV-positive LSIL, HPV-positive ASC-US, or repeated HPV-positive NILM). New data for these guidelines find that the risk of CIN 3+ is substantially reduced after a documented negative HPV primary screening test or cotest or normal colposcopic examination with biopsy confirmation of less than CIN 2. Based on lower CIN 3+ risks, 1-year surveillance, not colposcopy, is recommended for most patients with new HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL results after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within an appropriate screening interval (approximately 5 years) or colposcopic examination less than CIN 2 within the past year (see Figure 2). Of note, a previous negative cytology result alone does not reduce subsequent risk like a negative HPV-based screen; therefore, cytology alone is not used to modify subsequent management recommendations.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^14848ff0]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Cytology-negative, HPV-positive women 30 years and older — risk and follow-up: Women negative by both tests have a "less than 1 in 1,000 risk of having CIN 2+" and "should not be rescreened before 3 years". In screened populations, the prevalence data showed "6.5%, and 58% of the HPV-positive women had a concurrent negative cytology", and the risk of undetected CIN 2+ in cytology-negative, HPV-positive women ranged "from 2.4% to 5.1%". For comparison, "CIN 2+ was detected at enrollment colposcopy in 10.2% of women of unknown HPV status with ASC-US in ALTS". Natural history data indicate "60% of HPV-positive women became HPV negative after a median follow-up of 6 months". Accordingly, "repeat cytology and HPV testing at 12 months seems to be the best management approach", with persistently HPV-positive women on repeat testing who "should undergo colposcopy, even if cytology negative", while those negative on both tests "can be rescreened in 3 years".

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^7b3a4615]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

HPV-based prior results and high-quality colposcopy modify near-term management — after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, a new abnormal screening result has substantially reduced estimated risk of CIN 3+, often leading to surveillance rather than immediate colposcopy; in contrast, a previous negative cytology result alone does not similarly reduce risk. A colposcopic examination confirming low-grade or normal histology reduces estimated risk in the next 2 years and allows patients with HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL at their 1-year follow-up to return for repeat HPV or cotesting in 1 more year rather than immediately return to colposcopy.

### Developing guidelines for cervical cancer prevention in the face of diagnostic complexity [^e3523dd8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

Adoption of new cervical cancer screening guidelines by the American Cancer Society and others in 2012 required new guidelines for the management of abnormal screening and follow-up tests. The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology led a consensus conference including 26 professional organizations and agencies that developed new management guidelines. These guidelines are risk-based and derive from analysis of approximately 1.4 million women screened by the Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical group, with risk assessment in collaboration with NCI. New guidelines provide guidance for the conservative management of young women, for women with unsatisfactory Papanicolaou (Pap) tests and tests with limited transformation zone component, for women with discordant Pap and human papillomavirus (HPV) co-testing results, and for the incorporation of HPV 16/18 genotyping results into management decisions. The increasing number of available tests and the increasingly nuanced understanding of risk mean that clinicians will need to offset the complexity of diagnostic and treatment algorithms with technology and specialization.

### Benchmarking CIN 3 + risk as the basis for incorporating HPV and pap cotesting into cervical screening and management guidelines [^7b6cb3c6]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and a consensus of 25 organizations endorsed concurrent cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing ("cotesting") for cervical cancer screening. Past screening and management guidelines were implicitly based on risks defined by Pap-alone, without consideration of HPV test results. To promote management that is consistent with accepted practice, new guidelines incorporating cotesting should aim to achieve equal management of women at equal risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and cancer (CIN 3+).

Methods

We estimated cumulative 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for 965,360 women aged 30 to 64 years undergoing cotesting at Kaiser Permanente Northern California over 2003 to 2010. We calculated the implicit risk thresholds for Pap-alone and applied them for new management guidance on HPV and Pap cotesting, citing 2 examples: HPV-positive/atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and HPV-negative/Pap-negative. We call this guidance process "benchmarking".

Results

A low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion result, for which immediate colposcopy is prescribed, carries a 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 5.2%, suggesting that test results with similar risks should be managed with colposcopy. Similarly, ASC-US (2.6% risk) is managed with a 6- to 12-month follow-up visit and Pap-negative (0.26% risk) is managed with a 3-year follow-up visit. The 5-year CIN 3+ risk for women with HPV-positive/ASC-US was 6.8% (95% confidence interval = 6.2%-7.6%). This is greater than the 5.2% risk implicitly leading to referral to colposcopy, consistent with current management recommendations that HPV-positive/ASC-US should be referred for immediate colposcopy. The 5-year CIN 3+ risk for women with HPV-negative/Pap-negative was 0.08% (95% confidence interval = 0.07%-0.09%), far below the 0.26% implicitly required for a 3-year return and justifying a longer (e.g., 5-year) return.

Conclusions

Using the principle of "equal management of equal risks", benchmarking to implicit risk thresholds based on Pap-alone can be used to achieve safe and consistent incorporation of cotesting.

Among these persons, screening should be performed starting at age 21 years and continue through age 65 years. Testing can be performed using either conventional or liquid-based cytologic tests. For persons aged ≥ 30 years, screening can include FDA-cleared tests for high-risk, oncogenic types of HPV. For cytopathologic testing, clinics should use CLIA-certified laboratories using acceptable terminology and the Onclarity HPV test can detect the presence of 14 oncogenic HPV types, as well as individual types 16 and 18, and are cleared for primary cervical cancer screening.
- Colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk.
- If a patient has a minimally abnormal test result that was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead of colposcopy is recommended.
- When primary HPV testing is used for screening, cytology testing should be performed for all positive HPV test results to help determine the next steps in management.
- Ideally, cytology testing should be performed by the laboratory as a reflex test from the same specimen so the patient does not need to return to the clinic. Colposcopy is recommended if HPV genotyping is positive for types 16 or 18, and it can be considered if it is infeasible for the patient to return for cytology alone (.
- HPV testing or cotesting is preferred to cytology testing alone for follow-up after an abnormal test result.
- Negative HPV testing or cotesting is less likely to miss disease than normal cytology testing alone. Therefore, cytology testing is recommended more often than HPV testing or cotesting for follow-up of abnormal results. Specifically, cytology testing is recommended annually when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended at 3-year intervals, and cytology testing is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually.

Cotesting and primary HPV testing — All 3 guidelines endorse cytology plus testing for high-risk HPV in women aged 30 to 65 years as an alternative to cytology alone, and women with normal cytology and no high-risk HPV can have screening intervals lengthened to every 5 years; the cumulative risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe over the subsequent 5 years is estimated at 0.34%; the guidelines agree that HPV tests alone or in combination with cytology should not be used for primary screening in women younger than 30 years; the USPSTF issued a grade D recommendation for HPV testing in this age group.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^cc7327a4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Counseling for cytology (Pap test) and human papillomavirus (HPV) results — patient education and psychosocial support are emphasized. Persons might believe these tests screen for conditions other than cervical cancer or be confused by abnormal results, and health care providers have an important role in educating persons about HPV and moderating the psychosocial impact of abnormal results. Persons should be counseled on the risks, uncertainties, and benefits of screening. An abnormal cytology test or a positive HPV test can cause short-term anxiety, stress, fear, and confusion, possibly decreasing the patient's ability to absorb and retain information and acting as a barrier to follow-up care, and a positive HPV test might elicit concerns about partners, worries about disclosure, and feelings of guilt, anger, and stigmatization. Providers should frame HPV positivity in a neutral, nonstigmatizing context and emphasize its common, asymptomatic, and transient nature; providers also should emphasize that HPV infections often are shared between partners, that it is often not possible to know the origin of an HPV infection, and that HPV tests might become positive many years after initial exposure due to reactivation of latent infections in both male and female partners. Having an HPV infection should not raise concerns about a partner's health, and providers should communicate the meaning of both the cytology and HPV test results to patients at screening. Providers also should screen for tobacco use and perform cessation counseling.

### Primary high-risk human papillomavirus testing for cervical cancer screening in the United States: is It time? [^a9816062]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Context

- The most recent update to cervical cancer screening guidelines offers interim guidance on the use of primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening, with algorithms for management of results. After decades of screening with pure cytology and a shorter time with adjunctive HPV or cotesting with Papanicolaou (Pap) test and HPV, this is a significant change to our screening methods.

Objective

- To briefly review the history of cervical cancer screening, the evidence upon which these interim guidelines were based, the arguments for and against primary HPV testing, and the current state of the field.

Data Sources

- Primary studies, review articles, and commentaries were reviewed.

Conclusions

- While there is evidence both for and against primary HPV testing, there are a growing number of countries adopting the practice. It would be worthwhile to be informed and prepared for such a change in the United States as well.

### Summary of current guidelines for cervical cancer screening and management of abnormal test results: 2016–2020 [^e35c68ac]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer can be prevented through routine screening and follow-up of abnormal results. Several guidelines have been published in the last 4 years from various medical societies and organizations. These guidelines aim to personalize screening and management, reducing unnecessary testing in low-risk patients and managing high-risk patients with more intensive follow-up. However, the resulting complexity can lead to confusion among providers. The CDC, NCI, and obstetrician-gynecologists involved in guideline development summarized current screening and management guidelines. For screening, guidelines for average-risk and high-risk populations are summarized and presented. For management, differences between the 2012 and 2019 consensus guidelines for managing abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors are summarized. Current screening guidelines for average-risk individuals have minor differences, but are evolving toward an HPV-based strategy. For management, HPV testing is preferred to cytology because it is a more sensitive test for cancer precursor detection and also allows for precise risk stratification. Current risk-based screening and management strategies can improve care by reducing unnecessary tests and procedures in low-risk patients and focusing resources on high-risk patients. Knowledge of screening and management guidelines is important to improve adherence and avoid both over- and under-use of screening and colposcopy.

ASCCP risk-based management — risk-stratified actions for cervical screening abnormalities are outlined as follows: at the highest risk, expedited treatment can be performed without need for colposcopic biopsy; at somewhat lower but still high risk, colposcopy is recommended to find or rule out precancer requiring treatment; at lower but nonnegligible risk, colposcopy is not needed and surveillance at shortened intervals is prudent with 1 and 3 years maintained as 2 levels of concern/attention; and women at very low risk provided by a negative human papillomavirus (HPV) test (or HPV and cytology cotest) are recommended to continue screening at the 5-year interval.

HPV-positive ASC-US management after colposcopy with less than CIN 2 — The corrected Figure 2 legend states that a patient with this minimally abnormal screening result "would be managed based on risk estimates". "The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.5%)". If colposcopy shows "less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return)", and at the 1-year return a second HPV-positive ASC-US "has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return)". For the second postcolposcopy surveillance test, "if the HPV-based test performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended". If results are "either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended", and "Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or LSIL results". Similar management "would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e., less severe than ASC-H)".

Clinical Question 5

What is the recommended surveillance after treatment of AIS?

Recommendation 5.1

For patients who undergo definitive management with hysterectomy, surveillance per the ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus guidelines is recommended for at least 25 years after diagnosis, even if that extends the testing period beyond the age of 65 years (CIII).

Recommendation 5.2

i) For patients who undergo fertility-sparing management, surveillance with Pap plus HPV co-testing and endocervical sampling is recommended every 6 months for the first 3 years, then annually for at least 2 years or until hysterectomy is performed (BII).
ii) For patients who have consistently negative co-testing results in the first 5 years of surveillance, extending surveillance to every 3 years indefinitely is acceptable (CIII).

Literature Review

Owing to an increased risk of developing vaginal dysplasia after a history of cervical dysplasia, it is recommended that definitive surgical management should be followed by at least 25 years of surveillance per the ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines, with vaginal colposcopy performed to evaluate high-grade cytology results, persistent low-grade cytology results, or persistent positive HPV test results (two or more); although the HPV test is not currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved for vaginal screening or surveillance, the high negative predictive value of the test can identify those individuals who are at low risk for developing vaginal cancer. Management of abnormal vaginal cytology and positive HPV test results in this setting is beyond the scope of these management guidelines and is well-defined in the review article by Khan et al.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus DNA testing and pap smear for cervical cancer screening in a publicly financed health-care system [^cb6fd0e1]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Experts and existing guidelines were consulted before making the following assumptions for management of females with different screening results: (1) women with negative primary screening results are asked to undergo regular screening; (2) when a woman had a positive final screening result, she is urged to undergo a colposcopy-guided biopsy. All women with a confirmed histology of CIN I, CIN II or III and cancer are assumed to be treated with the therapy recommended by the Taiwan Cooperative Oncology Group. These patients are assumed treated immediately after disease confirmation. When treatment was completed, annual Pap smear screening followed; (3) in the HPV-Pap and combination strategies, those negative after follow-up screenings are suggested to undergo annual Pap smear screening for the rest of their lifetime.

We further assume that compliance with follow-up and treatment is 100% in the model.

Model parameters

Clinical action thresholds — management recommendations are based on Clinical Action Thresholds and correspond to risk strata. The 5-year return Clinical Action Threshold "approximates the risk after a negative human papillomavirus (HPV)–based screening test" and such patients are "recommended to receive screening at 5-year intervals with HPV-based testing". The 3-year return threshold "approximates the risk for a patient after a negative cervical cytology screen", and patients with risks at or below it but above the 5-year threshold are "recommended to receive HPV-based testing in 3 years". "One-year return is recommended for patients with risks above the 3-year threshold but below the Clinical Action Threshold for colposcopy". The colposcopy threshold "approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL screening result", and these patients are "recommended to receive colposcopy". The expedited treatment or colposcopy acceptable threshold "approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H)" and such patients are "recommended to receive counseling from their providers to choose between evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy or expedited treatment", with "Expedited treatment is defined as treatment without confirmatory colposcopic biopsy". The expedited treatment preferred threshold "approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV 16– positive HSIL cytology" and "It is preferred that patients with risk at or above this threshold receive expedited treatment unless they are pregnant, younger than 25 years, or have concerns about the effect of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes".

### Common abnormal results of pap and human papillomavirus cotesting: what physicians are recommending for management [^3ff702b1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the association between physician and practice characteristics and adherence to management guidelines to better understand the factors associated with different screening recommendations by primary care physicians.

Methods

We used a cross-sectional nationally representative survey of 950 primary care physicians familiar with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing to assess adherence to management guidelines by analyzing responses to two clinical vignettes of a 35-year-old woman who had Pap and HPV tests results: 1) discordant (normal Pap and positive HPV) or 2) mildly abnormal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance Pap and negative HPV). Analyses included multivariable logistic regression.

Results

For the discordant test results, 54.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 51–57.6%) of physicians recommended both Pap and HPV testing in 6–12 months, adhering to management guidelines. For the mildly abnormal results, only 12.2% (95% CI 10–14.7%) had a guideline-adherent recommendation of Pap testing in 12 months with no HPV test. In multivariable analyses, no significant difference among physicians' specialties was observed for the discordant results. For the mildly abnormal results, physician specialty was associated with guideline adherence in which obstetrician-gynecologists had the highest percent of adherence (19.8%) compared with family and general practitioners (9.3%) and internists (11%) (P < .001).

Conclusion

Even for the most common abnormal results, many physicians reported recommendations that did not adhere to current management guidelines. Evidence-based interventions are needed to improve adherence to management guidelines for the newer HPV DNA test.

### Human papillomavirus and Papanicolaou tests screening interval recommendations in the United States [^c16e0052]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines recommend when the human papillomavirus (HPV) and Papanicolaou tests are used together (HPV co-test) for routine cervical cancer screening, screening intervals can be extended to 3 years. We assessed HPV test practices and Papanicolaou test screening interval recommendations of US providers.

Study Design

Using a multistage probability design, we analyzed nationally representative data that were collected in 2006 through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.

Results

Approximately 51% of providers ordered the HPV co-test; however, clinical vignettes found that < 15% of providers who ordered the HPV test recommend the next Papanicolaou test in 3 years for women with concurrent normal HPV co-test results and a documented normal screening history.

Conclusion

Overall, annual cervical cancer screening continues to be a common recommendation, regardless of whether a screening history has been established or an HPV test has been ordered.

Box 1 — summary of updates to 2019 Guidelines highlights endorsement and management changes. Endorsement of the 2021 Opportunistic Infections guidelines for screening and management of HIV+ or immunosuppressed patients is noted. Guidelines were clarified around cytology-only screening; for patients 25 and older who are still receiving cytology-only screening, 2012 guidelines should be followed. Guidelines were revised for repeating an unsatisfactory cytology; cytology should be repeated as soon as convenient and no later than 4 months. After treatment for CIN2+, 3 negative HPV tests or cotests at 6, 18, and 30 months are recommended before the patient can return to a 3-year testing interval. Guidelines were clarified for use of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone (primary HPV) for patients undergoing observation for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2.

New 2019 principles — testing and risk foundation — HPV-based testing is the basis for risk estimation and refers to use of either primary HPV testing alone or HPV testing in conjunction with cervical cytology (cotesting). Characteristics of HPV infections, including HPV type and the duration of infection, determine a patient's risk of CIN 3+. Although cytology has high specificity, it has lower sensitivity and lower negative predictive value than HPV testing and reduced utility for long-term risk prediction, and risk estimates underlying the 2019 management guidelines are based on HPV DNA testing.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^d6150cb9]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

This patient has a history of treated CIN 3 and more than 1 negative follow-up test, therefore consult Table 5B. Her immediate CIN 3+ risk is less than 4%, so the 5-year risk is used. Her 5-year risk is 0.91%, which is above the 0.55% threshold for a 3-year return, so the recommended management is 1-year follow-up. In the KPNC database, 2,379 women had this result combination, among whom 12 had CIN 3+, leading to a recommendation confidence score of 91%.

Summary of Concepts Underlying Changes From 2012 Guidelines 1

Negative HPV tests reduce risk. An HPV-negative test is virtually as reassuring as a negative cotest. The only instance in which HPV-negative is not reassuring is when cytology is HSIL+. However, this test combination is extremely rare (0.01% of overall screens in Tables 1A, B).

As history, a negative HPV test followed by a positive HPV test suggests a new or reappearing infection, which is lower risk than a persistent infection. Therefore, a prior HPV-negative test leads to lower risks (see Table 1B) than unknown history (see Table 1A). For HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL, this reduction in risks leads to a change of recommended management. A documented negative HPV test result before HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL almost halves the immediate CIN 3+ risk (4.4%, 4.3%–2.0%, 2.1%, respectively) and changes the recommended management from immediate colposcopy to 1-year follow-up (see Table 1B).

### Cervical cancer screening [^0f585e12]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Screening in women has decreased the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer. Precancerous cervical lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasias) and cervical carcinomas are strongly associated with sexually-transmitted high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which causes more than 99% of cervical cancers. Screening methods include cytology (Papanicolaou test) and HPV testing, alone or in combination. The American Academy of Family Physicians and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend starting screening in immunocompetent, asymptomatic women at 21 years of age. Women 21 to 29 years of age should be screened every three years with cytology alone. Women 30 to 65 years of age should be screened every five years with cytology plus HPV testing or every three years with cytology alone. Screening is not recommended for women younger than 21 years or in women older than 65 years with an adequate history of negative screening results. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is in the process of updating its guidelines. In 2015, the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology published interim guidance for the use of primary HPV testing.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^fa7b6a97]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

THE GENERAL APPROACH TAKEN TO CREATE THE NEW GUIDELINES

The ASCCP and NCI cooperatively planned and supported the consensus process, with administrative support provided by the ASCCP. The convening of the consensus group is described in the main guidelines article. Once convened, the major task of the participating representatives was to decide on durable clinical action thresholds, striving to represent US consensus as to what clinical actions are recommended for increasing severity of cervical screening abnormalities. The following axiomatic principles were followed: the main purpose of cervical screening in the United States is to find precancerous lesions ("precancer") that can be treated easily to prevent invasive cervical cancer. Putting aside temporarily whether precancer is best defined as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/CIN 3/AIS, or CIN 3/adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), or histologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/AIS, there are a limited number of clinical actions available to clinicians and patients when faced with a cervical screening abnormality. Logically, a patient known to be at very high risk of having precancer has the greatest need of preventive treatment; at the highest risk, expedited treatment might be preferred without need for colposcopic biopsy. At somewhat lower but still high risk, colposcopic biopsies are recommended to find or rule out precancer requiring treatment. At lower but nonnegligible risk, colposcopy is not needed, but surveillance at shortened intervals is prudent (1 and 3 years were maintained as the 2 levels of concern/attention) to reduce the risk of "interval cancers" occurring before the next testing visit. Women at very low risk provided by a negative human papillomavirus (HPV) test (or HPV and cytology cotest) are recommended to continue screening at the 5-year interval.

Risk-based management scenarios and eligibility after a prior HPV-negative screen are outlined as follows: Scenario 1 describes initial management of abnormal screening results; Table 1A addresses patients without a documented recent HPV test result, and to qualify for Table 1B, a patient's current abnormal screening test result must be preceded by a negative HPV test documented in the medical record within the past approximately 5 years (e.g., a normal screening interval); Scenario 2 describes surveillance after abnormal results not requiring immediate colposcopy referral, including management of current cotest results after a previous result of HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM; Scenario 3 describes management upon receipt of colposcopy/biopsy results; Scenario 4 describes management after a colposcopy at which CIN 2+ was not found, with Table 4a for low-grade index tests and Table 4b for high-grade index tests; Scenario 5 addresses management after treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3; and notably, HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL preceded by a negative HPV test are now recommended to be followed-up in 1 year rather than immediately referred to colposcopy.

Risks were estimated for a given testing round, and beginning with the second round risks informed precolposcopy management after immediately prior results of HPV negative, HPV positive/NILM, cotest negative, HPV negative/ASC-US, or HPV negative/LSIL; risk estimates were not provided for other prior abnormal results such as HPV positive/ASC-US or HPV positive/LSIL.

Cervical cancer biology and screening goals — Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), principally HPV types 16 (HPV16) and HPV18, is the cause of almost all cervical cancers. For more than a half century, cervical cytologic testing, first with the Papanicolaou (Pap) test and more recently with liquid-based cytology, has been the foundation for screening for cervical cancer and has been highly effective in substantially reducing the burden of this disease in the United States as well as globally. Although HPV infections are common in healthy adults, only a small proportion of infections persist and progress to precancerous cells in the cervix, and progression to a precancerous state occurs over many years with significant rates of regression and lack of progression, especially in younger individuals; thus, although HPV infections and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) are common, they only rarely lead to cervical cancer. The primary goal of cervical cancer screening is to detect treatable abnormalities and precancers (CIN grade 2 [CIN2], CIN3, and adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS]) that are likely to progress to invasive cancer, with a secondary goal of detecting earlier stage invasive cervical cancer.

Cervical cancer screening abnormalities — prior HPV results and triage: CIN 3+ risk was considered alongside individual risk factors, and the guidelines emphasize the importance of previous human papillomavirus (HPV) test results; new abnormal results after a negative HPV test within the previous 5 years indicate new infection, and such patients have approximately half the CIN 3+ risk of those with unknown previous results and can now be safely triaged to surveillance rather than receiving immediate colposcopy.

Follow-up of abnormal cytology and human papillomavirus test results — 2019 ASCCP risk-based management highlights: The 2019 management guidelines detail risk with clinical action thresholds to generate personalized management recommendations and allow management on the basis of risk for CIN 3, identifying persons at high risk who require colposcopy or expedited treatment and persons at low risk who might be able to safely defer invasive diagnostic procedures. Highlights include that colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk; if a patient has a minimally abnormal test result that was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead of colposcopy is recommended; referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test results are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the 1-year follow-up visit; and treatment can be expedited for high-risk patients.

Data Presentation: Current Results and History

Two central questions underlie risk estimations: (a) What are the current results? (b) What past results affect the risk estimate for the current results? The "current results" are those for which the clinician is seeking guidance, either an HPV test or cotest result (see Tables 1A – 2C 4A – 5B) or a colposcopy/biopsy result (see Table 3). The past results that impact risk estimates are noted under "history". Table 1A refers to patients without a recent documented HPV test or cotest result, so the history is simply "unknown". In Table 1B, "history" refers to recent documented negative HPV test (management after a prior negative cotest is so similar that we do not show them, interested readers can consult the full tables online). However, documented negative cytology provides relatively less reduction in risk compared with a negative HPV or cotest as history. Therefore, patients with a negative cytology history will still be managed by Table 1A. In Tables 2A B C, "history" refers to the abnormal screening test result preceding the current result: HPV-negative ASC-US (Table 2A), HPV-negative LSIL (Table 2B), and HPV-positive NILM (Table 2C). In Table 3, "history" refers to the precolposcopy test results. In Table 4A, "history" refers to both the colposcopy result (< CIN 2) and a low-grade test result preceding colposcopy. In Table 4B, "history" again refers to both the colposcopy result (< CIN 2) and preceding test result but addresses when a high-grade test result preceded the colposcopy.

In Tables 5A and 5B, "history" refers to treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3, and "current results" are HPV test results or cotest results after treatment. For Tables 5A and 5B, the risk estimation in this scenario (i.e. posttreatment) derives specifically from treated CIN 3 and the test result at the follow-up visit after treatment. The risk remains higher for treated CIN 3 compared with CIN 2 scenarios. However, to maximize safety after treatment of precancer, management is recommended based on the risks of patients treated for CIN 3. Thus, the management recommendations apply to both treated CIN 2 and CIN 3.

ASCCP 2019 unsatisfactory cytology — management recommendations state: "For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) in 2 to 4 months is recommended (BIII)". "Triage using HPV testing is not recommended (DIII)". "Before repeat cytology, treatment to resolve atrophy or obscuring inflammation when a specific infection is present is acceptable (CIII)". "For patients 25 years and older who are cotested and have unsatisfactory cytology and a positive HPV test without genotyping, repeat cytology in 2 to 4 months or colposcopy is acceptable (BII)". "If a positive HPV test with partial genotyping is positive for HPV 16 or HPV 18, direct referral for colposcopy is recommended (BII)". Figure 5 operationalizes this via "No HPV or unknown result (any age)", "HPV Negative (age ≥ 25 years)", and "HPV Positive (unknown genotype) (age ≥ 25 years)" leading to "Repeat Age-based Screening after 2 to 4 months", while "HPV 16 or 18 Positive" goes to colposcopy; the caption clarifies that "unknown genotype" includes both scenarios described.

Bard
HPV test: Recommended age: Starting at age 25 (some organizations recommend 30). Frequency: Every 5 years (if negative). What it detects: Presence of high‐risk HPV types linked to cervical cancer. Benefits: Highly sensitive and can detect precancerous changes before symptoms appear.
Pap test (Papanicolaou smear [cervical smear]): Recommended age: Starting at age 21 years (some organizations recommend 30). Frequency: Every 3 years (if negative), co‐testing with HPV every 5 years after age 30 years (some organizations recommend co‐testing starting at age 25). What it detects: Abnormal cervical cells that could potentially become cancerous. Benefits: Established and reliable test for detecting precancerous changes.
Additional considerations: Women with a history of abnormal cervical smear tests or HPV infection may require more frequent screening. Women who have received the HPV vaccine should still follow recommended screening guidelines. Consult your healthcare provider for personalized screening recommendations based on your individual history and risk factors.

### Hr-HPV testing in the follow-up of women with cytological abnormalities and negative colposcopy [^7b48c41c]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

The success of any cervical cancer prevention programme relies on the interplay between the underlying risk factors and the type of screening programme: an organised programme is more effective than an opportunistic programme. Furthermore, the existence and quality of the field and laboratory facilities for screening and diagnostic follow-up, as well as the facilities available for treating diagnosed lesions, are key elements of any screening programme. Monitoring the patient path or 'chain of action' for each patient with an abnormal screening result is of crucial importance. In Italy, despite the availability of well-functioning screening programmes spreading all over the country, the follow-up protocol after abnormal Pap test and negative colposcopy is not clearly defined.

While existing uniformity of indications in case of cytological abnormalities and diagnosis of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 2 or more severe (CIN2+) (excisional therapy), there is no uniformity of indications for the abnormal cytology. The European guidelines suggest the hr-HPV test in the follow-up after negative colposcopy only for some cytological results: Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASC-US), Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL) and Atypical Squamous Cells cannot exclude a High-Grade Lesion (ASC-H). However, these indications are not universally applied in the Italian cervical cancer screening programmes and in majority of the programmes the follow-up of abnormal Pap test and negative colposcopy is usually managed according to the gynaecologist judgment.

For HPV-positive cytology negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), colposcopy is recommended. If genotyping is positive for HPV 16, HPV 18, or both with ASC-US or LSIL, colposcopy is recommended.

Clinics should weigh the benefits of each screening strategy as well as their resources, such as time and cost, in deciding on which of the three possible screening strategies to implement. Decision analytic models estimating the benefits, harms, and costs of several different strategies might be useful in making this determination. Adopting recommended screening and follow-up procedures, including screening methods, results provision, and follow-up, can lead to success in implementing cervical cancer screening in clinics.

Patients should be provided a copy of their test results; those with normal results should be provided information on follow-up visits and the importance of continued cervical cancer screening, if applicable. Those with abnormal screening tests should be managed per published guidelines. National consensus guidelines are available for the management of abnormal cervical cancer screening tests. HPV testing or cotesting is preferred to cytology alone for surveillance after an abnormal screening test result. These guidelines base management recommendations on case-by-case assessment of risk considering past screening history and current results (see Follow-Up). Patients with abnormal cervical cancer screening test results should be counseled about those results (see Counseling Messages).

TABLE 1
Participating Organizations

Box 1. Essential Changes From Prior Management Guidelines

1) Recommendations are based on risk, not results.

Recommendations of colposcopy, treatment, or surveillance will be based on a patient's risk of CIN 3+ determined by a combination of current results and history (including unknown history). The same current test results may yield different management recommendations depending on the history of recent past test results. 2) Colposcopy can be deferred for certain patients.
Repeat HPV testing or cotesting at 1 year is recommended for patients with minor screening abnormalities indicating HPV infection with low risk of underlying CIN 3+ (e.g. low-grade cytologic abnormalities after a documented negative screening HPV test or cotest).
At the 1-year follow-up test, referral to colposcopy is recommended if results remain abnormal. 3) Guidance for expedited treatment is expanded (i.e. treatment without colposcopic biopsy).
Expedited treatment was an option for patients with HSIL cytology in the 2012 guidelines; this guidance is now better defined.
For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older, expedited treatment, defined as treatment without preceding colposcopic biopsy demonstrating CIN 2+, is preferred when the immediate risk of CIN 3+ is ≥ 60%, and is acceptable for those with risks between 25% and 60%. Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 (HPV 16) (i.e. HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology) and never or rarely screened patients with HPV-positive HSIL regardless of HPV genotype.
Shared decision-making should be used when considering expedited treatment, especially for patients with concerns about the potential impact of treatment on pregnancy outcomes. 4) Excisional treatment is preferred to ablative treatment for histologic HSIL (CIN 2 or CIN 3) in the United States. Excision is recommended for adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). 5) Observation is preferred to treatment for CIN 1.
Treatment remains acceptable for patients with repeat diagnoses of CIN 1 persisting 2 years or more. 6) Histopathology reports based on Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST)/World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for reporting histologic HSIL should include CIN 2 or CIN 3 qualifiers, i.e. HSIL(CIN 2) and HSIL (CIN 3). 7) All positive HPV tests, regardless of genotype, should have additional reflex triage testing performed from the same laboratory specimen (e.g. reflex cytology).
Additional testing from the same laboratory specimen is recommended because the findings may inform colposcopy practice. For example, those with HSIL cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 qualify for expedited treatment.
HPV 16 or 18 infections have the highest risk for CIN 3 and occult cancer, so additional evaluation (e.g. colposcopy with biopsy) is necessary even when cytology results are negative.
If HPV 16 and 18 testing is positive, and additional laboratory testing of the same sample is not feasible, the patient should proceed directly to colposcopy. 8) Continued surveillance with HPV testing or cotesting at 3-year intervals for at least 25 years is recommended after treatment of histologic HSIL, CIN 2, CIN 3, or AIS. Continued surveillance at 3-year intervals beyond 25 years is acceptable for as long as the patient's life expectancy and ability to be screened are not significantly compromised by serious health issues.
The 2012 guidelines recommended return to 5-year screening intervals and did not specify when screening should cease. New evidence indicates that risk remains elevated for at least 25 years, with no evidence that treated patients ever return to risk levels compatible with 5-year intervals.
Surveillance with cytology alone is acceptable only if testing with HPV or cotesting is not feasible. Cytology is less sensitive than HPV testing for detection of precancer and is therefore recommended more often. Cytology is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually. Cytology is recommended annually when 3-year intervals are recommended for HPV or cotesting. 9) Human papilloma virus assays that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for screening should be used for management according to their regulatory approval in the United States. (Note: all HPV testing in this document refers to testing for high-risk HPV types only).
For all management indications, HPV mRNA and HPV DNA tests without FDA approval for primary screening alone should only be used as a cotest with cytology, unless sufficient, exceptionally rigorous data are available to support primary HPV testing in management.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^eb0e6753]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Guideline: For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with an estimated immediate risk of CIN 3+ 25% or greater and less than 60% based on history and current results, treatment using an excisional procedure without previous biopsy confirmation or histologic evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy are both acceptable (AII).

Rationale: The 2012 guidelines allow treatment without biopsy-proven histologic confirmation include patients who have HSIL cytology independent of HPV status. In the KPNC data set, the 25% to 59% risks strata includes patients with the following results and immediate CIN 2+/CIN 3+ risks, respectively: (a) HPV-negative HSIL cytology: 47%/25%; (b) HPV-positive ASC-H cytology: 50%/26%; (c) HPV-positive AGC (all categories): 40%/26%; and (d) HPV-positive HSIL cytology: 77%/49%. Using this threshold, 2.8 patients will undergo excisional procedures for every CIN 3+ treated.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: updates through 2023 [^f79b90cd]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

3) Update to interval for repeating unsatisfactory cytology: The recommendation statement has been updated to reflect evidence that waiting 2 months before repeating the cytology test is not necessary.

Guideline: For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) as soon as convenient and no later than 4 months is recommended (BIII).

Rationale: The 2- to 4-month waiting period was initially proposed due to early studies indicating differences in cytology results repeated over a short time interval. The recommendation was carried forward through several guideline iterations, but rereview of evidence supports revision of the 2-month waiting period. A seminal article in 2005 specifically addressed this question and found the concern of reduced cellularity with short interval repeat not to hold true. In this study, the cytology interval ranged from 8 to 30 days in 763 women, 31 to 60 days in 2,317 women, 61 to 90 days in 1,090 women, 91 to 120 days in 491 women, and 121 to 184 days in 394 women. They found that repeat cytologic interpretations of unsatisfactory findings, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) did not vary among the Pap interval groups. Most importantly, the approximate cellularity of the samples was slightly better in the interval group of 8 to 30 days (P trend = 0.04). In addition, higher rates of unsatisfactory results have been documented in patients with cancer compared with those with CIN3 or lower grade results. Waiting to repeat an unsatisfactory cytology in the presence of cancer could lead to harm, specifically if other recommended workup for symptomatic patients is not performed. For this reason, the 2019 recommendations were updated.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors: erratum [^112ce832]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

2019 ASCCP risk-based management erratum — Figure 2 legend for minimally abnormal HPV-positive ASC-US specifies corrected risk estimates and recommendations. This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common minimally abnormal screening test result (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the HPV-based test performed for the second post-colposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second post-colposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASCUS or LSIL results. Note similar management would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e., less severe than ASC-H). The erratum clarifies that the prior legend instead reported immediate risk 4.2% and a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return).

### Five-year risks of CIN 3 + and cervical cancer among women who test pap-negative but are HPV-positive [^84b5aabd]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Current US guidelines for cotesting recommend that the large numbers of women who test Pap-negative, but human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive, return in 1 year, and those who remain HPV-positive or have low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or worse Pap results be referred for colposcopy. However, the performance of these guidelines in routine clinical practice has not been evaluated.

Methods

We estimated cumulative 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) among 32,374 women aged 30 to 64 years with HPV-positive/Pap-negative cotest results at Kaiser Permanente Northern California during 2003 to 2010.

Results

The 5-year CIN 3+ risk after an HPV-positive/Pap-negative cotest result, which was found in 3.6% of women, was 4.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.2%-4.8%). The 5-year cancer risk was 0.34% (95% CI = 0.26%-0.45%), and half of the cases were adenocarcinoma. Overall, 48% of the women remained HPV-positive on return (median = 418 days after baseline), a percentage that varied little over ages 30 to 64 years. At the return after a baseline HPV-positive/Pap-negative result, almost every repeat cotest result predicted greater subsequent 5-year CIN 3+ risk than the same cotest result had at baseline (HPV-positive/LSIL, 9.2% vs 6.1%, p = .01; HPV-positive/atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US], 7.9% vs 6.8%, p = .2; HPV-positive/Pap-negative, 7.4% vs 4.5%, p < .0001; HPV-negative/LSIL,1.7% vs 2.0%, p = .8; HPV-negative/ASC-US, 2.9% vs 0.43%, p = .0005; HPV-negative/Pap-negative, 0.93% vs 0.08%, p < .0001).

Conclusions

Using the principle of "equal management of equal risks", women testing HPV-positive/Pap-negative had a subsequent CIN 3+ risk consistent with risk thresholds for a 1-year return. However, on returning in approximately 1 year, about one-half of women will be referred for colposcopy because of continued HPV positivity or Pap abnormality. Clinicians should keep in mind that cotest results at the return after a baseline HPV-positive/Pap-negative finding are riskier than the same baseline cotest results in the general population, supporting intensified clinical management at return testing.

ASCCP risk-based management — multiple data sets for risk validation: Prior guidelines relied on KPNC, which adopted cervical cotesting as standard practice in 2003, and for the 2019 guidelines additional databases were analyzed, comparing risks using BD Onclarity registrational trials, the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry, and CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (including many low-income and minority patients); although populations vary in abnormal-result rates and CIN 3+ prevalence, corresponding CIN 3+ risk strata for the same test-result and screening-history combinations were similar across data sets and robust regardless of geographic location, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.

Risk by cytology/HPV category and initial management — severe cytologic abnormalities carry a predicted 5-year risk of about 85% for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or a more severe lesion, whereas a normal cytologic test result with a positive human papillomavirus (HPV) test result carries a predicted 5-year risk of about 10%. With the use of current management algorithms, immediate colposcopy is recommended to about 4% of screened women after 1 round of screening, and among those undergoing colposcopy with biopsy, about 28% report moderate or more severe pain and 22% report postprocedure bleeding of at least moderate severity.

2006 consensus guidelines — HPV DNA testing and colposcopy safeguards — Triage using either human papillomavirus (HPV) testing or repeat cytology is generally not considered an acceptable option if 75% or more would be referred to colposcopy after testing. Laboratories should use only HPV tests that have been analytically and clinically validated with proven acceptable reproducibility, clinical sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for cervical cancer and verified precancer (CIN 2,3). Testing should be restricted to high-risk (oncogenic) HPV types (i.e., 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 66), and testing for low-risk (nononcogenic) HPV types has no role; whenever "HPV testing" is referred to, it applies only to high-risk types. The document notes that a single colposcopic examination misses approximately one third of women with CIN 2,3.

4) Patient Scenarios Not Initially Addressed in the 2019 Guidelines:

Additional guidance was developed to address scenarios for which the 2019 Guidelines did not initially provide management recommendations. This guidance was voted on in July 2021 and previously published. To summarize, this guidance (1) outlined management guidelines for cytology results without HPV testing among individuals aged 25 years and older and (2) clarified management when previous guidelines had not been followed:

(a) Guideline for individuals aged 25 and older screened with cytology alone: For individuals aged 25 years or older screened with cytology alone, the 2012 guidelines should be followed. In the 2012 guidelines, colposcopy is recommended for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or a more severe cytologic interpretation.
(b) Guideline for cases in which colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed: In cases in which a colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed, the recommendation is for colposcopy if the previous result was high-grade cytology [atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), atypical glandular cells (AGC), HSIL, or a more severe cytologic interpretation]. If the previous cytology result was not high grade, and the patient undergoes repeat testing with HPV testing or cotesting instead of colposcopy: colposcopy is recommended if the result on repeat testing indicates a second consecutive HPV-positive result and/or persistent cytologic abnormality (ASC-US or a more severe cytologic interpretation); repeat HPV testing or cotesting in 1 year is acceptable if the result on repeat testing is HPV negative or cotest negative.

Harms and prevalence patterns — age-related positivity for human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytologic abnormalities decreases with age, with positive results occurring in about 30% of women aged 21 to 24 years compared with about 12% of those aged 30 to 34 years and 5% of those aged 60 to 64 years; cytologic abnormalities occur in about 13% of women aged 21 to 24 years, about 7% of those aged 30 to 34 years, and 3% of those aged 60 to 64 years. In a prepaid health plan setting, about 9% of women aged 30 to 64 years had either an abnormal cytologic test result or a positive HPV test result, and the prevalence of underlying CIN grade 2 or a more severe lesion ranges from 12% among women aged 21 to 24 years to 2.4% among those older than 50 years.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^d34eca65]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP risk-based management — one-year surveillance thresholds and indications are as follows: When the estimated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) risk is below the threshold for immediate colposcopy (4.0% immediate risk) and above the 3-year follow-up threshold (≥ 0.55% at 5 years), repeat testing in 1 year with human papillomavirus (HPV)-based testing is recommended (AII). Follow-up at 1 year is recommended after screening tests showing minimal abnormalities — HPV-positive/negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) or HPV-negative/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) with unknown previous screening history (immediate risks 2.1% and 1.9% respectively) — and after colposcopy with biopsies of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) or less preceded by a low-grade cotest result (defined as HPV-positive LSIL, HPV-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US], or repeated HPV-positive NILM). Because risk is substantially reduced after a documented negative HPV primary screening test or cotest or normal colposcopic examination with biopsy confirmation of less than CIN 2, 1-year surveillance, not colposcopy, is recommended for most patients with new HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL results after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within approximately 5 years or colposcopic examination less than CIN 2 within the past year. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds; patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk of 0.40%), and patients with a low-grade cotest result followed by colposcopy less than CIN 2 and a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold. A previous negative cytology result alone does not reduce subsequent risk like a negative HPV-based screen; therefore, cytology alone is not used to modify subsequent management recommendations.

III. Necessity of a Transition Plan

To get to a successful program of primary HPV testing, we will likely need a transition plan that incorporates a comprehensive and coordinated cervical cancer prevention approach: primary vaccination of all adolescents and young adults before exposure, screening either by cytology or HPV testing based on the feasibility and acceptability of these tests in different settings, increased use of primary HPV testing, as well as access to self-collected specimens for HPV testing, especially among women not currently being screened, as well as a simplified approach to management of abnormalities that takes into account both underlying risk, effectiveness, management options, human behavior, provider and patient preference, and cost.

The existence of effective technology and appropriate guidelines do not guarantee uptake or correct use with patients. For example, well studied advances in screening and prevention, such as cytology/HPV co-testing and HPV vaccination have been Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, recommended in consensus guidelines by most professional physician organizations, and widely available for more than 10 years, yet uptake has been slow and cervical cancer rates have not changed meaningfully. Confusion about how to manage abnormalities and inadequate systems to help busy providers manage screening test results has further impeded progress.

Although primary HPV screening is the ultimate goal, HPV testing is not yet available to most women. The only HPV test currently FDA approved for primary screening is the Cobas test, based on 3 years of initial data in the United States. However, many laboratories in the United States do not have Cobas testing but instead have machinery for HPV testing by other platforms currently only approved in the co-testing or reflex testing setting. Transitioning to other technology or awaiting FDA approval for other tests will take time. Although off-label use is an option, laboratories and healthcare organizations may not endorse this for primary screening of entire populations. Thus, many women do not currently have access to the only FDA-approved HPV test for primary screening. It is not clear whether these other tests will perform similarly in the screening setting and how and when (if other tests are not validated quickly or at all) patients will have access to appropriate testing. Furthermore, patients managed in research studies are followed according to highly controlled algorithms that include more frequent visits than those that might be recommended in guidelines. To feel comfortable recommending primary testing for all women at 5-year intervals, we need more studies in a variety of "real-world" settings.

3.2 Patient‐facing platform for addressing common gynecologic oncology concerns

What are the recommendations for screening tests routine for cervical cancer?

ChatGPT
Pap smear (Pap Test): The cervical smear test is the most common screening test for cervical cancer. It involves collecting cells from the cervix and examining them under a microscope to detect any abnormal changes. Starting at the age of 21 years, most guidelines recommend having a cervical smear every 3 years for women with a cervix.
HPV testing: HPV is a common sexually transmitted infection that can lead to cervical cancer. HPV testing is often done in conjunction with a cervical smear for women aged 30 years and older. It detects the presence of high‐risk HPV types that may cause cervical cell changes. If both the cervical smear and HPV test results are normal, screening intervals can be extended to every 5 years.
Co‐testing: In some cases, both cervical smear and HPV testing (co‐testing) may be performed together for women aged 30–65 years. If both tests are negative, the screening interval can be extended.
HPV vaccination: Vaccination against certain high‐risk HPV types is recommended for both females and males between the ages of 9 and 26 years. The HPV vaccine is most effective when administered before the onset of sexual activity.
Screening cessation: In general, cervical cancer screening can be stopped at the age of 65–70 years if a woman has had regular screenings in the past and her recent results are consistently normal. However, individual circumstances may vary, so it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate screening schedule.

G.2 Unsatisfactory Cytology

Guideline: For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) in 2 to 4 months is recommended (BIII). Triage using HPV testing is not recommended (DIII). Before repeat cytology, treatment to resolve atrophy or obscuring inflammation when a specific infection is present is acceptable (CIII). For patients 25 years and older who are cotested and have unsatisfactory cytology and a positive HPV test without genotyping, repeat cytology in 2 to 4 months or colposcopy is acceptable (BII). If a positive HPV test with partial genotyping is positive for HPV 16 or HPV 18, direct referral for colposcopy is recommended (BII) (see Figure 5).

FIGURE 5
This figure describes the steps involved in clinical management of unsatisfactory cytology. Note that "unknown genotype" refers to both HPV testing without genotyping, and HPV testing where genotyping is negative for HPV 16 and 18 but positive for other high-risk HPV types.

Rationale: Literature was reviewed from 2012 to 2019, and no evidence was found to change recommendations. – When cotesting is performed, a negative HPV test in the setting of an unsatisfactory cytology may reflect an inadequate sample. Although a negative HPV test (performed from the same vial as the cytology) may be adequate for testing even when the cytology cellularity is inadequate for diagnosis, interpreting the HPV result in the setting of insufficient cellularity has not been validated, which is of concern given that repeat testing is not recommended for up to 5 years after a negative HPV screen. Negative results on HPV tests that are not FDA approved for primary cervical cancer screening should not be considered valid in the absence of adequate cytology (Section F.3). In summary, a negative HPV result from a cotest with inadequate cellularity on cytology should not be interpreted as negative primary HPV test and should be repeated.

### The ASCCP cervical cancer screening task force endorsement and opinion on the American cancer society updated cervical cancer screening guidelines [^cc651f71]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). High credibility.

ASCCP cervical cancer screening endorsement — key positions and management statements are as follows: The ASCCP no longer endorses its 2012 cervical cancer screening guidelines that do not include primary HPV screening and recognizes the need to move toward primary HPV-based cervical cancer screening. The combination of abnormal results that occur from either guidance should be managed using the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines. Patients with signs or symptoms suspicious for cervical cancer (abnormal uterine bleeding, postcoital bleeding, pelvic pain, etc) should have a diagnostic evaluation even if screening tests are negative. Adequate prior cervical cancer screening within 10 years of negative results (3 consecutive negative cervical cytology results or 2 consecutive negative co-testing results) is required to exit from screening. Patients with high-grade precancerous lesions should be followed for at least 25 years even if this extends beyond 65 years of age — the upper limit for screening — as they are at increased risk. The USPSTF recommendations include all screening modalities, providing flexibility that may benefit those who are marginalized, underserved, or experiencing inequity and health disparities.

### Cervical cancer screening: evidence behind the guidelines [^ca522b1c]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Cervical cancer screening involves a complex process of cytology, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, colposcopy, and a multitude of algorithms for the identification of preinvasive disease and prevention of invasive disease. High-risk HPV is a prerequisite for the development of almost all types of cervical cancer; therefore, a test for high-risk HPV has become an integral part of new screening strategies. Major changes to screening guidelines in the last decade include initiation of screening at age 21 years, conservative management of young women with abnormal cytology, extended screening intervals for women age ≥ 30 years, and cessation of screening in low-risk women at age 65 years. This review will focus on the evidence that has led to the current evidence-based guidelines. Evidence regarding primary HPV testing as well as postvaccine-based screening strategies will also be reviewed.

HPV-based testing: this term is used in this document to describe the use of either cotesting or primary HPV screening for surveillance after abnormalities. It does not apply to reflex HPV testing for triage of ASC-US cytology in this document. The HPV testing and positive HPV results discussed throughout this document refer to high-risk HPV types only.

Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST): this term refers to 2-tiered pathology criteria for evaluating histologic specimens obtained via colposcopic biopsy

Primary HPV testing: testing with HPV testing alone as a screening or surveillance test.

Reflex testing: this means that laboratories should perform a specific additional triage test in the setting of a positive screening test to inform the next steps in management. For example, an ASC-US cytology should trigger a reflex HPV test. New for these guidelines, a positive a positive primary HPV screening test should trigger both a reflex genotyping test (to determine the presence/absence of HPV 16/18 if that information is not included in the initial primary test result) and also a reflex cytology test to determine whether the patient would be a candidate for expedited management.

ASCCP risk-based management — initial HPV-based screening risks and intervals: At the initial HPV-based screen for patients new to HPV testing in KPNC aged 25–65 years, the immediate CIN 3+ risk is 0.45%. At the first visit, 1,546,262 people were screened and 92% had a primary HPV-negative result; for those with a negative screen, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is 0.14%, and a 5-year screening interval is recommended. Among the 8% initially HPV-positive, immediate CIN 3+ risk was 2.1% for HPV-positive NILM, 4.3% for HPV-positive ASC-US, 4.9% for HPV-positive LSIL, and 49% for HPV-positive HSIL.

FIGUR'E 1
This figure demonstrates how patient risk is evaluated. For a given current results and history combination, the immediate CIN 3+ risk is examined. If this risk is 4% or greater, immediate management via colposcopy or treatment is indicated. If the immediate risk is less than 4%, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is examined to determine whether patients should return in 1, 3, or 5 years.

The 5-year return Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after a negative screening test using HPV testing or cotesting in the general population, for whom retesting in 5 years is recommended by national screening guidelines. Patients with risks at or below this threshold are recommended to receive routine screening at 5-year intervals with HPV-based testing (Section E.1).
The 3-year return Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after a negative cervical cytology screen in the general population, for whom retesting in 3 years is recommended by national screening guidelines. Patients with risks at or below this threshold but above the 5-year threshold are recommended to receive HPV-based testing in 3 years (Section E.1).
One-year return is recommended for patients with risks above the 3-year threshold but below the Clinical Action Threshold for colposcopy (Section E.1).
The colposcopy Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL screening result in the general population, for whom colposcopy is recommended in the 2012 guidelines. Patients with risks at or above this threshold but below the expedited treatment threshold are recommended to receive colposcopy (Section E.2).
The expedited treatment or colposcopy acceptable Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) cytology screening result in the general population. Patients with risks at or above this threshold but below the expedited treatment preferred threshold are recommended to receive counseling from their providers to choose between evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy or expedited treatment (Section E.3). Expedited treatment is defined as treatment without confirmatory colposcopic biopsy.
The expedited treatment preferred Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology screening result in the general population. It is preferred that patients with risks at or above this threshold receive expedited treatment unless they are pregnant, younger than 25 years, or have concerns about the potential effects of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes that outweigh concerns about cancer (Section E.3).
Of note, patients with histologic HSIL (CIN 2) who have chosen observation are recommended to receive colposcopy and HPV-based testing at 6-month intervals (Section I.3).

In women in whom cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN 2,3) is not identified, follow-up with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing at 12 months or cytological testing at 6 months and 12 months is acceptable (CIII). Referral to colposcopy is recommended for women who subsequently test positive for HPV DNA or who are found to have ASC-US or greater on their repeat cytological tests (BII). If the HPV DNA test is negative or if 2 consecutive repeat cytological tests are "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy", return to routine cytological screening is recommended (AI). If CIN 2,3 is identified, manage per ASCCP Guideline.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^d4a6f45e]. CA (2020). High credibility.

HPV-based testing in individuals younger than 30 years — the new recommendation states primary HPV testing is preferred and both cotesting and cytology alone are acceptable transitional strategies from age 25 years for all individuals; randomized trials enrolled women to start screening at age 25 years, and HPV positivity was substantially higher in women younger than 30 to 35 years (13.1%) than in those aged > 35 years (5.8%), making colposcopy rates higher in younger women, while positive cytology rates were similar across age groups (4% vs 3.1%); recent guidelines recommend HPV-based screening via cotesting beginning at age 30 years or stand-alone primary HPV testing beginning at age 25 years or at age 30 years, with clear evidence of superior sensitivity of HPV-based testing compared with cytology across all age groups.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: methods for risk estimation, recommended management, and validation [^e3116af8]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The new risk-based management consensus guidelines will use risk and clinical action thresholds to determine the appropriate course of management of cervical screening abnormalities. These risk-based management guidelines represent an evolution of the 2012 guidelines, which incorporated human papillomavirus (HPV) test results into an existing cytology-based management framework by benchmarking 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or higher (CIN 3+) after HPV-cytology cotest results to that of cytology-only results. Since 2013, screening has continued to evolve with HPV vaccination, the introduction of new screening technology, and new knowledge of how history of negative HPV testing changes the clinical meaning of test results. To address these changes while ensuring that future revisions to management guidelines are equitable and simple to apply, the 2019 guidelines will move from result-based management (e.g. "colposcopic referral for HPV-positive ASC-US cytology") to risk-based management (e.g. "colposcopic referral when immediate risk of having CIN 3+ is 4% or greater").

In this article, we described the additional data sources and improved risk estimation methods used to estimate risks that support the 2019 guidelines. For each management scenario and past/current test result combination, we produced a risk profile of CIN grade 2 or higher (CIN 2+), CIN 3+, and cancer risks from the time of the current test until 5 years after the current test. We formalized how risk is used to determine the recommended risk-based management through the use of clinical action thresholds. Finally, we validated risk estimates by examining portability of risk-based management to diverse settings, including underinsured and underserved patients, using risks estimated from 3 independent, previously unpublished cohorts/trials and one published comparison.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^51a49b78]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society 2020 cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk — The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends initiating screening at age 25 years with primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing every 5 years through age 65 years (preferred). If primary HPV testing is not available, individuals aged 25 to 65 years should be screened with cotesting (HPV testing in combination with cytology) every 5 years or cytology alone every 3 years (acceptable) (strong recommendation). The ACS recommends that individuals aged > 65 years with no history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe disease within the past 25 years and with documented adequate negative prior screening in the prior 10 years discontinue all cervical cancer screening (qualified recommendation). These recommendations differ in 4 important respects compared with the 2012 recommendations: the preferred strategy is primary HPV testing every 5 years, with cotesting and cytology alone acceptable when access to US Food and Drug Administration–approved primary HPV testing is not yet available; the recommended age to start screening is 25 years rather than 21 years; primary HPV testing, as well as cotesting or cytology alone when primary testing is not available, is recommended starting at age 25 years rather than age 30 years; and the guideline is transitional in that options for cotesting or cytology alone are provided but should be phased out once full access to primary HPV testing is available without barriers. Follow-up for individuals who screen positive for HPV and/or cytology should be in accordance with the 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^895ef3ca]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Cervical cancer — USPSTF screening recommendations for persons with a cervix at average risk specify that among these persons, screening should be performed starting at age 21 years and continue through age 65 years. Testing can be performed using either conventional or liquid-based cytologic tests (i.e. Pap tests), and for persons aged ≥ 30 years, screening can include FDA-cleared tests for high-risk, oncogenic types of HPV. Annual cervical cancer screening is not recommended for persons at average risk; instead, cytology testing is recommended every 3 years for persons aged 21–29 years, and for persons aged 30–65 years, a cytology test every 3 years, an HPV test alone every 5 years, or a cytology test plus an HPV test (cotest) every 5 years is recommended. Cervical screening programs should screen those who have received HPV vaccination in the same manner as those that are unvaccinated, and screening is not recommended before age 21 years among those at average risk. For those aged 30–65 years, cytology alone or primary HPV testing is preferred by USPSTF; however, cotesting can be used as an alternative approach. For cytopathologic testing, clinics should use CLIA-certified laboratories using acceptable terminology (Bethesda 2001 or LAST terminology).

Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines Should Be Aspirational, Focusing on Best Practices for the Future, as Represented by HPV Testing Alone at 5-Year Intervals

Philip E. Castle, PhD, MPH

I. Introduction: Benefits and Harms

A current, impassioned debate about cervical-cancer prevention in the United States is how (cytology vs. HPV and cytology "co-testing" vs. HPV testing alone) and how frequently (once every 3–5 years) to screen adult women for prevention of cervical cancer. Screening for any disease in the general, average-risk population is a public-health intervention. Most people undergoing screening, even those who screen positive, will be healthy with respect to the target disease. The average lifetime risk of cervical cancer in an unscreened population is estimated to be approximately 2%. Thus, the consequences of screening to the 98% of women who will never get cervical cancer must factor into the decision about who and how to screen. Guidelines for screening must consider factors such as costs/cost-effectiveness and potential harms to healthy individuals in making recommendations for who should get screened and how often.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^41fd94a7]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Cervical cancer screening — cytology (Pap test) and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing protocols are specified for test use, timing, and special situations. Cytology (Pap tests) and HPV tests should not be considered screening tests for STIs, and all persons with a cervix should receive cervical cancer screening regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. A conventional cytology test should ideally be scheduled for 10–20 days after the first day of menses, whereas liquid-based cytology can be performed at any time during the menstrual cycle. The presence of a mucopurulent discharge should not postpone cytology testing, and the test can be performed after removal with a saline-soaked cotton swab. HPV testing can be performed either as a separate test or by using material from the liquid-based cytology specimen, and the presence of external genital warts does not warrant more frequent cervical cancer screening. Persons who have had a total hysterectomy with removal of the cervix do not require screening unless cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2), CIN 3, or adenocarcinoma in situ was diagnosed within the previous 20 years; if the cervix remains intact after a supracervical hysterectomy, regularly scheduled Pap tests should be performed as indicated. The use of instruments designed to sample the cervical transformation zone (e.g., cytobrushes) improves the accuracy of cytology tests, and both liquid-based and conventional cytology are acceptable because they have similar test-performance characteristics. At an initial visit, providers should ask patients about their recent cytology test and HPV results and any history of evaluation and treatment; effort should be made to obtain copies of recent results, and the importance and frequency of screening should be reinforced.

### HPV cotesting of unsatisfactory Papanicolaou tests: implications for follow-up intervals [^cc6d521e]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The 2019 American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology management guidelines recommend that patients with an unsatisfactory Papanicolaou (Pap) test (UPT) and negative human papillomavirus (HPV) cotest undergo repeat age-based screening in 2 to 4 months. The rationale is that a negative HPV test in the setting of an UPT may reflect an inadequate sample and therefore should not be interpreted as truly "negative". For patients 25 years and older who are cotested, if HPV is positive for the 16 or 18 genotypes, direct referral for colposcopy is recommended. Our study aimed to determine if a negative HPV cotest result is predictive of the absence of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and whether these patients may be called back for repeat testing at an interval longer than 2 to 4 months.

Methods

Follow-up cervical cytology and biopsy results in women with UPT and HPV cotests from January 2017 to December 2021 were collected. Original UPT and HPV cotest results were correlated with the follow-up Pap and biopsy results.

Results

There were 1,496 (2.28%) UPT cases out of 65,641 total Pap tests. Among the 1,496 UPT cases, 1,010 (67.5%) had HPV cotesting; 676 (45.1%) were followed by repeat Pap or biopsy within 4 months and 850 (56.8%) within 12 months. The total follow-up rate was 81%, with a range of 3 days to 36 months. The HSIL rate in HPV-positive cases was 5.7% (3/53) vs 0.4% (2/539) (P = 0.006) in HPV-negative cases. In UPT, HPV cotesting showed negative predictive values for low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion detection of 98.5% and 99.6%, respectively, while positive predictive values were 19% and 5.7%.

Conclusions

A negative HPV cotest in individuals with UPT predicted the lack of HSIL in our study. Compliance with the recommended follow-up time of 2 to 4 months for women with UPT was low (45.1%). Our study suggests that women with UPT and negative HPV cotest may be safely called back at an interval longer than 4 months.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^b3cee916]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

History of HPV-positive results — follow-up after HPV-positive NILM with a subsequent negative cotest should be shorter because risk remains elevated; specifically, after HPV-positive NILM a negative cotest is recommended to be followed up in 1 year rather than 3 years because the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is 0.9% compared with the 0.55% 3-year surveillance threshold, and after only 2 negative cotests the interval can be extended to 3 years when the 5-year CIN 3+ risk drops to 0.29%.

### Are health care professionals prepared to implement human papillomavirus testing? A review of psychosocial determinants of human papillomavirus test acceptability in primary cervical cancer screening [^9b0cce65]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Guidelines for cervical cancer screening have been updated to include human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, which is more sensitive compared to cytology in detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Because of its increased sensitivity, a negative HPV test is more reassuring for a woman that she is at low risk for precancerous cervical lesions than a negative Pap test. Prompted by the inadequate translation of HPV test-based screening guidelines into practice, we aimed to synthesize the literature regarding health care providers (HCPs) knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to HPV testing and the influence of psychosocial factors on HCPs acceptability of HPV testing in primary cervical cancer screening. Materials and Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Health, and Web of Science for journal articles from January 1, 1980 to July 25, 2018. A narrative synthesis of HCPs knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to HPV testing is provided. Informed by the Patient Pathway framework, we used deductive thematic analysis to synthesize the influence of psychosocial factors on HCPs acceptability of HPV testing. Results: The most important HCP knowledge gaps are related to the superior sensitivity of the HPV test and age-specific guideline recommendations for HPV testing. Thirty to fifty percent of HCPs are not compliant with guideline recommendations for HPV testing, for example, screening at shorter intervals than recommended. Barriers, facilitators, and contradictory evidence of HCPs' acceptability of the HPV test are grouped by category: (1) factors related to the HCP; (2) patient intrinsic factors; (3) factors corresponding to HCP's practice environment; and (4) health care system factors. Conclusions: HCP's adherence to guidelines for HPV testing in cervical cancer screening is suboptimal and could be improved by specialty organizations ensuring consistency across guidelines. Targeted educational interventions to address barriers of HPV test acceptability identified in this review may facilitate the translation of HPV testing recommendations into practice.

TABLE 3
Projected Outcomes From Different Treatment or Colposcopy Referral Thresholds Per 1 Million Patients Screened

To inform the 0.55% 5-year CIN 3+ risk threshold for a 3-year return, the surveillance group used the 5-year CIN 3+ risk of NILM as a benchmark (because 2012 guidelines recommended a 3-year return for NILM). We projected the 5-year CIN 3+ risks after an NILM result for different percentages of HPV positivity. If the proportion of HPV positive among NILM is 4.5% (KPNC is 4.4%), the risk of NILM would be 0.33%. If the proportion of HPV positive among NILM is 7% (CDC is 6.9% and 7.1% for well screened and screened rarely/never/unknown populations, respectively), the risk of NILM would be 0.45%. The 0.55% 5-year CIN 3+ risk corresponds to an HPV positivity of 9% among NILM cytology results and is close to the 0.52% risk estimated in the New Mexico Pap Registry. Similarly, to inform the 0.15% clinical action thresholds for a 5-year return, the surveillance group used the 5-year CIN 3+ risk of HPV negative at the KPNC as a benchmark, which is 0.14% with a 95% upper confidence limit of 0.15%.

### High-risk HPV testing in women 30 years or older with negative Papanicolaou tests: initial clinical experience with 18-month follow-up [^90f59813]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Cervical screening with combined cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) detection has been approved for women 30 years or older. We investigated the clinical use of cotesting for women with negative Papanicolaou tests. Follow-up cytology, HR-HPV test, and biopsy findings were identified during an 18-month period. In 1 year, 2,719 cotests from 2,686 women were identified; 146 were positive for HR-HPV. Among women with positive HR-HPV testing, 120 had follow-up, including 70 with repeated cotesting, and 3 had high-grade dysplasia identified (2.5% of women with follow-up). In 1,334 women with initial double-negative cotest results who had repeated cytologic testing within 18 months, 2 high-grade dysplasias were found (0.1%). The vast majority of cotest results are double-negative. Among tests that show HR-HPV positivity, the prevalence of underlying high-grade dysplasia is low. About half of all women who undergo cotesting receive follow-up that is not in accord with published guidelines.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^98c4a706]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Primary HPV screening follow-up and expedited treatment — When primary HPV testing is used for screening, cytology testing should be performed for all positive HPV test results to help determine the next steps in management, ideally as a laboratory reflex test from the same specimen so the patient does not need to return to the clinic. Colposcopy is recommended if HPV genotyping is positive for types 16 or 18, and it can be considered if it is infeasible for the patient to return for cytology alone. HPV 16 is the highest-risk HPV type. Expedited treatment should be considered for HSIL cytology results, and colposcopy is recommended in all other cases, even if the cytology test is normal. When considering treatment without confirmatory biopsy, shared decision-making with the patient is important, including age, concern about cancer, ability to follow up, financial concerns, and concerns about the potential effect of treatment on a future pregnancy.

HPV genotyping — oncogenic types and cancer attribution: Epidemiological data indicate that "approximately 13 types of HPV should be classified as oncogenic", yet "just 3 types of HPV, 16, 18, and 45, are associated with 77% of all cervical cancers". "HPV-18 seems to be particularly important for invasive adenocarcinoma, accounting for 37% of such cancers and for up to 32% of cervical adenocarcinomas". In cytology-negative, high-risk HPV DNA–positive women, infections with "HPV-16 and HPV-18" "accounts for most cases of CIN 2,3 subsequently identified".
