## Question

brown cursty skin on bilateral lower extremities

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "brown crusty skin on bilateral lower extremities" — what it might be, how to evaluate it, and what to do. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the morphology and distribution to frame the likely pathobiology. Then, I should generate and prioritize a differential diagnosis anchored to common vascular and inflammatory etiologies while not missing infections and neoplasms. Next, I will elicit targeted history and perform a focused exam to separate mimics. After that, I need to outline tiered diagnostics, including when to culture, scrape, image, and biopsy. Finally, I will consider initial management pathways and red flags that warrant urgent referral or expedited biopsy, keeping in mind the high misdiagnosis rate of "bilateral cellulitis" and the need for verification at each step [^111ZKv3w] [^114AhEfn].

> Let me first confirm the morphologic signals. "Brown" on the lower legs often reflects hemosiderin deposition from chronic venous hypertension (stasis dermatitis), postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, or melanin changes, whereas "crusty" can denote secondary impetiginization, serum/hemorrhagic crust over erosions/ulcers, or primary hyperkeratosis in verrucous plaques; bilateral involvement points me toward systemic or symmetric local processes such as venous insufficiency rather than a single-focus infection, so I should not jump to cellulitis without corroboration [^114qFJMU] [^111ZKv3w].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "bilateral cellulitis". I should double-check the literature: up to about one-third of presumed lower-limb cellulitis is ultimately something else, underscoring the need to slow down, examine symmetry, chronicity, and associated findings before committing to antibiotics and an infection label [^114AhEfn] [^111rjLNJ].

> I will now prioritize the differential with vascular/volume etiologies first. Stasis dermatitis from chronic venous insufficiency is most common, presenting with bilateral erythema, scale, pruritus, and brown hyperpigmentation that can crust if secondarily infected or if there are exudative erosions; hemosiderin-laden macrophages are typical histologically, which I should keep in mind if biopsy is needed [^114qFJMU]. Next, lipodermatosclerosis suggests advanced venous disease with bound-down, sclerotic, hyperpigmented plaques that may ulcerate and crust; demographic and duplex data often show venous abnormalities, so I should consider venous imaging if the exam supports it [^1144KF8Y]. Lastly, bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema (BLEIL) can mimic cellulitis after prolonged exertion with diffuse erythema and edema; wait, I should verify — primary crusting is not typical early, but chronic cases can show secondary changes, so timeline and context matter [^115Gat1N] [^112zZJxU].

> Next, I should review infectious causes that can produce crust. Ecthyma/impetigo presents with crusted ulcers or pustules; if I see purulent exudate, I need to obtain Gram stain and culture to determine staphylococcal or streptococcal involvement before finalizing therapy, rather than presuming empiric coverage will suffice [^112bwZ7j]. Crusted scabies can cause bilateral hyperkeratotic crusted plaques, often in diabetics or the immunosuppressed; I need to check for pruritus (which may be minimal) and confirm with scrapings for mites, eggs, and scybala to avoid missing a highly contagious infestation [^11431jGS]. But wait, what if an immunosuppressed patient presents with bilateral "cellulitis-like" lower-leg lesions — disseminated cryptococcosis can do this; in that scenario, I should confirm with biopsy and fungal cultures rather than escalating anti-bacterial therapy alone [^1139UY9S].

> Let me consider inflammatory/autoimmune mimics. Verrucous cutaneous sarcoidosis can present as chronic verrucous plaques on the lower legs; I should confirm with histology showing noncaseating granulomas and exclude infection with special stains and cultures before labeling it sarcoidosis [^116wmf8B]. Necrobiosis lipoidica on the shins (often in diabetes) can ulcerate and crust; I need to remember that chronic ulcers can complicate with squamous cell carcinoma over time, so changing lesions deserve biopsy rather than prolonged empiric topical care alone [^114UAASh] [^116rXSPw]. Pyoderma gangrenosum presents as painful ulcers with undermined borders; although not primarily crusted, overlying crust can occur — diagnosis remains one of exclusion, so I should rule out infection and vasculopathy before increasing immunosuppression [^113CHojB].

> I need to ensure neoplastic causes are not overlooked. Kaposi sarcoma can produce violaceous plaques of the lower legs, including in HIV-negative patients on JAK inhibitors; if I suspect it, I should biopsy and request HHV-8 immunohistochemistry rather than assuming an inflammatory plaque [^112wMLRW]. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma can arise in chronic ulcers or scars; if a plaque is indurated, exophytic, or changing, I should obtain a sufficiently deep biopsy per NCCN and not delay oncologic evaluation if suspicious features are present [^116fzSdn]. Leukemia cutis belongs on the radar if there are papules, nodules, or plaques on the legs in a patient with hematologic disease; histologic confirmation is essential because clinical appearances overlap with inflammatory and infectious entities [^115jfVkU].

> But wait, I should also consider metabolic/dermatologic entities that simulate "brown crust". Diabetic dermopathy causes bilateral brown, scaly shin patches that can appear atrophic more than crusted; coexistence with infections or ulcers in poorly controlled diabetes is common, so I should verify glycemic control and screen for other diabetes-related complications if suspected [^112Xh3TG].

> Next, I should elicit a targeted history to refine probabilities. I need to check for venous risk factors (varicose veins, prior DVT, prolonged standing, obesity), symptoms of heaviness and edema that worsen during the day, and prior ulcers, which push me toward venous stasis or lipodermatosclerosis [^111ZKv3w] [^1144KF8Y]. I should confirm diabetes, immunosuppression, HIV risk, or immunomodulator use to recalibrate the likelihood of crusted scabies, KS, or opportunistic infections, and I must clarify time course — chronic months–years favors venous disease or sarcoidosis; acute days–weeks with tenderness or purulence raises bacterial infection higher on the list [^115uKspM] [^112zZJxU]. Pruritus suggests eczema or scabies; fever, pain, and drainage suggest infection; and bleeding/bruising or systemic symptoms open vasculitis or hematologic pathways, which I should not miss.

> I will now examine the lesions with intent to separate phenotypes. For stasis dermatitis, I expect ill-defined erythematous, scaly patches with brown hyperpigmentation, often above the medial malleoli, plus edema and varicosities; lipodermatosclerosis feels indurated and bound-down with an "inverted champagne bottle" contour; I should confirm these tactile clues with careful palpation [^114qFJMU] [^1144KF8Y]. Ecthyma should reveal crusted, punched-out ulcerations with surrounding erythema; if I see purulent material, I'll culture before antibiotics; verrucous sarcoidosis appears as well-demarcated exophytic hyperkeratotic plaques; Kaposi sarcoma appears as violaceous macules to plaques and nodules that may be asymmetric despite bilateral distribution, so hue and evolution matter [^112bwZ7j] [^116wmf8B] [^112wMLRW]. Hold on, I should verify symmetry and extent — symmetric bilateral findings support venous eczema or systemic inflammatory disease; marked asymmetry, fluctuance, or focal warmth raises localized infection or neoplasm higher [^111ZKv3w].

> For initial diagnostics (Tier 1), I need to ensure safety and avoid iatrogenesis. Before prescribing compression for suspected venous disease, I should confirm arterial sufficiency — an ankle-brachial index helps prevent harm from unrecognized peripheral arterial disease, which I should not overlook [^112zZJxU]. If exam and history suggest venous hypertension, a venous duplex ultrasound can document reflux or obstruction, helping align treatment and prognosis; rare micro-AVFs exist, so persistent warmth/redness with duplex abnormalities may need vascular input [^1144KF8Y] [^112CyfNh]. Laboratory screening with CBC, inflammatory markers, and HbA1c can contextualize infection and metabolic control; if there is purulence or crusted ulcers, I should obtain Gram stain and culture rather than treating blindly; for pruritic hyperkeratotic crusted plaques in at-risk patients, I will perform skin scrapings for scabies microscopy to avoid missed infestations [^112bwZ7j] [^11431jGS] [^114KEFY5].

> Now, for targeted advanced testing (Tier 2), I should decide when to biopsy and what to request. Indications include lesions persisting beyond a month without clear diagnosis, atypical verrucous or indurated plaques, rapidly changing or ulcerating areas, or failure of appropriate empiric therapy; in such cases, I need to request a biopsy that includes deep reticular dermis for suspected neoplasia or sclerosing processes per NCCN, and add special stains/cultures if infection is on the table [^116fzSdn] [^114UAASh]. If leukemia cutis is in the differential, I must seek histologic confirmation because clinical overlap with nonleukemic dermatoses is common; this prevents misclassification and delays in hematologic workup [^115jfVkU]. Hold on, I should verify that I included appropriate stains: AFB, fungal, and PAS for granulomatous or verrucous plaques to exclude infections before labeling sarcoidosis or PG, which is critical to avoid harmful immunosuppression [^116wmf8B] [^113CHojB].

> Let me consider initial management pathways while I continue verification. If the phenotype supports venous stasis dermatitis without arterial compromise, I should begin leg elevation, emollients, medium-potency topical corticosteroids for eczematous inflammation, and graded compression, escalating to venous interventions if refractory; I'll reinforce skin care to reduce secondary impetiginization and ulcer risk [^114UAASh] [^112zZJxU]. For ecthyma/impetigo with positive cultures or strong clinical suspicion, I should follow IDSA guidance for pathogen-directed therapy rather than empiric, prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotics; if MRSA risk is high, I'll tailor accordingly after culture results return [^112bwZ7j]. For crusted scabies, I should initiate isolation precautions and combination therapy with topical permethrin and oral ivermectin per severity, verifying response with repeat scrapings to document clearance, especially in institutional settings [^11431jGS].

> I should confirm urgent red flags and referral triggers. Rapidly progressive, painful ulcers with violaceous undermined borders, livedo with necrosis, or systemic toxicity warrant urgent dermatology/rheumatology evaluation to exclude vasculopathy, PG, or invasive infection; delaying biopsy or comprehensive labs risks harm [^114UAASh] [^115uKspM]. Indurated or exophytic plaques that evolve or bleed require prompt biopsy to exclude SCC; violaceous plaques/papules in at-risk patients need evaluation for Kaposi sarcoma with HHV-8 staining and systemic staging when appropriate [^116fzSdn] [^112wMLRW]. In immunosuppressed hosts with atypical bilateral lower-leg lesions, I should expedite biopsy and fungal/mycobacterial studies to avoid anchoring on bacterial cellulitis alone [^1139UY9S].

> Hmm, wait a minute, let me also guard against common pitfalls. Assuming "bilateral erythema equals cellulitis" leads to unnecessary admissions and antibiotics; I must re-examine for stasis and lymphedema features before labeling infection [^114AhEfn]. Forgetting to culture purulent crusts or to perform scabies scrapings can prolong disease and fuel outbreaks; I should confirm microbiology rather than treating empirically when feasible [^112bwZ7j] [^11431jGS]. Applying compression without checking ABI risks ischemic injury, so I need to document arterial sufficiency first; overlooking neoplastic transformation in chronic plaques or miscalling verrucous psoriasis as carcinoma without clinicopathologic correlation can lead to overtreatment or undertreatment — I should align histology and clinical course thoughtfully before definitive therapy [^112zZJxU] [^116twkwr] [^116fzSdn].

Brown crusty skin on bilateral lower extremities most commonly reflects **chronic venous insufficiency** with stasis dermatitis and hemosiderin deposition, often with secondary infection or eczema [^114qFJMU] [^115uKspM]. Other causes include diabetic dermopathy [^112Xh3TG] and lichen simplex chronicus; less commonly, vasculitis, cutaneous lymphoma, or malignancy [^116s4Ni2] [^116fzSdn]. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by **duplex ultrasound** [^112CyfNh], with biopsy for atypical or non-healing lesions [^116fzSdn]. Management centers on compression, skin care, and treating the underlying venous disease [^114UAASh]; persistent or atypical lesions require biopsy to exclude malignancy or vasculitis [^116fzSdn] [^116s4Ni2].

## Common causes of brown crusty skin lesions

### Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and stasis dermatitis

In chronic venous insufficiency with stasis dermatitis, venous hypertension causes hemosiderin deposition, eczematous changes, and a predisposition to secondary infection [^114qFJMU]. Clinical features typically include bilateral medial ankle and leg **hyperpigmentation**, scaling, crusting, edema, varicosities, and possible **ulceration**. Complications include lipodermatosclerosis, venous ulcers, secondary infection, and, rarely, malignant transformation [^1144KF8Y] [^114UAASh] [^114qFJMU].

---

### Diabetic dermopathy

Pathophysiology involves **microangiopathy** leading to brown, atrophic, scaly shin lesions; **clinical features** are bilateral, asymptomatic, round or oval brown macules/patches with fine scale, common in diabetes.

---

### Lichen simplex chronicus

Pathophysiology reflects chronic scratching with **lichenification** due to pruritus or neuropathy; **clinical features** include thickened, hyperpigmented, crusted plaques with accentuated skin lines, often bilateral.

---

### Secondary infection or eczema

In chronic venous disease, the **pathophysiology** involves superimposed infection or eczematous inflammation; **clinical features** include crusting, oozing, erythema, pruritus, and possible malodor [^115uKspM] [^111ZKv3w].

---

## Less common but serious conditions

### Vasculitis

Pathophysiology is **small- or medium-vessel inflammation** causing purpura, ulceration, and necrosis; **clinical features** are painful purpuric lesions with ulceration and systemic symptoms such as fever and arthralgia [^116s4Ni2].

---

### Cutaneous lymphoma

Pathophysiology involves **malignant lymphoid infiltration** of the skin; **clinical features** include persistent plaques or nodules, sometimes crusted or ulcerated, that may mimic eczema or psoriasis [^115jfVkU].

---

### Malignancy (squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma)

In malignancy (squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma), the **pathophysiology** reflects malignant transformation driven by chronic inflammation or UV exposure; **clinical features** are persistent, non-healing, crusted lesions with irregular borders, bleeding, or rapid growth [^116fzSdn].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical evaluation

For clinical evaluation, obtain a **history** of duration, progression, pruritus, pain, trauma, systemic symptoms, and comorbidities (venous disease, diabetes). The **physical examination** should assess distribution, symmetry, edema, varicosities, ulceration, and lymphadenopathy [^112zZJxU].

---

### Laboratory and imaging studies

Laboratory and imaging studies include **duplex ultrasound** to assess venous insufficiency or obstruction and skin biopsy for atypical, non-healing, or suspicious lesions to exclude malignancy or vasculitis [^112CyfNh] [^116fzSdn] [^116s4Ni2]. Laboratory tests may include CBC, ESR/CRP, glucose, HbA1c, and an autoimmune panel when vasculitis is suspected.

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

- **Compression therapy**: Graduated compression stockings for venous hypertension [^114UAASh].
- **Skin care**: Emollients, topical corticosteroids for eczema, antifungals/antibiotics for infection [^111ZKv3w] [^115uKspM].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, leg elevation, exercise, smoking cessation.

---

### Medical and surgical interventions

- **Venous interventions**: Sclerotherapy, endovenous ablation, or surgery for severe venous disease [^114UAASh].
- **Systemic therapy**: Immunosuppressants for vasculitis or cutaneous lymphoma.
- **Surgical excision**: Persistent or malignant lesions [^116fzSdn].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

- **Ulceration**: Chronic venous ulcers, difficult to heal [^114UAASh].
- **Infection**: Cellulitis, osteomyelitis, sepsis [^115uKspM].
- **Malignancy**: Squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma [^116fzSdn] [^114qFJMU].
- **Functional impairment**: Reduced mobility, chronic pain, decreased quality of life [^112zZJxU].

---

Brown crusty skin on bilateral lower extremities most often reflects **venous stasis dermatitis** with hemosiderin deposition, but diabetic dermopathy, lichen simplex chronicus, and secondary infection are also common contributors. Atypical or non-healing lesions warrant biopsy to exclude malignancy or vasculitis [^116fzSdn] [^116s4Ni2]. Management should address venous disease, skin care, and complications to prevent ulcers, infection, and malignancy [^114UAASh].

### Initial presentation of stasis dermatitis mimicking solitary lesions: A previously unrecognized clinical scenario [^114qFJMU]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Stasis dermatitis is a common skin condition secondary to chronic venous insufficiency. Characteristic dermatologic changes in well-developed disease include bilateral erythematous, scaly, and slightly discolored papules and plaques on the lower legs. Earlier signs, such as prominent superficial veins and pitting ankle edema, are well known. Early recognition of signs and appropriate diagnosis can lead to timely treatment that can prevent painful complications, such as leg ulcers, which are at risk for development of squamous cell carcinoma.

- **Objective**: Herein we describe a yet unrecognized early sign of venous dermatitis — a solitary lesion, some mimicking neoplastic processes.

- **Methods**: Thirty-seven cases of stasis dermatitis submitted with the clinical diagnosis of a solitary lesion were identified. Thirty-three had no clinical history of venous insufficiency. All cases of stasis dermatitis presenting for the first time as a solitary lesion were reviewed retrospectively both clinically and pathologically.

- **Results**: Squamous cell carcinoma was most commonly suspected (33%), followed by basal cell carcinoma (24%), and a variety of other solitary lesions. The histopathology was characteristic of stasis dermatitis in all cases with absent or mild spongiosis (82%). Variable acanthosis and dermal fibrosis, and proliferation of papillary dermal thick-walled vessels were prominent (2–3+) in nearly all cases (≥ 90%) along with hemosiderin-laden macrophages and extravasated red blood cells (≥ 95%).

- **Limitations**: The study is limited by its retrospective nature.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: Part II. Conditions that simulate lower limb cellulitis [^111ZKv3w]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Several common conditions can mimic cellulitis, creating a potential for misdiagnosis and incorrect management. The most common disorders mistaken for lower limb cellulitis include venous eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, irritant dermatitis, and lymphedema. Dermatologists are often consulted when a patient has not responded to therapy, emphasizing the need for a thorough understanding of the differential diagnosis. This article focuses on entities that can mimic cellulitis, with an emphasis on elements of the history and physical examination that can help distinguish between lower limb cellulitis and its simulators.

### Lipodermatosclerosis: Review of cases evaluated at Mayo Clinic [^1144KF8Y]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Lipodermatosclerosis describes bound-down, sclerotic skin involving the lower extremities. Our purpose was to describe the demographic and clinical features of patients with lipodermatosclerosis. This retrospective study analyzed patients presenting to the Mayo Clinic between 1976 and 1998 with a diagnosis of lipodermatosclerosis.

Results indicated that, of 97 patients, 84 (87%) were women. The mean age was 62 years (range, 25–88 years), and the mean body mass index was 34.3 (range, 17.8–71.5). Clinical signs included bilateral involvement in 44 patients (45%), induration localized to a discrete plaque in 49 (51%), erythema in 69 (71%), hyperpigmentation in 57 (59%), ulceration in 13 (13%), concomitant edema in 69 (71%), and varicosities in 55 (57%). Vascular studies performed on 72 patients revealed abnormalities in 49, with deep venous incompetence in 33 (67%), calf muscle pump abnormality in 19 (39%), abnormal pulsatility in 10 (20%), and obstruction in 1 (2%).

In conclusion, lipodermatosclerosis was associated with female sex, middle age, high body mass index, and venous abnormalities.

### Persistent papules and plaques in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^1166XcKC]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

A 6-year-old girl presented with nightly fever and persistent joint pain in the knees, ankles, lower back, and hip. Her skin lesions included evanescent salmon-colored patches and persistent pruritic light to dark pink papules and plaques on her face, post-auricular scalp, trunk, thigh, and bilateral upper extremities. A skin biopsy supported the diagnosis of fixed papules and plaques of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). We report this case to highlight the diagnostic features of this exceedingly rare cutaneous presentation of sJIA, presenting with typical cutaneous salmon-colored evanescent eruptions.

### An unusual presentation of Vilanova disease (erythema nodosum migrans) with superficial histologic changes [^115xQrmH]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

This case shows the importance of considering erythema nodosum migrans (ENM) in the differential diagnosis of suspected morphea, necrobiosis lipoidica, and lower limb cellulitis. Certain variants of the disease may present with vascular changes in the dermis, as was seen in our case. This finding is quite atypical, and the diagnosis is made primarily based on the characteristic septal subcutaneous panniculitis. Although ENM is a variant of erythema nodosum (EN), the correct diagnosis is essential for appropriate management and patient care.

### Bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema after an ultramarathon [^115Gat1N]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema (BLEIL) was first described in 2015 among military basic trainees after prolonged periods of standing or marching. The physical exertion, well beyond accustomed levels, resulted in decompensated strain on the venous and lymphatic systems. Clinically, the condition resembles cellulitis of the bilateral lower legs, ankles, and feet, showing a rapid onset of diffuse tenderness, erythema, warmth, and edema. The pathophysiology results from prolonged venous congestion caused by the upright position, leading to interstitial edema, leakage of proteins and cytokines into the interstitial space, overload of the lymphatic system, and a subsequent inflammatory leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Endurance running has been shown to induce strain and subsequent adaptations in the vascular and lymphatic systems. A recent study compared venous and lymphatic system characteristics in habitual long-distance runners five days after running a marathon with those of sedentary controls. The marathoners demonstrated increased capillary and venous flow capacity at rest and a greater increase in venous and lymphatic flow after exercise as measured by Doppler and plethysmography studies.

On initial evaluation, the differential diagnosis often includes contact dermatitis, cellulitis, and rhabdomyolysis. The bilateral symmetric distribution, diffuse erythema and prominent edema, lack of fever, and normal or mildly elevated CK levels are important clues to the diagnosis of BLEIL. Exercise-induced vasculitis (EIV), also known as "golfer's vasculitis" or "Disney rash", can also present with erythema and edema of the lower legs.

### Livedo reticularis as a presenting sign of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^115YqxPy]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

It is important for clinicians to be aware of dermatologic manifestations, including exanthems, with SARS-CoV-2 infections. As the pandemic continues and rapid identification of disease remains important, the observation of COVID-19–associated skin rashes such as COVID-19 LR may serve as an early sign of developing disease. The association between COVID-19 LR and disease severity remains to be determined. To better treat patients who have COVID-19 LR, we recommend documenting coagulopathic parameters, viral load versus time, and progression of clinical findings.

### Pruritic rash in a man with seminoma [^113VYzh1]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

- **Answers**:
	- **A. Metastatic seminoma**: Incorrect. Although seminoma commonly spreads to the lungs, CT imaging would likely find multiple variably sized confluent soft tissue nodules and masses.
	- **B. Adult-onset Still disease**: Incorrect. Adult-onset Still disease is a rare systemic autoinflammatory disease characterized by the classic triad of fever, joint pain, and a distinctive bumpy salmon-colored rash. This disease is often considered a diagnosis of exclusion.
	- **C. Bleomycin toxicity**: Correct. This is a case of bleomycin-induced flagellate erythema (BIFE), bleomycin-induced melanonychia, and bleomycin-induced lung toxicity (BILT). BIFE and persistent hyperpigmentation occur in approximately 10% to 20% of patients on bleomycin. It can present from hours to months after bleomycin exposure and is characterized by pruritic, erythematous-to-hyperpigmented, linear streaks in a whip-like pattern primarily affecting the trunk. Bleomycin-induced melanonychia is a rare brown-to-black pigmentation of the nail caused by the presence of melanin in the nail plate associated with bleomycin use. The key to diagnosis in this patient is the clinical symptomatic respiratory impairment, recent bleomycin therapy and skin toxicity, and the exclusion of infection or pulmonary involvement of the primary malignancy.
	- **D. Erythema ab igne**: Incorrect. Erythema ab igne is a disorder characterized by a localized macular rash in a reticulated pattern that may lead to red or brown hyperpigmentation following chronic exposure to infrared radiation in the form of heat. It is commonly seen with the use of laptops.

### Diagnostic approach to leukemia cutis: A differential diagnostic step-by-step algorithm [^115jfVkU]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with leukemia cutis typically present with multiple, and less often single, lesions. These usually manifest as nodules, plaques, and papules, but on rare occasions, erythema, ulcers, or blisters may also appear. The most commonly affected body parts are the legs, followed by the arms, back, chest, scalp, and face, while involvement of palmoplantar and oral mucosa is rare. Sites of previous or concomitant inflammation tend to be preferentially involved. It is important to note that a high proportion of patients with leukemia have skin lesions that are not leukemia cutis, such as bleeding abnormalities (petechiae, purpurae) and infectious skin lesions due to cytopenia, which should be considered in differential diagnoses both clinically and histologically.

- **Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of leukemia cutis**: Clinically and histologically, leukemia cutis can be confused with a wide array of skin conditions. The major clinical differential diagnoses are nonleukemic cutaneous manifestations of leukemia mentioned above, known as leukemids. These cutaneous complications may be caused by various factors, such as cytopenias due to bone marrow failure, cutaneous side effects of antileukemic treatment, or immune-mediated diseases (e.g. petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, neutrophilic/eosinophilic/blistering dermatoses, and herpesvirus disease). This evidence highlights the clinical impact of only histologically confirmed extramedullary leukemia manifestations, suggesting that whenever possible, histologic confirmation should be sought in any suspected case.

### Novel mevalonate kinase missense mutation in a patient with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis [^117TTzqd]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 50-year-old Eastern European woman presented to the clinic with a 15-year history of small, round, asymptomatic but cosmetically bothersome lesions on her arms and legs. The patient reported similar lesions in her mother and maternal grandmother. On physical examination, numerous 2- to 3-mm annular brown-to-red papules and plaques with a scaly keratotic rim were identified on her extremities; her face and trunk were spared. Shave biopsy of a representative lesion on the leg found a cornoid lamella, dermal lymphocytic infiltrate, and epidermal dyskeratosis. The diagnosis of DSAP was made based on clinical presentation and characteristic histopathologic findings.

To identify the patient's causal mutation, sequencing of the MVK gene was performed on genomic DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens of DSAP (lesional) skin and histologically uninvolved perilesional skin and unaffected abdominal skin. The wild-type MVK sequence was obtained as a reference standard from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)'s RefSeq database. Sequencing analysis of all specimens found an identical novel heterozygous missense point mutation in exon 5 (c.455:G > A), resulting in the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine.

### Differential diagnosis of round or discoid lesions [^111Z96DE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Dermatologists are called upon to diagnose a variety of skin conditions in diverse age groups. Dermatologic diagnosis, based on the identification of a primary lesion, utilizes morphologic clues to categorize the pathologic process causing the eruption. Additionally, the distribution and grouping of lesions support a specific diagnosis. Dermatologists, consciously or unconsciously, employ pattern recognition to develop their differential diagnosis based on clinical experience and exposure to similarly appearing skin lesions in lectures, texts, and journals. Round and discoid patches and plaques are extremely common in the clinical practice of dermatology. This contribution reviews the dermatologic conditions that present as round or discoid lesions and outlines an approach to diagnosis.

### Pruritus: Diagnosis and management [^114KEFY5]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pruritus, specifically in the context of history and physical examination, AAFP 2022 guidelines recommend differentiating lesions as primary to pruritus or secondary, such as excoriations and scarring, while recognizing that primary skin lesions indicate skin disease.

### Two successive necrotic lesions secondary to presumed loxosceles envenomation [^114Ujvn3]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa) envenomations with subsequent necrotic skin lesions occur infrequently, and systemic loxoscelism is rarer still. We report a case of two successive developing necrotic lesions, each on adjacent medial aspects of the legs, secondary to presumed Loxosceles envenomation. A 31-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with two large necrotic lesions, one on each medial thigh. They had progressed over the course of one month from small blisters to large necrotic lesions with eschar. He underwent surgical debridement without skin grafting and experienced no further complications.

- **Clinical presentation**: Bites from recluse spiders that progress to necrosis usually present as single lesions. The differential diagnoses for a necrotic skin lesion are broad. The presence of more than one lesion argues against Loxosceles envenomation; however, in the absence of underlying infection, systemic diseases, immunodeficiency, or malignancy, the diagnosis must be considered if the case presents in an endemic area. Brown recluse spiders rarely bite multiple times, thus complicating the diagnosis of an already nonspecific clinical finding.

### Chronic verrucous plaques on bilateral lower extremities [^116wmf8B]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Answers:

- **Histoplasmosis**: Incorrect. Although disseminated histoplasmosis can lead to chronic skin lesions, it typically presents as multiple papules, pustules, or nodules in the context of additional systemic symptoms and a positive fungal culture, making this diagnosis unlikely.

- **Blastomycosis**: Incorrect. Although blastomycosis may present with verrucous skin lesions, the chronicity of these lesions, lack of subcutaneous nodules, abscesses, or accompanying pulmonary disease, and negative fungal culture make this diagnosis less likely.

- **Sporotrichosis**: Incorrect. The chronicity of these lesions and lack of ulceration or occurrence along lymphatic channels make this diagnosis unlikely.

- **Cutaneous sarcoidosis, verrucous subtype**: Correct. The presence of chronic and discrete verrucous plaques on the lower extremities of a patient with a family history of sarcoidosis, dermal epithelioid granulomas on histopathology, and negative infectious stains or cultures make this the most likely diagnosis. Cutaneous sarcoidosis often presents a diagnostic challenge due to its ability to mimic other dermatologic conditions, and verrucous sarcoidosis is an extremely rare subtype. It generally presents as well-demarcated exophytic and hyperkeratotic plaques, as seen in this patient, or discrete papillomatous papules. Diagnosis requires a compatible clinical picture and histopathologic findings, in addition to the exclusion of similarly presenting diseases, specifically infection.

- **Granulomatous (vegetative) pyoderma gangrenosum**: Incorrect. Although granulomatous pyoderma gangrenosum can…

### Atypical adult-onset Still's disease with flagellate morphology in a patient with skin of color [^1163xRpC]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

- **Clinical presentation**: Dark brown linear and flagellate plaques are observed on the thighs and legs of a patient with atypical Still's disease. Additionally, grey-brown papules and plaques are distributed bilaterally on the patient's back, and a hyperpigmented plaque is present on the left upper arm.

- **Laboratory findings**: Initial lab results indicate leukocytosis with eosinophilia (WBC 16.5 × 10⁹/L, EOS ABS 2.26 × 10⁹/L), anemia (Hb 7.4 g/dL), and normal platelet levels. Inflammatory markers are significantly elevated (ESR > 130 mm/hr, CRP 23.7 mg/L). Hyperferritinemia (13,660 mcg/L) and a slight elevation in transaminases (AST/ALT 150s units/L) are noted. Creatine kinase (CK) is 77 U/L and aldolase is mildly elevated at 14.3 U/L.

- **Additional investigations**: Comprehensive work-up including ANA, ENA, ANCA, RF, parvovirus, blood and urine cultures, hepatitis, HIV, RPR, gonorrhea, chlamydia, monospot, respiratory viral panel, and COVID tests all return negative results. Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound, are unremarkable. However, pelvic and lumbar spine X-rays reveal mild sclerotic changes of the bilateral sacroiliac joints and lower lumbar spine.

### Subcutaneous granuloma annulare: an unusual presentation in the eyelids and scalp [^11362o62]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Granuloma annulare is a dermatologic condition of unknown etiology. It most frequently presents on the extremities and trunk as skin-colored nodules arranged in an annular pattern. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and resolve spontaneously. Granuloma annulare is more common in females than males. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare is a subtype of granuloma annulare that affects children. It rarely occurs on the face and scalp and is extremely rare in the periocular region. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare is often misdiagnosed because it is not included in the differential diagnosis. Due to the rarity of facial presentation of granuloma annulare, we present a case of subcutaneous granuloma annulare of the eyelids and scalp in a 4-year-old child.

### Plum-colored plaques on the scalp and extremities [^112oRsm7]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: Which of the following is not a cutaneous manifestation of essential thrombocythemia?

	- A. Livedo reticularis
	- B. Erythromelalgia
	- C. Polyarteritis nodosa
	- D. Raynaud phenomenon
	- E. Lower extremity ulcers

- **Answers**:
	- A. Livedo reticularis – Incorrect. This is a purplish, net-like vascular pattern on the skin commonly occurring due to vascular pathology. In ET, the livedo reticularis pattern may be more limited and asymmetric compared to the classic/benign form.

	- B. Erythromelalgia – Incorrect. This is a rare condition characterized by burning pain and erythema at the distal extremities, exacerbated by heat and exercise. While rare, it has been documented in ET.

	- C. Polyarteritis nodosa – Correct. Polyarteritis nodosa is a medium-vessel vasculitis often affecting numerous organs, while classically sparing the lungs. It is commonly associated with hepatitis B infection and may also be triggered by blood dyscrasias such as hairy cell leukemia. However, ET is not a known trigger of polyarteritis nodosa.

	- D. Raynaud phenomenon – Incorrect. This condition results from vasoconstriction of peripheral arteries due to cold exposure. It is associated with ET and can be treated with avoidance of cold, warm clothing, and calcium channel blockers.

	- E. Lower extremity ulcers – Incorrect. Ulceration may occur from chronic coagulopathy, as in the case of ET. It may also result from chemotherapeutics, such as hydroxycarbamide, which are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.

### Cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19: A preliminary review of an emerging issue [^1132McKA]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

The infection caused by the recently identified SARS-CoV-2, called coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), has rapidly spread throughout the world. With the exponential increase of patients worldwide, the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is being better defined and new symptoms are emerging. Numerous reports are documenting the occurrence of different cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19.

- **Objectives**: To provide a brief overview of cutaneous lesions associated with COVID-19.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to 30 April 2020. This narrative review summarizes the available data regarding the clinical and histological features of COVID-19-associated skin manifestations.

- **Results**: The literature reports showed a great heterogeneity in COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations, as well as in their latency periods and associated extracutaneous symptoms. Pathogenic mechanisms are unknown, although the roles of a hyperactive immune response, complement activation, and microvascular injury have been hypothesized. Based on our experience and the literature data, we subdivided the reported cutaneous lesions into six main clinical patterns: (i) urticarial rash; (ii) confluent erythematous-maculopapular-morbilliform rash; (iii) papulovesicular exanthem; (iv) chilblain-like acral pattern; (v) livedo reticularis-livedo racemosa-like pattern; and (vi) purpuric 'vasculitic' pattern. These six patterns can be merged into two main groups: the first — inflammatory and exanthematous — includes the first three groups mentioned above.

### Unilateral reticulated patch localized to the anterior thigh [^1135zAya]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

This lesion has the potential to progress into which of the following?
A. Mycosis fungoides
B. Squamous cell carcinoma
C. Basal cell carcinoma
D. Expansion to involve the lower leg
E. Sneddon syndrome

- **Answers**:
	- A. Mycosis fungoides – Incorrect. Retiform parapsoriasis is a variant of large plaque parapsoriasis that is caused by superficial cutaneous lymphocytic infiltrates and may progress to overt mycosis fungoides.
	- B. Squamous cell carcinoma – Correct. Patients suffering from erythema ab igne are at risk for the development of cutaneous malignancies within the lesion, most commonly squamous cell carcinoma. The risk has been reported to be highest with hydrocarbon heat exposures such as from coal or peat fires. The latent period may be decades. Squamous cell atypia arising within erythema ab igne has been called thermal keratosis because of its strong histopathologic similarity to actinic keratosis.
	- C. Basal cell carcinoma – Incorrect. Erythema ab igne has been associated with a variety of cutaneous malignancies, but most commonly with squamous cell carcinoma. Merkel cell carcinoma and rarely cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma have also been reported.
	- D. Expansion to involve the lower leg – Incorrect. The shape and size of erythema ab igne closely approximates the heat source causing it. Erythema ab igne has classically presented with lesions on the lower legs from exposure to fires and stoves. However, this patient's exposure to heat was from a fan on his laptop computer resting on his thigh. Involvement of the lower leg would not occur without heat directed to the area.

### Diffuse lipofibromatosis of the lower extremity masquerading as a vascular anomaly [^116NzGHd]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Lipofibromatosis is a slow-growing, childhood soft-tissue neoplasm that is often confused with other conditions. We report a patient with lipofibromatosis causing extremity enlargement at birth. The lesion was initially thought to be a vascular anomaly or lipedema on clinical and MRI examination. When involving the lower extremity, diffuse lipofibromatosis must be differentiated from more common causes of lower limb enlargement in children: lymphatic malformation, lymphedema, or lipedema. Compared with these more frequent conditions, lipofibromatosis usually causes less morbidity. Management of the tumor includes observation or excision. Because complete extirpation of the lesion is difficult, the recurrence rate is high.

### Calciphylaxis in the absence of pathological skin lesions [^1142bcSA]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A woman in her 40s with haemodialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease presented to our emergency department with severe bilateral lower extremity pain accompanied by erythema and oedema. Bedside ultrasound was inconclusive, and further imaging was delayed due to significant patient discomfort during bed transfers. Ultimately, this patient was suspected to have calciphylaxis following a successful CT scan with premedication due to significant subcutaneous tissue calcification. Her diagnosis was confirmed with a tissue punch biopsy. Her first pathological skin lesion appeared at the biopsy site, and the patient subsequently experienced a protracted hospital course at two separate hospitals before passing away at home, approximately three months after the initial presentation. Our case demonstrates the heterogeneity of initial symptoms of calciphylaxis and the inherent risks of biopsy-dependent diagnostic confirmation of this disease.

### Clear cell acanthoma [^112qWAU1]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Clear cell acanthoma (CCA) is an asymptomatic benign lesion of unknown origin and etiology, which typically presents as a red to brown, dome-shaped papule on the leg. We discuss the case of a patient with an irregular plaque of hypopigmented papules whose diagnosis of CCA was only made by biopsy, and review the characteristic presentation, uncommon variants, locations, and associated conditions of this lesion. The diagnosis is based on histopathology and/or immunohistochemistry, but the variable clinical presentation may make diagnosis difficult. The differential diagnosis includes skin tumors and inflammatory and pigmentary dermatoses. The lesions do not regress spontaneously, and excisional removal is the preferred treatment.

### A case of extracutaneous pyoderma gangrenosum in a patient with persistent cutaneous and systemic symptoms: Implications for differential diagnosis and treatment [^113CHojB]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple myeloma status post bone marrow transplantation presented to dermatology for an ulceration of the lower portion of the leg (Fig 1), clinically consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Biopsy showed a benign ulcer with a dense neutrophilic infiltrate (Fig 2). Stains for infectious organisms and tissue cultures for bacteria, acid-fast bacteria, and fungi were all negative. Throughout the next several years, the patient continued to develop flares of PG on various sites of her extremities that were managed with systemic and intralesional steroids, adalimumab, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, and anakinra. Her rheumatoid arthritis also became better controlled with the treatment of her PG.

Ten years after the diagnosis of cutaneous PG, the patient was hospitalized for new shortness of breath with associated worsening of her cutaneous PG. The patient was afebrile with an elevated C-reactive protein (14 mg/L) and a white blood cell count of 17,000 with 80% neutrophils. Computed tomography imaging demonstrated pericardial effusion and multiple large, bilateral, cavitary pulmonary (Fig 3) and splenic abscesses. The patient was admitted to an internal medicine service with concern for infection and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and discontinuation of immunosuppressants, which only worsened her condition. Mycobacterium fortuitum was isolated from sputum, but bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsy, and two lung wedge resections revealed only abscesses with no evidence of infection by stains, culture, or molecular studies.

### Cutaneous vasculitis in autoinflammatory diseases [^111DtdKs]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Various cutaneous manifestations on the lower extremities were found 15 months after his first visit. (a, b) Livedo racemosa on both legs. (c) Livedo racemosa mixed with infiltrated erythema at higher magnification. (d) Tender swollen erythema appeared on the same lesional leg. (e) Erythematous purpuric lesions could be identified on the same lesional leg. (f) Biopsy from livedo racemosa revealed arteritis at the dermosubcutaneous junction (magnification, ×40). (g) Higher magnification showed infiltration of neutrophils in and around the disrupted arterial wall (circles) with luminal fibrin and marked extravasation of erythrocytes (magnification, ×400). (h) Marked development of livedo racemosa mixed with residual tender infiltrated erythema on both thighs was seen 3 months after the onset of skin lesions of a–e.

Our 65-year-old male patient with VEXAS syndrome initially developed relapsing polychondritis followed by the development of various skin lesions on different occasions, including livedo racemosa, infiltrated erythema, tender swollen erythema, and erythematous purpuric lesions one year later and appearance of Sweet syndrome–like dermatosis 23 months after his first visit.

Skin involvement may appear before or at the time of other clinical features of VEXAS syndrome.

### Infantile transient smooth muscle contraction of the skin in a 1-month-old girl [^111PrBjc]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A 1-month-old healthy girl presented to the pediatric dermatology clinic with a history of episodic dimpling and rippling of the bilateral lower extremities, lasting for approximately 30 seconds and occurring several times each day. On occasion, the upper extremities were also involved. Her mother reported that these episodes began at birth and often coincided with shifting temperature, especially during diaper changes. Between these episodes, the infant's skin appeared normal.

On physical examination, the skin of the patient's bilateral lower extremities appeared rippled and subtly blanched, with no other pigmentary change or hypertrichosis. The history and physical exam suggested a diagnosis of infantile transient smooth muscle contraction of the skin. Three years later, the patient's episodes had significantly decreased in frequency over time but were still occurring occasionally on the lower extremities. At the time of follow-up, the patient continued to grow and develop normally.

### An atypical presentation of a rare disease [^117FufUF]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old white woman presented for evaluation of asymptomatic skin lesions on her right shin, right buttock, and left arm. All lesions initially underwent slow growth, plateaued, and then remained stable in size. A complete review of systems revealed normal results. She had three well-demarcated erythematous round plaques ranging from 1.5 to 3 cm, all with a central depression, yellow hue, and prominent telangiectasias. An excisional biopsy was performed, revealing palisading granulomas within the papillary and reticular dermis, predominantly composed of a histiocytic cell population with multiple large giant cells.

### Pink edematous papules and plaques of the trunk and extremities [^114j8WAs]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following countries had the highest rate of new infections in 2019?
A. Brazil
B. India
C. Mexico
D. Philippines
E. The United States

Answers: A. Brazil – Correct. The majority of new worldwide cases occur in a few countries where the infection is less controlled. Brazil, India, and Indonesia together account for 80% of new worldwide infections. In 2019, the incidence of new cases was highest in Brazil, which reported over 27,863 cases in a population of 211 million (13 per 100,000 people).

B. India – Incorrect. India had 114,451 new cases in 2019, the highest than any other nation. With a population of 1.3 billion, the rate of new infections (9 per 100,000 people) is slightly below that of Brazil.

C. Mexico – Incorrect. In 2019, Mexico reported 182 new cases in a population of 126 million (rate of 1.4 per 100,000 people). Mexico is a common country of origin for patients with new diagnoses in Southern California.

D. Philippines – Incorrect. The Philippines is one of the 23 countries on the World Health Organization's global priority list that represent over 95% of new worldwide Hansen's disease infections. With 2122 new infections in 2019 in a population of 108 million (rate of 2 per 100,000 people), it had considerably fewer new infections than Brazil, Indonesia, or India. Of note, the patient in this case did describe a history of remote travel to the Philippines, where he may have been initially infected. Incubation can take as long as 10 years from the initial exposure to clinical presentation.

E. The United States – Incorrect.

### Diabetic muscle infarction and diabetic dermopathy: Two manifestations of uncontrolled prolonged diabetes mellitus presenting with severe leg pain and leg skin lesions [^112Xh3TG]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

In conclusion, diabetic muscle infarction (DMI) is an uncommon complication of long-standing uncontrolled diabetes. It presents with swelling and severe pain, usually in the lower extremity, and often prompts an extensive diagnostic workup to find the etiology of localized myositis. This diagnostic process might be unnecessary if the physician has a high level of suspicion. A T2-weighted MRI image can be a valuable diagnostic tool.

### The epidemiology of micro-arteriovenous fistulas in the lower legs [^112CyfNh]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2019).

Patients presenting with edema, skin redness, pain, and itching in their lower legs are common and encountered often in daily practice. However, although commonly recognized diseases such as deep venous thrombosis, stasis dermatitis due to varicose veins, lymphedema, and cellulitis are diagnosed correctly in most cases, micro-arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) may often be overlooked due to low awareness and rarity. This study was carried out to evaluate the prevalence of micro-AVF in patients presenting with foot skin symptoms.

- **Methods**: A total of 134 patients (184 limbs) visited the Department of Vascular Surgery at Kesennuma City Hospital with edema, skin redness, pain, and itching in their lower legs from January to September 2017 and were enrolled and followed up until November 2017. All patients received ultrasonic inspection of their symptomatic limb, and a blood test (white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and d-dimer) was performed if needed. When micro-AVF was detected in one limb, the other limb was routinely inspected by ultrasonography. A computed tomography scan was performed with the patient's consent. Patients diagnosed with micro-AVF started compression therapy immediately and were followed up for at least 2 months. A surgical procedure was considered if the symptoms worsened.

- **Results**: Micro-AVFs were detected in 24 limbs (13%, 24/184) of 14 patients (7 males and 7 females; age 70 ± 11.7 years). Four patients had unilateral skin symptoms with unilateral micro-AVFs, and 7 patients had unilateral skin symptoms and bilateral micro-AVFs.

### An 11-year-old male with periorbital edema and painful subcutaneous nodules [^111y3jbG]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

An 11‐year‐old previously healthy male presented with painful skin lesions on the lower legs. In the 6 weeks leading up to presentation, he experienced profound lethargy, polyarthritis of large joints of the extremities, cyclic low‐grade fever, approximately 7 kg weight loss, and bilateral periocular edema. He had traveled to Liberia for 3 weeks, 1 year prior to symptom onset. The patient was not on any medications. He was normotensive and intermittently febrile without a consistent pattern (T max = 38.5°C). On physical examination, he had hyperpigmented reticulated plaques and painful erythematous nodules on the lower legs, ankles, and dorsal feet (Figure 1), with milder involvement of the hands. He was also noted to have robust bilateral periorbital edema (Figure 2).

An extensive workup revealed elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] > 130 mm/h; C‐reactive protein (CRP) 19.5 mg/dL). He had an elevated anti‐streptolysin O (ASO) titer of 592 IU/mL. The remainder of his workup was normal, including DNAse B antibody level, creatinine, urinalysis, terminal complement deficiency testing, immunologic titers, transthoracic echocardiogram, and full body MRI. A punch biopsy from the left foot was taken (Figures 3 and 4).

### Segmental pigmented purpura [^115RgTCh]. Pediatric Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

A segmental distribution of pigmented purpura (PP) is rare. Our patient presented at five years of age with red-brown petechial macules and telangiectases on her chest, the inner and dorsal aspects of the right upper extremity, and the dorsal aspect of the hand, which had developed slowly over the previous seven months. The lesions were intermittently pruritic. A biopsy from the right arm revealed discrete hydropic degeneration of the basal layer of the epidermis, dilation of the blood vessels, numerous extravasated erythrocytes and lymphocytes, and lymphocytes in the lower part of the epidermis. The skin disease resolved almost completely within 18 months. The general physical examination revealed an open foramen ovale, slight hypogammaglobulinemia (G and A), and enhanced fragility of the blood vessels.

### Disseminated cryptococcosis presenting initially as lower limb cellulitis in a renal transplant recipient - a case report [^1139UY9S]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The patient represented to the hospital on 13th August 2015 with a worsening skin rash affecting his lower legs bilaterally (Fig. 1). Prior to this second hospital admission, he had received oral flucloxacillin through his primary care physician for 3 days. Initially diagnosed with venous insufficiency complicated by overlying cellulitis, he was recommenced on IV flucloxacillin.

An infectious diseases physician doubted bacterial cellulitis due to the atypical skin appearance and bilateral involvement. A dermatology opinion was sought on 14th August, with a preliminary diagnosis of lichen simplex chronicus and a recommendation to exclude malignancy and infection. Given the cellulitis was bilateral, persistent, and atypically presented, suspicion for an atypical infection and systemic etiology was raised.

Skin punch biopsies were performed on 14th August. Histology revealed yeast-like organisms highly suggestive of cryptococci (Fig. 2), which were confirmed on culture to be Cryptococcus neoformans, although sub-specification of the organism was not carried out.

### Malignant transformation of erythema ab igne [^112Sd1dA]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

On initial presentation to dermatology, the patient underwent a biopsy of two ill-defined, hyperkeratotic, indurated eroded plaques on the lower back, both consistent with moderately-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

- **Preoperative consult visit**: Scouting biopsies were performed to rule out multifocal SCC. All showed changes of erythema ab igne without signs of malignancy.

- **Day of surgery**: The inferior tumor had grown significantly since the biopsy. Due to proximity, both tumors were treated as a single lesion and removed en bloc with clear micrographic margins.

### The differential diagnosis of trunk and extremity dermal and sub-dermal lesions referred to a musculoskeletal oncology service [^111hKtm7]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

To determine the differential diagnosis of dermal and sub-dermal soft tissue masses which do not extend to the deep fascia that are referred to a specialist musculoskeletal oncology service, a review was conducted. This review included patients referred to the service over a 13-month period with a dermal or sub-dermal soft tissue mass, as identified by MRI appearances. Data collected comprised age, gender, site and maximal lesion size, and final histological diagnosis for biopsied and/or excised lesions.

A total of 56 patients were included in the study, with 21 (37.5%) males and 35 (62.5%) females, having a mean age of 49.75 years (ranging from 5 to 86 years). Three patients had two lesions each, resulting in a total of 59 lesions, with 11 (18.6%) being dermal and 48 (81.4%) sub-dermal. Histological diagnosis was available for 44 cases (74.6%), of which 11 (25%) were non-neoplastic, 23 (52.3%) were benign neoplasms, and 10 (22.7%) were malignant neoplasms. While older age at presentation and greater mean maximal tumour dimension were observed with malignant lesions, these factors did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.154 and 0.102, respectively). There was no significant relationship between skin involvement from sub-dermal lesions and malignancy; however, 5 of 6 dermal lesions which exhibited an exophytic growth pattern were malignant.

The differential diagnosis of dermal and sub-dermal lesions not reaching the deep fascia is broad, with a malignant lesion being the cause in nearly one-quarter of cases.

For cellulitis, particularly concerning immunocompromised patients, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend including several conditions in the differential diagnosis of skin lesions. These conditions are drug eruption, cutaneous infiltration with the underlying malignancy, chemotherapy- or radiation-induced reactions, Sweet syndrome, erythema multiforme, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) among allogeneic transplant recipients. Additionally, it advises to include bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic agents in the differential diagnosis for infection of skin lesions.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Squamous cell skin cancer, version 1.2022 [^116fzSdn]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining the following preliminary workup for a lesion suspicious for skin cancer:

- **History and physical examination**: Essential initial steps in assessing suspected squamous cell carcinoma.

- **Biopsy**: If the lesion is more than superficial, inclusion of the deep reticular dermis is preferred.

- **Imaging studies of area of interest**: Indicated for suspicion of locally extensive or metastatic disease. Recognize that extensive disease includes deep involvement such as bone, named nerves, and deep soft tissue. Obtain an MRI with and without contrast if disease of named nerve(s) is suspected. Obtain a CT with contrast if bone disease is suspected, unless contraindicated. Decide on the imaging modality and targeted area at the discretion of the treating team based on the suspected extent of disease (local, regional, metastatic).

- **Further assessment and histologic confirmation**: Obtain histologic confirmation to diagnose local recurrence, but consider obtaining an MRI with and without contrast to assess the extent of local disease. Obtain histologic analysis and/or additional imaging modalities to confirm nodal or distant metastases and assess the extent of disease. Consider obtaining an MRI with and without contrast of the brain to rule out subclinical cortical involvement in cases with bone invasion.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^111rjLNJ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

We found no robustly developed and validated diagnostic tools or criteria for lower-limb cellulitis. A variety of potential tools have been explored so far, including biochemical tests, imaging, predictive scoring, and clinical features. However, in seven of the eight included studies, cellulitis was not the main pathology of interest and was used as a comparator. Three studies compared cellulitis with rare differential diagnoses, such as osteomyelitis, which provide limited clinical applicability. This diversity in the tools explored emphasizes the difficulty in making a correct diagnosis on first presentation.

All eight included studies identified in this review were observational studies. The sample sizes were small, with only two studies including more than 100 patients with cellulitis. No criteria or tools have been subsequently validated in a large prospective study.

Despite cellulitis being a common presentation in community settings, all the tools identified at the time of writing have been developed and tested in secondary care, with limited evidence of validity or applicability in community settings. No study stated that the gold standard reference for clinical diagnosis was a board-certified dermatologist or other specialist with cellulitis expertise. Only one study clearly stated who made the cellulitis diagnosis.

All the tools developed at the time of writing can be accessed by secondary care, are already available, and, with the exception of CT imaging, are inexpensive. The severity of cellulitis is likely to be worse in secondary care. However, none of them showed proven reliability in primary care settings.

### Unilateral reticulated patch localized to the anterior thigh [^113xMEQL]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old white man presented with a 2-month history of an asymptomatic, hyperpigmented, telangiectatic, reticulated patch localized to the left anterior thigh (Fig 1). He denied a history of similar skin changes and recent changes in medications, trauma to the involved area, or other notable exposures. He reported using a laptop computer for up to 10 hours per day (Fig 2). Diagnosis was made based on clinical appearance, and no biopsy was performed.

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis?
	- A. Livedo reticularis
	- B. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa
	- C. Erythema ab igne
	- D. Reticular erythematous mucinosis
	- E. Retiform parapsoriasis

- **Answers**:
	- A. Livedo reticularis – Incorrect. Livedo reticularis is characterized by reddish-blue to hyperpigmented patches in a netlike vascular pattern. It is associated with a physiologic vasospastic response to cold. The affected area is more generalized than this patient's single lesion and is typically present symmetrically and bilaterally.
	- B. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa, a necrotizing vasculitis affecting the arteries within the dermis and subcutaneous fat, may present with reticulated lesions. It is typically characterized by tender subcutaneous nodules and ulcerations, which were absent in this patient.
	- C. Erythema ab igne – Correct. Erythema ab igne is caused by long-term exposure to heat below the threshold for thermal burn. The precise mechanism of lesion formation is unknown, but the pigmentary pattern corresponds with the dermal venous plexus. Histologic features include…

### Verrucous psoriasis: A rare variant of psoriasis masquerading as verrucous carcinoma [^116twkwr]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A review of the literature suggests that verrucous psoriasis (VP) has been previously misdiagnosed as verrucous carcinoma (VC). Kuan et al. reported a case of multifocal VC on the lower legs of a 42-year-old man that resolved with acitretin. The authors stated that the histopathology was consistent with VC's bulldozing invasion of bulbous rete versus a stabbing, narrow-tipped rete infiltration more consistent with VP. However, a letter was later published calling the diagnosis of VC into question because of the patient's response to acitretin, with VP being a more likely explanation. Although the original presentation and histopathologic diagnosis in this case and in our patient suggested VC, there is considerable overlap with the clinical and histopathologic features of VP.

- **Treatment considerations**: The treatment of choice for VC is excision, which can have significant morbidity due to poor wound healing on the lower extremities. When diagnosing VC, it may be prudent to consider a differential diagnosis including VP, verruca vulgaris, deep fungal infections, and hypertrophic lichen planus because these are amenable to medical treatment.

- **Diagnostic recommendations**: The similarities between VC and VP may make clinical and histologic differentiation of singular lesions difficult. Ancillary staining with p16 should be performed in equivocal cases. In the case of HPV-negative lesions, a thorough history and physical examination may provide evidence of underlying psoriasis. The alert dermatologic surgeon may consider further dermatopathology consultation with clinical correlation before surgery. If the clinician cannot make a clear distinction between VC and VP, medical treatments should be contemplated.

### The importance of challenging your diagnosis even in straightforward cases [^115neDw4]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

The art of diagnosis involves recognizing signs and symptoms and interpreting them in light of the individual circumstances obtained from the patient's history. In medicine, we encounter both straightforward cases and complex cases that might result from a rare disease or the uncommon presentation of a common disorder.

In this paper, we present the case of a patient with a non-healing traumatic wound on her shin. After unsuccessful treatments, a biopsy was performed, which led to the unexpected diagnosis of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. This diagnosis prompted the implementation of disease-targeted wound care, resulting in complete resolution in a short period of time.

### Long-standing purpuric exanthema [^116yjH3R]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

- **Answers**:
	- **A. Schamberg disease**–Incorrect. Schamberg disease is the most common condition among the pigmented purpuric dermatoses. The clinical presentation ranges from petechiae to brown-orange macules, favoring the lower extremities and sometimes involving the trunk, buttocks, and arms.
	- **B. Occlusive vasculopathy secondary to essential thrombocythemia**–Correct. Essential thrombocythemia is a chronic myeloproliferative condition characterized by an increase in the number of circulating platelets caused by the proliferation of megakaryocytes, resulting in thromboses of small, medium, or large vessels. Cutaneous manifestations occur in almost one fourth of the patients. Essential thrombocythemia can cause a wide range of dermatological manifestations, including pruritus, hematomas, ecchymoses, petechiae, or purpura, as well as other symptoms related to occlusive vasculopathy (erythromelalgia, livedo reticularis, livedo racemosa, Raynaud's phenomenon, and acrocyanosis).
	- **C. Drug eruption**–Incorrect. Drug eruptions represent a broad spectrum of cutaneous adverse reactions to several drugs. The clinical presentation is protean, depending on the involved drug and type of cutaneous reaction. Our patient did not receive any new medication in the past several months, and the purpuric exanthema was present for three years, and therefore, a diagnosis of drug eruption could be ruled out.
	- **D. Immune complex vasculitis**–Incorrect. Immune complex vasculitis is a type of small-vessel vasculitis often presenting with palpable purpura, sometimes with necrosis and ulceration.

### A bilaterally recurring exophytic mass on the lower jaw [^113m1Ltg]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Brown tumour is a rare focal giant-cell lesion that arises as a direct result of the effect of parathyroid hormone on bone tissue in patients with hyperparathyroidism (HPT). The lesions localize in areas of intense bone resorption, and the bone defect becomes filled with fibroblastic tissue. It can affect the mandible, maxilla, clavicle, ribs, and pelvic bones. Therefore, diagnosis requires a systemic investigation for lesion differentiation. The authors present a case of a 27-year-old woman with a rare case of brown tumour of the mandible due to HPT secondary to osteomalacia. The lesion showed a tendency to recur even after excision until her parathyroid levels became normal.

### Ulcerating yellow plaques on the legs [^115w8Nu3]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Answers:

- **Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (NXG) – Correct**: NXG is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, the histologic features of which include palisading necrobiotic granulomas of the dermis and subcutis, in addition to cholesterol clefts, foamy histiocytes, and prominent Touton and bizarre, foreign body multinucleated giant cells (Fig 3). Due to sampling error, this entity can be mistaken for NL when the cholesterol clefts and bizarre giant cells are not present.

- **Cholesterol emboli – Incorrect**: Cholesterol emboli often occur abruptly and are seen in close association with arterial catheterization, prolonged anticoagulation, or acute thrombolytic therapy. Clinical features may include ulceration; however, livedo reticularis and cyanosis are more commonly observed. Histopathologic examination reveals cholesterol clefts limited to the intravascular space, in contrast to those observed in NXG.

- **Necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) – Incorrect**: Although NL and NXG may mimic each other clinically, the histopathologic findings of NL differ from those of NXG. Microscopic examination reveals layers of palisading granulomatous dermatitis alternating with degenerated collagen. The condition is thought to be associated with diabetes mellitus and abnormal glucose tolerance.

- **Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) – Incorrect**: PG is a neutrophilic ulcerating condition associated with inflammatory bowel disease and hematologic disorders. Histopathologic examination reveals a sterile neutrophilic infiltrate. PG is a diagnosis of exclusion, and thus infection and other entities must be ruled out.

### Reticular rash on the lower extremities [^1111AA9d]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

- **Answers**:

	- A. Classic polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is characterized by palpable purpura, but livedo racemosa and retiform purpura can also be seen. Systemic signs include weight loss, fever, arthralgias, and renal failure. Histology findings show vasculitis rather than vascular thrombosis.

	- B. Rheumatoid vasculitis – Incorrect. Rheumatoid vasculitis occurs in less than 5% of rheumatoid arthritis patients and can involve the skin, nervous system, heart, and kidneys. Because rheumatoid vasculitis can affect small or medium-sized vessels, cutaneous findings range from palpable purpura to acral ulcerations and infarcts. A skin biopsy would most likely show vasculitis and not vascular occlusion.

	- C. Type I cryoglobulinemia – Correct. Type I cryoglobulinemia represents a thrombotic vasculopathy caused by monoclonal immunoglobulin occlusion of vessels in patients with hematologic malignancy, such as multiple myeloma, and can be associated with elevated serum viscosity. Cutaneous findings range from livedo reticularis to necrotic ulcerations and may be accompanied by neuropathy, arthralgias, and renal disease.

	- D. Mixed cryoglobulinemia – Incorrect. Mixed cryoglobulinemia describes both type II and type III cryoglobulinemia in which cryoglobulins are polyclonal immunoglobulins. Unlike type I cryoglobulinemia, mixed cryoglobulinemia results in vasculitis of the small and medium-sized vessels and is associated with underlying infection (most commonly hepatitis C), connective tissue disease, and, less frequently, lymphoproliferative disorders.

### Rapidly progressive purpuric plaques in an infant [^112mvDwD]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis?
	- A. Erythema multiforme minor
	- B. Polyarteritis nodosa
	- C. Sweet syndrome
	- D. Acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy
	- E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura

- **Answers**:
	- **A. Erythema multiforme minor**: Incorrect. Erythema multiforme minor, a self-limited immune-mediated reaction to infections, is characterized by the acute onset of target, maculopapular lesions on extremities. It is not associated with edema of the face.
	- **B. Polyarteritis nodosa**: Incorrect. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a leukocytoclastic medium-sized vessel vasculitis associated with cutaneous lesions such as livedo, subcutaneous nodules, and annular purpura, commonly on the arms and legs. Although cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is the most common form in children, no subcutaneous nodules nor livedo were present here.
	- **C. Sweet syndrome**: Incorrect. Sweet syndrome is characterized by acute purple and erythematous plaques on the face and extremities. Constitutional signs such as fever, malaise, arthralgia, and leukocytosis, which are minor criteria for Sweet syndrome, were absent in this patient.
	- **D. Acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy**: Correct. Acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy is a rare cutaneous vasculitis seen in children between 4 and 24 months of age. Initially, small erythematous papules or macules progress within 48 hours to sharply demarcated, targetoid, indurated purpuric plaques involving the face, the upper and lower extremities, and sparing the trunk. The children appear otherwise well. Acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy is associated with facial edema and low-grade fever.
	- **E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura**: Incorrect.

### Case of bilateral acroangiodermatitis due to symmetrical arteriovenous fistulas of the soles [^112btdrX]. The Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

A 58-year-old woman presented with painful chronic inflammation of the outer skin of the bilateral soles. A skin biopsy revealed chronic inflammation of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, marked dilatation and proliferation of capillaries and veins, and thick deposition of elastic fibers around the thick-walled veins. Three-dimensional contrasted computed tomography of the lower extremities demonstrated early bilateral imaging of the veins and fistulas of the peroneal, as well as the posterior tibial artery and vein of the bilateral soles. Based on a diagnosis of bilateral acroangiodermatitis due to symmetrical arteriovenous fistulas, the patient underwent compression therapy using elastic bandages, and the symptoms reduced in several days.

### Multiples in dermatology: Markers for special considerations in diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis [^112mv3hu]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Multiples of certain cutaneous lesions should alert clinicians to a wider differential diagnosis and possible systemic associations, although the individual skin lesion is often benign in nature and banal in appearance. This article focuses on findings in selected multiple cutaneous lesions that may be classified according to the primary cutaneous feature, such as vascular, pigmentary, nevoid hamartomas, and tumors/neoplastic conditions.

### Cutaneous findings of fulminant monkeypox in a patient with HIV/AIDS [^114wL5au]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A 37-year-old man with a 1-year history of untreated HIV/AIDS presented to the emergency department with a 5-week history of painful lesions on his face, torso, groin, and buttocks. Initially, the lesions were nonpainful, leading to a delay in seeking medical care until the pain became excruciating. Two days before presentation, he experienced subjective fevers and chills.

On examination, he had necrotic and confluent facial lesions with yellow crusting on the left side of his face and nose, ulceronecrotic nodular plaques on his torso, and ulcerative papulonodules on the digits of his hands (Fig 1). The differential diagnosis included atypical mycobacterium, malignant lues, leishmaniasis, and deep fungal infection. Laboratory test results demonstrated a CD4 count of 52 and viral load of 242,000. Lesional polymerase chain reaction swabs were performed and were positive for mpox, rapid plasma reagin titer positivity suggestive of concomitant syphilis, and urine polymerase chain reaction positive for gonococcal infection. Skin biopsies were taken from four sites, all demonstrating viral cytopathic change consistent with mpox infection. Subsequent spirochete staining was negative in all samples.

### Crusted scabies [^11431jGS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

A 54-year-old man presented with mildly itchy erythematous hyperkeratotic crusted plaques over the trunk, gluteal region, and bilateral arms and lower legs for 6 months (Figure 1). He had received multiple intramuscular dexamethasone injections from a general practitioner for his pruritus. He had type two diabetes mellitus and was on oral antihyperglycemic agents. His random blood sugar was 498 mg/dL and HbA1c was 10.1. A microscopic examination of the scrapings from hyperkeratotic lesions demonstrated numerous Sarcoptes scabiei mites, eggs, and scybala (Figure 2). A diagnosis of crusted scabies was made, and he was admitted to an isolation ward. He was treated with daily overnight topical 5% permethrin cream for 7 days and oral ivermectin on days 1, 2, and 8. The skin scraping turned negative on completion of treatment.

- **Figure 1**: Multiple erythematous hyperkeratotic crusted plaques over the gluteal region and lateral aspect of thighs.

- **Figure 2**: Left side, microscopic examination of crusted plaque at low power revealed Sarcoptes scabiei mite, scybala, and eggs. Right side, high-power view of the mite.

Crusted scabies is a highly contagious variant of scabies characterized by unhindered proliferation of the S. scabiei mite. Unlike classical scabies, pruritus is either mild or absent. Scabies is transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact and, to a lesser extent, via fomites. The high mite burden of crusted scabies can trigger nosocomial outbreaks. Crusted scabies is commonly observed in patients with immunosuppression, neurological diseases with reduced sensation, and…

### Kaposi sarcoma in a man-who-has-sex-with-men patient without human immunodeficiency virus who was treated with upadacitinib for ulcerative colitis [^112wMLRW]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A 45-year-old man presented to the dermatology clinic with a 6-month history of slowly progressive violaceous plaques on his bilateral lower extremities. His medical history was significant for preexposure prophylaxis use for HIV prevention because he has male sexual partners and severe ulcerative colitis (UC) that failed to improve with adalimumab therapy. He was switched to upadacitinib 15 mg daily for treatment-resistant UC one year before his presentation to the dermatology clinic. Six months before he presented to the clinic, his dose of upadacitinib was increased to 30 mg daily. After his dose was increased, over the next 6 months, he developed slowly progressive asymptomatic violaceous papules and plaques, first involving his bilateral ankles, with later involvement of his bilateral calves.

Physical examination on the day of presentation to the dermatology clinic was congruent with these findings. A skin biopsy was taken of the lesion on the patient's left calf, and histopathology showed the proliferation of spindled cells infiltrating collagen bundles and native vascular structures throughout the dermis. Immunohistochemistry showed neoplastic cells diffusely positive for HHV-8, confirming the diagnosis of Kaposi Sarcoma (KS). HIV-1/2 antigen/antibody testing 2 weeks after the skin biopsy was collected was negative. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, along with a computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast, were all negative for visceral KS involvement. At this point, medical oncology was consulted and believed the best course of action would be to d

A previously healthy 15-year-old female developed sudden onset right lower extremity swelling, pain, and erythematous linear streaking from the ankle to mid-thigh. Duplex venous ultrasound revealed multiple superficial and deep venous thrombi in the right lower extremity. Incidentally, the patient was also noted to have elevated transaminases and a microcytic anemia with significant iron deficiency. Additional evaluation ultimately led to the diagnosis of two distinct but interconnected chronic conditions, one of which progressed to requiring liver transplantation.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AhEfn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation.

The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower-limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. Routine biochemical and hematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis, resulting in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and also enhance the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring appropriate case definition. However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower-limb cellulitis. We define diagnostic criteria or tools as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower-limb cellulitis only. Lower-limb erysipelas is included as it is clinically relevant.

### Rare skin appendage tumour on the right leg: A case of primary cutaneous cribriform carcinoma [^111CV7L9]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A woman in her 60s presented with a longstanding history of a purplish, fleshy, and pedunculated nodule on the right shin, against a background of bilateral lower limb lymphoedema. A shave biopsy with double curettage of the base of the lesion revealed a nodular tumour with hyperchromatic basaloid cells arranged in a cribriform pattern, encircling an eosinophilic substance. Immunohistochemistry staining showed cells positive for pancytokeratin, low molecular weight keratin, and BerEP4, but negative for cytokeratin 20. There were no clinical or radiological features suggestive of primary visceral malignancy. These histological and immunohistochemical features favor a diagnosis of primary cribriform carcinoma of the skin. This is a rare, indolent skin appendage tumour of presumed apocrine origin, with no reported cases in the literature of metastasis or local recurrence after excision.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^113HJYLn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

All included studies were described in a narrative synthesis. To evaluate the methodological quality, two reviewers (M.P. and R.K. A.) assessed all studies using signalling questions in the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 tool, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer (S. I.L. or E.B.‐T.). If the information was not clearly provided in the study, the signalling question was assessed as 'unclear'.

For each domain, studies were judged as 'low risk' if all signalling questions were answered 'yes', 'high risk' if the answer to at least one signalling question was 'no', or 'unclear' in all other cases.

### Phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica without extracutaneous abnormalities: 12-year follow-up [^114mtP6B]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old white boy was referred to our dermatology department for yellow plaques on the face, chest, groin, and right extremities, as well as pigmented patches on the back. All lesions had been present since birth. He is a dizygotic twin, born at 37 weeks' gestation after in vitro fertilization and an uncomplicated pregnancy. His twin sister does not have any skin findings.

On initial physical examination, the patient was a healthy-appearing boy with growth and development appropriate for his age. He had multiple sebaceous nevi, including a 7-cm skin-colored, waxy, linear, verrucous plaque reaching from the mid-forehead to nasal tip; a similar 1-cm plaque inferior to the medial aspect of the right canthus; and a 7 × 10-cm skin-colored, waxy, alopecic plaque on the occipital aspect of the scalp extending to the right postauricular region. Streaky, blaschkoid, variably corrugated, yellow-brown plaques covered his right pectoral region, infiltrating his right axilla. The right groin had 3 linear plaques, 1 of which extended inferiorly and involved the scrotum. There were additional linear plaques arranged in blaschkoid distribution on the right extremities and across the right foot.

The authors present the case of a 65-year-old gentleman with a 2.6-mm Breslow thickness melanoma on the lower limb. During his treatment, he underwent several operations, including a partial foot amputation. At clinical review, he was noted to have developed an unusual rash. This rash, an annular and gyrate erythema, has never been described before in relation to melanoma and is sometimes seen in the presence of paraneoplastic processes. Highlighting this new association may enable clinicians to understand and appreciate melanoma better in the future.

### Verrucous squamous cell carcinoma arising in necrobiosis lipoidica in a young woman [^116rXSPw]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A 32-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes presented with a 7 × 7 cm painful, crusted red-brown verrucous plaque within a lesion of necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) on the distal right pretibial region (Fig 1). The patient had a history of NL on her bilateral lower legs since age 9, arising concomitantly with her diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The lesion developed 5 years prior in a longstanding NL, which grew slowly over time. The patient denied preceding ulceration but recalled a minor abrasion in the NL a few weeks prior to noticing skin changes.

- **Fig 1**: A verrucous squamous cell carcinoma within a necrobiosis lipoidica lesion on the distal pretibial region of the right leg.

The patient was previously evaluated by a different provider, and a review of chart notes indicated the lesion initially measured 3.0 × 2.5 cm. A biopsy at the time favored a benign verrucous keratosis, as it demonstrated an endophytic growth pattern with digitate epidermal acanthosis and confluent parakeratosis. Human papillomavirus in situ hybridization studies for high- and low-risk subtypes were negative. She underwent multiple subsequent biopsies over 4 years, none of which found sufficient evidence of malignant transformation.

### Bier spots are an under-recognized cutaneous manifestation of lower extremity lymphedema: A case series and brief review of the literature [^1171zi7i]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Bier spots represent a benign vascular mottling characterized by multiple irregular white macules along the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs. They have been reported in a variety of diverse conditions with no consistent disease association. We have identified a novel association between these physiologic anemic macules and lower extremity lymphedema. Eleven patients between 23 and 70 years of age (5 male and 6 female) were diagnosed with Bier spots, as evidenced by reversible white macules ranging from 3 to 8 mm in diameter on the extensor portions of the feet, ankles, and calves. The thighs were affected as well in 2 morbidly obese subjects. We suspect that these lesions are not uncommon in lymphedema but are simply under-recognized.
