## Question

left wrist pain differentials

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of left wrist pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clinical triage by onset, mechanism, localization, and associated symptoms. Then, I should confirm red flags and immediate imaging needs. Next, I will organize the differential by anatomic zone and pathophysiology, review key physical exam maneuvers, and map these to an evidence-based imaging algorithm. After that, I need to examine high-yield entities such as scaphoid fracture, TFCC pathology, de Quervain's tenosynovitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome, while not forgetting inflammatory, crystal, mass, and referred causes. Finally, I should outline initial management and when to escalate care, verifying that each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical triage frame. Acute pain after trauma raises concern for fracture or ligamentous injury, whereas subacute and chronic courses point toward overuse, degenerative, inflammatory, or neuropathic etiologies. Mechanism matters: a fall onto an outstretched hand increases the likelihood of scaphoid or distal radius fracture and scapholunate injury, and repetitive loading suggests tendinopathy or entrapment neuropathy. Anatomic localization narrows the field: radial pain implicates scaphoid, de Quervain's, or scapholunate problems; ulnar pain suggests TFCC, ECU tendinopathy, lunotriquetral injury, or ulnar impaction; volar symptoms raise carpal tunnel or flexor sheath issues. Systemic features or polyarticular involvement prompt consideration of inflammatory arthritis or crystal disease. I should keep these axes explicit before proceeding further [^113XJ29N] [^115deJfg] [^114pobUv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before screening for red flags. I need to ensure there is no open injury, neurovascular deficit, gross deformity, or suspected septic arthritis; if any are present, immediate emergency imaging and management are required. For acute trauma to the wrist, initial radiographs are indicated, and the term "sprain" should be used cautiously because MRI often reveals occult fractures or soft tissue injuries when plain films are normal, which can change management. I should double-check that my imaging sequence aligns with ACR acute trauma guidance and the recognition that many "sprains" conceal substantive pathology on MRI [^116gdzz6] [^114s4vbJ].

> Next, I will organize the differential by anatomic zone because localization drives both examination and imaging. Radial-sided pain raises scaphoid fracture, de Quervain's tenosynovitis, scapholunate instability, or superficial radial nerve entrapment. Ulnar-sided pain points to TFCC tears, ECU tendinopathy or subsheath injury, lunotriquetral instability, ulnar impaction, or rarer midcarpal impaction syndromes. Central or diffuse pain suggests advanced arthritis or complex ligamentous patterns. I need to ensure my working list remains anchored to the patient's localization and provocative activities before selecting tests [^115deJfg] [^113XJ29N] [^1168Dbi4] [^115qnEA5].

> I will now examine physical maneuvers that sharpen the differential. Wait, let me verify the classic signs: anatomic snuffbox and scaphoid tubercle tenderness for scaphoid injury; Finkelstein's test for de Quervain's; a battery of instability maneuvers for scapholunate and lunotriquetral pathology; ECU synergy test for ECU tendinosis or subsheath issues; and median nerve provocative tests and sensorimotor exam for carpal tunnel syndrome. I should also confirm general wrist exam structure to avoid missing multi-structure involvement [^113XJ29N] [^1142P4Dk] [^1133SEvn] [^116vMmau].

> Now, imaging strategy. I need to check my sequence for both acute and chronic scenarios. For chronic wrist pain, radiographs are usually the first step, followed by targeted advanced imaging based on clinical suspicion. For suspected CTS with nondiagnostic radiographs, ACR 2024 supports ultrasound or MRI as next imaging, tailored to the suspected condition. Wait, I initially thought ultrasound could be first-line for all chronic wrist pain, but I should correct that: radiography is typically the initial study, and then ultrasound or MRI are chosen according to the working diagnosis and location of symptoms. That order keeps us consistent with guideline methodology [^113c9XNE] [^112b7KC9] [^1117iinD].

> For acute FOOSH with radial-sided tenderness, I should maintain high suspicion for scaphoid fracture even if initial radiographs are negative. Conventional radiography can miss up to a third of scaphoid fractures; immobilization with repeat radiographs at 10–14 days is standard, but early MRI expedites diagnosis and reveals occult bony and soft tissue injury. CT can help define cortical integrity or fracture plane; reformatting along the scaphoid long axis improves accuracy compared with wrist-plane reformations. I should also remember that trapezium fractures are commonly occult and can mimic scaphoid injury, so cross-sectional imaging can redirect the diagnosis and management when plain films are negative but clinical suspicion remains high [^113XJ29N] [^112Tce5p] [^111ZBVxH] [^117E1gsC] [^112M6sJv] [^116i4VLH].

> Turning to ulnar-sided pain, let me consider TFCC and ECU pathology. History and exam guide whether instability of the distal radioulnar joint is present, which changes management. When radiographs show a fracture, MRI or MR/CT arthrography can delineate concurrent ligament injury; when films are normal but TFCC pathology is suspected, MRI or MRA can be selected to assess peripheral versus central tears. Peripheral TFCC tears may show secondary MRI signs, such as ECU tendon pathology and ulnar styloid bone marrow edema, which increase confidence. In select acute settings, cone-beam CT arthrography can accurately depict scapholunate and TFCC lesions with high specificity and near-perfect sensitivity for dorsal SLL tears, accelerating preoperative work-up, but availability and local expertise vary. If MRI confidence is low and clinical suspicion remains high, diagnostic arthroscopy remains a gold standard, especially for noncentral TFCC and interosseous ligament pathology, although I should weigh its limited added value when the preoperative diagnosis is nonspecific [^112DVeLW] [^116y7VLd] [^113ChmoZ] [^111y4kMe] [^111TgGpW].

> For radial-sided tendinopathies, I should confirm de Quervain's clinically with pain over the first dorsal compartment and a positive Finkelstein, while keeping CMC arthritis and scaphoid pathology in mind. Let me verify imaging: in chronic pain, start with radiographs to evaluate for arthritis or other bony causes, then use MRI if symptoms persist or if there are atypical features suggesting alternative pathology. That respects the stepwise ACR approach while avoiding overuse of advanced imaging when the exam is classic [^113XJ29N] [^116PvegJ] [^113HXgjb].

> I need to check neuropathic etiologies next. For CTS, diagnosis is supported by clinical criteria such as age over 45, sensory loss in the thumb, symptom relief by shaking the hand, and an elevated wrist ratio index, with functional scales aiding severity grading. Ultrasound measurement of the median nerve cross-sectional area can aid diagnosis, and in chronic wrist pain when radiographs are nondiagnostic, ACR allows ultrasound or MRI depending on presentation. Ulnar neuropathy at the wrist can present with ulnar-digit sensory changes and is often activity-related. Electrodiagnostic testing can characterize severity and localization when the clinical picture is unclear or prior to intervention [^112GB4nX] [^114xzrH4] [^1117iinD] [^113XJ29N].

> But wait, what if overuse and stress patterns are driving symptoms? I should consider lunate stress injuries in athletes with dorsal wrist pain, and Kienböck disease in chronic dorsal pain with stiffness or reduced grip, remembering that metabolic comorbidity like gout can coexist and complicate the presentation. Imaging selection should be guided by chronicity, localization, and exam, with radiographs first and MRI for bone marrow changes or early osteonecrosis staging when indicated [^1113N82m] [^115deJfg] [^113ztGST].

> I will now examine crystal and calcific entities that can mimic infection. Acute calcific tendinitis around the wrist can present with abrupt focal pain, erythema, and swelling; radiographs show peri-tendinous calcifications, and symptoms typically resolve with NSAIDs and immobilization. CPPD can affect the wrist and present as acute or chronic arthropathy; distinguishing it from septic and inflammatory arthritis relies on aspiration, imaging, and clinical context. These are important differentials when inflammatory signs are prominent in the wrist region [^112sJg58] [^1161Y1s1] [^115deJfg].

> Let me consider masses that present as wrist pain or tenderness. Dorsal ganglion cysts are the most common wrist masses, often arising from the scapholunate joint; MRI confirms a fluid signal lesion with rim enhancement and no internal enhancement. A carpal boss at the dorsal carpometacarpal junction can be a painful bony prominence that sometimes requires excision, though instability risk should be weighed. Noting their characteristic locations helps prevent misclassification as ligamentous injury or occult fracture [^113q9Aha] [^1125DNMG].

> Hold on, I should not overlook referred pain. Cervical radiculopathy and shoulder or elbow pathology can masquerade as wrist pain, so a proximal screen is prudent when findings are discordant. Rarely, cardiac ischemia may present atypically as wrist pain; disproportionate or unexplained bilateral wrist pain with risk factors should prompt cardiac evaluation, especially when accompanied by concerning systemic symptoms or ECG changes. While uncommon, these entities underscore the need to reconsider when symptoms outstrip local findings [^113YPjGS] [^111Pdt9t] [^116cfSL1].

> Finally, initial management should match the suspected diagnosis and acuity. I should confirm that acute traumatic pain is immobilized appropriately with timely imaging follow-up, and that analgesia includes NSAIDs unless contraindicated, recognizing that evidence does not clearly favor selective over nonselective NSAIDs after orthopedic trauma. For TFCC injuries without instability, conservative measures are reasonable before operative consideration; documented distal radioulnar joint instability, high-grade interosseous ligament disruption, or displaced fractures warrant early surgical referral. Throughout, I need to reassess the diagnosis if the response to care is suboptimal or if new red flags emerge [^114DjUTe] [^1133DBoD] [^115deJfg].

> In summary, I should proceed in a disciplined sequence: define onset and mechanism, localize pain and reproduce it with targeted maneuvers, obtain radiographs first in chronic pain and in all acute trauma, and then select advanced imaging tailored to the leading differential, while keeping neuropathic, inflammatory, crystal, mass, and referred causes in play. If my findings conflict or the patient trajectory deviates from expectations, I should double-check the localization and reconsider the imaging pathway per ACR guidance to avoid missed occult fractures or ligamentous injuries [^113c9XNE] [^1117iinD] [^116gdzz6].

Left wrist pain has a broad differential encompassing **traumatic injuries** (scaphoid, distal radius, carpal fractures; ligamentous injuries; TFCC tears) [^115deJfg], **degenerative conditions** (osteoarthritis, Kienböck's disease) [^113XJ29N], **inflammatory arthropathies** (rheumatoid arthritis, gout, CPPD) [^1124uUZ4], **tendinopathies** (de Quervain's, ECU, FCR), **nerve entrapments** (carpal tunnel, ulnar neuropathy) [^112GB4nX] [^111Mh7r9], and **other causes** (ganglion cysts, infections, tumors, referred pain) [^113q9Aha] [^113YPjGS]. A **structured approach — history, examination, and targeted imaging** (radiographs first, then MRI/CT/US as indicated) — is essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^116vMmau] [^116gdzz6] [^1117iinD] [^112b7KC9].

---

## Traumatic injuries

- **Scaphoid fracture**: common with FOOSH [^113XJ29N]; often occult on initial radiographs [^111J5hng]; MRI/CT may be needed [^112Tce5p].

- **Distal radius fracture**: Colles' and Smith's patterns; usually radiographically apparent [^116gdzz6].

- **Carpal fractures**: lunate, triquetrum, trapezium; may be radiographically occult [^112M6sJv] [^111J5hng].

- **Ligamentous injuries**: scapholunate, lunotriquetral, TFCC [^111PFL2D]; instability and chronic pain [^1168Dbi4].

---

## Degenerative conditions

Among degenerative conditions, **osteoarthritis** is common in older adults [^1124uUZ4] and causes pain, stiffness, and reduced ROM, while **Kienböck's disease** — AVN of the lunate — leads to chronic dorsal wrist pain, stiffness, and reduced grip [^113ztGST].

---

## Inflammatory arthropathies

Inflammatory arthropathies include **rheumatoid arthritis**, characterized by symmetric inflammatory arthritis with common wrist involvement [^1124uUZ4]; **gout**, an acute monoarthritis with urate crystals causing severe pain, swelling, and erythema; and **calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD)**, which causes pseudogout with acute or chronic wrist pain and calcifications [^114zjeNN] [^117NGmpc].

---

## Tendinopathies and tenosynovitis

- **De Quervain's tenosynovitis**: first dorsal compartment [^113XJ29N]; radial wrist pain; positive Finkelstein [^116PvegJ].

- **Extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendinopathy**: ulnar-sided pain; ECU synergy test positive [^1133SEvn].

- **Flexor carpi radialis (FCR) tendinopathy**: volar radial pain; aggravated by wrist flexion [^116vMmau].

---

## Nerve entrapment syndromes

In nerve entrapment syndromes, **carpal tunnel syndrome** involves median nerve compression [^111Mh7r9] causing pain, numbness, tingling, and thenar weakness [^112GB4nX], while **ulnar nerve entrapment at Guyon's canal** produces ulnar-sided pain, numbness, and weakness [^113XJ29N].

---

## Other causes

- **Ganglion cysts**: dorsal/volar masses [^113q9Aha]; pain with motion or pressure.

- **Infections**: septic arthritis, tenosynovitis; acute pain, swelling, erythema, systemic symptoms [^113XJ29N].

- **Tumors**: benign/malignant lesions (e.g. osteoid osteoma); chronic pain, swelling [^113YPjGS].

- **Referred pain**: cervical radiculopathy, myocardial ischemia; atypical presentations [^113YPjGS] [^111Pdt9t].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Begin with a **history and physical examination** addressing onset, mechanism, location, and systemic symptoms [^113XJ29N], and perform a focused exam using provocative tests [^1142P4Dk]. Start imaging with **radiographs** [^116gdzz6], and use **MRI/CT/US** to evaluate occult fractures, soft tissue, or nerve pathology [^1117iinD] [^112b7KC9]. Laboratory tests include **inflammatory markers, uric acid, and serology** for inflammatory or infectious causes [^1124uUZ4].

---

Left wrist pain spans traumatic, degenerative, inflammatory, tendinopathy, nerve entrapment, and other causes [^115deJfg]; a **structured evaluation with history, examination, and stepwise imaging is key** to diagnosis and management [^113c9XNE].

### Evaluation and diagnosis of wrist pain: a case-based approach [^113XJ29N]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with wrist pain commonly present with an acute injury or the spontaneous onset of pain without a definite traumatic event. A fall onto an outstretched hand can lead to a scaphoid fracture, which is the most commonly fractured carpal bone. Conventional radiography alone can miss up to 30 percent of scaphoid fractures. Specialized views, such as posteroanterior in ulnar deviation and pronated oblique, alongside repeat radiography in 10 to 14 days, can improve sensitivity for scaphoid fractures. If a suspected scaphoid fracture cannot be confirmed with plain radiography, a bone scan or magnetic resonance imaging can be utilized.

Subacute or chronic wrist pain usually develops gradually with or without a prior traumatic event. In these cases, the differential diagnosis is wide and includes tendinopathy and nerve entrapment. Overuse of the muscles of the forearm and wrist may lead to tendinopathy. Radial pain involving mostly the first extensor compartment is commonly de Quervain tenosynovitis. The diagnosis is based on history and examination findings, including a positive Finkelstein test and a negative grind test.

Nerve entrapment at the wrist presents with pain as well as sensory and sometimes motor symptoms. In ulnar neuropathies of the wrist, the typical presentation is wrist discomfort with sensory changes in the fourth and fifth digits. Activities that involve repetitive or prolonged wrist extension, such as cycling, karate, and baseball (specifically catchers), may increase the risk of ulnar neuropathy. Electrodiagnostic tests identify the area of nerve entrapment and the extent of the issue.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic hand and wrist pain: 2023 update [^1117iinD]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), and more specifically with respect to wrist imaging, ACR 2024 guidelines recommend considering an ultrasound or MRI as the next imaging study after normal or indeterminate radiographs in patients with chronic wrist pain suspicious of CTS.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: A review of the recent literature [^111Mh7r9]. The Open Orthopaedics Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on carpal tunnel syndrome:

- **Definition**: CTS is a condition characterized by symptomatic compressive neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist.

- **Pathophysiology**: CTS is caused by compression and traction of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, either due to idiopathic causes or secondary to fibrous hypertrophy of the synovial flexor sheath, or due to repetitive movements of the wrist.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence and incidence of CTS in the United States are 7.8% and 2.3 per 100 person-years, respectively.

- **Disease course**: The combination of increased pressure in the tunnel, median nerve microcirculation injury, median nerve connective tissue compression, and synovial tissue hypertrophy results in altered function of the nerve, demyelination, and degeneration of the nerve at the site of compression and beyond. These events cause paresthesias, weakness, and loss of function in the distal distribution of the median nerve (thumb, index, middle finger, and the radial side of the ring finger) and even outside the distribution of the median nerve.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Carpal tunnel release is effective in 70–90% of the patients. The recurrence rate after carpal tunnel release varies from 3–25%.

### Focal hand lesions: Review and radiological approach [^113q9Aha]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Ganglion cysts are the most common lumps encountered in the hand and wrist region. They tend to occur in young adults and are three times more frequent in females. These cysts are thought to represent the degeneration of connective tissue caused by chronic irritation. The most common location is the dorsum of the wrist, where they usually arise from the scapholunate joint. Less typical sites include the volar aspect of the wrist from the radio-scaphoid or scapho-trapezial joint, at the metacarpophalangeal joint in relation to flexor tendons, and distal interphalangeal joints. MR imaging shows a well-circumscribed unilocular or multilocular lesion of fluid signal, although the signal may vary depending on the amount of proteinaceous content. Mild rim enhancement of the capsule may be seen, but there is usually no enhancement of internal contents. Differential diagnoses include synovial cysts and other cystic lesions such as epidermal cysts.

- **Figure 1**: Ganglion cyst in a 24-year-old female who presented with a slowly growing, firm, painless hand lump for about six months.
	- (a) T1-weighted sequence shows a smooth, well-circumscribed lesion within the thenar musculature of homogeneous low signal.
	- (b) The lesion is hyperintense on the T2-weighted with fat suppression sequence. No invasion into adjacent structures is seen.
	- (c) There is minimal rim enhancement with no significant internal enhancement (arrow).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic hand and wrist pain: 2023 update [^112b7KC9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Chronic hand and wrist pain is a common presenting complaint. The intricate anatomy results in a variety of pain generators: multiple bones, articular cartilage, intrinsic ligaments, triangular fibrocartilage complex, joint capsules and synovium, tendons and tendon sheaths, muscles, and nerves in a compact space. The need for imaging and the choice of the appropriate imaging modality are best determined by the patient's presentation, physical examination, and the clinician's working differential diagnosis. Radiography is usually appropriate as the initial imaging study in the evaluation of chronic hand or wrist pain.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Sphenopalatine ganglion block for ipsilateral shoulder pain following open pancreaticoduodenectomy [^113wkZZJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The differential diagnoses included pain from surgical positioning and immediate postoperative complications such as anastomotic leak or subphrenic collections, cardiac complications, pulmonary complications, and/or referred pain from manipulation of the pancreas. The patient was afebrile and had no leukocytosis.

Chest X-ray findings included: heart and mediastinum of normal size and contour; linear opacity in the left lower lobe likely representing atelectasis; no developing chronic heart failure or pneumonia; unremarkable osseous structures, particularly involving the left shoulder; no acute fracture or dislocation; and an unremarkable acromioclavicular joint. This suggested that the source of the pain was not from surgical malposition nor from a pulmonary complication.

ECG showed sinus rhythm and a heart rate of 79 beats per minute with a normal axis, which made the shoulder pain from a cardiac complication less likely. Since there were no signs of systemic infection at that time, which could point towards immediate postoperative complications, the primary surgical team chose not to perform a CT scan at this time. The remaining differential diagnosis was referred pain from manipulation of the pancreas.

### Stress injury of the lunate in tennis players: A case series and related biomechanical considerations [^1113N82m]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The objective was to investigate the clinical and imaging differential diagnosis, as well as tennis stroke biomechanics potentially involved in the pathogenesis of lunate stress injury.

- **Methods**: The present report describes five competitive tennis players with overuse-related dorsal wrist pain assessed by magnetic resonance imaging.

- **Results**: Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of lunate stress injury. All players were treated conservatively, with symptom resolution and complete functional recovery achieved at 14 weeks.

- **Conclusions**: Lunate stress injuries should be considered in the differential diagnosis of overuse-related dorsal wrist pain in tennis players.

### Pediatric ulnar-sided wrist pain: A review of the current literature [^115eeKuP]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with ulnar-sided wrist pain can pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to physicians because there are several pathologies with similar signs and symptoms. In comparison with adult patients, other etiologies must be considered in the pediatric patient, given the skeletal immaturity and potential for known or unrecognized syndromes. In addition, these patients may not be able to articulate their symptoms as clearly as an adult patient, further stressing the importance of obtaining a pertinent history and performing a focused physical examination. Having a thorough understanding of the anatomy, the varying pathologies, and the indications for surgical and nonsurgical management will assist in improved patient outcomes.

### Role of MRI in the diagnosis of clinically suspected scaphoid fracture: Analysis of 611 consecutive cases and literature review [^112Tce5p]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

A clinically suspected scaphoid fracture with normal initial plain X-rays is a difficult but common problem. The role of MRI as a diagnostic modality in this situation was analyzed based on the experience of 611 consecutive cases.

- **Methods**: All patients presenting to the emergency department with a history of a fall on an outstretched hand, tenderness over the anatomical snuff box, and scaphoid tubercle but normal plain X-rays were offered MRI as part of the standard protocol. Between January 2003 and November 2005, 611 of a total of 619 such patients underwent the scan and formed the study cohort. Coronal 3 mm T1 and Short Tau Inversion Recovery images were obtained using a 12 cm field of view as standard.

- **Results**: There were 342 abnormal scans (56%) and 269 (44%) normal scans. Of the abnormal scans, 80% showed acute bony injuries, 8% showed acute soft tissue injuries, and 12% showed incidental pathology.

- **Conclusions**: MRI is a useful and effective tool in the diagnosis of radiologically occult wrist injuries. It is feasible to perform MRI scans in a timely manner in a district general hospital.

### Scapholunate instability: Current concepts in diagnosis and management [^1168Dbi4]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Injuries to the scapholunate joint are the most frequent cause of carpal instability and account for a considerable degree of wrist dysfunction, lost time from work, and interference with activities. The complex arrangement and kinematics of the two rows of carpal bones allow for an enormous degree of physiologic motion. A hierarchy of primary and secondary ligaments serves to balance an inherently unstable structure. Although not sufficient to cause abnormal carpal posture or collapse on static radiographs, an isolated injury to the scapholunate interosseous ligament may be the harbinger of a relentless progression to abnormal joint mechanics, cartilage wear, and degenerative change.

- **Intervention for scapholunate instability**: Aimed at arresting the degenerative process by restoring ligament continuity and normalizing carpal kinematics.

In this review, we discuss the anatomy, kinematics, and biomechanical properties of the scapholunate articulation and provide a foundation for understanding the spectrum of scapholunate ligament instability. We propose an algorithm for treatment based on the stage of injury, degree of secondary ligamentous damage, and arthritic change.

### Clinical differentiation of upper extremity pain etiologies [^113YPjGS]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Upper extremity pain can result from many overlapping etiologies. These can be categorized into anatomic regions and specific organ systems. Anatomically, pain etiologies are classified into four major groups: neurologic, musculoskeletal, vascular, and other (e.g. tumor, infection). Knowledge of the characteristic clinical presentation and physical examination findings of each group can help distinguish the source of the patient's complaints quickly, so that an accurate clinical diagnosis can facilitate appropriate diagnostic measures and treatment.

- **Neurologic causes**: Focus on cervical spine pathology, peripheral nerve compression, and neuropathy.
- **Musculoskeletal causes**: Include shoulder and elbow pain (e.g. adhesive capsulitis, calcific tendinitis, biceps tendinitis, synovitis).

Understanding the distinguishing characteristics, such as periscapular pain, two-point discrimination, and signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI, helps determine the appropriate diagnosis.

### Differential diagnosis of polyarticular arthritis [^114pobUv]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Polyarticular arthritis is commonly encountered in clinical settings and has multiple etiologies. The first step is to distinguish between true articular pain and nonarticular or periarticular conditions by recognizing clinical patterns through the history and physical examination. Once pain within a joint or joints is confirmed, the next step is to classify the pain as noninflammatory or inflammatory in origin.

Noninflammatory arthritis, which is mostly related to osteoarthritis, has a variable onset and severity and does not have inflammatory features, such as warm or swollen joints. Osteoarthritis usually presents with less than one hour of morning stiffness and pain that is aggravated by activity and improves with rest. A review of systems is usually negative for rashes, oral ulcers, or other internal organ involvement.

In contrast, inflammatory arthritis generally causes warm, swollen joints; prolonged morning stiffness; and positive findings on a review of systems. Once inflammatory arthritis is suspected, possible diagnoses are sorted by the pattern of joint involvement, which includes number and type of joints involved, symmetry, and onset. The suspicion for inflammatory arthritis should be confirmed by the appropriate serologic/tissue and/or imaging studies in the clinical setting or in consultation with a subspecialist.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute hand and wrist trauma [^112DVeLW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for distal radius fracture, specifically in terms of diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining any of the following imaging studies in adult patients with suspected wrist tendon or ligament trauma when radiographs show an acute wrist fracture:

- **Magnetic resonance arthrography**: Useful for detailed imaging of joint structures.
- **MRI without IV contrast**: Provides high-resolution images to assess soft tissue and bone.
- **CT arthrography**: Offers a detailed view of the bone and joint architecture.
- **Ultrasound**: Effective for evaluating soft tissue abnormalities.

### Midcarpal impaction syndromes as a rare cause of ulnar-sided wrist pain: A review [^113o32CF]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Ulnar-sided wrist pain remains a commonly encountered diagnostic challenge, and its successful management requires a comprehensive understanding of the multiple conditions that can present with this symptom. Midcarpal impaction syndromes, in the form of hamato-lunate and triquetro-hamate impingement, have both previously been reported as rare potential causes of ulnar-sided wrist pain. Despite this, they remain poorly recognized and incompletely understood. This article reviews existing literature that describes the diagnosis and management of these clinical entities.

### The benefit of magnetic resonance imaging for patients with posttraumatic radial wrist tenderness [^116i4VLH]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

To describe fractures revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a series of skeletally mature patients with radial wrist pain after an acute injury and clinically suspected to have a scaphoid fracture, we attempted to assess the diagnostic value of radiographs and computed tomography (CT) in patients with scaphoid and other carpal fractures verified by MRI.

- **Methods**: We conducted the study prospectively over a 3-year period on skeletally mature patients presenting at our emergency department with tenderness on the radial side of the wrist after an injury. A total of 300 wrists in 296 patients underwent clinical and radiographic examination. We performed low-field, 0.23-T MRI of all injured wrists within 3 working days from inclusion in the study. If the radiographs or MRI revealed a scaphoid fracture, we immediately carried out a supplementary 16-slice CT scan of the wrist. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of radiographs and CT for the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures using MRI as the reference standard.

- **Results**: We diagnosed a total of 224 fractures in 196 wrists using MRI; 42% were scaphoid fractures, 15% were distal radius fractures, 6% were triquetrum fractures, and 5% were capitate fractures. The most commonly found fracture combinations were those of the scaphoid and distal radius, followed by scaphoid and capitate fractures. The sensitivity of radiographs for visualization of scaphoid fractures was 70% and the specificity was 98%. Radiographic sensitivity for other fractures was less than 60%.

### An update on polymyalgia rheumatica [^113NBoSM]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Conditions affecting people aged 50 years and older and associated with bilateral shoulder pain should be included in the differential diagnoses of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). This is especially true as there are no specific diagnostic tests for PMR, and misdiagnosing any condition as PMR may lead to unnecessary exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs) for extensive periods. The differential diagnosis should include both rheumatic and non-rheumatic diseases.

- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Among the most important rheumatic conditions in the differential diagnoses of PMR is seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This is particularly true early in the disease onset of RA, which might have a prodromal phase of bilateral shoulder joint arthritis. Additionally, both RA and PMR can present with arthritis in wrist joints. If patients test negative for rheumatoid factor and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), differentiating between these two conditions may not be easy. However, the presence of symmetric small joint arthritis should favor the RA diagnosis. Both RA and PMR can be successfully treated with prednisolone, limiting the utility of this medication in differentiation. Typical extra-articular manifestations (e.g. rheumatoid nodules, cutaneous vasculitis, serositis) and positive RF/anti-CCP favor the diagnosis of RA rather than PMR.

- **Myositis**: Polymyositis (PM) is another disease that may be misdiagnosed as PMR and vice versa. Both conditions affect the proximal muscle groups in the upper and lower extremities. However, the presence of muscle weakness rather than stiffness is a distinguishing factor.

### ACR appropriateness criteria chronic wrist pain [^113c9XNE]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Radiographs are indicated as the first imaging test in all patients with chronic wrist pain, regardless of the suspected diagnosis. When radiographs are normal or equivocal, advanced imaging with MRI (without or with intravenous contrast or following arthrography), CT (usually without contrast), and ultrasound each has a role in establishing a diagnosis. Furthermore, these examinations may contribute to staging disease, treatment planning, and prognostication even when radiographs are diagnostic of a specific condition. Which examination or examinations are best depends on the specific location of pain and the clinically suspected conditions. The American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA appropriateness method and grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Pseudogout or pseudolymphoma? Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease of the cervical spine: a rare presentation and literature review [^117NGmpc]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease is a crystal arthropathy primarily affecting peripheral joints, most commonly the wrist and the knees. However, CPPD in the cervical spine is a rare entity. This report describes a case of CPPD of the cervical spine which presents with symptoms of neck pain and brachalgia.

A 62-year-old woman presented with left-sided upper limb and neck pain. MRI scanning revealed a low signal abnormality within the C6 and C7 vertebrae, and the possibility of lymphoma was raised. The patient was recalled for gadolinium-enhanced scans, which showed perivertebral and marrow enhancement. Fine-needle aspirate histology initially suggested a spindle cell tumour or lymphoma. However, CT-guided biopsy showed positively birefringent crystals, confirming CPPD.

CPPD of the spine is a rare differential of nerve impingement in the cervical spine when MRI scanning shows perivertebral signal enhancement. Furthermore, CPPD of the spine can mimic malignancy.

### Ultrasound imaging and guidance in common wrist/hand pathologies [^116Ch81p]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

Wrist and hand pain are prevalent musculoskeletal conditions with a wide spectrum of etiologies, ranging from overuse injuries to soft tissue tumors. Although most anatomical structures are quite superficial and can be easily evaluated during a physical examination, the use of ultrasound imaging and guidance has gained significant attention in the prompt management of these conditions.

This review aims to illustrate detailed cadaveric wrist and hand anatomy to enhance understanding of ultrasonographic examinations and interventions in conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger, de Quervain's tenosynovitis, rhizarthrosis, and radiocarpal joint arthritis. Additionally, evidence from the literature is presented to support the rationale for the unconditional use of ultrasound guidance in musculoskeletal practice.

### Computed tomography for suspected scaphoid fractures: Comparison of reformations in the plane of the wrist versus the long axis of the scaphoid [^117E1gsC]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

Definitive diagnosis of occult scaphoid fractures remains difficult. We tested the null hypothesis that, for diagnosis of true fractures among suspected scaphoid fractures, computed tomography (CT) reformations along the long axis of the scaphoid have the same accuracy as reformations made relative to the anatomical planes of the wrist.

- **Methods**: In a prospective trial, 34 patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture underwent CT scanning within 10 days after trauma. CT reformations along the long axis of the scaphoid (CT-scaphoid) and along planes relative to the wrist (CT-wrist) were made. We used radiographs obtained 6 weeks after injury as the reference standard for a true fracture. A blinded panel including two surgeons and one radiologist came to a consensus diagnosis for each reformation plane.

- **Results**: The reference standard showed six fractures of the scaphoid (prevalence 18%). Using CT-wrist, a scaphoid fracture was diagnosed in five patients (15%), with three false positives, four false negatives, and two true positive diagnoses. Using CT-scaphoid, a scaphoid fracture was diagnosed in five patients (15%), with one false positive, two false negatives, and four true positive results. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 33%, 89%, and 79% for CT-wrist, and 67%, 96%, and 91% for CT-scaphoid, respectively. This resulted in positive predictive values of 36% for CT-wrist and 76% for CT-scaphoid. Negative predictive values were 87% for CT-wrist and 94% for CT-scaphoid. No significant differences were found with the number of patients available.

### Unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome: An unusual presentation of nodular fasciitis [^117U3ByF]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A healthy 38-year-old man presented with occasional pain in his right wrist and tingling sensations in his right thumb, index, and middle fingers, lasting for six weeks. The symptoms developed insidiously and progressed gradually, prompting the patient to seek medical attention. There was no history of preceding trauma, fever, multiple joint pain, or morning stiffness. He had no other medical illnesses.

Physical examination revealed mild, diffuse fullness over the volar aspect of the wrist, with mild tenderness upon deep palpation. There was no local increase in temperature. Resisted active finger flexion elicited wrist pain. Tinel's sign was positive for the median nerve, and Phalen's test was also positive. The range of motion at the wrist was comparable to the left wrist. There was no hypoesthesia or motor weakness observed on neurological examination.

### The carpal boss: Review of diagnosis and treatment [^1125DNMG]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

It is not uncommon to find a protruding mass at the dorsum of the wrist. The carpal boss is a commonly overlooked condition of unclear etiology. Minor trauma and persisting os styloideum are among the suspected causes of the condition. Long-standing carpal boss can lead to osteoarthritic damage in some patients.

Many diagnostic tools, such as a "carpal boss view" radiographic study or a technetium bone scan, are available to help differentiate carpal boss from other, more common masses of the dorsal aspect of the wrist. For years, excision of the mass has been a commonly described treatment because conservative treatment does not always provide relief of symptoms. However, the benefits of wide excision must be balanced by the risks of instability at the involved joints, leading to persistent and potentially worsened symptoms.

### Unusual and very rare presentation of wrist pain in a man with acute anterior myocardial infarction, a case report and literature of review [^111Pdt9t]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

A 41-year-old man came to the emergency room with pain in both wrists and mild epigastric pain. He did not experience shoulder or arm pain. The wrist pain began around 11:00 p.m. the previous night, but the patient dismissed it, took acetaminophen, and went to sleep. At approximately 3:30 a.m., he awoke with severe pain in both wrists. Despite the intensity, there was no sweating, nausea, or vomiting. He reported no pain in the chest, back, or other areas of his arms.

After experiencing wrist pain and a mild burning sensation in the epigastrium at 4:30 a.m., he proceeded to Valiasr Hospital, a center specializing in digestive problems, for emergency treatment. Due to the epigastric pain, a routine ECG was performed. Although the patient reported no prior medical history of trauma, the differential diagnosis for wrist pain included fractures, ischemic events, or thrombotic events. However, these were ruled out upon further examination.

The ECG revealed an acute anterior STEMI, confirmed by a positive Troponin-I test. Consequently, the patient was transferred to Razi Birjand Hospital at 4:45 a.m., a facility equipped with PCI capabilities. The patient's vital signs were stable: blood pressure was 128/76 mmHg, pulse rate 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 37.2°C, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 97%. His medical history included hypertension, occasional cigarette smoking, but no family history of heart disease. Heart and lung auscultation were normal during the clinical examinations. His laboratory data were consistent with the diagnosis.

### Do computerized tomography scans change management in carpometacarpal dislocations and fracture-dislocations [^114hVMVV]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

The treating physician must have a high index of suspicion for this injury, as they can frequently be missed, and delayed diagnosis can result in substantial dysfunction and worse surgical outcomes. There is no consensus on the use of advanced imaging for the characterization of potentially operative concomitant injuries in the setting of carpometacarpal dislocations and fracture-dislocations (CMCD/FD). Previous studies have shown that the sensitivity of x-rays for diagnosing concomitant carpal injuries is lacking, with up to 50% of initial wrist injuries being undiagnosed with plain films. These findings suggest that computerized tomography (CT) is a useful adjunct if there is clinical suspicion of additional injury.

This study aims to answer the question: Is obtaining a CT scan in a patient with a CMCD/FD likely to change that patient's management? We demonstrate that one should have a high suspicion for concomitant injuries in both low- and high-velocity mechanisms that cause a CMCD/FD in the hand. In comparison to plain films alone, obtaining a preoperative CT scan frequently led to new bony injury diagnosis and changed operative management just over half of the time. These diagnoses ranged from fractures and fracture-dislocations of surrounding metacarpals to fractures of the carpal bones. These findings suggest that CT scans are a useful adjunct to identify clinically relevant injuries in patients with CMCD/FD, even in the setting of low-velocity trauma.

In particular, damage to the second and third carpometacarpal joint (CMCJ) was associated with a high proportion of concomitant injuries, suggesting that injuries capable of disrupting these highly stable joints are likely to cause additional damage.

### Management and outcomes of clinical scaphoid fractures in children [^117LiNcM]. Hand (2022). Low credibility.

Acute wrist trauma with clinical suspicion of a scaphoid fracture, but normal radiographs, is known as a clinical scaphoid fracture. Standard treatment involves immobilization and repeat radiographs in 10 to 14 days. When repeat radiographs are normal but a scaphoid fracture is still clinically suspected, the optimal management in children is unknown.

This study retrospectively assessed the management and outcomes of pediatric patients diagnosed with clinical scaphoid fractures. A retrospective study was performed of all patients over a 2-year period treated for a clinical scaphoid fracture at a tertiary pediatric center. Patients were included if they had clinical signs of a scaphoid fracture and 2 negative x-rays 7 to 14 days apart postinjury.

Results: Ninety-one patients with a mean age of 13.2 years (range: 7.8–17.7) were included. Sixteen patients (17.6%) underwent computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a mean time of 10.2 weeks postinjury. Five patients (5.5%) were diagnosed with a scaphoid fracture by x-ray or CT at an average of 4.5 weeks postinjury (range: 3–6). Six patients were diagnosed with other wrist fractures at a mean time postinjury of 3.1 (range: 3–6.5) weeks. Out of 195 total radiographs, the surgeon and radiologist disagreed on 59 (30.2%) images. No patients underwent surgery.

Management of clinical scaphoid fractures at our institution was relatively uniform: nearly all patients were immobilized and less than 20% received advanced imaging. Our findings suggest a low but non-zero occult scaphoid…

### Acute calcific tendinitis of the wrist [^112sJg58]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Acute calcific tendinitis, a benign and self-limiting inflammatory condition commonly seen in the shoulder, is also described in many other tendons, including those in the hand and wrist. When involving the wrist, acute calcific tendinitis is often misdiagnosed and mistaken for infection.

- **Objective**: We present this case to increase familiarity with this condition and avoid errors in diagnosis that could result in inappropriate treatment with antibiotics or even surgery.

- **Case report**: A 27-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with a two-week history of volar wrist pain, accompanied by a sudden increase in pain, chills, and new onset swelling and redness of the wrist. Plain radiographs showed characteristic soft-tissue calcification overlying the insertion of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon into the wrist. Treatment with ibuprofen and splinting resulted in complete symptom resolution.

- **Conclusion**: Acute calcific tendinitis is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of acute wrist pain. Radiographs are helpful in confirming the diagnosis when symptoms and examination findings are characteristic.

### Primary meningococcal arthritis as a presentation of nodal marginal zone lymphoma [^112mfkrU]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 68-year-old man presented with a 4-day history of worsening knee and arm pain. On examination, there was erythema and swelling of the left knee and both wrists. Joint aspiration grew *Neisseria meningitidis*. Blood tests showed an unusually high total protein level (100g/L) and an IgM kappa paraprotein band of 45g/L on protein electrophoresis. CT showed widespread lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and multilevel thoracic vertebral collapse. A bone marrow biopsy revealed a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, and a lymph node biopsy showed features of nodal marginal zone lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation.

### A new definition of wrist sprain necessary after findings in a prospective MRI study [^114s4vbJ]. Injury (2012). Low credibility.

Wrist injuries with negative X-rays are diagnosed as acute wrist sprains. The prognosis is usually good, but some patients suffer from long-lasting pain and reduced wrist function, probably due to missed diagnosis followed by inappropriate treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate acute wrist sprains with MRI to detect the pathoanatomy of the injury.

- **Patients and methods**: This prospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study included patients between 18 and 49 years, who attended the Accident and Emergency Department (A&E) Bergen, Norway, after sustaining an acute wrist trauma within the previous week. Initial X-rays of the wrist were normal. MRI was done within a median of 1 day (range 0–31 days) after the trauma, 80% within 4 days. The study period lasted from 5 November 2009 to 4 November 2010.

- **Results**: A total of 155 acute MRIs were done, out of which 30 were completely normal. Patients with positive MRI had a median of two (range 0–8) pathological findings. We found 54 fractures and 56 bone bruises, mostly located to the radius followed by the scaphoid, the triquetrum, the capitate, and the lunate. There were 73 soft-tissue injuries, which included 15 injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and five scapho-lunate (SL) ligament lesions.

- **Conclusions**: Wrist sprain is an inaccurate diagnosis. In four out of five patients with normal X-rays, MRI identified pathological findings and a large variety of injuries in different structures. We suggest that wrist sprain should be defined as "occult partial or complete soft tissue (ligament) injury" based on the findings.

### Bilateral Kienböck's disease concomitant with gouty arthritis [^113ztGST]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of pain and stiffness in the bilateral wrists. The pain in the right wrist was disabling and severe enough to restrict daily life activities. After evaluating clinical and radiological features, the patient was diagnosed with Kienböck's disease, Lichtman stage IIIB in the right wrist and stage IIIA in the left wrist. Routine laboratory investigations revealed a serum uric acid level of 9.27 mg/dL.

- **Treatment**: Lunate excision and scaphocapitate fusion were performed on the right wrist after discussing with the patient. The histopathological examinations of tophi in synovial tissue were negatively birefringent under polarised light microscopy, confirming the diagnosis of gout. Febuxostat was started postoperatively.

The patient returned to work at the end of 5 months. There was no recurrence of symptoms and no radiological signs of arthritis at the end of 1 year.

### Polyarticular joint pain in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1124uUZ4]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

Polyarticular joint pain involves five or more joints and can be inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Two of the most common causes of chronic polyarthritis are osteoarthritis, especially in older patients, and rheumatoid arthritis, which affects at least 0.25% of adults worldwide. The initial evaluation should include a detailed history of the patient's symptoms with a focus on inflammation, location of pain, duration of symptoms, presence of systemic symptoms, and any exposures to pathogens that could cause arthritis. Redness, warmth, or swelling in a joint is suggestive of synovitis and joint inflammation.

A systematic approach to the physical examination that assesses for a pattern of joint involvement and presence of synovitis can help narrow the differential diagnosis. Laboratory tests, joint aspiration, and imaging studies should be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis. Rheumatoid factor and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody tests are helpful when there is concern for rheumatoid arthritis. Although magnetic resonance imaging is highly sensitive in identifying erosive bony changes and inflammation, conventional radiography remains the standard for the initial imaging evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis. Point-of-care musculoskeletal ultrasonography can also be a useful tool to detect findings that support a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis.

### Calcium deposits in the hand and wrist [^1161Y1s1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Calcium, or calcific, deposition disease in the form of acute calcific periarthritis of the hand and wrist is an uncommon entity that may be confused with more common crystalline or inflammatory arthropathies, as well as infection. It is important for the clinician to be aware of this disease process and to include it in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acutely painful, focal inflammation of the hand or wrist. Nonsurgical management is often sufficient. However, considering the self-limited nature of the disease, accurate diagnosis is essential to avoid unnecessary antibiotic or surgical treatment.

### Adult scaphoid fracture [^111ZBVxH]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Scaphoid fractures are the most common carpal fractures, accounting for 70% of carpal bone fractures. The diagnostic accuracy of physical examination findings and emergency medicine (EM) imaging studies for scaphoid fractures has not been previously described in the EM literature. Plain X-rays are insufficient to rule out scaphoid fractures in patients with a suggestive mechanism and radial-sided tenderness on physical examination. This study is a meta-analysis of historical features, physical examination findings, and imaging studies for scaphoid fractures not visualized on plain X-rays in adult emergency department (ED) patients. It specifically addresses which types of imaging tests should be recommended for patients with persistent concern for an acute fracture after ED discharge.

- **Methods**: A medical librarian and two emergency physicians (EPs) conducted a medical literature search of PubMed and EMBASE. The original studies' bibliographies were reviewed for additional references, and unpublished manuscripts were located via a hand search of EM research abstracts from national meetings. All abstracts were independently reviewed by the two physicians, and the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) was used to assess individual study quality. When two or more qualitatively similar studies were identified, a meta-analysis was conducted using Meta-DiSc software. The primary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) for predictors of scaphoid fracture detected on follow-up in patients with normal ED X-rays.

### Orthopedic pitfalls in the ED: Scaphoid fracture [^114TkmJ5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Wrist injuries are frequently encountered in the emergency department. When a patient presents with such an injury, the possibility of a scaphoid fracture must be at the top of the differential for the emergency practitioner. Unfortunately, these injuries can be missed on first presentation, as they are frequently radiographically occult. When left unrecognized and untreated, these injuries lead to a high incidence of long-term functional disability and chronic pain. The emergency physician needs to be vigilant for scaphoid fracture and be aggressive in both its diagnosis and treatment to avoid this practice pitfall. This review examines the clinical presentation, diagnostic techniques, and management options applicable to the emergency physician.

### Gantry-free cone-beam CT arthrography for diagnosis of scapholunate ligament injuries: Accelerating the preoperative work-up in acute wrist trauma [^111y4kMe]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Diagnostic assessment of the dorsal scapholunate ligament

For the dorsal scapholunate ligament (SLL), the diagnostic specificity of gantry-free cone-beam CT (CBCT) arthrography was even higher than for the palmar segment [R1: 98% (95% CI: 89–100%); R2: 96% (95% CI: 86–100%); R3: 98% (95% CI: 89–100%)]. One reader missed a single dorsal SLL rupture, resulting in almost perfect sensitivity [R1: 100% (95% CI: 54–100%); R2: 83% (95% CI: 36–100%); R3: 100% (95% CI: 54–100%)]. Figure 3 shows an isolated tear of the dorsal SLL, whereas Figure 4 highlights a complete tear involving all ligament segments. Inter-reader reliability was slightly better than for the assessment of the palmar ligament segment (Krippendorff α = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.70–0.95).

A 62-year-old man, following a motorcycle accident, was admitted to the emergency department with increasing left wrist pain and swelling. Cone-beam CT arthrography revealed a destabilizing tear of the scapholunate ligament's dorsal segment (A / B, black arrows), while previously taken radiograms displayed a widened scapholunate angle indicative of dorsal intercalated segment instability (C). Without patient repositioning between contrast injection into the radiocarpal compartment under fluoroscopic guidance and the completion of 3D imaging, the entire procedure required less than 5 minutes. Subsequently, the patient underwent ligament suture as well as scapholunate and scaphocapitate transfixation to re-establish the stability of the proximal carpal row. Surgical success is indicated by marked narrowing of the scapholunate angle in the postoperative lateral radiogram (D).

### Physical examination of the wrist: Useful provocative maneuvers [^1142P4Dk]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic wrist pain resulting from partial interosseous ligament injury remains a diagnostic dilemma for many hand and orthopedic surgeons. The overuse of costly diagnostic studies, including magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography scans, and bone scans, can be frustrating to clinicians due to their inconsistent specificity and reliability in these cases.

Physical diagnosis is an effective, though underused, means of establishing a working diagnosis of partial ligament injury to the wrist. Carefully performed provocative maneuvers by clinicians can reproduce the precise character of a patient's problem, reliably establish a working diagnosis, and initiate a plan of treatment. By using precise physical examination techniques, the examiner introduces energy into the wrist in a manner that loads specific support ligaments of the carpus, leading to an accurate diagnosis.

This article provides a broad spectrum of physical diagnostic tools to help surgeons develop a working diagnosis of partial wrist ligament injuries when faced with chronic wrist pain and normal x-rays.

### Unusual and very rare presentation of wrist pain in a man with acute anterior myocardial infarction, a case report and literature of review [^116cfSL1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

As the rising epidemiology of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in terms of lifestyle and diabetes is one of the factors in atypical presentations, the importance of distinguishing AMI patients with rare symptoms is constantly rising. Familiarity with less presented symptoms helps physicians and cardiologists in better practice and prevents misdiagnosis of this fatal disease.

- **Strengths and weaknesses**: As this study states a rare presentation of AMI, the findings are new and are useful for future physicians to better manage AMI cases with rare presentations. Our study includes the possible mechanism of this phenomenon, which to our knowledge has not been discussed before. There were some limitations and weaknesses in our management of patients. The 5-hour delay of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to the transferring of the patient and the rarity of the presentation should be taken into account for future encounters. The lack of physiological and anatomical data on this matter is sensible, and therefore we need future studies to better elaborate on related mechanisms of pain in such referral pains.

### Trapezium fracture: a common clinical mimic of scaphoid fracture [^112M6sJv]. Emergency Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Fractures of the trapezium are rarely diagnosed on plain radiographs after acute wrist trauma. High-resolution cross-sectional imaging identifies fractures of the trapezium as the most common radiographically occult carpal bone fracture. This study reviews the fracture frequency, mechanisms, and patterns of trapezium fractures.

Cone beam CT was performed in patients with suspected radiographically occult radiocarpal fracture following acute injury. The frequency of carpal bone fractures was assessed and compared.

Ninety-three radiographically occult wrist fractures were identified in 166 patients with acute trauma and negative radiographs. The trapezium was the most frequently fractured carpal bone, accounting for 20.4% of wrist fractures. Seventy-nine percent of trapezium fractures involved the volar ridge. Notably, the scaphoid was the clinically suspected fractured bone at initial assessment in 84% of patients with trapezium fractures.

Fractures of the trapezium in acute wrist trauma are much more common than described in the literature. If initial radiographs are negative, a fracture of the trapezium is more likely to be present than one of the scaphoid, despite high levels of clinical suspicion for scaphoid injuries. Awareness of the types and mechanisms of trapezium fracture is crucial. Cross-sectional imaging should be considered in all cases of post-traumatic wrist pain with negative radiographs.

### Bilateral Kienböck's disease concomitant with gouty arthritis [^115VAetA]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old man presented with complaints of pain and stiffness in the bilateral wrist for two months. The symptoms were more pronounced in the right wrist than the left wrist. The pain was insidious in onset, dull, and boring, which gradually increased over the last two months. The location of the pain was over the dorsum of both wrists, and the intensity of pain increased with wrist movements. There was no diurnal variation in pain intensity. The patient used to take tablet paracetamol (1 g) whenever he felt an increase in pain intensity.

There was no medical history of corticosteroids intake, occupation causing repetitive microtrauma, collagen disorder, or prior history of pain in the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. Minimal swelling and tenderness were observed over the dorsal aspect of the right wrist. There was mild tenderness over the dorsum of the left wrist, and the range of motion of the left wrist was normal. The range of motion of the right wrist was painful and restricted. The active motion was recorded as extension: 0°–30°, flexion: 0°–20°, ulnar deviation: 0°–10°, and radial deviation: 0°–10°. The preoperative Mayo wrist score was 35 points, and the pain was rated at 1.5 on the visual analogue scale. The grip strength was 23% in the right hand.

### Editorial commentary: Magnetic resonance imaging is not inferior to the gold standard of diagnostic arthroscopy for identification of wrist ligamentous pathology [^111TgGpW]. Arthroscopy (2024). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnoses of wrist ligamentous injuries are critical to guiding the proper treatment pathway for patients with these pathologies. Although advancements in imaging continue and magnetic resonance imaging is valuable, diagnostic arthroscopy remains superior, particularly if involvement of the noncentral triangular fibrocartilage complex, scapholunate interosseous ligament, or lunotriquetral interosseous ligament is suspected on the basis of history and physical examination, and even in the face of negative magnetic resonance imaging findings.

### Gantry-free cone-beam CT arthrography for diagnosis of scapholunate ligament injuries: Accelerating the preoperative work-up in acute wrist trauma [^1174Mayw]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures are among the most common reasons for admission to emergency departments worldwide. Depending on the fracture pattern and the degree of displacement, conventional radiography is often insufficient for surgical planning. While cross-sectional imaging is valuable for 3D visualization of fracture morphology, conventional CT is incapable of displaying concomitant soft tissue injuries, for example, of the intrinsic carpal ligaments. Among these, tears of the scapholunate ligament (SLL) are most common, occurring in one of ten distal radius fractures, especially in the presence of radiocarpal joint surface affliction.

An intact SLL possesses a horseshoe-like appearance, connecting the scaphoid and lunate bone with a thick dorsal and a thinner palmar ligament segment. The dorsal SLL segment, in particular, is of relevance to carpal biomechanics, serving as the primary stabilizer of the proximal carpal row. Insufficiency of this segment is mostly trauma-associated and frequently leads to dissociation in the scapholunate compartment, characterized by dorsal extension of the lunate ("dorsal intercalated segment instability") and palmar rotatory subluxation of the scaphoid.

Since non-surgical assessment of ligament integrity requires either MRI or arthrography in combination with cross-sectional imaging in the form of CT or MR arthrograms, SLL injuries are commonly overlooked in acute trauma settings. The reason is simple: whereas unstable fracture patterns mandate timely reduction and fixation, SLL-specific imaging techniques are often not available.

### The use of 4D-CT in assessing wrist kinematics and pathology: A narrative view [^112z4y86]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2019). Low credibility.

The wrist is a complex joint involving many small bones and complicated kinematics. It has traditionally been difficult to image and ascertain information about kinematics when making a diagnosis. Although MRI and fluoroscopy have been used, both have limitations. Recently, there has been interest in the use of 4D-CT in imaging the wrist. This review examines the literature regarding the use of 4D-CT in imaging the wrist to assess kinematics and its ability to diagnose pathology. Some questions remain about the description of normal ranges, the most appropriate method of measuring intercarpal stability, the accuracy compared with established standards, and the place of 4D-CT in postoperative assessment.

### Bilateral Kienböck's disease concomitant with gouty arthritis [^114TAgiy]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of pain and stiffness in the bilateral wrist. The pain in the right wrist was disabling and severe enough to restrict daily life activities. After the evaluation of clinical and radiological features, the patient was diagnosed with Kienböck's disease, Lichtman stage IIIB in the right wrist and stage IIIA in the left wrist. Routine laboratory investigations revealed a serum uric acid level of 9.27 mg/dL.

- **Surgical intervention and outcomes**: Lunate excision and scaphocapitate fusion were performed in the right wrist after consultations with the patient. The histopathological examinations of tophi in synovial tissue were negatively birefringent under polarised light microscopy, confirming the diagnosis of gout. Febuxostat was started postoperatively. The patient returned to work at the end of 5 months, and there was no recurrence of symptoms or radiological signs of arthritis at the end of 1 year.

### Diagnostic wrist arthroscopy for nonspecific wrist pain [^111ZchgH]. Hand (2017). Low credibility.

This study addresses the prevalence of discrete pathophysiology accounting for patients' symptoms during diagnostic wrist arthroscopy in individuals with wrist pain without a specific preoperative diagnosis. Secondarily, we determined the number and type of surgeries subsequent to diagnostic wrist arthroscopy.

- **Methods**: Between January 2000 and January 2015, 135 diagnostic wrist arthroscopies were performed by 12 surgeons in 3 urban academic hospitals. We recorded the diagnostic findings of diagnostic wrist arthroscopy and any subsequent surgeries.

- **Results**: One hundred and five patients had synovitis or a normal wrist (78%), 17 had likely age-appropriate changes (e.g. central triangular fibrocartilage complex defects, scapholunate changes) (13%), 8 (6%) were given uncommon diagnoses, and 5 (4%) had osteochondral defects. Sixteen patients (12%) had subsequent wrist surgery: 2 were for adverse events, 2 were carpal tunnel releases, and 12 were other surgeries. Diagnostic arthroscopy performed in the setting of an unclear preoperative diagnosis yielded limited diagnostic benefit.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the wrist: Anatomy and pathology of interosseous ligaments and the triangular fibrocartilage complex [^111VT8nP]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

The complex anatomy of the radiocarpal joint and proximal carpus makes high-quality magnetic resonance imaging challenging. Interpretation is more problematic than in other areas of the skeleton due to the common occurrence of abnormal communications through the triangular fibrocartilage complex, scapholunate, and lunotriquetral ligaments, often resulting in difficulty assessing the importance of findings. This article reviews the anatomy, provides suggestions for protocols for scanning the wrist, and discusses the pathological conditions that may be observed in these structures. In particular, it emphasizes the three-dimensional nature of these structures and the best approaches for evaluating them in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes.

### Extensor carpi ulnaris tendon pathology and ulnar styloid bone marrow edema as diagnostic markers of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex tears on wrist MRI: A case-control study [^116y7VLd]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

One of the most common causes of ulnar-sided wrist pain is an injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), which acts as a stabilizer of the distal radioulnar and ulnocarpal joints and functions to distribute compressive forces during axial loading. The TFCC is composed of the triangular fibrocartilage, meniscal homologue, dorsal and volar radioulnar ligaments, ulnolunate ligament, ulnotriquetral ligament, and the subsheath of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon.

The TFCC consists of three components: a central component (articular disc proper), a radial component which attaches to the sigmoid notch of the radius, and an ulnar component which attaches with two limbs to the ulna. As an addon to this complex anatomy, the peripheral TFCC blends at its ulnar attachments with the ECU tendon subsheath. The ECU subsheath is a band of tissue overlying the ECU tendon, spanning the ulnar groove; it is the primary restraint of ECU subluxation, keeping the ECU tendon in the ulnar groove.

The most commonly applied classification system for TFCC tears is the Palmer classification, which divides the tears into traumatic (type 1) and degenerative injuries (type 2). However, even though widely used with high reproducibility, this classic system lacks detail in modern radiologic setup; for instance, the classification does not account for the morphologic features (capsular injuries, bucket handle, or horizontal tears) or combined tears.

### Rehabilitation of orthopedic and rheumatologic disorders. 4. Rheumatoid arthritis and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease [^114zjeNN]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

This self-directed learning module highlights a clinical vignette of two patients: (1) a woman with bilateral, distal, upper-limb pain assessed by differential diagnosis, laboratory work-up, and treatment of rheumatologic disorders frequently seen in the physiatric practice setting and (2) a 57-year-old man with an acute recurring monoarthritis of the knee. It addresses clinical presentation, assessment, medical management, and rehabilitation approaches. Part of the chapter on rehabilitation of orthopedic and rheumatologic disorders in the Self-Directed Physiatric Education Program, it is designed for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation.

The article specifically focuses on two aspects: (1) the differential diagnosis of polyarthralgia, distal upper-limb pain, criteria for classification of rheumatoid arthritis, synovial fluid analysis, and comprehensive treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic; and (2) the differential diagnosis, clinical diagnostic considerations, pharmacotherapy, invasive procedure options, and orthotic and exercise interventions for a patient with calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate-induced monoarthritis of the knee.

- **Overall article objectives**: Clinical evaluation, diagnosis, management, and rehabilitation strategies in persons with initial presentations of inflammatory distal upper-limb pain and clinical evaluation of an individual with crystal-induced monoarthritis, and differentiation of the pathophysiology, assessment, and treatment of chondrocalcinosis.

### Looking further when symptoms are disproportionate to physical findings [^112ZExiL]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Low credibility.

A 36-year-old man presents with left ulnar-side wrist pain during an ice hockey game that prevented him from playing hockey or golf. There was no acute mechanism of injury. The usual clinical examination revealed only minimal tenderness and minimal pain with resisted wrist extension. Careful attention to precipitating factors led to testing resisted wrist extension with the forearm fully supinated, which reliably reproduced the intensity of the patient's symptoms, leading to a diagnosis of extensor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy.

A literature review suggested three additional special tests, of which two were positive, and management strategies. However, a standard of care has yet to be established because neither the tests nor the management has been properly validated through research, thus making the management of this condition more of an art than a science.

### Limb amputations in fixed dystonia: A form of body integrity identity disorder [^116WPNu3]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

- **Case 4**: A 46-year-old woman with bipolar affective disorder and epilepsy developed right-sided fixed wrist and finger flexion at age 25 after an accident to her right hand. Symptoms worsened following right wrist surgery and later spread to the other hand following a minor injury, associated with CRPS1 and psychogenic signs. She was diagnosed with a probable psychogenic movement disorder. Initial improvement in painful spasms was achieved with botulinum toxin injections, but functional improvement was not observed, and deterioration followed. A sympathectomy provided no benefit, and she requested amputation of the affected limbs.

- **Case 5**: This 48-year-old woman sustained a left-sided wrist fracture 8 years prior. Within a year, she developed progressive dystonic posturing of the left hand, with fixed clenching of the third, fourth, and fifth digits, sparing the index finger and thumb. Treatment for dystonia, including oral baclofen, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, and local botulinum toxin injections, proved ineffective. She experienced progressive, incapacitating pain in the left arm, leading to its amputation 3 years later. In the year following the left arm amputation, she developed a similar clinical presentation in the right arm, accompanied by progressive pain in the left arm stump, akin to the previous pain experienced in the dystonic hand and forearm. She is now seeking amputation of the right arm.

### Differential diagnosis and physical therapy management of a patient with radial wrist pain of 6 months' duration: a case [^111oLJrj]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

The study is a case report focusing on a 57-year-old man suffering from right radial wrist pain for 6 months. The differential diagnosis of radial wrist pain requires careful consideration of systemic disease, referred pain, and local dysfunctions such as De Quervain syndrome and entrapment neuropathy of the superficial radial nerve.

The patient's referral diagnosis was De Quervain syndrome. However, previous electrophysical agents-based physical therapy was unsuccessful. The physical examination eliminated the cervical, shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints as potential pain sources. Diagnosis focused on entrapment neuropathy of the superficial radial nerve, indicated by symptom provocation during a modified radial bias upper limb nerve tension test. The treatment involved active and passive exercises using neurodynamic techniques.

After the initial treatment session, the patient experienced notable improvements in pain intensity and function, surpassing the minimal clinically important difference and minimal detectable change. Remarkably, after only two sessions, the patient reported complete symptom resolution and returned to work fully.

This case report evaluates the diagnostic process for patients experiencing radial wrist pain and suggests a consideration of neuropathy in the superficial sensory branch of the radial nerve.

### Extensor carpi ulnaris tendon pathology and ulnar styloid bone marrow edema as diagnostic markers of peripheral triangular fibrocartilage complex tears on wrist MRI: a case-control study [^114EApjT]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The results of our study can be directly applied to clinical practice in the following way: if there is a peripheral TFCC tear on direct MRI evaluation and, in addition, both ECU pathology and BME are noted on MRI, the positive predictive value is 100% that there will be a peripheral TFCC tear on arthroscopy, compared to 89% with direct evaluation alone. If there is no peripheral TFCC tear on direct MRI evaluation, and neither ECU pathology nor BME is present on MRI, the negative predictive value is 98% that there will be no peripheral TFCC tear on arthroscopy, compared to 94% with direct evaluation alone.

Several limitations exist within our study. First, this was a retrospective setup, including patients from nearly 10 years from a single center. Second, MRI was conducted using 1.5-T scanners, and no subsequent MRA was performed. Third, no subclassification of peripheral TFCC tears into Palmer classes (on MRI or arthroscopy) was performed, preventing more in-depth analyses. Fourth, although ECU pathology was initially divided into several groups, for the statistical analyses the subclassification was abandoned for the sake of simplicity and to retain statistical power. Fifth, the hand surgeons performing the arthroscopic assessment were experienced, but some bias might have been present since they were not blinded to MRI results.

In conclusion, our results suggest that on routine wrist MRI, ECU pathology and ulnar styloid BME are often seen together with peripheral TFCC tears. As a practical implication, they may be used as secondary signs to confirm the presence of a peripheral TFCC tear.

### The value added of advanced imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of triangular fibrocartilage complex pathology [^117YPuhn]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Pathology of the triangular fibrocartilage complex is a prevalent cause of ulnar-sided wrist pain that presents a diagnostic challenge. We hypothesized that a history and physical examination (H&P) would be more cost-effective when used alone or with diagnostic injection, compared to the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA), in diagnosing and treating symptomatic triangular fibrocartilage complex abnormalities.

A simple-chain decision analysis model was constructed to assess simulated subjects with ulnar-sided wrist pain and normal radiographs using several diagnostic algorithms: H&P alone, H&P with injection, H&P with delayed advanced imaging (MRI or MRA), and H&P with injection and delayed advanced imaging (MRI or MRA). Three years after diagnosis, effectiveness was calculated in Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH)-adjusted life years. Costs were extracted from a commercial insurance database using US dollars. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10,000 second-order trials, including sampling of parameter distributions, was performed along with one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses.

All strategies showed similar mean effectiveness, ranging from 2.228 to 2.232 DASH-adjusted life years, with mean costs ranging from $5,584 for H&P alone to $5,980 for H&P, injection, and MRA. History and physical examination alone or with injection were identified as the most cost-effective strategies. History and physical examination alone emerged as the most preferred diagnostic strategy, while H&P with injection and H&P with delayed advanced imaging were also considered.

### Evaluation of ulnar-sided wrist pain [^115qnEA5]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Determining the etiology of ulnar-sided wrist pain is often challenging. The condition may be acute or chronic, and differential diagnoses include injuries to the ulnar carpal bones, ligament tears, tendinitis, vascular conditions, osteoarthritis, systemic arthritis, and ulnar nerve compression. An anatomically based, methodical physical examination, coupled with provocative maneuvers — including piano key, ulnar impaction, shuck, foveal stress, and extensor carpi ulnaris synergy tests — further defines the differential diagnosis.

Diagnostic imaging used in the evaluation of ulnar-sided wrist pain includes plain radiographs and MRI, with or without arthrography. Wrist arthroscopy is becoming increasingly important in the diagnosis and management of ulnar-sided intra-articular wrist pathology.

### Ulnar-sided wrist pain: Evaluation and treatment of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears, ulnocarpal impaction syndrome, and lunotriquetral ligament tears [^111PFL2D]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Ulnar-sided wrist pain is a common cause of upper-extremity disability. Presentation can vary from acute traumatic injuries to chronic degenerative conditions. Because of its overlapping anatomy, complex differential diagnosis, and varied treatment outcomes, the ulnar side of the wrist has been referred to as the "black box" of the wrist, and its pathology has been compared with that of low back pain. Common causes of ulnar-sided wrist pain include triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries, lunotriquetral ligament injuries, and ulnar impaction syndrome.

### Contrast-enhanced MRI of the wrist: Intravenous application of gadolinium improves diagnosis in ulnar-sided injuries of the TFCC [^113ChmoZ]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Although lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) frequently induce ulnar-sided wrist pain and potentially distal radioulnar joint instability, diagnosis can pose a challenge due to the intricate anatomy. This study aims to evaluate the benefits of contrast-enhanced sequences for the detection of TFCC injuries in magnetic resonance imaging of the wrist.

Ninety-four patients underwent wrist MRI with intravenous application of gadolinium-based contrast agents. For each patient, two datasets were analyzed independently by two board-certified radiologists. One set comprised only plain T1- and fat-saturated proton-density-weighted sequences, while the second dataset included contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat suppression. Arthroscopy or clinical reports served as the reference standard, with the former being used whenever available. Diagnostic confidence and TFCC component assessability were subjectively evaluated. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were calculated to serve as an objective indicator of image contrast.

Lesions of the articular disc, the foveal and styloid ulnar attachment were present in 24 (25.5%), 61 (64.9%), and 53 (56.4%) patients. Access to contrast-enhanced T1 images improved the diagnostic accuracy for injuries of the styloid (R1/R2, 0.68/0.73 vs. 0.86/0.88) and foveal attachment (0.68/0.72 vs. 0.90/0.89) substantially compared to plain MRI (all p < 0.001), while no benefits could be identified for lesions of the central disc (0.89/0.90 vs. 0.87/0.90). Readers' diagnostic confidence and CNR for ulnar-sided lesions improved.

### Management of acute triangular fibrocartilage complex injury of the wrist [^1133DBoD]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Acute trauma to the triangular fibrocartilage complex includes tears of the fibrocartilage articular disk substance and meniscal homolog as well as radioulnar ligament avulsions, with or without an associated fracture. Patient evaluation includes clinical examination, imaging studies, and wrist arthroscopy (diagnostic). The Palmer classification is typically used to define injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex. The critical distinction is in differentiating injuries that produce instability of the distal radioulnar joint from those that do not. Also important is the recognition of acute injuries in the context of an ongoing degenerative pattern, such as Palmer class 2 lesions.

- **Nonsurgical management**: Temporary splint immobilization of the wrist and forearm, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, corticosteroid joint injection, and physical therapy.

- **Surgical strategies**: Débridement, acute repair, and subacute repair. Most surgical procedures can be performed arthroscopically. However, open ligament repair may be needed in the setting of distal radioulnar joint instability.

### Examination of the wrist [^116vMmau]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

After reading this article and reviewing the supplemental videos, the participant should be able to:

- **Identify common wrist conditions**: Common wrist conditions that may be encountered on evaluation can include fractures, tendonitis, arthritis, and instabilities.

- **Describe provocative maneuvers**: These maneuvers are used to confirm a diagnosis of a wrist disorder and are essential in the examination process.

- **Develop a systematic approach**: Having a structured method for the examination of the wrist is crucial for effective evaluation.

- **Determine appropriate diagnostic maneuvers**: The article guides on choosing appropriate maneuvers for diagnosing radial, central, and ulnar wrist pain.

The wrist is a complex structure, and healthcare providers dealing with hand and upper extremity conditions need to grasp wrist examination techniques and provocative maneuvers for the conditions they encounter. Providers should have an idea of the diagnosis based on the clinical examination and use imaging as needed to confirm or stage a diagnosis.

### Differential effects of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors in a single patient with neuropathic pain [^114vNafq]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 52-year-old previously healthy man with an 11-year history of recurrent, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome presented with a 22-month history of severe neuropathic pain (NP) in his right hand. The same condition was present on the left side, although to a lesser degree.

The patient had undergone multiple decompressive surgeries (two on the left side, three on the right) during the 11 years prior to the presentation. After each operation, he experienced symptom relief lasting from 6 to 9 months, followed by gradual recurrence. His last operation on his right wrist, 30 months prior to presentation, resulted in roughly 8 months of pain relief. Further surgical intervention was not recommended upon pain recurrence. Various treatments were tried without satisfactory pain relief. The pain was eventually deemed chronic and treatment refractory.

The patient described the pain as constantly present, with intensity usually ranging between 5 and 8 on a 0–10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). The pain was located primarily distal to the wrists, in the area of median nerve innervation. Although there were both pain and sensory symptoms beyond this, both in the hand and lower forearm, he did not describe it as radiating. The pain was associated with numbness, tingling, and prickling sensations. The most striking and clinically debilitating aspect of the patient's pain was the degree to which it was aggravated by cold, in terms of both cold allodynia and the effect of ambient temperature. He scored 22/38 on the PainDETECT questionnaire.

### Wrist injuries in young adults: The diagnostic impact of CT and MRI [^111J5hng]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

To evaluate the diagnostic impact of MRI and/or multidetector CT in young patients with wrist injuries, specifically when clinical examinations and X-rays are inconclusive or negative, researchers explored variations in imaging strategies between a district general hospital (GH) and a university hospital (UH).

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 34 young patients (mean age 23 years) with wrist trauma who underwent CT and/or MRI. Among these, 24 had acute injuries and 10 chronic. Twenty-two patients were from a GH and 12 from a UH. Two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists reviewed the imaging studies blindly. The study assessed the effect of cross-sectional imaging on patient care and treatment plans.

In 9 out of 34 patients, one or more fractures were diagnosed through cross-sectional imaging. The scaphoid was fractured in four patients, while the lunate and/or trapezium were fractured in three patients. One patient had both the scaphoid and lunate fractured, and another had a distal radius fracture. MRI uniquely identified ligamentous trauma in 11 patients, involving the TFCC in eight cases. In four patients who underwent both imaging methods, CT detected a trapezium fracture not visible on MRI, and a scapholunate fracture with only MRI findings of a distal radial fracture. In one patient with normal CT, MRI revealed bone marrow edema of the scaphoid; in the other, MRI showed edema of the distal radius, lunate, and triquetrum.

Both CT and MRI should be considered for patients with acute or chronic wrist injuries, particularly where there is clinical uncertainty and normal initial radiographs.

### Sports-related extensor carpi ulnaris pathology: A review of functional anatomy, sports injury and management [^1133SEvn]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with active tendinopathy and tenosynovitis of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) will often have a vague and subtle swelling over the dorsoulnar aspect of the affected wrist. The pain has two components: a constant dull aching sensation on the dorsoulnar aspect of the wrist and a sudden searing longitudinal pain felt along the course of the distal ECU tendon on active contraction of the muscle.

The ECU Synergy Test has been shown to be sensitive as well as specific for the diagnosis of ECU tendinosis. It is performed with the patient's elbow resting on the examination table, flexed at 90°, and the forearm fully supinated. The patient actively and fully extends all the digits while the wrist is held in neutral and faces the examiner. The examiner places one hand to palpate the ECU tendon and the other on the radial side of the adducted thumb. The patient is asked to resist the examiner's attempts to adduct the thumb, and the examiner's other hand feels the ECU tendon contract isometrically to resist adduction as this action is performed. Pain along the course of the ECU tendon during this manoeuvre has been shown to represent a positive test for ECU tendinosis.

ECU tendinosis can coexist with other conditions in the ulnar side of the wrist, so the diagnosis must not be considered as an exclusion of all other possible diagnoses. A full clinical and radiological assessment of the other important ulnar-sided wrist structures is mandatory to exclude coexistent pathology in the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), lunotriquetral ligament, and distal radioulnar joint.
