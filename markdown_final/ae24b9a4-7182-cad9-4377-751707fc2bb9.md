## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which fluid should be administered to a 5-month-old with severe vomiting and diarrhea, hypernatremia, and hypoglycemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the severity of dehydration and whether IV therapy is indicated. Then, I should verify the implications of hypernatremia for fluid choice and rate. Next, I will consider the hypoglycemia and whether dextrose is needed now or later. After that, I need to evaluate each option against guideline-based care. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise plan and confirm safety monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical severity and the need for IV therapy. The infant is lethargic with poor appearance, delayed capillary refill, dry mucous membranes, and tachycardia, which together indicate severe dehydration and shock physiology; oral rehydration is not appropriate in this setting, and IV isotonic fluids are indicated per IDSA guidance for severe dehydration with altered mental status or failure of ORS, so I should not delay IV access and resuscitation [^116jwv3M] [^115oX9BJ].

> Wait, let me verify the implications of hypernatremia before choosing fluids. Hypernatremic dehydration reflects relatively greater water loss than sodium; rapid correction risks cerebral edema, so the safest first step is to restore intravascular volume with isotonic saline and then correct hypernatremia more slowly with hypotonic fluids after stabilization, with a correction target not exceeding about 0.5–1 mmol/L/hr in children, which argues against starting with hypotonic solutions or dextrose-only fluids in the resuscitation phase [^115ERib3].

> I need to check the hypoglycemia next. A glucose of 2.9 mmol/L is symptomatic in infants and warrants prompt correction; however, in the context of shock and hypernatremia, I should prioritize restoring perfusion with isotonic saline first and then address hypoglycemia with a dextrose bolus or by adding dextrose to maintenance fluids once hemodynamics improve, rather than delaying resuscitation to mix specialized solutions, because delays in isotonic resuscitation can worsen outcomes in severe dehydration [^116KFhrm] [^117RVSVk].

> Now, I will examine each option against this framework. Option A, a 20 mL/kg isotonic saline bolus, aligns with IDSA recommendations for severe dehydration and is the standard initial resuscitation strategy; it restores intravascular volume without risking rapid shifts in serum sodium and can be repeated as needed to normalize perfusion, which is exactly what this infant needs right now [^116jwv3M] [^115oX9BJ]. Option B, 10 mL Pedialyte over 5 minutes, is inadequate volume and inappropriate in severe dehydration with altered mental status; oral therapy should follow, not precede, stabilization of circulation in this scenario [^116jwv3M]. Option C, D10 in half-normal saline, is a maintenance-type solution with free water that could worsen hypernatremia if given as a bolus in an unstable patient; dextrose should be layered in after perfusion is restored and with careful sodium monitoring, not as the initial resuscitation fluid [^117RVSVk]. Option D, an ORS with a 1:1 Na:glucose ratio, is not an IV solution and is contraindicated in severe dehydration with altered mental status; even if it were IV, the sodium load would be unsafe in hypernatremia, and ORS is reserved for after stabilization or for mild to moderate dehydration only [^116jwv3M] [^111KxZ6T].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical sequence so I don't miss anything. The correct first step is to give a 20 mL/kg isotonic saline bolus rapidly, reassess perfusion, and repeat up to a total of 60 mL/kg if shock persists; once perfusion and mental status improve, transition to maintenance fluids and address the free water deficit and hypoglycemia with hypotonic dextrose-containing solutions and close electrolyte monitoring, correcting sodium no faster than about 0.5–1 mmol/L/hr to avoid cerebral edema [^116jwv3M] [^117RVSVk]. I initially thought to add dextrose immediately, but wait, I should confirm that adding dextrose too early in hypernatremic dehydration can deliver free water and theoretically worsen sodium shifts; therefore, I will correct hypoglycemia after the initial isotonic bolus and with planned maintenance rather than as the primary resuscitation fluid [^117RVSVk].

> I should double-check monitoring and safety endpoints. Continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring, frequent vitals, strict intake/output, and serial electrolytes including sodium and glucose are essential; urine output is a reliable marker of perfusion recovery, and I should halt or slow sodium correction if the child develops seizures or other neurologic changes, adjusting the fluid plan accordingly [^115swQN4] [^117RVSVk].

> Final answer: A) IV isotonic fluid 20 mL/kg, repeated as needed to restore perfusion, followed by careful correction of hypernatremia and hypoglycemia once stabilized, is the most appropriate immediate intervention here [^116jwv3M] [^115oX9BJ].

---

The correct answer is **A) IV isotonic fluid 20 ml/kg**. This 5-month-old has **severe dehydration with hypernatremia and hypoglycemia**; immediate IV isotonic fluids (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) are indicated to restore circulation and correct shock, with dextrose added only after perfusion improves to avoid rapid osmotic shifts. Options B and D are inappropriate because oral rehydration is contraindicated in severe dehydration with altered mental status, and option C is incorrect because dextrose 10% in ½ normal saline is hypotonic and risks worsening hypernatremia if given as a bolus. Hypernatremia should be corrected **slowly** (≤ 0.5 mmol/L/h) to prevent cerebral edema [^117RVSVk].

---

## Clinical assessment and severity of dehydration

The infant presents with **severe dehydration**, evidenced by:

- **Lethargy and poor appearance**: Indicates severe dehydration and possible shock [^116jwv3M].
- **Dry mucous membranes and delayed capillary refill (3 seconds)**: Classic signs of significant dehydration [^114vCHjd].
- **Tachycardia (HR 130)**: Compensatory response to hypovolemia [^notfound].
- **Hypernatremia (Na 149 mmol/L)**: Suggests hypertonic dehydration, often due to water loss exceeding sodium loss [^117RVSVk].
- **Hypoglycemia (glucose 2.9 mmol/L)**: Common in severe dehydration due to decreased intake and increased metabolic demands [^1138fsWX].

---

## Pathophysiology and implications of hypernatremia

Hypernatremia reflects a **net water deficit relative to sodium**, causing cellular dehydration and neurologic complications if corrected too rapidly. Rapid correction can cause cerebral edema; therefore, sodium should be lowered **slowly** (≤ 0.5 mmol/L/h) [^117RVSVk].

---

## Pathophysiology and implications of hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia in this context results from **decreased intake, increased losses, and heightened metabolic demands**. It can cause seizures, altered mental status, and worsening shock; prompt correction is essential [^114KC129].

---

## Fluid management principles

The goals are to **restore intravascular volume**, correct electrolyte disturbances, and manage hypoglycemia while avoiding rapid shifts in serum sodium. Isotonic fluids are first-line for severe dehydration with hypernatremia to restore perfusion without exacerbating hypertonicity [^117RVSVk].

---

## Analysis of fluid options

| **Option** | **Rationale** | **Appropriateness** |
|-|-|-|
| A) IV isotonic fluid 20 ml/kg | - First-line for severe dehydration with hypernatremia <br/> - Restores perfusion without rapid sodium correction <br/> - Allows controlled correction of hypernatremia and hypoglycemia | Appropriate |
| B) Pedialyte 10 mL over five min | - Oral rehydration is contraindicated in severe dehydration with altered mental status <br/> - Inadequate volume for severe deficits | Inappropriate |
| C) Dextrose 10% in 1/2 normal saline | - Hypotonic solution risks rapid sodium correction and cerebral edema <br/> - Not indicated as initial bolus in hypernatremic dehydration | Inappropriate |
| D) ORS with 1:1 Na:glucose ratio | - Oral rehydration is contraindicated in severe dehydration with altered mental status <br/> - Inadequate for severe deficits | Inappropriate |

---

## Recommended fluid management plan

- **Initial bolus**: IV isotonic fluid (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) 20 ml/kg over 15–30 minutes; repeat as needed to stabilize perfusion [^116jwv3M].
- **Subsequent fluids**: After perfusion improves, add dextrose (e.g. D5NS) to correct hypoglycemia and provide maintenance fluids.
- **Hypernatremia correction**: Aim for slow correction (≤ 0.5 mmol/L/h) with close monitoring of sodium and neurologic status [^117RVSVk].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent reassessment of vitals, urine output, electrolytes, and glucose.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate initial fluid is **IV isotonic fluid 20 ml/kg** (Option A) to restore perfusion and allow controlled correction of hypernatremia and hypoglycemia. Oral rehydration and hypotonic dextrose solutions are contraindicated initially due to the risk of rapid osmotic shifts and cerebral edema [^116jwv3M] [^117RVSVk].

Recommendation 6 — The guideline panel suggests IV fluid administration at the early treatment of acute CVS episodes guided by patient age, symptom severity, and degree of dehydration (conditional recommendation, based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Remarks state there is no research evidence regarding use of D10 vs. D5 IV fluids in this setting and no recommendations for specific IV fluids are made due to lack of evidence and potential for delay if specialized fluids are utilized; IV fluids should be determined by the evaluating clinician and provided similarly to other children with acute onset vomiting, with goals of rehydration and alleviation of electrolyte disturbances and ketosis. Background notes that a prior pediatric expert consensus recommended dextrose 10% (D10) over dextrose 5% (D5), but the guideline panel found no published evidence supporting this practice, and the panel was unable to judge the desirable effects of D10 versus D5 given the lack of evidence.

### Diagnosis and management of dehydration in children [^114pDes8]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The most useful individual signs for identifying dehydration in children are prolonged capillary refill time, abnormal skin turgor, and abnormal respiratory pattern. However, clinical dehydration scales based on a combination of physical examination findings are better predictors than individual signs. Oral rehydration therapy is the preferred treatment of mild to moderate dehydration caused by diarrhea in children. Appropriate oral rehydration therapy is as effective as intravenous fluid in managing fluid and electrolyte losses and has many advantages. Goals of oral rehydration therapy are restoration of circulating blood volume, restoration of interstitial fluid volume, and maintenance of rehydration. When rehydration is achieved, a normal age-appropriate diet should be initiated.

Fluid management in infectious diarrhea — Isotonic intravenous fluids such as lactated Ringer's and normal saline solution should be administered when there is severe dehydration, shock, or altered mental status and failure of oral rehydration solution (ORS) therapy (strong, high) or ileus (strong, moderate). In people with ketoemia, an initial course of intravenous hydration may be needed to enable tolerance of oral rehydration (weak, low). In severe dehydration, intravenous rehydration should be continued until pulse, perfusion, and mental status normalize and the patient awakens, has no risk factors for aspiration, and has no evidence of ileus (strong, low), after which the remaining deficit can be replaced by using ORS (weak, low). Infants, children, and adults with mild to moderate dehydration should receive ORS until clinical dehydration is corrected (strong, low), and once rehydrated, maintenance fluids should be administered with replacement of ongoing stool losses with ORS until diarrhea and vomiting are resolved (strong, low).

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112r2PYE]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

For children with moderate to severe AGE, rehydration with oral or intravenous isotonic fluids to correct fluid and electrolyte deficits and on-going losses is the mainstay of treatment. Where oral rehydration is not feasible, rehydration by nasogastric tube is the preferred option and recommended before intravenous rehydration in some guidelines. However, some aspects of current management recommendations are controversial. First, the decision to treat with either oral or intravenous fluids is largely based upon an assessment of level of dehydration, which has been shown to be notoriously unreliable. Second, though the evidence supporting the recommendations are scanty, current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for the treatment of severe dehydration ('Plan C') are based on rapid, intravenous administration of isotonic fluids. Plan C recommends a minimum of 100mls/kg, the equivalent volume replacement for losses in those with 10% dehydration. Plan C is given in two stages over 3–6 h, dependent on age. Recommending an initial 30 ml/kg to be administrated rapidly (30–60 min) and the remaining 70 ml/kg more slowly over 2.5–5 h respecitvely in infants aged under 12 months and older. For those with hypovolaemic shock initial management recommends fluid boluses (of up to 60 ml/kg) rehydration for children which is followed by step 2 of plan C (70 ml/kg more slowly over 2.5–5 h). Whilst the aggressive regime may be appropriate for cholera, the only infective cause of secretory-diarrhoea (leading to excess fluid and electrolyte loss), it may not be generalisable to non-cholera AGE, the dominant cause of AGE worldwide. Despite lack of formal testing, the WHO expert review group indicated this as a strong recommendation.

There are, however, increasing concerns over the safety of rapid intravenous correction of fluid deficits. The only controlled trial (FEAST) assessing fluid bolus therapy in children with presumed sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated a significantly higher mortality in those children receiving fluid-bolus therapy, including a large group with severe dehydration. Although the FEAST trial raises important questions about the safety of rapid intravenous fluid therapy in severe febrile illnesses, children with severe dehydration secondary to AGE were not included in the trial, therefore it is uncertain whether rapid fluid replacement to correct dehydration, the cornerstone of standard management in this condition, is safe. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the evidence underpinning current guidelines for intravenous rehydration.

### Double trouble: ten-year-old girl with chronic diarrhea and acute abdominal pain [^114juKQK]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Prior to presenting to our institution, she had presented to an outside hospital ED. She was given a fluid bolus and intravenous ondansetron. An abdominal X-ray performed was read as normal. She was subsequently discharged. Due to persistent symptoms, she presented to our ED that same evening.

Upon presentation to our ED, her initial physical examination revealed sinus tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill of 3 to 4 seconds, normoactive bowel sounds, and diffuse abdominal pain with palpation, most notable at the periumbilical region, without peritoneal signs. She was given a fluid bolus for dehydration and intravenous acetaminophen for the abdominal pain. Her blood glucose was 69 mg/dL; she received a 10% dextrose bolus. Her basic metabolic panel was significant for metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap, acute kidney injury, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyponatremia. Complete blood count with differential showed lymphopenia but was otherwise unremarkable. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were normal. Urinalysis was significant for specific gravity greater than 1.030, ketonuria of 80 mg/dL, and 5 to 10 RBCs/HPF (red blood cells per high power field). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her abdomen and pelvis ruled out appendicitis and revealed trace intra-pelvic free fluid. Stool studies including parasitic panel were sent. She was admitted to the inpatient pediatric service for further workup and care.

A 9-day-old infant girl presented with diarrhea and weight loss of 19% since birth. She was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 weeks' gestation to a mother positive for group B Streptococcus who received adequate intrapartum prophylaxis. The infant was formula-fed every 2 to 3 hours with no reported issues with feeding or swallowing. The infant had nonmucoid watery stools ∼5 to 15 times per day. Her family history was significant for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in several of her family members. Her initial vital signs and physical examination were normal. Laboratory data on hospital admission showed a normal complete blood cell count, but her chemistry analysis revealed significant hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury. Her hypernatremia was resistant to fluid management. In this article, we discuss the infant's hospital course, our clinical thought process, and how we arrived at our final diagnosis.

### The global enteric multicenter study (GEMS) of diarrheal disease in infants and young children in developing countries: epidemiologic and clinical methods of the case / control study [^111n52Xi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Case Definition of MSD and Other Study Outcomes

The initial step in eligibility screening was the selection of children who fulfilled the WHO definition of diarrhea (≥ 3 abnormally loose stools in 24 hours). In subsequent steps we identified cases of MSD, the primary outcome of interest, intending to capture diarrheal illnesses that would not be expected to resolve spontaneously without medical intervention or without sequelae, because these illnesses constitute priorities for development of vaccines and other new or improved preventive and therapeutic strategies. We reasoned that episodes that would qualify as MSD fell into 2 general categories: (1) those accompanied by dehydration to a degree that the child's survival would likely depend on access to life-saving rehydration fluids, and (2) those with evidence of inflammatory destruction of the intestinal mucosa, thereby at increased risk for disabling sequelae (such as persistent diarrhea and stunting) or death.

To capture children who had potentially life-threatening diarrheal dehydration, we adapted the WHO definition of dehydration to our case definition of MSD, choosing the most objective signs (sunken eyes more than usual and slow or very slow recoil after an abdominal wall "skin pinch"). In addition, we included the determination by a healthcare provider that the severity of dehydration warranted administration of intravenous fluids. Although not part of our case definition, other signs of dehydration proposed by WHO were documented, including restlessness or irritability and drinking eagerly or appearing thirsty (considered to be signs of "some" dehydration), and lethargy, loss of consciousness, inability to drink, or drinking poorly (as signs of "severe" dehydration). During analysis we will explore the impact on the study findings of including these other signs of dehydration in the definition of MSD. We considered adopting as inclusion criteria elements of systems used widely to define severe illness in rotavirus vaccine trials. However, many of the components, such as total duration and maximum severity of diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, can only be determined in retrospect when the episode is resolving or resolved, at which point the decision to include a child in GEMS would already have been made. Instead, our approach has been to collect this information for exploration during analysis.

### Gastroenteritis in children: part 1. diagnosis [^114vCHjd]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis in children is a major cause of morbidity in the United States. Viral infections, primarily from rotavirus, cause 75 to 90 percent of cases. The remaining infections are largely bacterial, with as many as 10 percent of cases secondary to diarrheagenic Escherichia coli. The history and physical examination of children with gastroenteritis should focus on assessing for the presence and degree of dehydration and determining the underlying etiology. The child's weight during the illness versus posttreatment is often used to evaluate degree of dehydration retrospectively. The three examination signs that best suggest dehydration in children are an abnormal respiratory pattern, abnormal skin turgor, and prolonged capillary refill time, although parental report of the child's history is also helpful in the assessment. In general, measuring serum electrolyte levels usually is unnecessary in children with mild to moderate dehydration. Laboratory tests are recommended only when severe dehydration is suspected; in such cases, intravenous fluids would be warranted. Although it is not necessary to routinely obtain stool cultures, they should be collected if diarrhea is persistent.

Cholera — clinical presentation and severity — most commonly manifests as acute watery diarrhea in an afebrile person, with the pathogen typically remaining in the gastrointestinal tract and not invading the bloodstream; infection is often mild or asymptomatic, but it can be severe. Severe cholera (cholera gravis) occurs in approximately 10% of cholera episodes and is characterized by profuse watery diarrhea (rice-water stools), often with nausea and vomiting that can rapidly lead to severe volume depletion. Clinical findings include dry mucous membranes and loss of skin turgor, hypotension, tachycardia, and thirst; untreated cholera can cause rapid loss of body fluids leading to severe dehydration, hypovolemic shock, and death within hours. The case-fatality ratio for untreated cholera can reach 50%, but with adequate and timely rehydration, the case-fatality ratio is < 1%.

CLINICAL SYNDROMES OF PEDIATRIC DIARRHEAL DISEASE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

As seen by clinical health providers at fixed healthcare facilities in developing countries, almost all cases of pediatric diarrheal illness can be conveniently characterized as falling into 1 of 5 clinical syndromes (Table 1). Approximately 80%–85% of patient episodes present as "simple gastroenteritis" with the subject passing loose or watery stool (often with mucus but not with blood), low-grade fever, occasional vomiting, anorexia, and apparent malaise (Figure 1). Approximately 5%–15% of children present with overt dysentery (gross blood in the diarrheic stools) (Figure 2), often accompanied by fever (sometimes high); many dysenteric patients appear clinically toxic. A small proportion of cases in older children present with profuse watery diarrhea, passing such voluminous "rice water" stools that even older children can rapidly become severely dehydrated (Figure 3). Another few percent of pediatric cases present with a history of apparent simple gastroenteritis that began 14 or more days previously but did not abate; this defines "persistent diarrhea", a syndrome that particularly can have adverse nutritional consequences. Finally, a few percent of children are brought by caretakers for care because of vomiting rather than diarrhea as the main complaint. Few reports have described expanded etiologic analyses in relation to these clinical syndromes.

Figure 1.
An infant who presented with diarrheal dehydration consequent to simple gastroenteritis that was not treated promptly or effectively. Loss of turgor of skin over the abdomen is visible as "tenting", following pinching. Simple gastroenteritis caused by many etiologic agents in young infants in developing countries can lead to dehydration. The fundamental reason is that per kilogram of body weight, the daily water and electrolyte requirements of young infants are substantially greater than those of older children. Thus, abnormal losses from diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, accompanied by inadequate fluid intake and lack of prompt and appropriate replacement (as with glucose/electrolyte oral rehydration solution), can lead to moderate and severe dehydration and death.

### Development of an emergency department triage tool to predict acidosis among children with gastroenteritis [^112yZXah]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Design a triage assessment tool that predicts acidosis in children with vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.

Methods

A convenience sample of patients aged 3 months to 7 years with vomiting and/or diarrhea were enrolled in the triage area of a pediatric hospital's emergency department (ED). Caretakers of the eligible children completed a parental questionnaire assessing the patient's history of presenting illness. The triage nurse completed a 4-point physical examination assessment form. Collected information from the parental questionnaire and examination findings from the nurses' assessment were analyzed for factors that predicted acidosis in patients which was defined as having a serum bicarbonate level of 16 mmol/L or less or, if unavailable, an end-tidal carbon dioxide of 31 mm Hg or less.

Results

One hundred eighteen of the 130 patients enrolled had either a documented serum bicarbonate level or an end-tidal carbon dioxide and were therefore used in the final analysis for the primary outcome. Twenty-nine patients (25%) had acidosis. Univariate predictors of acidosis were younger age (mean [SD], 1.7 [1.4] vs. 3.1 [2.2] years, P = 0.002), previous evaluation by the primary care physician (62% vs. 33%, P = 0.008), being sent in by the primary care physician (66% vs. 33%, P = 0.002), and a worse overall appearance based on the triage nurse's mark on a 0-cm ("alert/playful") to 10-cm ("lethargic/limp") visual analog scale (3.7 [2.8] vs. 2.4 [2.2] cm, P = 0.013). A regression tree analysis identified age younger than 2 years, dry mucous membranes, and duration of illness more than 2 days as sequential factors predictive of patients at risk for acidosis. This decision tree identified patients with acidosis with an 89.7% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 71.5%-97.3%) and a 93.6% negative predictive value (95% confidence interval, 81.4%-98.3%).

Conclusions

The stepwise regression tree triage assessment tool dichotomizing patients based on age younger than 2 years, dry mucous membranes, and days of illness more than 2 days was able to predict acidosis with 90% sensitivity in patients presenting to the ED for evaluation of gastroenteritis. Identifying patients with acidosis early in their ED course allows the treating ED physician to focus more attention and resources toward rehydrating this at-risk population of patients with gastroenteritis.

### How to interpret symptoms, signs and investigations of dehydration in children with gastroenteritis [^116Xbgc1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

Dehydration is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. Infants and young children are vulnerable to dehydration, and clinical assessment plays a pivotal role in their care. In addition, laboratory investigations can, in some children, be helpful when assessing the severity of dehydration and for guiding rehydration treatment. In this interpretation, we review the current literature and provide an evidence-based approach to recognising and managing dehydration in children.

### Hypernatremia in children with diarrhea: presenting features, management, outcome, and risk factors for death [^1119uyyv]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

We sought to investigate the magnitude, clinical features, treatment, and outcome of children suffering from hypernatremic diarrhea and to identify risk factors for fatal outcome among them. We reviewed 2 data sets of children < 15 years admitted to the in-patient ward of the Dhaka Hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr, b) with diarrhea and hypernatremia (serum sodium ≥ 150 mmol/L): (a) March 2001 to March 2002 (n = 371) and (b) March 2009 to August 2011 (n = 360). We reviewed their records and collected relevant information for analyses. The prevalence of hypernatremia was 5.1% (371/7212) and 2.4% (360/15 219), case fatality rate was 15% and 19%, respectively. In logistic regression analysis, the risk for death significantly increased in association with serum sodium ≥ 170 mmol/L, nutritional edema, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, and absent peripheral pulses and reduced with the sole use of oral rehydration salts (ORS) or ORS following intravenous fluid, if indicated (for all, P < .05). Thus, managing children with hypernatremia using only ORS or ORS following intravenous fluid may help reduce the number of deaths.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^111VV6u4]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and Initial Evaluation

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) defined as serum glucose > 600 mg/mL (33 mmol/L), serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/L, and minimal ketonemia/ketonuria, is being seen with increasing frequency as the presenting indication of T2D and may be associated with mild-tomoderate acidosis from severe dehydration, leading to confusion with DKA. Conversely, patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) may have features of HHS, especially if they have been satisfying their polydipsia with fluids containing a high concentration of glucose.HHS has a substantial mortality rate and requires aggressive reconstitution of the circulatory volume.–

Body weight should be determined for calculation purposes. Dehydration can be estimated as 5% if there is reduced skin elasticity, dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, and deep breathing, and up to 10% with capillary refill time greater than 3 seconds and sunken eyes (Table 1). Calculations of fluid deficit are commonly based on 10% dehydration, which in most cases is a modest overestimate that does not appear to have clinical significance.–The level of consciousness should be recorded using the Glasgow Coma Scale (Table 2). An initial venous blood sample should be tested for glucose; electrolytes; pH; urea nitrogen; creatinine; osmolality; ketones or beta-hydroxybutyrate; hemoglobin and hematocrit or complete blood count, while keeping in mind that DKA is associated with leukocytosis.

Pediatric cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — early presentation for IV intervention is based on one retrospective pediatric CVS study assessing factors predicting hospital admission from the emergency department (ED) during a CVS attack, and the panel judged desirable effects to be moderate for preventing hospitalization, noting delayed (> 24 h) presentation as the strongest independent risk predictor. Undesirable effects were assessed as small and related to the invasiveness of IV fluids, supporting use of urgent care centers, infusion centers, or home IV therapy to mitigate emotional stress and emphasizing individualized risk assessment. Despite low certainty, the panel judged a moderate therapeutic benefit with small harm, warranting early presentation for IV intervention in patients refractory to abortive therapy, with cost-effectiveness from preventing hospitalizations and feasibility using individualized CVS protocols. Subgroup considerations include patients refractory to outpatient interventions with historically prolonged episodes requiring repeated IV intervention, and research priorities include trials of timed early IV fluids and medications (e.g., if patient does not respond within 2–4 h of other medications at home and continues to have severe symptoms).

### Rapid versus standard intravenous rehydration in paediatric gastroenteritis: pragmatic blinded randomised clinical trial [^112kRn4i]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Outcome measurements

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was rehydration, defined as a score on the clinical dehydration scale of ≤ 1two hours after the start of treatment. This scale, which consists of four clinical variables, was used to improve diagnostic characteristicsas individual measures, such as prolonged capillary refill, abnormal skin turgor, and abnormal respiratory pattern, have sensitivities of only 43–60% to detect 5% dehydration. In validation studies, the scale selected has been shown to correlate with length of stay and the use of intravenous rehydration and therefore seems to correlate with clinical decision making.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes included prolonged treatment — a composite measure defined as admission to an inpatient unit at the index visit or admission within 72 hours of randomisation or a stay in the emergency department longer than six hours after the start of treatment; score on the clinical dehydration scale; adequate oral intake, a common prerequisite for discharge, defined as consuming at least 5 mL/kg of liquid per two hour time period (only a small volume was prespecified as all children additionally received intravenous rehydration); time to discharge, determined by chart review — defined as the time between the start of treatment and discharge from the emergency department or inpatient unit; repeat emergency department visit within 72 hours; and attending physician's comfort with discharge at two and four hours as reported on a 5 point Likert scale. We found the latter correlated strongly with the outcome of hospital admission.

Sample size

We estimated that enrolling 226 children would provide 80% power to detect a 20 percentage point difference in the proportion of children rehydrated two hours after the start of treatment, given a two sided type I error probability of 0.05 and a 40% success rate in the standard group. This calculation included a 5% adjustment for losses to follow-up, withdrawals, and missing data.

Acute cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) exacerbation — intravenous (IV) fluids: The guideline panel determined that there is very low certainty evidence (no direct evidence) on whether D10 or D5 containing IV fluids should be used in children with an acute CVS exacerbation, and standard practice for IV rehydration should be implemented, with a focus on the rapidity of intervention. In patients with known or suspected metabolic disorders, higher glucose infusion rates should be considered, and there is no evidence to support specialized IV fluids, which may delay care compared to the use of routine IV fluids. Patient-specific concerns about hypo- or hyper-glycemia can be evaluated with bedside blood glucose monitoring or other standard techniques in the acute care setting. The panel rated the overall certainty as very low and thought there was probably no impact on equity or costs associated with D10 versus D5 IV fluids, noting that either is likely to be acceptable, but D10 is probably not feasible; the panel judged any undesirable effects as trivial and mostly related to practical considerations and potential delay in care with specialized rather than standard IV fluids.

Evidence for oral rehydration solution (ORS) and solution osmolality — The safety and efficacy of ORS, in comparison to intravenous rehydration therapy (IVT), was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 17 RCTs involving 1811 patients aged < 18 years from high-income and low-income countries, with no important clinical differences in failure to hydrate, weight gain at discharge, hyponatremia or hypernatremia, duration of diarrhea, or total fluid intake at 6 or 24 hours between children receiving ORS and IVT; the model estimated that 4% of children treated with ORS would fail and require IVT, and historically standard WHO-ORS (osmolarity 311 mmol/L) was recommended, but in 2002 a hypotonic ORS with total osmolality < 250 mmol/L was recommended by the WHO and other advisory bodies as first-line therapy for mild to moderate dehydration caused by diarrhea of all causes.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: WHO plan C versus slow rehydration [^115swQN4]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In the design of the trial, when considering secondary outcomes, we aimed to use guideline recommendations for assessing the reversal of dehydration. First, we aimed to check on whether the clinical signs for severe dehydration accurately predict the degree of dehydration. We based this on the gold standard looking at the percentage change in weight from admission to day 7, rather than weight at discharge since this time point has not been reliable previously. We found that although the trial was targeting children that were assumed to have 10% or more dehydration, our data suggests this was present in only 33 (29%), with 30 (26%) having a deficit of > 5- < 10% and nearly half with only modest deficit (1–5%). There have been several systematic reviews covering the issue of the specificity of all the available dehydration scores; nearly all perform poorly in practice including the WHO scoring. Of note during initial rehydration, at 8-h most children remained clinically dehydrated, based on the same signs, but were not re-prescribed intravenous rehydration (even though it is recommended to start plan C again). In order to address the lack of specificity of these signs we added two additional parameters that are also considered as rehydration goals and/or adverse consequences. We selected time to pass urine as a more reliable marker of perfusion (as it is specified or required as an endpoint for management of shock or hydration status). We also included dysnatraemia, as this has been used in a number of other clinical trials as a safety endpoint (defined as a sodium level outside the normal range (135–145 mmol/L). However, we found, on stored samples, batch-analysed at the end of the trial, that quite a number had haemolysis (noted at the time of storage in – 80 °C freezers) and many had extreme sodium and chloride values at admission and 8 h which could not be rechecked for verification. We thus excluded samples with visual evidence of haemolysis (that also had extreme potassium values) and those with extreme values (sodium > 240 mmol/L and creatinine (< 20 mmol/L). However, we do note that severe hypernatraemia can also cause rhabdomyolysis, which would also result in similar findings as haemolysis (as well as dark urine). Discussions with local trial teams indicated that intravenous access for cannulation and blood draws were exceptionally difficult owing to the extreme volume depletion in many children. Moreover, our finding of exceptionally high sodium level (and chlorides) in some children is consistent with hypernatraemic dehydration, and with a history of parents rehydrating children with high-sugar energy fizzy drinks (containing 54–62 g glucose/500 ml). This practice has been reported on by previously as being a major risk factor for hypernatraemic dehydration, as well as young infants receiving only breast milk. Hypertonic or hypernatraemic dehydration (defined as a sodium level > 150 mmol/L) occurs when water loss is much greater than sodium loss and usually often presents with different clinical signs ('doughy' skin in an irritable child and full fontanelle in an infant) and is generally recommended to be managed using a separate slow rehydration protocol. The current WHO rehydration Plan C protocol recommends that children with severe isotonic or hypotonic dehydration receive fast rehydration to restore intracellular sodium and water losses but makes no recommendations for rehydration of children with hypernatraemic dehydation. The most conservative estimate, when most haemolysed and extreme values were excluded, suggests that 26% of children with gastroenteritis in Eastern Uganda present with hypernatraemic dehydration (sodium > 150 mmol/L). Nevertheless, outcomes for both arms were similar with few children developing neurological complications (one of the risks of hypertonic dehydration) and mortality was much lower that pre-trial estimates. On the whole sodium levels tended to normalise by 8- and 24-h in those presenting with hyponatraemia, normonatraemia and hypernatraemia, with little difference between the study arms (Fig. 5).

### Clinical practice guideline: maintenance intravenous fluids in children [^112puCGw]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Biochemical laboratory monitoring and dysnatremia risk during maintenance intravenous fluids (IVFs): Researchers in most studies obtained serial plasma sodium values, with the first plasma sodium being measured between 6 hours and 12 hours, and in patients receiving isotonic fluids the incidence of hyponatremia ranged from 0% to 23%. Clinicians should be aware that even patients receiving isotonic maintenance IVFs are at sufficient risk for developing hyponatremia and, if isotonic IVF recipients develop hyponatremia, they should be evaluated to determine if they are receiving other sources of free water or if they may have SIAD and/or an adrenal insufficiency. If hypernatremia develops (plasma sodium > 144 mEq/L), patients should be evaluated for renal dysfunction or extrarenal free-water losses. In patients at high risk for developing electrolyte abnormalities, such as those who have undergone major surgery, those in the ICU, or those with large gastrointestinal losses or receiving diuretics, frequent laboratory monitoring may be necessary, and if neurologic symptoms that could be consistent with hyponatremic encephalopathy are present, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, or lethargy, electrolytes should be measured.

Fig. 3
Algorithm for differential diagnosis of hypernatremia, modified according to Bockenhauer et al. and Zieg, J. After excluding pseudohypernatremia, early management is tailored to the volume status and weight of the patient. While free water loss and insufficient water intake are associated with weight loss and low urine sodium, children with salt intoxication gain weight and their urine sodium is high. Measurement of plasma and urine osmolality is important in determining the cause of hypernatremia

Table 2
Etiology of hypernatremia in children

Hypernatremia may lead to neurologic symptoms due to the shift of water from the intracellular compartment, resulting in cellular shrinkage. These symptoms include irritability, fever, and weakness. Severe cases may present with lethargy, focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status, coma, seizures, and death. Children with hypernatremic dehydration should first receive intravenous isotonic solutions to restore intravascular volume and tissue perfusion, followed by solutions containing higher free water content to correct hypernatremia. The free water deficit can be estimated using the formula: 4 mL x weight (kg) x desired change in serum sodium (mmol/L). This formula can be applied for patient management in situations where children are experiencing hypernatremia dehydration and require fluid supplements. It is essential to correct hypernatremia gradually with a recommended correction rate of below 1 mmol/L/h and 15 mmol/24 h to prevent the development of cerebral edema. Some experts recommend administering solutions with slightly higher sodium content (10–15 mmol/L lower) in children with severe hypernatremia (greater than 175 mmol/L) to avoid the risk of rapid decline in serum sodium due to excessive free water intake. Regular monitoring of serum sodium is necessary to avoid a rapid drop in serum sodium levels. Following fluid replacement for losses, hypotonic solutions with lower sodium content (Na 75 mmol/L) are recommended for severe hypernatremia and (Na 30 mmol/L) for mild cases to help control and gradually adjust the sodium concentration. Rehydration strategies are different in children with renal concentration defects to control sodium levels according to specific needs. Individuals with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus should be given hypotonic solutions (dextrose), whereas those with central diabetes insipidus require replacement of water loss with hypotonic fluids alongside desmopressin administration. However, caution is exercised with these treatments as they potentially lead to hyponatremia in cases of renal impairment affecting electrolyte balance. Therefore, careful monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential when administering desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to prevent the development of hyponatremia. In hemodynamically unstable patients, rapid correction of intravascular volume with isotonic saline should be initially used to stabilize the patient. Once stability is achieved, transitioning to hypotonic solutions may be considered.

Abortive interventions (IV) — The guideline panel suggests early presentation and immediate IV fluid for treatment of acute cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) episodes in children and adolescents not responding to outpatient abortive therapies (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects). The guideline panel suggests IV fluid rehydration for treatment of acute CVS episodes guided by patient age, symptom severity, and degree of dehydration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects), and there is no research evidence regarding the use of D10 versus D5 IV fluids in the setting of acute CVS episodes; no recommendations for specific IV fluids are made. The guideline panel suggests using an IV NK-1 receptor antagonist (e.g., fosaprepitant) and an IV 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents not responding to outpatient abortive therapies (each a conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects).

### Rapid versus standard intravenous rehydration in paediatric gastroenteritis: pragmatic blinded randomised clinical trial [^117Bv1Gb]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine if rapid rather than standard intravenous rehydration results in improved hydration and clinical outcomes when administered to children with gastroenteritis.

Design Single centre, two arm, parallel randomised pragmatic controlled trial. Blocked randomisation stratified by site. Participants, caregivers, outcome assessors, investigators, and statisticians were blinded to the treatment assignment.

Setting Paediatric emergency department in a tertiary care centre in Toronto, Canada.

Participants 226 children aged 3 months to 11 years; complete follow-up was obtained on 223 (99%). Eligible children were aged over 90 days, had a diagnosis of dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis, had not responded to oral rehydration, and had been prescribed intravenous rehydration. Children were excluded if they weighed less than 5 kg or more than 33 kg, required fluid restriction, had a suspected surgical condition, or had an insurmountable language barrier. Children were also excluded if they had a history of a chronic systemic disease, abdominal surgery, bilious or bloody vomit, hypotension, or hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia.

Interventions Rapid (60 mL/kg) or standard (20 mL/kg) rehydration with 0.9% saline over an hour; subsequent fluids administered according to protocol.

Main outcome measures Primary outcome: clinical rehydration, assessed with a validated scale, two hours after the start of treatment. Secondary outcomes: prolonged treatment, mean clinical dehydration scores over the four hour study period, time to discharge, repeat visits to emergency department, adequate oral intake, and physician's comfort with discharge. Data from all randomised patients were included in an intention to treat analysis.

Results 114 patients were randomised to rapid rehydration and 112 to standard. One child was withdrawn because of severe hyponatraemia at baseline. There was no evidence of a difference between the rapid and standard rehydration groups in the proportions of participants who were rehydrated at two hours (41/114 (36%) v 33/112 (30%); difference 6.5% (95% confidence interval −5.7% to 18.7%; P = 0.32). The results did not change after adjustment for weight, baseline dehydration score, and baseline pH (odds ratio 1.8, 0.90 to 3.5; P = 0.10). The rates of prolonged treatment were similar (52% rapid v 43% standard; difference 8.9%, 21% to −5%; P = 0.19). Although dehydration scores were similar throughout the study period (P = 0.96), the median time to discharge was longer in the rapid group (6.3 v 5.0 hours; P = 0.03).

Conclusions There are no relevant clinical benefits from the administration of rapid rather than standard intravenous rehydration to haemodynamically stable children deemed to require intravenous rehydration.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: WHO plan C versus slow rehydration [^113a8hNS]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, an estimated 2.5 billion cases of acute gastroenteritis occur annually in children under 5 years. In this age group, gastroenteritis is the second biggest cause of mortality (after acute respiratory illnesses). The vast majority of deaths occur in low resource settings in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. A large case-control study, Global Enteric Multicentre study of gastroenteritis (GEMS), conducted in Africa and Asia showed that children with moderate/severe gastroenteritis seeking care at health centres are 8.5 times more likely to die than non-gastroenteritis controls. A third of the fatalities occurred < 7 days following enrolment — indicating that current treatment strategies may not be working in practice and/or are poorly implemented.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has produced guidance on the management of dehydration in children with diarrhoea, largely based on expert opinion. In children (without severe malnutrition), oral rehydration solution (ORS) is recommended for children with diarrhoea with some dehydration, defined as two or more of the following: restlessness/irritability, sunken eyes, drinks eagerly/thirsty and/ or skin pinch goes back slowly (plan B). Intravenous fluids are recommended for resuscitation of children with severe dehydration, defined as the presence of two or more of the following clinical features: sunken eyes, skin pinch goes back very slowly ≥ 2 seconds (s), lethargy and/or inability to drink (under the protocol called 'plan C'), using 100 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or 0.9% saline. This is the approximate volume estimated to have been lost in children with 10% dehydration and is recommended to be given over 3 h (or 6 h in children < 1 year). Plan C consists of two steps in which the volume and rate of infusion are different and also differ by age group (< 1 year and ≥ 1 year). In Step 1 30 ml/kg over 30 min (or 1 h if < 1 year) and then in Step 2 70 ml/kg over 2.5 h (or 5 h if < 1 year). For children presenting with shock (defined as the presence of all three of weak and fast pulse, temperature gradient and capillary refilling time > 3 s), WHO also recommends initial fluid boluses given for shock (i.e. up to 3 boluses of 20 ml/kg of normal (0.9%) saline given as rapidly as possible) followed directly by Step 2, i.e. 90–130 ml/kg. These management guidelines are recommended in resource-poor settings, despite no formal testing in a clinical trial. A review of the evidence underpinning WHO management guidelines in 2012, with regard to shock and rehydration management, focused principally on the type of fluid for resuscitation but did not consider the rate or volume.

Case presentation

A 5-month-old female was transferred from an outside facility for dermatologic evaluation of a diffuse pruritic and scaling rash that began at 2 months with asymptomatic dryness and erythema on the chest. By 3 months, the rash became pruritic and progressed to her face, scalp, and extremities, resulting in gradual hair shedding. Her birth history was noncontributory; no collodion membrane was present. At 5 months, the rash intensified until she developed poor oral intake and lethargy, resulting in emergency evaluation and admission for hypernatremic dehydration.

Vital signs on initial admission demonstrated hypothermia and hypotension, while bloodwork revealed hypernatremia, hypoalbuminemia, leukocytosis, and elevated transaminases. Due to her severe clinical course, she was evaluated by infectious diseases, gastroenterology, and endocrinology — all with negative respective workups. Nutritional deficiencies were considered, yet zinc, alkaline phosphatase, and total protein levels were all within normal limits. Similarly, immunologic workup yielded normal complete blood counts, immunoglobulins, and complement levels without peripheral eosinophilia. Aside from lethargy-related decreased oral intake, there were no gastroenterology symptoms. Given her altered mentation, she received empiric antibiotics and underwent lumbar puncture, which was unremarkable. The days following, she received multiple albumin transfusions and intravenous fluids; numerous attempts were made at oral feeds. Despite these efforts, hypernatremia and hypothermia persisted, requiring a radiant warmer to maintain her temperature.

Predisposing Factors for Pediatric Intussusception.

The clinical presentation of intussusception usually reveals waxing and waning crampy abdominal pain associated with typical gastroenteritis symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. The abdominal pain occurs due to peristalsis at the intussuscepted segment that is transiently obstructed. Physical examination may reveal abdominal discomfort in any quadrant, typically without rebound tenderness. Although rarely found, the classic triad of symptoms is abdominal pain, palpable "sausage shaped" mass, and bloody ("currant jelly") stools. If the area is not actively peristalsing, the patient may be asymptomatic. Patients often present dehydrated due to anorexia secondary to pain and/or in shock due to bowel ischemia. Therefore, tachycardia, hypotension, delayed capillary refill, dry mucous membranes, and oliguria could be present in affected children.

Intussusception is diagnosed primarily using ultrasound. Intussusception can only be confirmed when the bowel is actively intussuscepted, although there have been improvements in identifying them due to an increase in point-of-care ultrasounds. Intussusception is classified based on location, which determines therapy. In a large bowel to large bowel intussusception, the mainstay of treatment is nonoperative reduction of the intussusception using air or contrast enemas. However, when the intussuscepted site is more proximal in the small bowel, bowel rest with supportive care is suggested, as it is too proximal for an enema to be effective and most resolve spontaneously. Rarely, the involved area of the small bowel requires surgical intervention if the intussusception does not resolve spontaneously with supportive care.

### Oral rehydration versus intravenous therapy for treating dehydration due to gastroenteritis in children: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112oe444]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Despite treatment recommendations from various organizations, oral rehydration therapy (ORT) continues to be underused, particularly by physicians in high-income countries. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to compare ORT and intravenous therapy (IVT) for the treatment of dehydration secondary to acute gastroenteritis in children.

Methods

RCTs were identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, authors and references of included trials, pharmaceutical companies, and relevant organizations. Screening and inclusion were performed independently by two reviewers in order to identify randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing ORT and IVT in children with acute diarrhea and dehydration. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality using the Jadad scale and allocation concealment. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. The primary outcome measure was failure of rehydration. We analyzed data using standard meta-analytic techniques.

Results

The quality of the 14 included trials ranged from 0 to 3 (Jadad score); allocation concealment was unclear in all but one study. Using a random effects model, there was no significant difference in treatment failures (risk difference [RD] 3%; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0, 6). The Mantel-Haenzsel fixed effects model gave a significant difference between treatment groups (RD 4%; 95% CI: 2, 5) favoring IVT. Based on the four studies that reported deaths, there were six in the IVT groups and two in ORT. There were no significant differences in total fluid intake at six and 24 hours, weight gain, duration of diarrhea, or hypo/hypernatremia. Length of stay was significantly shorter for the ORT group (weighted mean difference [WMD] -1.2 days; 95% CI: -2.4,-0.02). Phlebitis occurred significantly more often with IVT (number needed to treat [NNT] 33; 95% CI: 25,100); paralytic ileus occurred more often with ORT (NNT 33; 95% CI: 20,100). These results may not be generalizable to children with persistent vomiting.

Conclusion

There were no clinically important differences between ORT and IVT in terms of efficacy and safety. For every 25 children (95% CI: 20, 50) treated with ORT, one would fail and require IVT. The results support existing practice guidelines recommending ORT as the first course of treatment in appropriate children with dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis.

### Rapid versus standard intravenous rehydration in paediatric gastroenteritis: pragmatic blinded randomised clinical trial [^116oY9j6]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine if rapid rather than standard intravenous rehydration results in improved hydration and clinical outcomes when administered to children with gastroenteritis.

Design

Single centre, two arm, parallel randomised pragmatic controlled trial. Blocked randomisation stratified by site. Participants, caregivers, outcome assessors, investigators, and statisticians were blinded to the treatment assignment.

Setting

Paediatric emergency department in a tertiary care centre in Toronto, Canada.

Participants

226 children aged 3 months to 11 years; complete follow-up was obtained on 223 (99%). Eligible children were aged over 90 days, had a diagnosis of dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis, had not responded to oral rehydration, and had been prescribed intravenous rehydration. Children were excluded if they weighed less than 5 kg or more than 33 kg, required fluid restriction, had a suspected surgical condition, or had an insurmountable language barrier. Children were also excluded if they had a history of a chronic systemic disease, abdominal surgery, bilious or bloody vomit, hypotension, or hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia.

Interventions

Rapid (60 mL/kg) or standard (20 mL/kg) rehydration with 0.9% saline over an hour; subsequent fluids administered according to protocol.

Primary Outcome

clinical rehydration, assessed with a validated scale, two hours after the start of treatment.

Secondary Outcomes

prolonged treatment, mean clinical dehydration scores over the four hour study period, time to discharge, repeat visits to emergency department, adequate oral intake, and physician's comfort with discharge. Data from all randomised patients were included in an intention to treat analysis.

Results

114 patients were randomised to rapid rehydration and 112 to standard. One child was withdrawn because of severe hyponatraemia at baseline. There was no evidence of a difference between the rapid and standard rehydration groups in the proportions of participants who were rehydrated at two hours (41/114 (36%) v 33/112 (30%); difference 6.5% (95% confidence interval -5.7% to 18.7%; P = 0.32). The results did not change after adjustment for weight, baseline dehydration score, and baseline pH (odds ratio 1.8, 0.90 to 3.5; P = 0.10). The rates of prolonged treatment were similar (52% rapid v 43% standard; difference 8.9%, 21% to -5%; P = 0.19). Although dehydration scores were similar throughout the study period (P = 0.96), the median time to discharge was longer in the rapid group (6.3 v 5.0 hours; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

There are no relevant clinical benefits from the administration of rapid rather than standard intravenous rehydration to haemodynamically stable children deemed to require intravenous rehydration. Trail registration Clinical Trials NCT00392145.

### A rare diabetes ketoacidosis in combined severe hypernatremic hyperosmolarity in a new-onset Asian adolescent with type I diabetes [^117CdKUP]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 13-year-old Asian boy presented with an 8 h history of lethargy and vomiting. He had a 3-week history of polyuria, polydipsia and a 6 kg weight loss over a period of 1 month. Fluid intake prior to admission was over 6 L of sports drinks and cola per day. Initial biochemical findings were as follows: plasma glucose 1351 mg/dL, serum sodium 154 mEq/L, serum osmolarity 425 mOsm/L, arterial blood pH 6.96 and urine ketone of 3+. He was treated with intensive fluid resuscitation and an insulin infusion. He completely recovered without any neurological deficits. Severe hypernatremia is rare in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) but was exhibited in this case. Excess intake of carbonated carbohydrate-rich beverages may exacerbate the initial severe presentation of type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of an Asian child with DKA combined with severe hypernatremic hyperosmolarity at onset of T1DM.

### Fluid and electrolyte pathophysiology in common febrile illness in children and the implications for clinical management [^115ZNUh2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

Achieving fluid homeostasis and the management of fluid and electrolyte complications are constants in the treatment of seriously ill children worldwide. Consensus on the most appropriate fluid strategy for unwell children has been difficult to achieve and has evolved over the last two decades, most notably in high-income countries where adverse events relating to poor fluid management were identified more readily, and official robust inquiries were possible. However, this has not been the situation in many low-income settings where fluids that are prohibited from use in high-income countries may be all that are available, local guidelines and processes to recognise adverse events are not developed, and there has been limited training on safe fluid management for front-line healthcare workers. This narrative review outlines the fluid and electrolyte pathophysiology of common febrile illnesses in children, describes the evolution of this field and concludes with implications and principles of a fluid management strategy for seriously ill children. This review was prepared as a physiological background paper to support evidence presented to the WHO Guideline Development Group for Fluid Guidelines in Children, Geneva, March 2024.

### Myocardial and haemodynamic responses to two fluid regimens in African children with severe malnutrition and hypovolaemic shock (AFRIM study) [^113EA6hX]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) severe malnutrition guidelines for treatment of hypovolaemic shock recommend reserving intravenous fluids for those presenting with advanced shock, and recommend low-volume hypotonic fluids. These recommendations are founded on the assumption that the "malnourished" heart is at risk of incipient biventricular failure and thus unable to respond to isotonic fluid challenges; however, this remains controversial owing to the weak evidence base, including randomised clinical trials (RCTs) or appropriate physiological studies.

A study conducted in Bangladesh in which standard fluid resuscitation/rehydration was used in malnourished children showed no evidence of heart failure in the marasmic children. A phase II randomised trial in which half-strength (hypotonic) Darrow's/5% dextrose (usual care) was compared to isotonic Ringer's lactate (RL) in severely malnourished Kenyan children with shock demonstrated superior shock reversal and lower mortality in the RL arm and supported further research examining the rate and volume of fluid replacement. However, publication of a multicentre RCT, (Fluid Expansion as A Supportive Therapy trial (FEAST)), which demonstrated increased mortality in the fluid bolus arms compared to control (no-bolus) in African children with severe febrile illness, has necessitated further research to elucidate the mechanism of harm with fluid boluses. Children with shock due to gastroenteritis were excluded from the FEAST trial, thus, further research is required to generate evidence for best practice in this group.

Severe dehydrating diarrhoea is a common complication of severe malnutrition, as demonstrated in a prospective study of severely malnourished Kenyan children, in which > 50% of patients admitted had this complication, with an associated overall 20% fatality rate, increasing to 38% in the presence of severe dehydration and delayed capillary refill time. Most deaths occur early in the course of admission. The high mortality in this sub-group and lack of relevant research to inform management guidelines warranted this prospective study in children with severe malnutrition, to examine myocardial function and haemodynamic response to fluid resuscitation in hypovolaemic shock due to gastroenteritis (the Appropriate Fluid Resuscitation In Malnutrition (AFRIM) study).

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines on the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^116NcUGC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in children — abortive intravenous (IV) management: The guideline panel suggests early presentation and immediate IV fluid therapy for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents not responding to outpatient abortive therapies (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Regarding fluid selection, remarks note there is no research evidence regarding the use of D10 versus D5 IV fluids, make no recommendations for specific IV fluids due to lack of evidence and potential delays, and state that IV fluids should be determined by the evaluating physician with goals of rehydration and alleviation of electrolyte disturbances and ketosis. When outpatient therapy fails, the guideline panel suggests using an IV NK-1 receptor antagonist (e.g., fosaprepitant) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents not responding to outpatient abortive therapies (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects), and suggests using an IV 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) for acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents not responding to outpatient abortive therapies (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects).

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^115hbzur]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Fluid Therapy

Dehydration can be assumed to be 5%–10% (50–100 mL/kg). As noted above, the degree of dehydration is usually overestimated. The severity of extracellular fluid (ECF) contraction may be indicated by serum urea and hematocrit concentrations. Serum Na concentration is not reliable for determining ECF deficit because of the osmotic effect of hyperglycemia-induced dilutional hyponatremia, and the low Na content of the elevated lipid fraction of the serum in DKA. Corrected Na, ie for normal glucose levels, can be estimated by adding 1.6 mEq to the measured value for each 100 mg/dL blood glucose above normal.
During the first 1–2 hours, 10–20mL/kg 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) should be provided to restore peripheral perfusion.
Maintenance can be calculated as 1000 mL for the first 10 kg body weight + 500 mL for the next 10 kg + 20 mL/kg over 20 kg or 1500 mL/m 2 body surface area.
The remainder of replacement after the loading dose, based on 5%–10% dehydration, and maintenance, can be distributed over the subsequent 22–23 hours. While many guidelines call for calculating replacement over 48 hours, there is no evidence basis for this being safer or more efficacious. Fluids that have recently been administered orally at home (if not vomited) and parenteral fluids provided in the emergency room or referring institution need to be incorporated into the calculation.
Except for severely ill and very young individuals, oral intake should begin before 24 hours.
While urinary output should be carefully documented, urinary losses should not be added to fluid requirements, except in the presence of HHS.
After initial 0.9% NaCl bolus, rehydration/maintenance should be continued with 0.45% NaCl. The measured Na can increase to the level of the corrected Na during rehydration as glycemia declines and then decline to normal levels if the corrected level was elevated.
Continued use of 0.9% saline after the initial resuscitation may result in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
To prevent unduly rapid decline in plasma glucose concentration and hypoglycemia, 5% glucose should be added to the IV fluid when the plasma glucose falls to 300 mg/dL (17 mmol/L). An efficient method of providing glucose as needed without long delays entailed by the changing of IV solutions is to have two IV fluid bags connected, one containing 10% dextrose and the appropriate Na and K concentrations and the other with the same salt concentrations but no dextrose, the so-called "two bag system".
K (40 mEq/L or up to 80 mEq/L as needed) can be provided as half potassium chloride (KCl), half potassium phosphate (KPO 4; to replenish low phosphate levels and to decrease the risk of hyperchloremia) or as half KPO 4 and half K acetate (which, like lactate, is converted to bicarbonate to help correct acidosis) after serum K is < 6 mmol/L or urine flow is established. Serum K concentration increases by approximately 0.6 mEq/L for every 0.1 decrease in pH, so that the serum K level does not reflect the large deficit from diuresis and vomiting, ∼5 mEq/kg body weight. Both K and phosphate shift markedly from intracellular to extracellular compartments with acidosis and re-enter cells rapidly with insulin-induced glucose uptake and rehydration.
Bicarbonate administration is not indicated in pediatric DKA. There is no evidence that bicarbonate facilitates metabolic recovery. Restoring circulatory volume will improve tissue perfusion and renal function, increasing organic acid excretion and reversing lactic acidosis. The administration of insulin stops further synthesis of ketoacids and reactivates the Krebs cycle, permitting metabolism of ketoacids, and regeneration of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate therapy may cause paradoxical central nervous system (CNS) acidosis, rapid correction of acidosis can cause hypokalemia, the additional Na can add to hyperosmolality, and alkali therapy can increase hepatic ketone production, potentially slowing recovery.

### Comparison of ultrarapid and rapid intravenous hydration in pediatric patients with dehydration [^114UUzxc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of ultrarapidly infused vs rapidly infused intravenous (IV) hydration in pediatric patients with acute gastroenteritis and moderate dehydration.

Methods

Patients 3 to 36 months, with vomiting and/or diarrhea and moderate dehydration, were eligible. Subjects were randomly assigned "ultra" (50 mL/kg normal saline for 1 hour) vs "standard" (50 mL/kg normal saline for 3 hours) after failing an oral fluid challenge. Subjects were weighed and had serum electrolyte testing, and urine was obtained before/after IV hydration. Input/output and vital signs were tabulated hourly during the study. Subjects were discharged after fulfilling specified criteria. A follow-up questionnaire was completed 24 hours after discharge. Comparison data included success and timing of rehydration, number of patients who returned and/or were admitted, output during the rehydration period, laboratory differences, and serious complications.

Results

Eighty-eight of 92 subjects completed the study: 45 ultra and 43 standard. Four patients failed treatment (1 ultra and 3 standard), were hospitalized, and excluded from the study. Groups were similar regarding sex, days of symptoms, episodes of vomiting/diarrhea before treatment, capillary refill time, tears, and vital signs and laboratory results. No subject had evidence of serious complications. Ninety-one percent of subjects completed the follow-up questionnaire. Seven ultra and 6 standard subjects returned. Six ultra subjects received oral fluid, one received IV fluid, and all were discharged. Five standard subjects received oral fluid, one received IV fluid, and all were discharged.

Conclusion

Based on this pilot study, ultrarapid hydration for 1 hour preliminarily appears to be an efficacious alternative to standard rapid hydration for 3 hours and improves emergency department throughput time.

### ACR appropriateness criteria vomiting in infants up to 3 months of age [^1111oujr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Vomiting is a commonly reported symptom in infants less than three months of age. There are a multitude of pathologies to consider, both within and outside the gastrointestinal tract. In addition to conducting a thorough history and physical examination, a clinician formulates a reasonable differential diagnosis by consideration of two main factors: the infant's age and the characterization of the vomit as bilious or nonbilious. In this endeavor, the clinician is able to determine if an imaging study is needed and, if so, the urgency of the request. A review of the appropriate imaging evaluation of vomiting infants in the newborn to three-month-old age group is provided by organizing the discussion around the following three clinical scenarios: bilious vomiting, intermittent nonbilious vomiting since birth, and new-onset bilious vomiting. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

When should feeding be initiated following rehydration — recommendations and evidence: Human milk feeding should be continued in infants and children throughout the diarrheal episode (strong, low), and resumption of an age-appropriate usual diet is recommended during or immediately after the rehydration process is completed (strong, low). Evidence includes that early feeding (within 12 hours of beginning rehydration) was as safe and effective as later feeding among children aged < 6 years old with acute diarrhea, and a meta-analysis of 33 trials involving children < 5 years of age found that a lactose-free diet reduced the duration of diarrhea by an average of 18 hours and reduced treatment failure by one half. Although the BRAT diet and avoidance of dairy are commonly recommended, supporting data for those interventions are limited, and instructing patients to refrain from eating solid food for 24 hours does not appear to be useful.

### A comparison of the NIRUDAK models and WHO algorithm for dehydration assessment in older children and adults with acute diarrhoea: a prospective, observational study [^117EFG91]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhoea is the eighth leading cause of death globally and the fifth leading cause of death in low-income countries. Despite considerable progress in reducing early childhood deaths over the past 50 years, diarrhoea morbidity and mortality remains high in older children and adults with 5.7 billion cases and 1.1 million deaths globally in 2019. In many countries, epidemics of diarrhoeal disease are becoming more frequent due to the effects of climate change, conflict, and mass displacement.WHO warned of an "unprecedented" surge in cholera outbreaks in 2022, with epidemics reported in 30 countries and an overall case fatality ratio of nearly 2% — twice the acceptable limit and the highest in a decade. Although diarrhoea incidence varies by age and region, most adults and older children will experience at least one episode of diarrhoea annually. The vast majority of these episodes will follow a relatively benign course; however, approximately 5% of episodes in older children and adults, or about 285 million cases each year, will lead to moderate or severe disease requiring medical management. Evidence suggests that older people can be especially susceptible to diarrhoea morbidity and mortality.

Although antibiotics can be useful in specific situations, appropriate rehydration remains the most important management strategy for acute diarrhoea in all populations. As the severity of dehydration from acute diarrhoea can vary widely, accurately assessing and managing dehydration remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. - Patients with severe dehydration require immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids in a hospital to prevent hypovolaemic shock, electrolyte derangements, and death; those with mild to moderate dehydration can be safely managed in an ambulatory setting with oral rehydration solution alone; and those with no dehydration require only guidance for continued oral intake and expectant management at home. Accurate assessment of dehydration status can thus improve the cost-effectiveness of diarrhoea management by reducing intravenous fluid and hospital bed usage while also reducing the morbidity and mortality that results from both overtreatment and undertreatment.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) — definition and acute clinical features — is described as a non-IgE-mediated food allergy that typically presents in infancy with repetitive protracted vomiting that begins approximately 1 to 4 hours after food ingestion, often accompanied by lethargy and pallor and followed by diarrhea; watery diarrhea can develop within 5 to 10 hours and can be present for up to 24 hours, and symptoms of acute FPIES usually resolve within 24 hours after food ingestion. Summary Statement 1 states: "Recognize FPIES as a potential medical emergency, which presents as delayed onset of protracted emesis and/or watery/bloody diarrhea, culminating in hemodynamic instability and hypotension in at least 15% of reactions. [Strength of recommendation: Strong; Evidence strength: IIa/IIb; Evidence grade: B]" Delayed onset and absence of cutaneous and respiratory symptoms suggest a systemic reaction different from anaphylaxis, and severe cases can progress to hypothermia, methemoglobinemia, acidemia, and hypotension, mimicking sepsis.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^115KxMA7]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) fluid therapy — initial management should focus on volume expansion and perfusion restoration, with a minimum initial bolus of 20 mL/kg of isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and assumed fluid deficits of approximately 12% to 15% of body weight; subsequently, 0.45% to 0.75% NaCl should be given to replace the deficit over 24 to 48 hours, and isotonic fluids are recommended initially then followed by more hypotonic (0.45%-0.75% saline solution) fluids, with isotonic fluids restarted if perfusion and hemodynamic status worsen as osmolality declines; administration of isotonic fluids (0.9% saline solution) during ongoing osmotic diuresis may increase serum sodium concentration, which is undesirable as it may perpetuate the hyperosmolar state.

### A randomized trial of plasma-lyte A and 0.9% sodium chloride in acute pediatric gastroenteritis [^112KwgDt]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This prospective, randomized, triple-blind, company-sponsored, active-controlled study was conducted at 8 pediatric emergency departments (ED) in the US and Canada (NCT#01234883). Institutional ethics approval was obtained from each institution (Additional file 1: Table S1), and written informed consent was obtained from the parent/legal guardian of all children before randomization. Safety data were periodically monitored by an independent consultant (pediatric nephrologist, SLG) who was not involved in patient recruitment or management.

Patients ≥ 6 months to < 11 years of age were eligible for enrollment if they presented to the ED with moderate-to-severe dehydration due to AGE, defined as ≥ 3 episodes of diarrhea or nonbilious vomiting within the previous 24 h and a Gorelick dehydration score ≥ 4. Screened patients had blood drawn for serum chemistry. A prerandomization fluid bolus of ≤ 20 mL/kg in the 4 h prior to enrollment was permitted. Exclusion criteria included AGE that did not require IVT per clinicians' judgment, chronic health conditions such as renal failure affecting the ability to tolerate fluids or those that result in electrolyte abnormalities, or the use of prohibited medications (eg, antacids/anti-diarrhea or systemic corticosteroids within 24 or 72 h prior to presentation, respectively).

During the prestudy period, all patients received routine care, and oral rehydration therapy and IVT per clinician judgment. Screening included review of inclusion/exclusion criteria, complete medical history and physical exam, Gorelick score, abdominal pain assessment, and assessment of volume and type of prestudy IVT.

Concealed treatment allocation was via an Interactive Voice Recognition System/Interactive Web-based System. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive concealed bolus therapy with PLA (Multiple Electrolyte Injection, Type 1) or 0.9% NaCl. Following randomization, hour 0 was defined as the beginning of infusion of the first bolus of blinded study treatment. Patients were assessed at baseline, hour 4 (± 1), and 48 ± 6 h. The study treatment period was for up to 8 h. If the patient continued to require IVT beyond the study treatment period, the clinician ordered standard-of-care rehydration IVT. The safety follow-up period was defined from the end of the last blinded study bolus to 48 ± 6 h. The protocol recommended 20 mL/kg for the first study treatment IV bolus, but the ordered dose was left to provider discretion.

### Exploring mechanisms of excess mortality with early fluid resuscitation: insights from the FEAST trial [^113nBSHp]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Adverse effects of hyperchloremia, at the doses given in this trial, remain controversial. Intriguingly, the most deleterious effects of boluses were in those patients with severe acidosis at baseline, the group with the least a priori equipoise regarding the potential benefits of fluid resuscitation - lending support to the notion of adverse effects of the resuscitation fluids on acid-base equilibrium. Alternatively, this may indicate lethal reperfusion injury or a surge of cytokines in cases with advanced shock. As previously suggested, shock may be an adaptive, time-dependent response sustaining children through a prolonged period prior to hospital admission - only to die within hours of reperfusion.

Whatever the explanation, these findings raise important questions about the pathophysiological mechanisms of shock and goal-directed management, questioning whether the protocol-driven requirement for inotropes and vasoactive drugs has been driven, in part, by aggressive fluid challenge. The 2008 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, informed by a modified Delphi process, graded the pediatric recommendation (20 ml/kg boluses over 5 to 10 minutes up to 60 ml/kg) as 2C, indicating a weak recommendation with low quality of evidence. The pediatric studies on which these recommendations were based included only two retrospective, observational studies of initial resuscitation volume on the outcome of children with putative sepsis from a single tertiary referral center, involving 34 and 91 children respectively. The inclusion criteria for both studies were children who survived to intensive care unit admission, but were inotrope-dependent and had pulmonary arterial catheters in situ. Higher initial fluid boluses and early shock reversal in 9 and 24 children in the two respective studies were associated with improved global outcome. However, the study design and the patient population had major limitations in terms of survivorship bias and external validity to other settings. Other sources of evidence that were referenced to inform fluid resuscitation guidelines include dengue shock. We suggest these are largely irrelevant to the management of sepsis, because shock as a complication of dengue occurs 7 to 10 days after fever defervescence, secondary to gross intravascular leakage leading to vomiting, abdominal pain, increasingly tender hepatomegaly, narrow pulse pressure and hemoconcentration. The American College of Critical Care Medicine guideline, and similar guidelines, nevertheless have been adopted by many countries worldwide where point-of-care testing and intensive care facilities are available and are considered to be best practice. These are now being recommended as standards of care for resource-poor settings; indicating that the FEAST trial had limited generalizability because the adverse effects of fluid boluses were largely confined to children with malaria and/or anemia. The data presented in the original manuscript, subsequence correspondence and this detailed sub-analysis definitely counter this interpretation. A recent systematic review assessing the evidence base for fluid resuscitation in the treatment of children with shock due to sepsis or severe infection found only 13 pediatric trials. Whilst the majority of all randomized evidence to date comes from the FEAST trial, they recommended that implementation of simple algorithms for children managed at hospitals with limited resources to ensure identification of children who maybe potentially be harmed by fluid boluses. The findings we report here raise questions over the rates, volumes and types of solutions recommended in pediatric resuscitation protocols, most of which remain untested in clinical trials.

### Variables associated with intravenous rehydration and hospitalization in children with acute gastroenteritis: a secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials [^117TU8vd]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

One approach to reduce the use of intravenous rehydration is oral ondansetron followed by a trial of ORT. Although clinical trials have consistently demonstrated benefit, database studies, which lack detailed clinical characteristics and timelines, have reported less positive results. Our study, which included timelines related to ondansetron administration, route, and timing of orders for intravenous rehydration, enabled us to ensure that oral ondansetron was administered a minimum of 30 minutes before the order for intravenous rehydration, thereby ensuring it was given and followed by ORT. This is an important concept, as one can reach incorrect conclusions when such an approach is not incorporated into analyses, because in some settings, oral ondansetron and intravenous rehydration are ordered simultaneously. Our finding associating oral ondansetron with a reduction in intravenous rehydration and hospitalization suggest that strategies promoting the appropriate use of oral ondansetron in children with AGE and nonsevere dehydration are crucial to accruing its benefits.

Unscheduled revisit rates for children with AGE range from 7% to 18%, and are associated with absence of a primary care provider, higher serum bicarbonate, greater frequency of vomiting and diarrhea, and administration of intravenous rehydration in the ED. Similarly, we found that prior ED visits, particularly those associated with intravenous rehydration, were associated with intravenous rehydration at the enrollment ED visit. These findings highlight the importance of administering intravenous rehydration based on presenting clinical features rather than previous therapies. This approach is important because caregivers of children who received intravenous rehydration are less likely to comply with ORT recommendations.

Consistent with previous reports, the proportion of children with AGE admitted to the hospital was low (3.6%). Our data suggest that hospitalization was associated with more severe dehydration and care in the US. The latter association may reflect previously published differences in health care resource utilization between Canada and the US in children with AGE. Although we did not quantify volume of oral fluids consumed or fluid losses in the ED, a higher CDS score is independently associated with ORT failure, which may have influenced the decision for hospitalization. Consistent with previous reports, we found oral ondansetron to be associated with a lower odds of hospitalization, most likely through the reduction in intravenous rehydration. Thus, promoting oral ondansetron and a trial of ORT in the ED for children with nonsevere dehydration may decrease the risk of intravenous rehydration and demonstrate a strategy that caregivers can continue post–ED discharge.

### Rehydration: role for early use of intravenous dextrose [^115jLK8E]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis is a common reason for children to seek health care. Among the potential complications of acute gastroenteritis, the most common is dehydration. For mild to moderate dehydration, treatment options include oral and intravenous rehydration. Outpatient treatment failure for either method, when it occurs, is often due to persistent nausea and vomiting. Some authorities have suggested that the early administration of dextrose to patients receiving intravenous rehydration may help terminate vomiting and result in fewer outpatient treatment failures. The purpose of this report was to review the evidence supporting the effectiveness of early intravenous dextrose administration in the outpatient management of dehydration in children with acute gastroenteritis.

### Emergency management of adrenal insufficiency in children: advocating for treatment options in outpatient and field settings [^114a5Zqg]. Journal of Investigative Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric adrenal insufficiency (AI) emergency care — initial steroid dosing, evaluation, and acute crisis treatment are specified as follows: if an intravenous catheter cannot be placed quickly, the initial dose should be given intramuscularly; ongoing stress doses are typically given parenterally for the first 24–48 hours and then transitioned to oral dosing if feasible, and because hydrocortisone sodium succinate in high doses has mineralocorticoid effect, no fludrocortisone is needed while the patient receives intravenous fluids and stress doses of hydrocortisone. Appropriate evaluation should include biochemical documentation of AI (serum cortisol and plasma ACTH), assessment of hydration and acid–base status, and investigation of an underlying precipitant, and ideally a blood sample should be collected prior to administration of hydrocortisone sodium succinate, although treatment should NOT be delayed if obtaining a blood sample proves difficult. In an acute adrenal crisis, hypovolemia should be rapidly reversed with a 20 mL/kg bolus of isotonic solution, preferably normal saline, and hypoglycemia should be treated with a 2.5 mL/kg bolus of 10% dextrose solution and repeated if the response is not adequate.

### Infants and children 6–59 months of age with moderate wasting: evidence gaps identified during WHO guideline development [^114tFo2r]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

SUMMARY BOX

The 2023 WHO guideline on wasting and nutritional oedema provides the first systematically developed evidence-informed set of recommendations and good practice statements for children 6–59 months of age with moderate wasting.
Several of the prioritised guideline questions lacked a rigorous evidence base, providing impetus for future studies specifically in children with moderate wasting.
We identified several evidence gaps for moderate wasting, including: (1) accurate assessment of dehydration, (2) appropriate choice of rehydration fluids, (3) nutritional supplementation approaches, (4) prioritisation for specially formulated foods, (5) quantity of specially formulated foods and (6) implications of task-shifting to community health workers identifying and managing wasting.

### Hypoglycemia complicating dehydration due to acute gastroenteritis [^1138fsWX]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

To identify clinical variables predictive of hypoglycemia in dehydrated children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE), clinical variables were recorded for dehydrated children younger than 5 years old with AGE before measuring serum glucose. One hundred and eighty-four children were enrolled; 62 with, and 122 without, hypoglycemia. Multivariate analysis identified variables associated with hypoglycemia. Female gender, neurologic symptoms of hypoglycemia, and a greater amount of vomiting vs. diarrhea were significantly associated with hypoglycemia. Clinical variables do not have adequate sensitivity and specificity to accurately predict which children with AGE have hypoglycemia. Glucose determination should be considered for these patients.

### An evidence and consensus based guideline for acute diarrhoea management [^116w2tod]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop an evidence and consensus based guideline for the management of the child who presents to hospital with diarrhoea (with or without vomiting), a common problem representing 16% of all paediatric medical attenders at an accident and emergency department. Clinical assessment, investigations (biochemistry and stool culture in particular), admission, and treatment are addressed. The guideline aims to aid junior doctors in recognising children who need admission for observation and treatment and those who may safely go home.

Evidence

A systematic review of the literature was performed. Selected articles were appraised, graded, and synthesised qualitatively. Statements on recommendation were generated.

Consensus

An anonymous, postal Delphi consensus process was used. A panel of 39 selected medical and nursing staff were asked to grade their agreement with the generated statements. They were sent the papers, appraisals, and literature review. On the second and third rounds they were asked to re-grade their agreement in the light of other panelists' responses. Consensus was predefined as 83% of panelists agreeing with the statement.

Recommendations

Clinical signs useful in assessment of level of dehydration were agreed. Admission to a paediatric facility is advised for children who show signs of dehydration. For those with mild to moderate dehydration, estimated deficit is replaced over four hours with oral rehydration solution (glucose based, 200–250 mOsm/l) given "little and often". A nasogastric tube should be used if fluid is refused and normal feeds started following rehydration. Children at high risk of dehydration should be observed to ensure at least maintenance fluid is tolerated. Management of more severe dehydration is detailed. Antidiarrhoeal medication is not indicated.

Validation

The guideline has been successfully implemented and evaluated in a paediatric accident and emergency department.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^113icEQE]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric guidelines — fluid bolus in low-resource settings: For children without signs of fluid overload where advanced supportive and intensive care is not available, the panel recommends against bolus fluid administration in the first hour if hypotension is not present, and suggests administering up to 40 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10–20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour if hypotension is present; for the subset with septic shock and hypotension, the panel suggests cautious administration of fluid bolus therapy as a weak recommendation based on low quality of evidence. For this weak recommendation, hypotension can be defined as systolic blood pressure less than 50 mm Hg in children younger than 12 months old, less than 60 mm Hg in children 1 to 5 years old, and less than 70 mm Hg in children older than 5 years old, or by World Health Organization criteria of cold extremities with prolonged capillary refill greater than 3 seconds and weak, fast pulse; WHO recommends 10–20 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid over 30–60 minutes, followed by an additional 10 mL/kg over 30 minutes if condition has not improved and there are no signs of fluid overload, cardiac failure, or neurologic deterioration. In a FEAST analysis of children with moderate hypotension, fluid bolus therapy was not beneficial or harmful compared with maintenance fluid only (RR of death = 1.48; 95% CI, 0.61–3.66; p = 0.41), while among children reclassified as meeting all three WHO shock criteria mortality was 48% in the bolus groups versus 20% in the control group (p = 0.07), a very small proportion of FEAST participants (only 72 [2.3%] with moderate hypotension and 65 [2%] meeting full WHO shock criteria).

### Clinical practice guideline: maintenance intravenous fluids in children [^115mMa3C]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Maintenance intravenous fluids (IVFs) in children — scope, intent, and exclusions: The guideline provides an evidence-based approach for choosing the tonicity of maintenance IVFs in most patients from 28 days to 18 years of age who require maintenance IVFs, noting high variability in prescribing and a lack of guidelines; it states maintenance IVFs should only be administered when clinically indicated and notes that the administration of hypotonic IVF has been the standard in pediatrics with concerns that this approach results in a high incidence of hyponatremia and that isotonic IVF could prevent the development of hyponatremia; recommendations do not apply to patients with neurosurgical disorders, congenital or acquired cardiac disease, hepatic disease, cancer, renal dysfunction, diabetes insipidus, voluminous watery diarrhea, or severe burns; neonates who are younger than 28 days old or in the NICU; or adolescents older than 18 years old.

### Gastroenteritis in children [^112w212R]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhoea is defined as the frequent passage of unformed, liquid stools. Regardless of the cause, the mainstay of management of acute gastroenteritis is provision of adequate fluids to prevent and treat dehydration.

Methods and Objectives

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute gastroenteritis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 16 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: clear fluids, enteral rehydration solutions (oral or gastric), lactose-free feeds, loperamide.

### Oral rehydration salt solutions for children: a review [^1175uDCv]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Dehydration continues to be a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in children globally. Oral rehydration salts (ORS) solutions can successfully treat mild to moderate dehydration. However, the uptake of this simple and cost-effective intervention remains low in both high-income and low-to-mid-income countries. The low-osmolality ORS solution recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) contains an appropriate balance of electrolytes and glucose that helps effectively absorb water and electrolytes, irrespective of the cause of gastroenteritis. ORS solution can be administered orally in most cases of mild to moderate dehydration; however, a nasogastric tube can be used in cases of oral intolerance in selected cases. The amount of ORS solution required for rehydration depends on the estimates of fluid losses and the child's weight. Severe dehydration could be managed with intravenous fluids initially; however, oral rehydration therapy can be used as soon as the patient is stable. The few contraindications for the use of oral rehydration solution include altered mental status, inability to tolerate oral or nasogastric intake of fluids, underlying gastrointestinal problems such as ileus, anatomical abnormalities, and gut malabsorption. This review describes the use of different ORS solutions in the United States and discusses the newly studied, non-glucose-based ORS solutions. The review also discusses hydration strategies for fluid loss during exercise and in hot environments.

### Infant 4.2% sodium bicarbonate [^1159CBfo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is administered by the intravenous route.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia.

In infants (up to two years of age), the 4.2% solution is recommended for intravenous administration at a dose not to exceed 8 mEq/kg/day. Slow administration rates and the 4.2% solution are recommended in neonates, to guard against the possibility of producing hypernatremia, decreasing cerebrospinal fluid pressure and inducing intracranial hemorrhage.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids. The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight-hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight — depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2 content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^114fuMUB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic relief — Ancillary treatment with antimotility, antinausea, or antiemetic agents can be considered once the patient is adequately hydrated, but their use is not a substitute for fluid and electrolyte therapy (weak, low). Antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children < 18 years of age with acute diarrhea (strong, moderate). Loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). Antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children > 4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate).

### Acute severe hypernatremia complicated by osmotic demyelination syndrome in a 13-day-old infant [^111nf2Ls]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This clinical case reports a neonatal osmotic demyelination syndrome associated with iatrogenic hypernatremia.

Case presentation

A 13-day-old neonate initially admitted to the hospital with poorly tolerated fever due to enterovirus meningitis developed severe hypernatremia (184 mmol/L) following an error in fluid therapy, which was complicated by extra-pontine demyelination syndrome (subtype of osmotic demyelination syndrome). The child presented with nonspecific neurological symptoms of irritability, tremors and convulsions. Natremia was slowly corrected by hyperhydration within 26.5 h. Brain imaging revealed lesions consistent with extra-pontine demyelination. At 3 months, both clinical signs and MRI lesions had markedly regressed.

Conclusion

Sudden osmolar variations can induce osmotic demyelination syndrome. Few cases have been reported in the pediatric population but none in the neonatal period to our knowledge. Measures to prevent sudden changes in osmolarity are critical to prevent poor neurological outcomes. Dysnatremia correction rates must be strictly controlled and customized according to the presence of neurological symptoms, the severity of sodium fluctuation, and the course of tonicity imbalance.

Prismatic clinical scenario — pediatric adrenal crisis presentation, initial management, and EMS barriers: A "9-year-old boy" presented with tachycardia "(pulse 110 bpm), mild hypotension (85/60 mm Hg)", and labs showing hyponatremia "(sodium 129 mEq/L)", hyperkalemia "(potassium 5.8 mEq/L) and hypoglycemia (glucose 55 mg/dL)". Despite fluids "with 2 intravenous boluses of normal saline and a bolus of 10% dextrose", hypotension persisted and he received "75 mg of intravenous hydrocortisone sodium succinate". Two years later, during a gastrointestinal illness, "He was unresponsive on arrival of the ambulance 20 minutes later", and EMS policy meant they "were not allowed to administer the child's personal supply of hydrocortisone sodium succinate and did not have an alternative medication on the ambulance". Field glucose was "30 mg/dL", he was taken to an ED "30 minutes away", and in the ED "he was given 75 mg intravenous hydrocortisone sodium succinate… [and] had later died of complications related to prolonged hypoglycemia and aspiration pneumonitis".

### Oral ondansetron in management of dehydrating diarrhea with vomiting in children aged 3 months to 5 years: a randomized controlled trial [^112xGHPE]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the role of oral ondansetron in facilitating successful rehydration of under-5-year-old children suffering from acute diarrhea with vomiting and some dehydration.

Study Design

Children (n = 170) aged 3 months to 5 years with acute diarrhea with vomiting and some dehydration were enrolled in this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The participants were randomized to receive either single dose of oral ondansetron (n = 85) or placebo (n = 85) in addition to standard management of dehydration according to World Health Organization guidelines. Failure of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), administration of unscheduled intravenous fluids, and amount of oral rehydration solution intake in 4 hours were the primary outcomes. Secondary outcome measures included duration of dehydration correction, number of vomiting episodes, adverse effects, and caregiver satisfaction.

Results

Failure of ORT was significantly less in children receiving ondansetron compared with those receiving placebo (31% vs 62%; P < .001; relative risk 0.50, 95% CI 0.35–0.72). Almost one-half of the children in the ondansetron group received intravenous fluids compared with those in the placebo group, but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.074; relative risk 0.56, 95% CI 0.30–1.07). The oral rehydration solution consumption was significantly more in the ondansetron group (645 mL vs 554 mL; mean difference 91 mL; 95% CI: 35–148 mL). Patients in the ondansetron group also showed faster rehydration, lesser number of vomiting episodes, and better caregiver satisfaction.

Conclusion

A single oral dose of ondansetron, given before starting ORT to children < 5 years of age with acute diarrhea and vomiting results in better oral rehydration.

### Intravenous rehydration for severe acute malnutrition with gastroenteritis [^113HvKJo]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

International recommendations advise against the use of intravenous rehydration therapy in children with severe acute malnutrition because of the concern about fluid overload, but evidence to support this concern is lacking. Given the high mortality associated with the current recommendations, the adoption of intravenous rehydration strategies might improve outcomes.

Methods

We conducted a factorial, open-label superiority trial in four countries in Africa. Children 6 months to 12 years of age with severe acute malnutrition with gastroenteritis and dehydration underwent randomization in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of three rehydration strategies: oral rehydration, plus intravenous boluses for shock; a rapid intravenous strategy that consisted of lactated Ringer's solution (100 mL per kilogram of body weight) administered over a period of 3 to 6 hours, with boluses for shock; or a slow intravenous strategy that consisted of the same solution administered over a period of 8 hours, with no boluses. The primary end point was death at 96 hours.

Results

A total of 272 children underwent randomization; 138 were assigned to the oral strategy, 67 to the rapid intravenous strategy, and 67 to the slow intravenous strategy. Participants were followed for 28 days. A nasogastric tube was used for oral rehydration in 126 of 135 participants (93%) in the oral group and in 82 of 126 (65%) in the intravenous groups. Intravenous boluses were administered at admission in 12 participants (9%) in the oral group, 7 (10%) in the rapid intravenous group, and none in the slow intravenous group. At 96 hours, 11 participants (8%) in the oral group and 9 (7%) in the intravenous groups (5 in the rapid group and 4 in the slow group) had died (risk ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41 to 2.52; P = 0.69). At 28 days, 17 participants (12%) in the oral group and 14 (10%) in the intravenous groups had died (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.78). Serious adverse events occurred in 32 participants (23%) in the oral group, 14 (21%) in the rapid intravenous group, and 10 (15%) in the slow intravenous group. No evidence of pulmonary edema, heart failure, or fluid overload was noted.

Conclusions

Among children with severe acute malnutrition and gastroenteritis, no evidence of a difference in mortality at 96 hours was noted between oral and intravenous rehydration strategies.
