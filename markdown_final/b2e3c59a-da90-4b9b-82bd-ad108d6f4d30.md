## Question

Can Fasciculations be a benign phenomenon in healthy individuals?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fasciculations can be a benign phenomenon in healthy individuals. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how fasciculations are defined and what distinguishes benign from pathological forms. Then, I should verify prevalence and triggers in healthy populations. Next, I will review longitudinal data on benign fasciculation syndrome to assess prognosis. After that, I need to check for exceptions and red flags that suggest motor neuron disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion and counseling points, making sure I anchor each step to the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Fasciculations are spontaneous, visible contractions of a small bundle of muscle fibers reflecting ectopic motor unit firing; when they occur without objective weakness, atrophy, or upper motor neuron signs, they are typically labeled benign fasciculation syndrome, which is a recognized clinical entity with a favorable prognosis [^1135ktL8] [^11738QXR].

> Wait, let me verify prevalence in healthy people. I initially thought fasciculations were "common" in healthy individuals, but I should be precise: they are frequently observed, particularly in distal muscles and after exercise or physiologic stressors, and they can be detected by ultrasound even in asymptomatic athletes, supporting that they are not rare in health [^113y36nq] [^114bjshE]. Hold on, I should also check pediatric data; fasciculations are described as the most common spontaneous muscle contraction in children and can occur in otherwise healthy children, reinforcing that they are not inherently pathological [^112axqgk].

> Next, I should review triggers and modulators. Let me consider common precipitants: anxiety, fatigue, caffeine, and strenuous exercise are repeatedly cited as exacerbating factors in benign presentations, and clinicians themselves with fasciculation anxiety syndrome often report these triggers, which aligns with everyday clinical experience and supports a physiologic, hyperexcitability model rather than neurodegeneration in many cases [^115emVDY] [^114uWcvr]. I need to ensure I also note pharmacologic provocation: depolarizing neuromuscular blockers like succinylcholine characteristically produce fasciculations, underscoring that fasciculations can be a normal physiological response in certain contexts [^112F9Lnr] [^111SDh1N].

> I will now examine longitudinal prognosis. A retrospective follow-up of 37 patients with benign fasciculation syndrome found that over a median 4.7 years, two-thirds reported symptomatic improvement and none progressed to ALS; importantly, even those with minor EMG abnormalities remained stable, arguing that such changes are not necessarily harbingers of motor neuron disease [^11738QXR]. Let me double-check prospective data: a 24-month prospective cohort of 35 BFS patients likewise reported no conversions to ALS, with persistent but generally stable symptoms, which further supports a benign course in carefully selected populations [^116zuATg].

> But wait, what if fasciculations are an early sign of ALS? I need to check the exceptions. Case series document rare patients initially labeled as "benign cramps and fasciculations" who later developed ALS, with latency sometimes spanning years, so a blanket reassurance without follow-up is unsafe in higher-risk phenotypes, particularly older men with abrupt-onset, widespread fasciculations or evolving weakness [^116A3JP7] [^114X95To]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical clue: in ALS, fasciculations are often unperceived by patients despite being clinically visible, whereas benign fasciculations are frequently perceived and even drive presentation, which can help calibrate risk in the exam room [^117Evpa8] [^115emVDY].

> Next, I should review how to distinguish benign from malignant fasciculations. I need to ensure I emphasize the absence of weakness, atrophy, and upper motor neuron signs as the most reliable bedside discriminators; in younger patients under about 40 without these features, reassurance without EMG is reasonable, whereas in older patients or those with atypical features, targeted EMG and clinical follow-up are prudent to mitigate diagnostic delay if disease emerges [^115emVDY]. Let me reconsider EMG features: benign fasciculation potentials are often simpler and more proximally generated than ALS fasciculations, but overlap exists, so morphology alone cannot reliably distinguish entities, reinforcing that the clinical context remains paramount [^111ALesP] [^113KTmgV].

> I should confirm the pathophysiology to avoid overcalling disease. Evidence suggests benign fasciculations often arise proximally in the motor unit and reflect increased excitability without denervation, whereas ALS-related fasciculations evolve with denervation and reinnervation; this mechanistic divergence supports why benign fasciculations typically do not progress to weakness or atrophy in the absence of other signs [^113KTmgV] [^1135ktL8]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that all benign fasciculations are proximally generated; while proximal origin is more common in BFS, distal generation can occur too, so I should qualify that statement to avoid overgeneralization [^113KTmgV].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing contradicts the totality of evidence. Yes, fasciculations can be a benign phenomenon in healthy individuals, especially when they are longstanding, exercise- or anxiety-related, distal, and unaccompanied by weakness, atrophy, or UMN signs; longitudinal cohorts show no progression to ALS in such patients, though rare exceptions exist, warranting individualized risk assessment and follow-up when red flags are present [^11738QXR] [^116zuATg] [^116A3JP7]. I should double-check that my counseling aligns with practice: reassure when the phenotype is classic, educate about triggers, and arrange follow-up or EMG if the story is atypical or evolves, which balances overdiagnosis against the small but consequential risk of early motor neuron disease [^115emVDY].

Fasciculations can be a **benign phenomenon** in healthy individuals, especially when they occur without weakness, atrophy, or other neurological signs [^1135ktL8]. Benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) is common, often persistent, and typically does not progress to **ALS** or other serious disease [^11738QXR] [^116zuATg]. Triggers include anxiety, fatigue, caffeine, and exercise [^115emVDY]; EMG may show simple fasciculation potentials without denervation or chronic neurogenic change [^114uWcvr]. Reassurance and avoidance of triggers are usually sufficient, but persistent or atypical cases warrant **clinical evaluation** to exclude ALS or other neuropathies [^115emVDY].

---

## Prevalence and clinical features

- **Prevalence**: Fasciculations are common in healthy individuals, with estimates ranging from 10% to 70% depending on the population and detection method [^notfound].

- **Clinical features**: Benign fasciculations typically present as brief, localized muscle twitches, often in the calves, eyelids, or fingers, and are usually painless or mildly bothersome [^1135ktL8] [^116zuATg].

- **Triggers**: Anxiety, stress, fatigue, caffeine, alcohol, and strenuous exercise are common precipitants [^115emVDY] [^114uWcvr].

---

## Electrophysiological characteristics

On EMG, benign fasciculations show **simple, low-amplitude, short-duration** fasciculation potentials without fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, or chronic neurogenic changes [^114uWcvr]. The **origin** of benign fasciculations is often proximal (anterior horn cell or proximal axon), whereas ALS-related fasciculations more often arise distally [^113KTmgV].

---

## Differentiation from ALS

| **Feature** | **Benign fasciculations** | **Als** |
|-|-|-|
| Muscle weakness | Absent | Present |
| Muscle atrophy | Absent | Present |
| Hyperreflexia | Absent | Present |
| EMG findings | Simple fasciculation potentials | Fasciculations with fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, and chronic neurogenic changes |
| Progression | Stable over time | Progressive |

---

## Prognosis and clinical course

Benign fasciculations are **non-progressive** and do not lead to ALS or other serious neurological diseases [^116zuATg]. Long-term studies show no significant progression or development of motor neuron disease in patients with isolated fasciculations [^116zuATg].

---

## Management and reassurance

- **Reassurance**: Education and reassurance are the cornerstone of management, as most cases are benign and self-limited [^notfound].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Reducing caffeine, managing stress, and avoiding fatigue can decrease frequency and severity [^notfound].

- **Clinical follow-up**: Persistent or atypical cases may require further evaluation with EMG or neurological consultation to exclude underlying pathology [^1136GqLx].

---

## Conclusion

Fasciculations can be a benign phenomenon in healthy individuals, characterized by simple, **non-progressive muscle twitches** without accompanying neurological signs. Benign fasciculation syndrome is common, often persistent, and typically does not progress to **ALS** or other serious neurological diseases. Reassurance, **lifestyle modifications**, and selective clinical evaluation are the mainstays of management.

### Benign fasciculations: a follow-up study with electrophysiological studies [^11738QXR]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Fasciculations can be symptomatic, yet not progress to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a condition categorized as benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS). We aimed to assess electrodiagnostic changes and clinical course over time in patients with BFS.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of medical records of patients who were referred because of a suspicion of ALS or who had directly asked for a consultation because of a personal concern regarding ALS. All clinical and electromyography (EMG) investigations were performed by the same neurologist, following an established protocol. In addition, laboratory testing and imaging studies were performed as determined to be clinically necessary.

Results

We included 37 subjects (mean age 46 ± 14.7 y, 29 male, 7 healthcare professionals). Most patients had experienced fasciculations in both upper and lower limb muscles (62.2%); the remaining patients had fasciculations only in their lower limbs. EMG in seven subjects showed chronic neurogenic potentials in addition to fasciculation potentials; all of these were older men. Follow-up data were available in 24 patients (median 4.7 y), 21 with repeat EMGs, including all those with neurogenic EMG changes at baseline (median 6.5 y). Two-thirds of patients reported symptomatic improvement: 57.1% of those with abnormal EMG and 61.1% with normal EMG. The EMG changes were stable.

Discussion

Prognosis of BFS is favorable, regardless of minor EMG abnormalities. The latter do not necessarily imply progression to ALS.

### Fasciculations and cramps: how benign? Report of four cases progressing to ALS [^116A3JP7]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in patients presenting with cramps and fasciculations may not be evident at the first consultation. Sequential reviews, clinical and neurophysiological, form an important part of clinical practice in such cases. Recent attempts to delineate a more benign group with cramps and fasciculations have lacked information on the long term profile, both clinical and neurophysiological. Four patients who were initially diagnosed as suffering from benign cramps and fasciculations, but who subsequently progressed to ALS, are described. We propose that a diagnosis of benign cramps and fasciculations should not be considered secure without a minimum follow up of 4–5 years.

### Fasciculations in children [^112axqgk]. Pediatric Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fasciculations are the most common form of spontaneous muscle contraction. They frequently occur in healthy individuals. However, there are a minority of situations that fasciculations are observed in association with specific neurologic disorders. Publications concerning the evaluation of pediatric patients experiencing fasciculations are limited. These children may undergo invasive or expensive diagnostic investigations that are unnecessary. Moreover, without careful consideration of differential diagnoses, rare neuromuscular disorders that present with fasciculations in the pediatric age group can be under-recognized by pediatric neurologists. This review examines the most important pediatric disorders presenting with fasciculations and other spontaneous muscle contractions to guide pediatric neurologists in evaluating these children.

### Cramps, muscle pain, and fasciculations: not always benign? [^114X95To]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Fasciculation and cramps without weakness or muscle atrophy are recognized as a benign syndrome. The authors report a patient with cramp and fasciculation, which persisted for 1 year without abnormal motor unit morphology on EMG before progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, and EMG abnormalities developed. This observation raises the possibility that lower motor neuron hyperexcitability may precede motor neuron death in motor neuron disease.

### Fasciculation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: origin and pathophysiological relevance [^1135ktL8]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

This review considers the origin and significance of fasciculations in neurological practice, with an emphasis on fasciculations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and in benign fasciculation syndromes. Fasciculation represents a brief spontaneous contraction that affects a small number of muscle fibres, causing a flicker of movement under the skin. While an understanding of the role of fasciculation in ALS remains incomplete, fasciculations derive from ectopic activity generated in the motor system. A proximal origin seems likely to contribute to the generation of fasciculation in the early stages of ALS, while distal sites of origin become more prominent later in the disease, associated with distal motor axonal sprouting as part of the reinnervation response that develops secondary to loss of motor neurons. Fasciculations are distinct from the recurrent trains of axonal firing described in neuromyotonia. Fasciculation without weakness, muscle atrophy or increased tendon reflexes suggests a benign fasciculation syndrome, even when of sudden onset. Regardless of origin, fasciculations often present as the initial abnormality in ALS, an early harbinger of dysfunction and aberrant firing of motor neurons.

LMN-only signs

Benign fasciculations

The anxious medical student, qualified clinicianor other individuals (typically under 40 years of age) presenting with fasciculations is a common clinical encounter. While ' muscle twitching ' was the most sensitive symptom-based keyword for internet search engines to suggest MND as a diagnosis, it is part of normal physiology. Exercise, anxiety, caffeine and alcohol may all provoke fasciculations, and approximately 10% of thyrotoxic patients display them floridly. It is our experience that those with MND typically do not perceive their fasciculations until pointed out by the physician or a partner and so, in contrast to benign fasciculations, they are rarely the presenting complaint.

In the absence of weakness or abnormalities of thyroid function or electrolytes, individuals aged less than 40 years can be reassured without resorting to electromyography (EMG) to avoid the small but highly damaging possibility of false-positives. Equally, however, most subspecialists will recall a small number of cases, typically men in their 50s or 60s, in whom the latency from presentation with apparently benign fasciculations to weakness (and then clear MND) was several years. Our impression is that a clue may be that the fasciculations of MND are often abrupt and widespread at onset in an individual previously unaffected by fasciculations in youth. The site of the fasciculations, for example, those in the calves versus abdomen, has not been shown to be discriminatory for a benign disorder. There is conflicting evidence as to whether the character of fasciculations differs neurophysiologically in MND.EMG is only 60% sensitive for MND, however, and should not be treated as a diagnostic test, but carefully weighed up in the context of the clinical features.

Cramps and stiffness are a frequent co-occurrence with otherwise benign fasciculations; in the absence of weakness, these may be labelled as cramp-fasciculation syndrome, which improves with carbamazepine. True neuromyotonia (Isaacs' syndrome) is an extremely rare cause of fasciculations, and serum antivoltage gated potassium channels are only 50% sensitive. The absence of weakness in both cases is the most useful reassuring feature.

### A prospective study of benign fasciculation syndrome and anxiety [^116zuATg]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Benign fasciculations are common. Despite the favorable prognosis of benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS), patients are often anxious about their symptoms. In this study, we prospectively followed 35 patients with BFS over a 24-month period.

Methods

We conducted serial questionnaires to assess anxiety, associated symptoms, and duration.

Results

71.4% of patients were men, and 34.4% were employed in the medical field. Most reported anxiety, but only 14% were anxious as measured by the Zung self-rating anxiety scale. Fasciculations were most common in the calves and persisted in 93% of patients. Anxiety levels did not change over time. Associated symptoms (subjective weakness, sensory symptoms, and cramps) were common and resolved to varying degrees. No patients developed motor neuron disease.

Discussion

BFS is a benign disorder that usually persists over time. Commonly associated symptoms include subjective weakness, sensory symptoms, and cramps. BFS is usually not associated with pathologic anxiety. Muscle Nerve 58:852–854, 2018.

### Fasciculation-cramp syndrome preceding anterior horn cell disease: an intermediate syndrome? [^111diGHR]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Cramp-fasciculation syndrome (cramp-FS) is an ill-defined condition with uncertain clinical limits. The authors studied a 55-year-old man with progressively more severe, widespread fasciculations and cramps during a 6-year-period. Mild progressive lower motor neuron loss, shown by motor unit number and multi-motor unit potential (MUP) analysis, developed during the 4 years after onset, which stabilised during a further 2-year follow-up. Cramp-FS is generally a benign syndrome, probably with several causations. Our patient developed a limited form of anterior horn cell degeneration perhaps representing a syndrome transitional with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Cramp-FS merits more detailed study.

### Fasciculation potentials and earliest changes in motor unit physiology in ALS [^115Te1Cj]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is little information on the earliest changes in motor unit (MU) physiology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the development of the classical neurophysiological features of ALS over time.

Objective

We studied the earliest abnormalities in MU physiology in ALS and changes over time.

Design

Observational, cross-sectional and longitudinal study.

Population and Methods

We studied the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in three groups of subjects; 73 patients with ALS, 10 with benign fasciculation and 37 healthy control subjects. In the ALS group, 61 had normal strength in the TA muscle and 12 had TA muscle strength of 4 on the medical research council scale. In all subjects we evaluated the presence of fasciculation potentials (FPs) and fibrillation/sharp-waves (fibs-sw), and quantified MU potentials (MUPs) and jitter. Twenty-six ALS patients with TA muscle of normal strength were investigated in serial studies.

Results

FPs were recorded in TA muscles (medical research council 5) of 21 ALS patients with normal MUPs. Longitudinal studies confirmed that the patients presenting with FPs as the only abnormality progressed to MUP instability before large MUPs associated with fibs-sw were detected. FPs from ALS patients with no other neurophysiological change were simpler than in patients in whom there were also fibs-sw and neurogenic MUPs. The complexity of FPs in patients with weak TA muscle was greater than in the latter group. FPs in patients with benign fasciculations were simpler than FPs in ALS patients with normal TA muscle strength.

Conclusions

FPs are a very early marker of ALS and anticipate MUP instability or reinnervation, consistent with a very early phase of increased axonal excitability. Later, widespread neuronal dysfunction causes widespread fibs-sw and loss of MUPs with compensatory reinnervation. Our results confirm the importance of FP morphology analysis in the differential diagnosis of ALS and other disorders, and indicate that benign FPs represent a different phenomenon.

### Clinically visible but often unperceived: low awareness of fasciculations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^117Evpa8]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fasciculations are a key clinical sign of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) but also occur in other conditions such as benign fasciculation syndrome. Patients often present with perceived twitching fearing ALS; however, the extent to which ALS patients themselves perceive fasciculations has not been systematically examined. We therefore aimed to clarify how often ALS patients are aware of fasciculations that are clinically visible.

Methods

We prospectively studied 34 ALS patients. First, a structured questionnaire assessed initial symptoms, chief complaints, and awareness of twitching. Then, the frequency and concordance between objective fasciculations and subjective awareness of fasciculations (twitching) were analyzed across five body regions (bilateral upper and lower limbs and trunk) based on simultaneous visual observation and patient reports.

Results

In the questionnaire, only one of the 34 patients (3%) reported twitching as the initial symptom, and none presented with twitching as the chief complaint. More than half (19, 56%) had never noticed twitching. In the fasciculation analysis, patients showing objective fasciculations without subjective awareness were most common (21/34, 62%), whereas those with objective fasciculations accompanied by subjective awareness were fewer (10/34, 29%), indicating relatively low concordance between visible fasciculations and patient awareness. No patient exhibited subjective awareness without objective fasciculations. These findings suggest that the majority of visible fasciculations in ALS are not perceived by patients.

Conclusion

Fasciculations in ALS are rarely the initial or presenting symptom and are often unperceived by patients despite being clinically visible.

### Characteristics of fasciculations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the benign fasciculation syndrome [^111ALesP]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine first, if benign fasciculations and those in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can de distinguished on the basis of their waveforms or firing characteristics, and second to determine how fasciculation parameters evolved with progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Fasciculation potentials recorded from 63 muscles of 28 patients with definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were compared with those from 21 muscles of 11 patients with the benign fasciculation syndrome. In each muscle, at a single site, up to 15 identifiable fasciculation potentials could be recognized. Thus the characteristics of 430 fasciculations from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 191 benign fasciculations were analysed. Fasciculation potential amplitude, area, turns, duration, firing interval, indices of waveform variability, evidence of axonal conduction block, evidence of axonal conduction variability and propensity to produce double fasciculations were measured. The waveforms of fasciculations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were on average of shorter duration and had a greater number of turns than benign fasciculations, but, although irregular in both conditions, the firing rate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was significantly higher. In both conditions, there was evidence of multifocal distal generation of fasciculations, axonal conduction block in the motor unit arborization and of variable axonal conduction. When severe weakness and marked chronic neurogenic change were present on electromyography, the firing rate of fasciculations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was higher but fasciculation potential amplitude, area and indices of waveform variability were little changed. Double fasciculations in which the waveforms of the two potentials were the same occurred in both conditions. The intervals were in two bands: an early band with 4–10ms intervals showed identical waveforms of the two potentials, indicating the region of generation was the same. A second band of double fasciculation occurred in the tibialis anterior at an interval of 30–50ms. Here, the first fasciculation waveform was variable in shape but the second fasciculation was the same on each occasion, suggesting reactivation of the fasciculation via the F-wave route. Double fasciculations in which the second discharge was different from the first had flat time-interval histograms, indicating no interaction between different fasciculations. In conclusion, benign and malignant fasciculations are not distinguishable on the basis of waveform; highly complex fasciculation potentials can be seen in both conditions. Fasciculation firing rate and the frequency of double fasciculations increases in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis when there is a marked lower motor neuron abnormality.

### Origin of fasciculations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and benign fasciculation syndrome [^113KTmgV]. JAMA Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Fasciculation potentials (FPs) may arise proximally or distally within the peripheral nervous system. We recorded FPs in the tibialis anterior using 2 concentric needle electrodes, ensuring by slight voluntary contraction and electrical nerve stimulation that each electrode recorded motor unit potentials innervated by different axons.

Observations

Time-locked FPs recorded from both electrodes, suggesting a spinal origin, were most frequent in benign fasciculation syndrome (44%) (P < .001) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis without reinnervation (27%). Fewer time-locked FPs were found (14%) in the reinnervated tibialis anterior in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

We conclude that in chronic partial denervation FPs are more likely to arise distally and that FPs in benign fasciculation syndrome more frequently arise proximally.

### Distribution of fasciculations in healthy adults after exercise: an ultrasound study [^114bjshE]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ultrasound has become a reliable method to detect fasciculations. There is disagreement as to whether fasciculations above the knee should raise the suspicion of a disorder even if there are no other signs of lower motor neuron abnormality.

Methods

Using ultrasonography, 3 arm and 3 leg muscles were investigated for 120 s, 45min after 90-min handball training or a 5,000 meter run in a group of 25 men and 25 women handball players and 7 men who are amateur runners.

Results

All athletes had fasciculations in muscles above the knee. There were no fasciculations in the upper limb muscles in the runner group. In 21 men and 18 women handball players between 1 to 17 fasciculations in 2min were detected. The number of fasciculations in the rectus femoris was 4-fold higher in the runners compared with the handball players (ratio 0.24; P = 0.037).

Conclusions

Fasciculations may occur in muscles above the knee in healthy subjects. The distribution of fasciculations primarily depends on the exercised muscles. Muscle Nerve, 2016 Muscle Nerve 54: 132–135, 2016 Muscle Nerve 54: 132–135, 2016.

### Increased HCN channel driven inward rectification in benign cramp fasciculation syndrome [^1131Nwpf]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Muscle cramps are a common complaint associated with sudden painful involuntary contractions of a muscle. The mechanisms responsible for muscle cramps are still not clear. Axonal excitability and multi-unit electromyography studies were performed in 20 patients suffering from benign cramp fasciculation syndrome, not currently on medication. The measures of axonal excitability suggested greater inward rectification, indicative of an increase in Ih. Mathematical modelling suggested that the data were best explained by depolarization of the voltage dependence of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. Parameters associated with polarization of resting membrane potential were not changed. These findings suggest that a role for HCN channels may become apparent during the rhythmic discharge associated with a voluntary contraction. Consistent with this view, patients had higher motor unit discharge rates than healthy controls during maximal voluntary effort.

### Sensory modulation of fasciculation discharge frequency [^112XoHeg]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fasciculations are a marker for the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and reflect increased lower motor neuron (LMN) excitability.

Methods

We investigated modulation of fasciculation frequency in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle of the right hand following peripheral sensory nerve electrical stimulation, and vibration over the muscle-tendon region (50 and 100Hz), in patients with ALS, spinal muscular atrophy, and benign fasciculation syndrome. FDI muscles of ALS patients were classified by the presence or absence of neurogenic changes on needle electromyography.

Results

Both sensory nerve electrical stimulation and vibration significantly increased the frequency of fasciculations in neurogenic FDI muscles of ALS patients, but not in the remaining groups.

Discussion

Our results favour increased excitability of LMNs when affected by the disease process in ALS. We found that some fasciculations originating in these neurons in ALS are susceptible to modulation by sensory input. Muscle Nerve 59:688–693, 2019.

### A shortened surface electromyography recording is sufficient to facilitate home fasciculation assessment [^114J6T1X]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Fasciculations are an early clinical hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), amenable to detection by high-density surface electromyography (HDSEMG). In conjunction with the Surface Potential Quantification Engine (SPiQE), HDSEMG offers improved spatial resolution for the analysis of fasciculations. This study aims to establish an optimal recording duration to enable longitudinal remote monitoring in the home.

Methods

Twenty patients with ALS and five patients with benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) underwent serial 30min HDSEMG recordings from biceps brachii and gastrocnemii. SPiQE was independently applied to abbreviated epochs within each 30-min recording (0–5, 0–10, 0–15, 0–20, and 0–25min), outputting fasciculation frequency, amplitude median and amplitude interquartile range. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to assess agreement with the validated 30-min recording.

Results

In total, 506 full recordings were included. The 5 min recordings demonstrated diverse and relatively poor agreement with the 30min baselines across all parameters, muscles and patient groups (ICC = 0.32–0.86). The 15-min recordings provided more acceptable and stable agreement (ICC = 0.78–0.98), which did not substantially improve in longer recordings.

Discussion

For the detection and quantification of fasciculations in patients with ALS and BFS, HDSEMG recordings can be halved from 30 to 15min without significantly compromising the primary outputs. Reliance on a shorter recording duration should lead to improved tolerability and repeatability among patients, facilitating longitudinal remote monitoring in patients' homes.

### Identifying fasciculation potentials in motor neuron disease: a matter of probability [^113XyUtG]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fasciculations, the spontaneous activity of single motor units (MUs) are characteristic, but nonspecific for motor neuron disease (MND). We aimed to identify MU discharge properties to optimally differentiate MND patients from healthy controls.

Methods

High-density surface electromyography recordings were performed in the thenar muscles during 10 min of rest. MU discharges were classified as "isolated" when the interspike intervals (ISIs) before and after were > 250 ms, "continual" when both ISIs were ≤ 250 ms, or as "other".

Results

In patients (n = 30) compared with controls (n = 14), more MUs were active (9 vs. 3, P < 0.001) and generated relatively more isolated discharges (35% vs. 10%, P = 0.01). Two or more MUs with isolated discharges occurred more frequently in patients compared with controls (24% vs. < 1% of 10-s windows, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

More frequent occurrence of multiple MUs showing isolated discharges may improve identification of patients with MND.

### Fasciculation analysis reveals a novel parameter that correlates with predicted survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^116XDM2E]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prognostic uncertainty in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) confounds clinical management planning, patient counseling, and trial stratification. Fasciculations are an early clinical hallmark of disease and can be quantified noninvasively. Using an innovative analytical method, we correlated novel fasciculation parameters with a predictive survival model.

Methods

Using high-density surface electromyography, we collected biceps recordings from ALS patients on their first research visit. By accessing an online survival prediction tool, we provided eight clinical and genetic parameters to estimate individual patient survival. Fasciculation analysis was performed using an automated algorithm (Surface Potential Quantification Engine), with a Cox proportional hazards model to calculate hazard ratios.

Results

The median predicted survival for 31 patients was 41 (interquartile range, 31.5–57) months. Univariate hazard ratios were 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.16) for the rate of change of fasciculation frequency (RoCoFF) and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.01–1.19) for the amplitude dispersion rate. Only the RoCoFF remained significant (P = .04) in a multivariate model.

Discussion

Noninvasive measurement of fasciculations at a single time-point could enhance prognostic models in ALS, where higher RoCoFF values indicate shorter survival.

### Functional magnetic resonance imaging of human motor unit fasciculation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^112BK2JU]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

A novel diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging protocol sensitive to contraction of individual skeletal motor units was developed. We applied this technique to the lower limb muscles of 4 patients with confirmed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 6 healthy controls. A 3-minute scan revealed florid fasciculation in ALS patients, involving both superficial and deep muscles, and at a frequency higher than in healthy controls. This novel imaging technique reveals hitherto unobtainable information on human motor unit structure and function, which may allow earlier diagnosis and recruitment to clinical trials.

### Detecting fasciculations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: duration of observation required [^114Z6AMV]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

A practical issue in the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is how long the EMG must be observed before a muscle can be declared free of fasciculations with some degree of certainty. To answer this question, the intervals between fasciculation potentials (FPs) were recorded from 53 muscles of 19 ALS patients. The distribution of the FP intervals found across the sample showed that to record a single fasciculation with a probability approaching unity, observation for up to 90&emsp14; s may be required.

### Quantitative sonographic evaluation of muscle thickness and fasciculation prevalence in healthy subjects [^113y36nq]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In the current study, we aimed to determine normative values for muscle thickness and fasciculation prevalence in healthy subjects.

Methods

We performed a prospective study from October to December 2018 in 65 healthy subjects. All subjects underwent quantitative sonographic evaluation of muscle thickness and fasciculation prevalence in the following 8 muscles: Biceps brachii, abductor pollicis brevis, first dorsal interosseous, abductor digiti minimi, quadriceps, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum brevis, and abductor hallucis brevis.

Results

Subject ages ranged from 21 to 82years, with 63% women. Normative values for muscle thickness were determined using the fifth percentile. Multivariate regression analysis showed that sex, age, body mass index, and hand dominance affected muscle thickness. Fasciculations were observed frequently only in distal muscles.

Conclusions

Normal values for muscle thickness were determined, and may enhance neuromuscular ultrasound sensitivity and serve as a basis for future studies. Larger series are needed to confirm these values.

### Neuromuscular ultrasound in combination with nerve conduction studies helps identify inflammatory motor neuropathies from lower motor neuron syndromes [^114Jwdks]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fasciculations are considered to be an important and the earliest sign of ALS patients and can be effectively detected by muscle US compared to EMG, whilst in patients with ALS mimics, such as CIDP and MMN, fasciculations tend to be related to the process of axonal regeneration and re‐innervation and might occur in the later chronic phase of the disease. Moreover, although Vázquez‐Costa et al. revealed that fasciculation intensities were associated with muscle weakness and atrophy in an inverted U‐shaped pattern, Avidan et al. reported that fasciculations in at least one muscle were present in almost all ALS patients (87/90, 97.8%). Hence, it was speculated that, in the relatively early disease stages, patients without high intensity fasciculations were unlikely to have ALS. Fortunately, these results were consistent with our hypothesis that high intensity fasciculations were absent in 13 patients, and none of these patients were diagnosed with ALS by the end of the study (11 treatment‐responders, one Hirayama disease and one undiagnosed). From the other perspective, our work also suggested that if NCSs do not meet the criteria of demyelination and high intensity fasciculations are present, then a diagnosis of ALS is highly likely. In clinical practice, fasciculations might also be detected by clinical observation and EMG detection. However, the detection rate is significantly lower than that of muscle US, as mentioned above, and no specific criteria for measuring fasciculations or defining the "pathological" or "physiological" characteristics has been established (e.g. sporadic fasciculations might also appear in healthy subjects and peripheral neuropathies; if subjects have sporadic fasciculations, it would be improper to consider a diagnosis of ALS), which might limit the use of EMG detection or clinical observation of fasciculations in clinical practice for early diagnosis of ALS. Hence, it is recommended that muscle US studies be performed in LMNS patients in clinical practice to differentiate IMN from other diseases, such as ALS.

### Fasciculations demonstrate daytime consistency in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^115VaU2R]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fasciculations represent early neuronal hyperexcitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To aid calibration as a disease biomarker, we set out to characterize the daytime variability of fasciculation firing.

Methods

Fasciculation awareness scores were compiled from 19 ALS patients. In addition, 10 ALS patients prospectively underwent high-density surface electromyographic (HDSEMG) recordings from biceps and gastrocnemius at three time-points during a single day.

Results

Daytime fasciculation awareness scores were low (mean: 0.28 muscle groups), demonstrating significant variability (coefficient of variation: 303%). Biceps HDSEMG recordings were highly consistent for fasciculation potential frequency (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 95%, n = 19) and the interquartile range of fasciculation potential amplitude (ICC = 95%, n = 19). These parameters exhibited robustness to observed fluctuations in data quality parameters. Gastrocnemius demonstrated more modest levels of consistency overall (44% to 62%, n = 20).

Discussion

There was remarkable daytime consistency of fasciculation firing in the biceps of ALS patients, despite sparse and intermittent awareness among patients' accounts.

### Preventing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: insights from pre-symptomatic neurodegenerative diseases [^111PEswq]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Prodromal mild motor impairment

Clinically manifest ALS is preceded, at least in some patients, by a prodromal stage that is characterized by non-specific symptoms (e.g. muscle cramps, reduced exercise tolerance), signs (e.g. fasciculation, isolated loss of ankle reflexes, diffuse hyperreflexia) or EMG abnormalities (e.g. positive sharp waves in a single limb muscle or thoracic paraspinal muscles) in the absence of progressive muscle weakness. Importantly, to meet the criteria for prodromal disease, these findings — which represent a departure from the spectrum of healthy physiology — should be insufficient to permit an experienced neurologist to declare the unequivocal emergence of clinically manifest ALS and should not obviously be attributable to another cause.

By analogy to the recognized clinical syndromes of MCI and MBI in other neurodegenerative diseases, we have proposed the term mild motor impairment (MMI) to describe this prodromal period. Of note, prodromal manifestations are still considered 'pre-symptomatic' since they are insufficient to permit determination that clinically manifest disease has emerged. We suggest the term phenotransition to describe the initial appearance of mild impairment and the shift from the pre-manifest to the prodromal stage of pre-symptomatic disease. The rationale for this term is multifold: it differentiates the emergence of MMI from clear clinical evidence of ALS; captures the essential observation that MMI has an overt phenotype; and embodies the notion that the individual is entering a transitional stage (e.g. MMI). As discussed next, this same framework is also applicable to the early changes in cognition/behaviour in prodromal FTD and ALS. The timing of onset of these prodromal manifestations may be difficult to define, either because they are insidious or because they are observed post hoc by the examiner rather than reported real-time by the subject. As such, operationally, it is often only feasible to declare that phenotransition has occurred than to define when it occurred.

### Muscle ultrasound: present state and future opportunities [^113bMihm]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Medium credibility.

2.5 Dynamic muscle ultrasound

While static muscle ultrasound images are already very useful for diagnostic and follow up purposes in neuromuscular disease, ultrasound also brings a dynamic capability that can capture movement in a video sequence. For example, ultrasound videos can be used to show normal and abnormal muscle contraction patterns in muscular dystrophy, using a technique called speckle tracking. 55 But probably the most useful dynamic application of muscle ultrasound is the detection of fasciculations in patients with suspected motor neuron disease. Because of the larger pick‐up area of around 4 × 4‐6 cm, that is the size of the muscle slice that is shown on the screen, muscle ultrasound has a higher sensitivity for picking up fasciculations than clinical observation or needle EMG. 56 Fasciculations can be found in 10% to 30% of muscles that are subclinically involved or EMG‐negative in patients with motor neuron disease. 19, 57 Combining static and dynamic ultrasound scanning for echogenicity changes and fasciculations with EMG provides 25% of the patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with a more certain diagnosis at the time they first present. 14, 15 A small ultrasound screening protocol with ≥ 2/9 muscles positive for fasciculations, had a sensitivity and specificity of > 90% for discriminating patients with clinically probable or definite ALS from disease mimics. 36 Of note though, patients with other lower motor neuron disorders were excluded from this study cohort, limiting the clinical utility of this protocol.

### Plasma neurofilament heavy chain levels and disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: insights from a longitudinal study [^113Qepob]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Participants and sampling

Approximately 20% of those patients with ALS approached declined participation in the study. In most cases, patients with ALS consented for the study shortly after diagnosis, although recruitment was not limited to newly diagnosed cases. Exclusion criteria included neurological comorbidities likely to affect Nf homeostasis, including previous neurosurgical operations, peripheral neuropathies and a recent history of neurotrauma. The control group included healthy controls (HCs) and neurological controls (NCs), affected by multiple sclerosis, a range of neuropathies, compressive radiculopathies and benign fasciculations and cramp syndrome (table 1, legend).

Table 1
Plasma NfH levels and characteristics of patients with ALS and controls in the cross-sectional study

Baseline plasma samples were used for a cross-sectional study of NfH levels. Serial blood samples and clinical information were obtained on average every 2–4 months from 74 of the 136 patients with ALS, who accepted to donate further blood samples after baseline sampling. No selection criteria were applied to identify these 74 ALS individuals. Serial sampling for each patient was continued until the last clinic attendance when possible, although most of the follow-up samples were obtained within 15 months from baseline sampling, with an average follow-up period of 12.2 ± 1 months (mean ± SEM; max = 39, min = 1.1; 25% = 4.1 months; 75% = 17.9 months). For the definition of symptoms onset, clinical features suggestive of ALS, including weakness and dysarthria, were identified through interviews and further details obtained from medical records. The study clinimetrics are summarised in the onlineS1 and defined in the results section.

### Fasciculation anxiety syndrome in clinicians [^114uWcvr]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The goal of this study is to define the clinical features, pathogenesis and key investigation findings of fasciculation anxiety syndrome in clinicians (FASICS). Twenty consecutive clinicians presenting with fasciculations were prospectively assessed with serial clinical and neurophysiological evaluations. Clinicians with fasciculations formed three groups: 70% of clinicians experienced symptomatic fasciculations and anxiety about the possibility of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), termed FASICS; a further 15% of clinicians experienced fasciculations associated with cramps and consistent with cramp-fasciculation syndrome (CFS). The final 15% of clinicians presented with fasciculations associated with sensory symptoms or muscle weakness and were diagnosed with neuropathy (10%) and ALS (5%). In FASICS, fasciculations most often involved the lower limbs, without evidence of muscle weakness on clinical examination. Exercise, stress, fatigue and caffeine consumption were identified as common exacerbating factors. Neurophysiological studies confirmed normal nerve conduction studies and the presence of simple fasciculations, without acute denervation or neurogenic motor unit changes. Antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels were assayed in each clinician and were not detected, and systemic autoantibodies were detected only in clinicians with features of CFS. FASICS is a disorder common among physicians presenting for evaluation of fasciculations. The present study delineates the diagnostic features of FASICS and contrasts the clinical presentation with other causes of fasciculations in clinicians.

### The clinical spectrum of isolated peripheral motor dysfunction [^112dn5jm]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Isolated peripheral motor dysfunction due to lower motor neuron or peripheral nerve disorders presents an interesting challenge to clinicians because of the diverse differential diagnosis with a broad range of prognoses.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of adults who presented over 12 years with muscle weakness, atrophy, or fasciculations, but without hyperreflexia or sensory involvement.

Results

In 119 patients, 52% had a motor neuron disease (MND), 13% had immune neuropathies, 11% had genetic neuronopathies, 10% had residual or post-polio syndrome, 5% had benign fasciculation, 1% had an infectious etiology, and 8% were not given a final diagnosis. Only MND patients had cognitive dysfunction or frontal release signs. Bulbar and respiratory symptoms virtually excluded consideration of immune neuropathy.

Conclusions

Only half of the patients were diagnosed with MND. A significant minority have treatable conditions. Cognitive involvement, frontal release signs, and bulbar or respiratory symptoms are strongly suggestive of MND.

### Detection of fasciculations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: the optimal ultrasound scan time [^1147GQQL]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

This study seeks to elucidate the optimal scan time to detect fasciculations by using ultrasound in the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Methods

The intervals between fasciculations were recorded from tongue, abdominal, and limb muscles in ALS patients, incorporating assessment of the cumulative probability of 2 fasciculations occurring.

Results

From prospective studies of 228 muscles from 19 ALS patients, fasciculations were detectable in 68% of patients. The longest interfasciculation interval recorded was 81.4 s in the hand muscle. The cumulative probability of 2 fasciculations occurring was calculated as ≥ 0.9 in all muscles during a period of 60 s.

Discussion

A definition of 2 or more fasciculations occurring during a scan time of 60 s reliably allowed detection of fasciculations in ALS. Muscle Nerve, 2017.

### Spontaneous activity in electromyography may differentiate certain benign lower motor neuron disease forms from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^114HHtra]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

There is limited data on electromyography (EMG) findings in other motor neuron disorders than amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We assessed whether the distribution of active denervation detected by EMG, i.e. fibrillations and fasciculations, differs between ALS and slowly progressive motor neuron disorders. We compared the initial EMG findings of 43 clinically confirmed, consecutive ALS patients with those of 41 genetically confirmed Late-onset Spinal Motor Neuronopathy and 14 Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy patients. Spontaneous activity was more frequently detected in the first dorsal interosseus and deltoid muscles of ALS patients than in patients with the slowly progressive motor neuron diseases. The most important observation was that absent fibrillations in the first dorsal interosseus muscle identified the benign forms with sensitivities of 66%-77% and a specificity of 93%. The distribution of active denervation may help to separate ALS from mimicking disorders at an early stage.

### Isaacs syndrome: a review [^113JzAyo]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Isaacs syndrome is a peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (PNH) syndrome that presents as continuous motor activity. Clinical findings include cramps, fasciculations, and myokymia. Electrodiagnosis plays a key role in diagnosis by demonstrating after-discharges on nerve conduction studies, and fasciculation potentials, myokymic discharges, neuromyotonic discharges, and other types of abnormal spontaneous activity on needle examination. Etiopathogenesis involves the interaction of genetic, autoimmune, and paraneoplastic factors, which requires a broad-ranging evaluation for underlying causes. Initial treatment is symptomatic, but immune therapy is often needed and can be effective. The purpose of this review is to describe the syndrome and its pathogenesis, assist the reader in evaluating patients with suspected Isaacs syndrome and distinguishing it from other disorders of PNH, and suggest an approach to management, including both symptomatic and immunomodulating therapy.

### Mimics and chameleons in motor neurone disease [^114XRQv7]. Practical Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The progression of motor neurone disease (MND) is currently irreversible, and the grave implications of diagnosis naturally fuels concern among neurologists over missing a potential mimic disorder. There is no diagnostic test for MND but in reality there are few plausible mimics in routine clinical practice. In the presence of a progressive pure motor disorder, signs such as florid fasciculations, bilateral tongue wasting, the 'split hand', head drop, emotionality, and cognitive or behavioural impairment carry high positive predictive value. MND is clinically heterogeneous, however, with some important chameleon-like presentations and considerable variation in clinical course. Lack of confidence about the scope of such variation, or an approach to diagnosis emphasising investigations over clinical common sense, has the potential to exacerbate diagnostic delay in MND and impede timely planning of the care which is essential to maximising quality of life.

### Different patterns of fasciculation in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a muscle ultrasonographic study [^1157tKi7]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

The present study revealed that fasciculations are frequently found not only in ALS but also in SBMA. However, the fasciculation pattern differed: in ALS, fasciculations are generally intense overall, whereas in SBMA, fasciculations are widespread, including the tongue and distal muscles. These findings suggest that the different patterns of fasciculation in SBMA and ALS may be useful for differential diagnosis.

### Different patterns of fasciculation in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a muscle ultrasonographic study [^113aAikV]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Pathophysiology of fasciculation in SBMA

While the origin of fasciculation is unknown, fasciculations in ALS are thought to be derived from the hyperexcitation of the motor cortex and axons. In SBMA, increased motor axonal excitability has been reported, similar to ALS. In the present study, extensive fasciculations similar to those in ALS were observed in SBMA, suggesting that increased axonal excitability in SBMA may be the underlying cause. In addition, SBMA showed extensive fasciculations similar to ALS, although the fasciculation intensity was slightly lower than that in ALS. Several studies have shown that muscles can be a primary target of polyQ-AR toxicity in SBMA. The difference in fasciculation intensity may be attributed to the lack of involvement of cortical motor neurons in SBMAor to direct muscle damage. At present, the extent of interplay between central and lower motor neuron excitability and fasciculations remains unresolved.SBMA is a pure lower motor neuron disorder, and the results of our study support that fasciculation occurs only in lower motor neuron disorders. Contrary to the reason why fasciculations in the tongue and distal limbs were frequent in SBMA, which remains unknown, such different mechanisms may contribute to differences in distribution patterns.

Overall findings of the present study

The overall findings of our present study may support clinical practice. Previous ultrasonographic studies also analysed fasciculations in ALS patients but did not focus on SBMA patients. The present study has revealed different patterns of fasciculation distribution and intensity between SBMA and ALS. As previously mentioned, the presence of fasciculations is a very important sign for SBMA diagnosis. Additionally, ultrasonography is a non-invasive and convenient tool to assess fasciculations, and the combination of needle EMG with ultrasonography improves the diagnostic sensitivity. As such, the characteristics of the fasciculation distribution are potentially important for SBMA diagnosis. In clinical practice, the absence of tongue muscle fasciculations on ultrasound may serve as strong evidence for excluding SBMA from the diagnosis. However, SBMA and ALS can currently be differentiated through clinical history and findings, EMG and genetic testing. Therefore, ultrasound should not be considered a replacement for existing diagnostic methods but may serve as a complementary tool, particularly in cases where clinical and electrophysiological findings are inconclusive.

### Atypical fibrillation and fasciculation potentials: an exercise in waveform identification and analysis [^112BENfc]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Medium credibility.

No consensus criteria exist for recording and analyzing waveforms in clinical electromyography (EMG). There have been significant technical improvements in recent decades that are under-used in both routine practice and research. In current practice, disciplined techniques in acquisition and analysis of signals are required to appropriately define them. As an example, we describe such an exercise in acquisition and analysis. During a routine study, atypical spontaneous activity was encountered. High-quality digital recordings were stored for off-line analysis. These revealed waveforms that could be isolated and quantitatively defined using basic instrumentation available on most modern EMG systems: "slow" firing fibrillation potentials and a repeating fasciculation potential. Subjective analysis alone could not have identified them. To improve accuracy in identification and understanding of these waveforms, we propose criteria for data collection and signal analysis. This is critical for quality in routine practice, education, and proper reporting of electrophysiological signals.

### Prevalence of fascicular hyperintensities in peripheral nerves of healthy individuals with regard to cerebral white matter lesions [^114bYr18]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Detection and pattern analysis of fascicular nerve hyperintensities in the T2-weighted image are the backbone of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) as they may represent lesions of various etiologies. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of fascicular nerve hyperintensities in healthy individuals with regard to a potential association with age or cerebral white matter lesions.

Methods

Sixty volunteers without peripheral nerve diseases between the age of 20 and 80 underwent MRN (high-resolution T2-weighted) of upper (median, ulnar, radial) and lower (sciatic, tibial) extremity nerves and a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence of the brain. Presence of peripheral nerve hyperintensities and degree of cerebral white matter lesions were independently rated by two blinded readers and related to each other and to age. T test with Welch's correction was used for group comparisons. Spearman's correlation coefficients were reported for correlation analyses.

Results

MR neurography revealed fascicular hyperintensities in 10 of 60 subjects (16.7%). Most frequently, they occurred in the sciatic nerve (8/60 subjects, 13.3%), less frequently in the tibial nerve at the lower leg and the median, ulnar, and radial nerves at the upper arm (1.7–5.0%). Mean age of subjects with nerve hyperintensities was higher than that of those without (60.6 years vs. 48.0 years, p = 0.038). There was only a weak correlation of nerve lesions with age and with cerebral white matter lesions, respectively.

Conclusion

Fascicular nerve hyperintensities may occur in healthy individuals and should therefore always be regarded in conjunction with the clinical context.

Key Points

- MR neurography may reveal fascicular hyperintensities in peripheral nerves of healthy individuals. Fascicular hyperintensities occur predominantly in the sciatic nerve and older individuals.
- Therefore, fascicular hyperintensities should only be interpreted as clearly pathologic in conjunction with the clinical context.

### Cramp-fasciculation syndrome associated with monofocal motor neuropathy [^114JpH44]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cramp-fasciculation syndrome is a peripheral nerve hyperexcitability disorder, which could be caused by inflammatory neuropathy.

Case Report

We describe a 51-year-old woman who presented with a 4- to 5-year history of fasciculations and painful cramping of the right thenar eminence.

Results

Electrophysiological studies showed motor conduction block in the right median nerve between the axilla and the elbow with fasciculation potentials and cramp discharges on electromyography in the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle. High titers of serum anti-GM1 immunoglobulin M antibodies were detected.

Conclusions

Monofocal motor neuropathy of the right median nerve was diagnosed. Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment led to significant improvement of symptoms and signs. Although fasciculations and cramps have been reported in multifocal motor neuropathy and are considered supporting criteria for the diagnosis, the occurrence of cramp-fasciculation syndrome as the presenting feature and predominant manifestation in monofocal motor neuropathy, a variant of multifocal motor neuropathy, is unique.

### Assessment: symptomatic treatment for muscle cramps (an evidence-based review): report of the therapeutics and technology assessment subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^1127dHHe]. Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Muscle cramps — definition, prevalence, and associated conditions are summarized as follows: Muscle cramps are involuntary, generally painful contractions of a muscle or muscle group. A cross-sectional prevalence study of 365 outpatients aged 65 or older in the United Kingdom reports that 50% of outpatients report frequent cramps, and another review of 515 elderly veterans reports a similar prevalence of 56%, with half having cramps occurring at least once per week. When the motor system is stressed, either by a neuromuscular disease or by a physiologic stress such as dehydration or excessive exercise, cramps become more frequent, and neuropathic conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), peripheral neuropathies, and cramp-fasciculation syndrome are commonly associated. In addition to neurologic conditions, multiple medical conditions such as hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypothyroidism, and renal or liver dysfunction may be the cause, and cramps are also frequent during the last trimester of pregnancy and in athletes such as marathon runners. When no underlying cause of recurrent muscle cramps can be identified, they are referred to as idiopathic muscle cramps, which are usually most prominent in the lower leg and foot muscles and more evident at night.

### Ultrasound-guided botulinum toxin injection for the treatment of teres major fasciculations [^1173PRzK]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This case study presents a 31-yr-old male weightlifter without known neuromuscular disease who presented with 5 wks of atraumatic, constant fasciculations of his right teres major muscle without recent injury. Electromyography identified fasciculation potentials within the teres major and pronator teres, suggesting an acute C6 radiculopathy, although a cervical magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated no significant neuroforaminal stenosis. Trigger point injections and multiple medications failed to stop the fasciculations. Under electromyography and ultrasound guidance, he was focally injected with botulinum toxin to the teres major 10 wks from initial onset with subsequent complete resolution of the symptoms and no side effects.

### Role of EMG evaluation in muscle hyperactivity syndromes [^113ZjfBf]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Muscle hyperactivity can be a clinical feature on its own or, more commonly, an observation on electromyography (EMG) examinations. Whatever manifestation it takes, muscle hyperactivity always means enhanced excitability of muscle, axons or neurons. Clinical findings may be variable, ranging from fasciculations to muscle cramps. Even though clinical examination may lead in most instances to suggest the diagnosis of the underlying disease, EMG studies are necessary to identify the type of abnormal discharges and suggest the site of their suspected origin. Although in clinical studies, the action potential showing abnormal muscle hyperactivity is practically always recorded from muscle fibers, the site in which the impulse has arisen will determine its shape and firing patterns. In this review, we describe the EMG characteristics observed in syndromes featuring muscle hyperactivity and the pathophysiology underlying the abnormal firing of muscle fibers.

### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a clinical review [^112yB84w]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical features

Clinical presentation

The hallmark of ALS is progressive muscle weakness, accompanied by muscle atrophy, fasciculations, muscle cramps and slowness of movements with muscle stiffness. The onset of muscle weakness in ALS is usually focal and typically spreads to adjacent body regions. This pattern is compatible with spreading of disease pathology within the motor system, with neuroanatomic propagation within the spinal cord segments and the motor cortex [52].

The disease usually presents with unilateral distal muscle weakness and atrophy in upper or lower limb muscles (spinal ALS, roughly in two‐thirds of patients) or in bulbar muscles (bulbar ALS, in about one‐third of patients). Upper limb onset is most commonly in the dominant hand [53], with thenar muscles being more affected than hypothenar muscles (which is referred to as the split‐hand syndrome) [54], with early involvement of the first interosseous muscle and finger extensors more affected than finger flexors [55]. In the lower limb the anterior tibial muscle is typically affected earlier in the disease course than the gastrocnemius muscle, the hamstrings before the quadriceps muscles [56].

Bulbar onset ALS presents most commonly with dysarthria or dysphagia, less commonly with dysphonia, or reduced mouth closure or chewing problems. Axial muscle weakness with head drop and problems with posture are common in later stages of the disease, but rarely can be the presenting symptom. In about one‐third of patients, there can be bouts of uncontrolled laughing or crying (referred to as a pseudobulbar affect) [57].

In some patients, the muscle weakness is preceded by a period in which fasciculations, muscle cramps or mild weight loss has been noted.

On neurological examination, a combination of signs of UMN and LMN involvement is found in patients with classic ALS. Signs of LMN involvement include muscle weakness, atrophy, fasciculations and reduced muscle tone. Signs of UMN involvement to look for include hyperreflexia (or retained reflexes in atrophic muscles), increased muscle tone (especially in upper limb flexors and lower limb extensors) and slowness of movements (e.g. of tongue movement).

### Different patterns of fasciculation in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a muscle ultrasonographic study [^116uqjSN]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Conversely, fasciculation intensity was significantly higher in the limbs and trunk in ALS, compared with SBMA patients. A previous study showed that ALS compared with non-ALS patients exhibited a significantly higher intensity of fasciculations, such as multifocal motor neuropathy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth and cervical spondylopathy or lumbar spondylopathy. Fasciculation in ALS, which is thought to originate from upper and lower motor neurons, is associated with hyperexcitation of the motor cortex and axons. As described later, while the combination of such hyperexcitation may contribute to hyperintense fasciculations in ALS, fasciculations in SBMA originated from only lower motor neurons. This may be one of the underlying causes of the different intensity of fasciculations in ALS compared with SBMA. Similarly, figures1 2 show that, except for the ADM and TA muscles, muscles with a higher detection rate of fasciculations also tend to exhibit greater fasciculation intensity. While the underlying factors are unclear, it is possible that areas with a higher incidence of fasciculations may have physiological or disease-specific pathophysiological characteristics. In these regions, multiple mechanisms, such as the formation of larger motor units due to denervation and reinnervation changes, neural excitability, ion channel abnormalities and disease progression, could contribute to the increased intensity of fasciculations. Moreover, the present study developed the modified fasciculation ultrasound score and revealed a significant difference, indicating that fasciculation intensity is higher in ALS than in SBMA. However, this does not necessarily indicate that ALS patients universally exhibit higher fasciculation intensity, as the scoring method accounts for variations in fasciculation intensity across different muscle groups, such as the tongue and TA muscles. This modified fasciculation ultrasound score demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity, making it a useful tool for distinguishing ALS from SBMA. On the other hand, no significant difference in fasciculation ultrasound scoreswas observed between SBMA and ALS, which complicates differentiation. Since both SBMA and ALS exhibit common widespread fasciculations, it may be necessary to focus on the intensity of fasciculations in order to differentiate these two diseases. To clarify, the original fasciculation ultrasound scoresare useful to distinguish ALS from ALS mimics, such as cervical spondylosis, progressive supranuclear palsy, spinal dural arteriovenous fistula, myasthenia gravis, posterior interosseous nerve palsy, multifocal motor neuropathy and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. Separately, the modified fasciculation ultrasound score is useful to distinguish SBMA from ALS. These findings suggest that the distinct patterns of fasciculation in SBMA and ALS may support our diagnostic process.

### Accuracy of repetitive nerve stimulation for diagnosis of the cramp-fasciculation syndrome [^111dYrcf]. Muscle & Nerve (2007). Low credibility.

The goal of this retrospective cohort study was to test the hypothesis that the cramp-fasciculation syndrome (CFS) represents a disorder of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability and to evaluate the accuracy of repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) for its diagnosis. A consecutive series of 108 patients were evaluated with posterior tibial RNS at 1, 2, and 5 HZ. Abnormal peripheral nerve excitability was defined by the presence of afterdischarges, cramp potentials, or continuous motor unit activity. RNS demonstrated abnormal nerve hyperexcitability in 29 of 36 subjects (81%) with CFS, defined operationally by the presence of both muscle cramps and fasciculations. Based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, tibial RNS correctly classified the presence or absence of CFS in 75% of subjects. These results suggest that CFS represents a form of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability and, furthermore, that RNS is a clinically useful test for CFS.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:

Risk of Improper Use of Pyridostigmine Bromide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Individuals at Increased Risk of Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Use in Bromide-Sensitive Individuals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

Serious Adverse Reactions, Such as Difficulty Breathing, Severe Dizziness, Loss of Consciousness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The adverse reactions to pyridostigmine bromide are typically of two varieties: muscarinic and nicotinic. Muscarinic adverse reactions include abdominal cramps, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, emesis, increased peristalsis, nausea, hypersalivation, urinary incontinence, increased bronchial secretion, diaphoresis, miosis, and lacrimation. Nicotinic adverse reactions are comprised chiefly of muscle cramps, fasciculations, and weakness.

In a controlled study of 90 healthy volunteers comparing immediate-release pyridostigmine bromide 30 mg every 8 hours, which provides exposures comparable to pyridostigmine bromide 105 mg extended-release tablets once daily, to placebo for 21 days, the adverse reactions that were reported in 2% or more of subjects is included in Table 1. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 3%) are diarrhea, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, and twitch.

### Misdiagnosis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^1136GqLx]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can mimic those of compressive neuropathies, such as carpal and cubital tunnel syndromes, especially early in a patient's clinical course. We surveyed members of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand and found that 11% of active and retired members have performed nerve decompression surgeries on patients later diagnosed with ALS. Hand surgeons are commonly the first providers to evaluate patients with undiagnosed ALS. As such, it is important to be aware of the history, signs, and symptoms of ALS to provide an accurate diagnosis and prevent unnecessary morbidities, such as nerve decompression surgery, which invariably results in poor outcomes. The major "red flag" symptoms warranting further work-up include weakness without sensory symptoms, profound weakness and atrophy in multiple nerve distributions, progressively bilateral and global symptoms, presence of bulbar symptoms (such as tongue fasciculations and speech/swallowing difficulties), and, if surgery is performed, failure to improve. If any of these red flags are present, we recommend neurodiagnostic testing and prompt referral to a neurologist for further work-up and treatment.

### Prevalence of denervation in paraspinal and foot intrinsic musculature [^112wqoMB]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The primary purpose of this investigation was to determine the prevalence of abnormal spontaneous activity (positive sharp waves (PSWs) and fibrillation potentials (FPs)) in selected lumbosacral paraspinal and foot intrinsic muscles in an asymptomatic healthy population.

Design

This was a prospective assessment of 50 individuals without history or physical findings suggestive of peripheral neuromuscular disease whereby a monopolar needle electrode was located in the unilateral L4 and L5 paraspinal as well as abductor hallucis and extensor digitorum brevis muscles. These muscles were extensively evaluated for the presence of PSWs, FPs, and fasciculation potentials.

Results

Ten subjects per decade from 20–59 yr and ten subjects from 60–80 yr comprised the 50 participants (28 women), resulting in a mean age of 45 ± 15.9 (range, 20–76) yr. A single individual (prevalence, 2%) demonstrated fibrillation potentials in the extensor digitorum brevis, and FPs and PSWs were detected in two subjects' (4% prevalence) L4/L5 paraspinal muscles. Ninety-four percent of the subjects had fasciculation potentials in the abductor hallucis, whereas 60% had these waveforms in the extensor digitorum brevis. Only 6% of subjects had fasciculation potentials in the L4 but not L5 paraspinal muscles. All subjects demonstrated both prototypical and "atypical" appearing endplate spikes in all of the muscles examined.

Conclusions

We failed to confirm the previously reported prevalence of FPs and PSWs in both the paraspinal and foot intrinsic musculature. Atypical appearing endplate spikes, however, display configurations similar to FPs and PSWs and were present in all subjects. Failure to pay close attention to the discharge rate and rhythm of endplate spikes can lead to misinterpreting these waveforms as FPs and PSWs. It is likely that the previously reported high prevalence of spontaneous activity in healthy persons resulted from not fully appreciating the similarity between innervated and denervated spontaneous single muscle fiber discharge configurations.

### Corticomotoneuronal function and hyperexcitability in acquired neuromyotonia [^111m7HQR]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnostic utility of threshold tracking TMS

The diagnosis of acquired neuromyotonia relies on the presence of clinical symptoms combined with neurophysiological findings of doublet, triplet or multiplet ('myokymic') motor unit discharges and fasciculations (Hart et al.). Although the clinical features of acquired neuromyotonia and ALS may be different, with patients with acquired neuromyotonia exhibiting a faster fasciculation frequency (Hart et al.), in certain clinical scenarios acquired neuromyotonia may be misdiagnosed as ALS. This may be the case when cramps and fasciculations are accompanied by clinical weakness, as may occur when acquired neuromyotonia is associated with a motor polyneuropathy (Newsom-Davis; Hart et al.). Moreover, anti-VGKC antibodies > 100 pM were reported in up to 5% of individuals > 50 years (Vincent et al.), and recently in 30% of patients with ALS (Nwosu et al.), although the latter study did not state the cut-off for normal values recommended by the laboratory involved.

In addition, fasciculations may be the sole presenting feature of ALS (Gubbay et al.), developing prior to fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves and chronic neurogenic changes (de Carvalho et al; de Carvalho and Swash). Such presentations may result in misdiagnosis and ultimately a delay in the institution of appropriate management. The contrasting finding of cortical excitability suggests that the threshold tracking TMS technique may be of diagnostic utility in differentiating acquired neuromyotonia from ALS, particularly in the early disease stages.

### Different patterns of fasciculation in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a muscle ultrasonographic study [^114DcWBa]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Background

Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, also known as Kennedy disease) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are two major motor neuron diseases. SBMA is an X-linked monogenic disorder caused by an abnormally expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene, characterised by slowly progressive proximal limb muscle weakness, bulbar involvement, orofacial fasciculation, dysarthria, hand tremor and dysphagia. In contrast, ALS is a rapidly progressive and fatal disorder characterised by relentless impairment of motor function following the degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons. Occasionally, ALS and SBMA show similar symptoms, and thereby, distinguishing these two disorders is of paramount interest.

Recently, the usefulness of ultrasonography for neuromuscular disorders has been emphasised, and ultrasonography has also been shown to be a useful tool for ALS to detect fasciculations, with increased diagnostic sensitivity of ALS. A previous study reported that widespread and prominent fasciculations are characteristic features in ALS. Another study found that ALS patients compared with non-ALS patients exhibited higher intensity of fasciculations, such as multifocal motor neuropathy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth and cervical and lumbar spondylopathy; moreover, the distribution pattern of fasciculations differed between ALS and non-ALS patients. Conversely, perioral fasciculation is the most distinguishing clinical finding in SBMA, differentiating SBMA from other motor neuron diseases. Furthermore, widespread fasciculation potentials are also known to be observed in SBMA, using needle electromyography (EMG). However, the detailed distribution and characteristics of fasciculations throughout the body in SBMA are not fully understood.

As such, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the characteristics of fasciculations in SBMA patients and the differences in their distribution between SBMA and ALS patients using extensive muscle ultrasound examination. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, since SBMA and ALS occasionally present with similar symptoms, the goal was to develop a clinically applicable differential diagnostic prediction model. The findings of the present study may be useful not only for the diagnosis in SBMA but also for investigating the fasciculation mechanism in motor neuron disease.

The examination

There is great wasting of the muscles of the upper and lower limbs and trunks, especially the small muscles of the hands. Fibrillary contraction may be observed in the limbs and trunk. Elbow tap exaggerated on left side, and also on right, but much less marked. Knee-jerk exaggerated on both sides.

The physical signature of 'classical' MND is captured once again, but importantly only in the context of a prior history of progressive weakness. The core features here are:
Upper motor neurone (UMN) and lower motor neurone (LMN) signs in the same territory
Florid fasciculations.

There are a handful of key signs on examination that, in the presence of a history of progressive weakness in someone aged over 50 years, should immediately prompt consideration of the diagnosis of MND (table 1). However, the great challenge of MND is that it is evidently a syndrome, and the relative degree of UMN and LMN predominance is highly variable and influences prognosis. At least 10% survive into a second decade, over-represented by those with either 'pure' LMN or UMN involvement. By definition, classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) displays evidence of both UMN and LMN involvement, accounting for 85% of cases of MND, so that the terms are largely synonymous. Furthermore, many of those with apparent LMN-only disease, sometimes termed progressive muscular atrophy, have subclinical evidence of UMN pathology, so the distinction is not particularly meaningful. The very rare (< 2%) patients with a pure UMN syndrome, termed primary lateral sclerosis, are characterised by slow progression, but may be difficult to distinguish from the so-called UMN-predominant forms of ALS(see below). Within this taxonomy, the site of symptom onset also varies. There is also a clear clinicopathological overlap between MND and frontotemporal dementia. Although most cases of MND show only mild or no cognitive impairment, up to 15% may present with frank frontotemporal dementia, which is then associated with more rapidly progressive motor involvement.

### Proposed research criteria for mild motor impairment as a prodromal syndrome in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^116zFyAG]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Building on early allusions in the literature, as well as our initial description of the phenomenology of MMI as a prodromal state preceding phenoconversion to clinically manifest ALS, we have now developed a set of proposed formal criteria to operationally define MMI. Except for neck flexion/extension, we excluded weakness from the definition of MMI because progressive weakness (or impaired motor function), when combined with signs of UMN and LMN dysfunction, is the foundational element of ALS diagnostic criteria. Weakness also serves as a pragmatic and relatively hard boundary between a prodromal state and clinically manifest disease.

Several aspects of these criteria for MMI are worth highlighting. First, weakness aside, these criteria are agnostic to subjectively reported symptoms such as muscle cramps, fasciculations, and fatigue. Second, the proposed criteria are based on physical examination and EMG findings that reflect the presence of UMN or LMN dysfunction. UMN and LMN dysfunction may occur in isolation or together, and with a pattern that may be focal or multifocal. While in most instances of MMI multiple criteria were met, each criterion alone also identifies some instances that are not captured by any other criteria (eTable 2), underscoring the value of each criterion. Moreover, we recognize the potential need in the future to refine these criteria (e.g. removing, merging, or adding), as our understanding of MMI evolves. Third, criteria MMI-a–MMI-g are intended to identify different features or characteristics of MMI, rather than mutually exclusive "subtypes" of MMI. Fourth, exclusive reliance on physical examination, without EMG, meaningfully diminishes our ability to detect MMI and the strength of the association between MMI and the timing of phenoconversion. This observation supports including EMG in the definition of MMI as proposed and underscores the importance of EMG in the context of a prevention trial, for example, where it would be critical to enroll (and randomize) those with the highest short-term risk of phenoconversion. Fourth, we recognize that these criteria for MMI do not define a syndrome that is specific to ALS; rather, they might also detect the emergence of other pathologies that affect the motor neuron system. The development of biomarkers (e.g. TDP-43) that reflect the underlying pathology of ALS, will help differentiate MMI that is prodromal to ALS from MMI that is not and enable us to explore the association between MMI (as a clinical syndrome) and the underlying biology that is driving motor neuron loss. In this study, the analogy to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Alzheimer disease (AD) is informative; only MCI with biomarker evidence of amyloid and tau pathology are considered prodromal to AD. Of note, the specificity of a "diagnosis" of MMI might be increased by requiring, for example, that a minimum of 2 individual MMI criteria be met, but at the cost of a significant reduction in sensitivity (eTable 2). We, therefore, favor our proposed definition of MMI (i.e. requiring that at least 1 MMI criterion be met), which is strongly associated with time to phenoconversion. Finally, we observed MMI, with similar frequency, across the full range of genotypes that we have studied, supporting our hypothesis that MMI is not unique to a specific genetic or biological (e.g. TDP-43 or not) form of ALS. Rather, it is likely a feature of ALS in general, irrespective of underlying cause(s) or contributor(s) to the development of disease — for example, whether disease etiology is multistep, whether there is a polygenic contribution to ALS risk, or whether there is variable penetrance of individual pathogenic variants.

### Proposed modification to data analysis for statistical motor unit number estimate [^1171N2Yi]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) is an important electrophysiological technique for quantitative measurement of motor neuron loss. Although commonly used, there is no consensus concerning the optimal procedure for statistical MUNE, particularly regarding several operator-dependent variables. To assess the variables, we analyzed 500 sequential, submaximal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) responses at three or four stimulus intensities in 10 controls and 10 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In both controls and ALS patients, we found that posttest filtering data based on 20% or 25% windows or 2, 2.5, or 3 SD excludes < 5% of data. Windows of 10% or 15% excluded < 5% of data in controls but not in ALS patients. Excluding data based on ± 2 SD, the coefficient of variation for final MUNE was 12% in controls and 6% in ALS patients. Group sizes of 30 or 50 and sample sizes of 300 to 500 sequential CMAP responses per run yielded the lowest coefficient of variation. We propose that statistical MUNE data should be analyzed based on excluding data > 2 SD from the mean, because this is operator independent, includes the majority of data, effectively excludes clearly outlying data, such as fasciculations or movement artifact, and has a reasonable coefficient of variation.

### All hands on deck: the multidisciplinary rehabilitation assessment and management of hand function in persons with neuromuscular disorders [^116eatXW]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease causing loss of motor neurons. In about 70% of cases, manifestations first occur in a single limb, most often distally, with approximately equal distribution between upper and lower limbs, and subsequent progressive involvement of other body regions. Persons with ALS (pwALS) display both upper motor neuron (spasticity, loss of motor speed, and precision) and lower motor neuron (fasciculations, atrophy, muscle weakness, and cramps) signs with few or no sensory changes. Many pwALS, especially with limb‐onset presentation, show a "split hand" pattern, in which the radial side of the hand, is preferentially affected compared with the muscles of the hypothenar eminence, despite sharing the same myotomes and, in the case of first dorsal interosseus and abductor digiti minimi, peripheral innervation. Reported in about 20% of pwALS by Kuwabara et al.50% in a 2021 systematic review, and even observed in up to 95% at follow‐up by some authors, this phenomenon seems to occur early in the disease course and is very rarely found in other neuromuscular diseases. Some pwALS may progressively develop bilateral, severely debilitating "flail arms"with complete upper extremity paralysis and secondary balance and mobility impairments. Whether through spasticity, loss of dexterity, or weakness, pwALS with hand involvement will demonstrate fine motor difficulties with functional implications.

2.3 Spinal muscular atrophy

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused, in about 95% of cases, by a homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene, resulting in progressive loss of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord, causing flaccid paralysis. The disease phenotype correlates with the number of SMN2 copies in one's genome, with a broad spectrum ranging from infants with symptom onset at birth or in the first weeks of life and never being able to sit, to milder adult‐onset forms. When upper limbs become involved, persons with SMA (pwSMA) usually develop earlier and more severe proximal weaknessand contractures, but eventually face issues with hand strength and range of motion (ROM), especially in cold conditions, that worsen with age and progressively impair independence. Some pwSMA also demonstrate hand joint hypermobilityand up to 59% of patients will demonstrate a fine hand tremor.

### Corticomotoneuronal function and hyperexcitability in acquired neuromyotonia [^113PQ6Yn]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

SICI

SICI has been defined as an increase in the test stimulus intensity required to track a constant target MEP of 0.2 mV. In normal controls, two peaks of SICI were evident, a smaller peak at interstimulus interval of 1 ms and a larger peak at 3 ms. SICI was significantly different between acquired neuromyotonia and ALS, reduced in the latter, and consistent with cortical hyperexcitability (Fig. 2). In addition, peak SICI at an interstimulus interval of 1 ms (acquired neuromyotonia 8.3 ± 1.5%; controls 7.5 ± 0.8%; ALS, 1.7 ± 0.7%, F = 16.1, P < 0.001; Fig. 3 A) and at interstimulus interval 3 ms (acquired neuromyotonia 17.1 ± 2.8%; controls 16.1 ± 1.2%; ALS 5.4 ± 1.2%, F = 15.4 P < 0.001; Fig. 3 B) were significantly different. In further comparisons to acquired neuromyotonia, limb-onset ALS patients, who clinically exhibited more frequent fasciculations than bulbar-onset ALS patients, disclosed significantly reduced SICI (4.3 ± 1.4%, P < 0.01).

### Update on recent advances in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^114MokwZ]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic challenges

Clinical examination remains the cornerstone of ALS diagnosis. The diagnosis of ALS has been traditionally categorized by the El Escorial criteria into various levels of certainty depending on the presence and progressive spread of UMN and LMN signs. Subsequently, the Awaji criteria proposed fasciculations as a clinical and electrophysiologic sign of LMN involvement, aiming at increasing overall diagnostic sensitivity. However, El Escorial and Awaji criteria are hampered by ALS heterogeneity and do not capture the full disease spectrum. In addition, a significant proportion of ALS patients may never attain the criteria for clinically definite ALS. In order to overcome these limitations, the Gold Coast criteria have been recently proposed classifying patients as having or not having ALS, streamlining diagnostic certainty and eliminating confusion from the El Escorial terminology. However, cognitive and behavioral impairment are not included in these criteria.

Although an ALS diagnosis is generally fairly simple, the false-positive rate has been estimated to be as high as eight to 10%, while the false-negative rate approaches 45%. Several disorders, often referred to as ALS mimics, may primarily affect the motor system, simulating ALS. These include Sandhoff disease, adult polyglucosan body disease, Hirayama disease, spinal dural defects associated with CSF leaks and neurogenic calf amyotrophy with CK elevation by entrapment radiculopathy. In selected cases, motor nerve biopsy may be useful for an early differential diagnosis of patients presenting with an atypical LMN syndrome, while motor‑evoked potentials may prove essential in order to detect subclinical UMN involvement in LMN phenotype. Most importantly, differentiation between MND, in particular progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) may be extremely challenging. Although MMN has distinctive neurophysiological features and is often associated with anti-GM1 antibodies, a recent large case–control study showed that both PMA and MMN, but not ALS and PLS, are associated with an IgM monoclonal gammopathy (8% and 7%, respectively), suggesting that a subset of patients presenting with PMA share pathogenic mechanisms with MMN.

Paraneoplastic neuromyotonia (Isaacs syndrome) — pathophysiology and clinical features include that it is associated with antibodies against the voltage-gated potassium channel, leading to an increased release of acetylcholine and prolonged muscle fiber action potential; electromyography shows fibrillation, fasciculation, and high frequency of discharge, which are abolished by curariform anticholinergic drugs but not by sleep induction or general anesthesia. Symptoms are primarily muscle cramping, weakness, and stiffness, and the syndrome usually is caused by lung cancer and thymoma.

### The motor unit and electromyography – the legacy of derek denny-Brown [^116itTME]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2001). Low credibility.

With the development of the concept of the motor unit and new recording instruments, single motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) were recorded in 1929 in man by Adrian and Bronk and in the experimental animal by Denny-Brown. Studies of MUAPs in patients with neuromuscular disease followed, and in 1938, Denny-Brown and Pennybacker laid the foundation for clinical electromyography (EMG). Action potentials of single contracting or spontaneously firing motor units, termed fasciculations, were recorded and separated from the action potentials of single denervated muscle fibers, termed fibrillations. Thus, it was possible to interpret muscle twitching and cramping by EMG and separate neurogenic from myopathic diseases. Since then, EMG and neuromuscular disease have expanded greatly providing greater diagnostic capability and therapeutic success.

### Clinical utility of neurophysiologic classification (and declassification) of myoclonus [^116gFC2y]. Movement Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Myoclonus is a hyperkinetic movement classification characterized by brief, involuntary, jerk‐like quality. Thorough history and examination cannot always distinguish myoclonus from imitators, including tremor, dystonia, fasciculations, and functional neurologic disorder (FND) jerks. Once identified, the breadth of potential etiologies for myoclonusprovokes a diagnostic odyssey, which may conclude with "idiopathic", leaving uncertainty regarding optimal treatment.

Movement clinical neurophysiology (mCNP) studies have been essential in research investigations of myoclonus physiology, and are available in some tertiary centers to evaluate suspected myoclonus and other abnormal movements. mCNP utilizes surface electromyography (EMG), accelerometers, electroencephalography (EEG), and other tools to measure movements and corresponding muscle and neurologic activities.mCNP can definitively identify myoclonus and differentiate its neurophysiologic origin, including cortical, cortical–subcortical, subcortical/nonsegmental, segmental, and peripheral (Table Data S1). Myoclonus neurophysiologic subtyping based on specific mCNP findings has been validated in combination with expert clinician diagnosis, and specialized tests such as EEG–EMG back‐averaging have high specificity. Neurophysiologic subtyping can narrow the diagnostic search to associated etiologiesand can guide medication choices regardless of etiology.

Despite providing these clinical insights, mCNP availability is limited. Reasons include lack of specialized training, equipment, and reimbursement. A majority of movement specialists perceive mCNP as clinically valuable and cost beneficial, and prior research has confirmed that mCNP frequently results in changes in hyperkinetic movement classification, but there has been limited demonstration of how this impacts real‐world clinical management, particularly for myoclonus subtyping. This study aimed to investigate the impact of mCNP on diagnosis and treatment decisions using retrospective patient data.

### Electrodiagnostic abnormalities associated with fibromyalgia [^113Kpj7g]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Another type of pathological activity that may be found in relaxed muscles during needle EMG is fasciculation potentials. These fasciculation potentials may be a sign of irritation of the axons but not a sign of denervation, as the axons are not interrupted. They can be seen in radiculopathies due to compression causing irritation without interruption of the axons. We found fasciculation potentials in the foot muscles in 41% of PFM.

It can be argued that the S2-innervated plantar foot muscles show more EMG abnormalities because foot muscles are prone to normal "wear and tear" from walking and standing. However, abnormalities should be symmetrical in both feet. In our patients, EMG abnormalities in the intrinsic foot muscles were more pronounced in one foot compared to the other in 10 (60%) of PFM, suggesting a more proximal pathology.

Because of the above relative difficulties with the interpretation of needle EMG, it is a prerequisite that the electrophysiologist is experienced in EMG of sacral nerve root myotomes, as was the case in our study.

In our retrospective study, in the S2-innervated intrinsic foot muscles, irritation of the nerve roots was detected in 94% (all except one) of the PFM. This percentage of PFM showing EMG abnormalities was higher than that in the EMG study of Caro et al. However, the authors had not examined the S2 and S3-S4 myotomes.

Caro et alstudied two insertions in the lumbar myotomes: the tibialis anterior and quadriceps femoris muscle, and detected abnormal spontaneous activity in 61% of 28 patients. This percentage is much higher than in our EMG study of the leg muscles. We found abnormal spontaneous activity in only 1 (6%) patient in the L5 myotomes and in 3 (17%) patients in the S1 myotomes (total of 23%). The explanation is possibly that our study group was 11–13 years younger on average. Our oldest patient was 67 years old, whereas in the study by Caro et al, the eldest patients were 84 and 90 years old. In fact, the only patient with abnormal spontaneous activity in the L5-innervated muscle in our study was 67 years old. During aging, FM pain involves an increasing number of body areas, probably because neurogenic abnormalities emerge after years of nerve irritation.

### Spontaneous continuous motor unit single discharges [^114fko8J]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Motor unit hyperexcitability (MUH) may become manifest in needle electromyography (EMG) recordings as fasciculation potentials, myokymic discharges, or neuromyotonic discharges. Here, we describe a further MUH phenomenon.

Methods

Needle EMG recordings of the Neurology Hospital of Halle (Saale) stored in a video mode as .wav data between 2000 and 2015 were screened for spontaneous continuous motor unit single discharges (SCMUSD).

Results

We identified 23 video needle EMG waveforms from 14 patients with SCMUSD. The corresponding motor units discharged at a rate of about 6 HZ (6.3 ± 4.0; range, 1.3–18.1). The coefficient of variation of the discharge rate was 3.5% ± 1.7%. Neurogenic disorders were diagnosed in 12 patients, limb girdle muscle dystrophy was diagnosed in one patient, and stiff-limb syndrome was diagnosed in one patient.

Discussion

Spontaneous continuous motor unit single discharge, as described here, widens the spectrum of MUH phenomena.

### Diagnosing ALS: the gold coast criteria and the role of EMG [^112FZbf8]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

In September 2019, a group of international neurologists gathered in Gold Coast, Australia, to deconstruct the diagnostic process for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to try to simplify it. A proposal for revised diagnostic criteria emerged(box 1) and the initial experience of their application has been positive. The diagnosis remains fundamentally clinical, and it is timely to reflect on the adjunctive role of electromyography (EMG).

Box 1

The Gold Coast criteria for the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Progressive motor impairment documented by history or repeated clinical assessment, preceded by normal motor function,

AND

The presence of upper * and lower † motor neurone dysfunction in at least ONE body region ‡, with: upper and lower motor neurone dysfunction noted in the same body region if only one region is involved, or lower motor neurone dysfunction in at least TWO body regions,

AND

Investigations§ excluding other disease processes.

*Upper motor neurone dysfunction implies at least one of the following:

Increased deep tendon reflexes, including the presence of a reflex in a clinically weak and wasted muscle, or spread to adjacent muscles.
Presence of pathological reflexes, including Hoffman sign, Babinski sign, crossed adductor reflex, or snout reflex.
Increase in velocity-dependent tone (spasticity).
Slowed, poorly coordinated voluntary movement, not attributable to weakness of lower motor neurone origin or Parkinsonian features.

†Lower motor neurone dysfunction in a given muscle requires either:

Clinical examination evidence of muscle weakness and muscle wasting, or
EMG abnormalities that must include both: Evidence of chronic neurogenic change, defined by large motor unit potentials of increased duration and/or increased amplitude (with polyphasia), and motor unit instability regarded as supportive but not obligatory evidence, and Evidence of ongoing denervation, including fibrillation potentials or positive sharp waves, or fasciculation potentials.

### LGI1, CASPR2 and related antibodies: a molecular evolution of the phenotypes [^113eFfgC]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Neuromyotonia

My wife noticed my skin jumping while I was sleeping, soon I noticed it while awake and I would get painful muscle cramps in my thighs, legs and feet, I also noticed muscle twitching in these and other muscles. — 32-year-old man with CASPR2 antibodies and electrophysiological evidence of NMT

Another relatively specific feature of patients with CASPR2 antibodies in particular is NMT, a form of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. Patients develop cramps, stiffness, fasciculations and sometimes CNS features including depression and amnesia. Electromyography findings can include myokymia, fasciculations, as well as classic NMT with spontaneous and continuous motor unit discharges with a high intraburst frequency. Often patients have reduced motor and sensory nerve action potential amplitudes suggesting potential for loss of axons over time. Large complex motor units can be seen with reduced recruitment, characteristic of a motor axononpathy. The presence of isolated NMT, or NMT as part of Morvan's syndrome, is an important red flag in detailed screening for a thymoma. Studies of plasma exchange (PLEX) and passive antibody transfer to experimental animals provided the earliest evidence that NMT was an antibody-mediated disease, although the antigenic targets were not determined in these historical studies. The relatively lower rates of NMT in LGI1 antibody-positive patients likely relates to the greater expression of CASPR2 in the periphery. Since acquired NMT is both rare and almost exclusively exists with one or both antibodies, this feature also appears suggestive of a shared functional disease pathway. Yet, it is not known why some patients with serum NSAbs — both of CASPR2 and LGI1 specificities — and accessible peripheral nerve targets, only have CNS features, but a younger age is the only known association of a restricted peripheral nerve presentation.

Studies were also undertaken on 104 patients with definite or probable ALS (66 males, 38 females, aged 25–80 years, mean age: 58 years) as defined according to the revised El Escorial criteria (Brooks et al.). The mean disease duration to the time of testing was 18 ± 1.8 months, with a mean ALS functional rating scale-revised score of 39 ± 0.9. There was moderate weakness of the target abductor pollicis brevis muscle, with a median Medical Research Council score of 4. Limb-onset disease was reported by 77% of patients with ALS, while bulbar-onset disease was evident in 23% of patients. Clinically, patients with ALS exhibited less fasciculations when compared to the acquired neuromyotonia cohort, although a formal fasciculation frequency was not calculated. Patients with ALS and acquired neuromyotonia cohort were clinically quantified using the same method. Using the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude as a broad marker of disease severity, with CMAP amplitude < 4 mV a cut-off for more advanced disease (Vucic and Kiernan,), it was evident that the majority of patients with ALS (61%) exhibited less severe disease at the time of testing. Results from acquired neuromyotonia and patients with ALS were compared to control data obtained from 62 normal controls (31 males; 31 females, aged 23–83 years, mean: 46 years) (Vucic and Kiernan). All patients gave informed consent to the procedures, which were approved by the South East Sydney Area Health Service Human Research Ethics Committee.

Peripheral nerve studies

Prior to undertaking cortical excitability studies, conventional nerve conduction studies were undertaken on all patients. The CMAP was recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle as were the distal motor and F-wave latencies. From the CMAP amplitude, the neurophysiological index was calculated according to a previously established formula (de Carvalho and Swash).

### Retroviral elements in pathophysiology and as therapeutic targets for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^114Jv32T]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Human T-lymphotropic Virus Type 1

HTLV-1 is a ubiquitous virus, infecting approximately twenty million people worldwide. In the neurological context, it is known to be responsible for HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HAM/TSP is a disease that progresses to severe disability (usually wheelchair-bound status) within 20 years of symptom onset. Similar to HIV, HTLV-I has been shown to cause an ALS-like syndrome. Numerous case reports and series have described HTLV-1 infected individuals with both upper and lower motor neuron signs including bulbar symptoms and signs, tongue atrophy and fasciculations, limb atrophy, and hyperreflexia.

Nearly forty cases of an ALS-like syndrome in HTLV-1 infected individuals have been reported since the 1980s. The case series by Matsuzaki et al. reported clinical improvement in two of three individuals treated with prednisolone. Ando et al. reported a more recent case of ALS-like syndrome in an HTLV-1 infected patient initially diagnosed with ALS who also responded positively to high-dose steroids. Additionally, they also discuss a case of a patient diagnosed with ALS during life who was found to have clinical features consistent with HAM-TSP on autopsy. While the majority of individuals with HAM-TSP will have additional features not characteristic of ALS (bladder and bowel dysfunction and severe spasticity), the aforementioned cases emphasize the important recognition of an ALS-like syndrome in HTLV-1 infected individuals. Including this phenomenon in the differential diagnosis can allow for the possibility of effective treatment with steroids (and potentially future therapies for HTLV-1) in select individuals. A single report described antibodies to HTLV in patients with ALS and the detection of HTLV tax-rev sequences in blood cells from six ALS patients. These HTLV sequences could not be confirmed by another group.

Spumaviruses

Spuma or Foamy viruses share features of retroviruses and hepadnaviruses. These are non-human viruses but human infections have been described. Antibodies to this virus were described in 25–45% of patients with ALS in a series of publications from a single laboratory; however it could not be replicated by another group in which they examined serum and CSF samples from only eight patients with ALS.

### Asymptomatic plantar nodules in a 1-year-old healthy girl [^11529B6A]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following statements is true regarding this diagnosis?
A. Skin biopsy is rarely indicated.
B. The natural history of these skin lesions is easily predictable.
C. Surgical excision is usually the treatment of choice.
D. The affected individuals are mostly immunocompromised.
E. The nodules exclusively occur in the precalcaneal region.

Answers:

A. Skin biopsy is rarely indicated – Correct. With full knowledge of PCFH, it can be diagnosed clinically. Invasive investigations such as skin biopsies are generally avoided.
B. The natural history of these skin lesions is easily predictable – Incorrect. Because PCFH is presumably underreported, it is challenging to determine its clinical course. Some cases regress spontaneously after 2 to 3 years of their onset while others persisted without changes in their size or nature. In our patient, the lesions have not changed in size since their onset.
C. Surgical excision is usually the treatment of choice – Incorrect. Treatment for PCFH is generally not required. Once recognized, parents should be reassured about the benign nature of this condition.
D. The affected individuals are mostly immunocompromised – Incorrect. PCFH commonly affects otherwise healthy children with no impact on daily activities such as walking.
E. The nodules exclusively occur in the precalcaneal region – Incorrect. Several names have been proposed for PCFH with the most recent being cutaneous fibrolipomatous hamartoma. The latter carries a broader nomenclature because there are some atypical reported cases involving retro-calcaneal areas as opposed to the classic presentation.

### Primary lateral sclerosis: application and validation of the 2020 consensus diagnostic criteria in an expert opinion-based PLS cohort [^113sxrhJ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Validation of the 2020 consensus criteria for primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is essential for their use in clinical practice and future trials.

Methods

In a large cohort of patients diagnosed with PLS by expert opinion prior to the new criteria with detailed clinical baseline evaluation (n = 107) and longitudinal follow-up (n = 63), we applied the new diagnostic criteria and analysed the clinical phenotype, electromyography (EMG), diagnostic accuracy and prognosis, adding neurofilaments and MRI as potential biomarkers.

Results

The criteria for definite PLS were met by 28% and those for probable PLS by 19%, whereas 53% did not meet the full criteria at baseline, mainly due to the time, EMG and region criteria. Patients not meeting the criteria had less generalised upper motor neuron involvement but were otherwise similar in demographic and clinical characteristics. All patients with definite and probable PLS maintained PLS diagnosis during follow-up, while four patients not meeting the criteria developed clinical lower motor neuron involvement. Definite PLS cases showed improved survival compared with probable PLS and patients who did not meet the criteria. Despite a clinical PLS phenotype, fibrillation potentials/positive sharp waves and fasciculations in one or more muscles were a frequent EMG finding, with the extent and prognostic significance depending on disease duration. Serum neurofilament light and a multiparametric MRI fibre integrity Z-score correlated with clinical parameters and were identified as potential biomarkers.

Conclusion

Validation of the 2020 PLS consensus criteria revealed high diagnostic certainty and prognostic significance, supporting their value for research and clinical practice.

### Motor neuron intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of FUS-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^114GjkCh]. Acta Neuropathologica (2017). Low credibility.

Cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS drives age-dependent, progressive motor neuron degeneration

To determine whether this mild motor phenotype could be due to an underlying motor neuron disease, we performed electromyography analysis (EMG) on Fus + / + and Fus ΔNLS/ + mice at 10 and 22 months of age. We did not observe stereotypical denervation-related electrical activities in gastrocnemius (GA) or tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of 10-month-old Fus + / + and Fus ΔNLS/ + mice. However, 22-month-old Fus ΔNLS/ + mice showed typical fibrillation and fasciculation potentials in both muscles (Fig. 4 a). Consistent with qualitative observations, a quantitative analysis of the EMG recordings demonstrated a significantly increased frequency of abnormal potentials in 22-month-old Fus ΔNLS/ + mice, but not at 10 months of age (Fig. 4 b) and the amplitude of compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) was decreased in 18- to 22-month-old Fus ∆NLS/+ mice (Fig. 4 d).

### The new missense G376V-TDP-43 variant induces late-onset distal myopathy but not amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^1125yiii]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we identified a G376V-TDP-43 variant in patients with late-onset distal myopathy devoid of motor neuron disease. We also found that the G376V variant altered the behaviour of TDP-43: the mutant protein was more prone to aggregation, formed abnormal condensates in vitro, mislocalized to the cytoplasm in patient-derived muscle cells, and altered mRNA splicing in diseased muscle tissue.

The clinical presentation of patients with the G376V-TDP-43 variant was rather homogenous, with onset after 50 years of age, often asymmetric distribution, preferential involvement of the muscles in the anterior compartment of the forearm, and spreading to all four extremities within 5–10 years. During the course of the disease, most patients experienced involvement of bulbar and respiratory musculature. EMG, muscle MRI and muscle biopsy findings were consistent with a primary skeletal muscle disease. Conversely, we found no evidence of a devastating motor neuron disease, such as ALS. The disease had a chronic course, progressing slowly over several decades. Affected individuals usually maintained their ability to walk and did not require nutritional or ventilatory support during the day. Moreover, there were no indications of lower motor neuron involvement, such as fasciculations, abnormal EMG readings or neurogenic atrophy in biopsy samples. Likewise, there were no signs of upper motor neuron involvement, such as spasticity, exaggerated reflexes or abnormal plantar responses. Upon neurological examination, none of the patients displayed overt symptoms of dementia, and there were no self-reported cognitive issues or problems reported by relatives or partners.

### A novel homozygous p. Ser69Pro SOD1 mutation causes severe young-onset ALS with decreased enzyme activity [^115Y8M83]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The parents of the index patient (IV-2) were cousins and had one daughter and two sons (Fig. 1). There was no history of a neuromuscular disease in the family before the youngest brother (IV-4) developed a right foot drop at the age of 10 years. Within a few months, the disease spread to the other limbs and bulbar muscles. He died from respiratory failure at the age of 12 years. No autopsy or genetic study was done. A diagnosis of juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was postulated. His sister (IV-2) started experiencing cramps of both lower limbs upon walking or standing for longer periods at the age of 25 years. At the age of 26 years, and during her third month of pregnancy, she started complaining of weakness of her right foot rapidly progressing to foot drop. Shortly after delivering a healthy baby, a neurological examination revealed weakness of both right extensor digitorum brevis and right tibialis anterior muscles with loss of the right Achilles reflex. The left ankle reflex was preserved, while both patellar reflexes were exaggerated. A neurophysiological study was consistent with anterior horn cell disease. Within 6 months, the left lower limb was affected with foot drop and loss of the Achilles reflex. Both plantar responses were flexor, diffuse fasciculation of lower limbs, trunk and both upper limbs were observed; the tongue showed atrophy and fasciculation. Electromyography showed diffuse fasciculation with motor unit potentials of high amplitude, increased duration with frequent giant potentials and reduced interference pattern. This was found in cervical, dorsal and lumbar segments and the diagnosis of familial ALS was made based on the earlier affected brother. The condition progressed rapidly and the patient became wheelchair-bound within 3 years of onset. There was no impairment of coordination, extrapyramidal and sphincter function, or sensory deficits. Baseline ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS - R) was 38, dropping to 23 after 2 years (normal range 0–48). Assessment of cognitive functions using the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS) after 2 years of onset gave a score of 118 (normal range 0–136), with decreased scores for language, verbal fluency, and visuospatial orientation. A brain MRI was unremarkable. The patient died 3 years after the disease onset. Her total creatin kinase (CK) level was normal. No genetic testing for dystophinopathies was done. The second brother (IV-3), in his mid-20 s, had no symptom of ALS. A recent neurological examination was unremarkable except for some infrequent fasciculations in his arms that was considered as benign. The parents, in their mid-50 s, show no neurological manifestations.

### Tongue surface electromyography detects reduced motor unit recruitment in oropharyngeal cancer survivors with hypoglossal neuropathy [^114VCJP2]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This proof-of-concept case-control study examined the feasibility of tongue high-density surface electromyography (HDS-EMG) to detect hypoglossal neuropathy.

Methods

We analyzed tongue HDS-EMG for N = 2 participants. Subjects were graded through clinical tongue functional measures and gold-standard needle EMG. We collected HDS-EMG in three tongue tasks: relaxation, protrusion, and isometric maximum effort. The HDS-EMG was decomposed into motor unit spike train estimates.

Results

Muscle relaxation HDS-EMG contained spikes consistent with fasciculation potential morphology. During tongue protrusion, a case of confirmed CN XII neuropathy exhibited an elevated motor unit (MU) discharge rate and fewer MUs (45.71peaks/s, 3 estimated MUs) compared to the control (11.63peaks/s, 11 estimated MUs). During isometric contraction, the case exhibited an average discharge rate of 3.96peaks/s on 3MU estimates, whereas the control had a discharge rate of 2.58peaks/s on 5 MU estimates.

Conclusions

Non-invasive tongue HDS-EMG appears to show potential sensitivity for detecting reduced MU recruitment in hypoglossal neuropathy.

### Recurrent de novovariant causes childhood-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by excess sphingolipid synthesis [^1179b7gL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

On clinical examination, all patients showed a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs with no sensory findings (figure 1A–D). Upper motor neuron involvement was evident in the form of spasticity, pathologic hyper-reflexia including an exaggerated jaw jerk, positive Babinski sign and/or ankle clonus. Fasciculations, including tongue fasciculations, proximal more than distal weakness and muscle atrophy, was seen in all patients, signifying multilevel lower motor neuron disease. Ancillary tests were also consistent with motor neuron disease. NCS performed in all of the patients showed normal sensory responses, normal conduction velocities and decreased amplitude in compound muscle action potentials. Electromyography revealed acute and chronic neurogenic changes with spontaneous activity in the form of fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves and fasciculations as well as decreased recruitment of large amplitude and long duration motor unit action potentials in multiple myotomes with a non-length dependent pattern. Muscle ultrasound performed in three patients revealed muscle atrophy, increased echogenicity in a 'streaky' pattern, reflecting groups of atrophic fibres, in upper and lower extremities and spontaneous activity in the form of fasciculations, indicating neurogenic changes in the muscles (figure 1E, online supplemental video 1). Muscle biopsies were obtained in three patients revealing acute neurogenic changes such as angular myofiber atrophy, target fibres and chronic neurogenic changes such as fibre type grouping, pyknotic nuclear clumps and atrophic clusters which sometimes involved entire fascicles (figure 1F–H). P5 was found to have mild cardiomyopathy and was treated with a beta blocker. Brain MRI imaging was reported as normal in all patients (online supplemental figure 1A–C).

### Succinylcholine [^112F9Lnr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes.

The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis and finally the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis occurs with repeated administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in 7 of 7 patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O2/narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

### Motor-evoked potentials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: potential implications in detecting subclinical UMN involvement in lower motor neuron phenotype [^1157DaWc]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by upper (UMN) and lower motor neurons (LMN) damage. Given the clinical heterogeneity and the prevalence of atypical phenotypes, the diagnostic delay from symptom onset in ALS is commonly12 months.

The diagnosis of ALS is primarily clinical, and requires the careful exclusion of ALS-mimic syndromes. Electrophysiological studies, especially needle electromyography, can recognize LMN involvement based on the evidence of either active or chronic denervation and fasciculation potentials, even in the early stage of the disease. Therefore, to improve the diagnostic power of clinically based El Escorial criteria (EEC), electromyographic (EMG) features have been incorporated in Airlie house criteria (AHC) and more recently in Awaji criteria (AC), that consider EMG signs equal to the clinical evidence of LMN impairment.

On the other hand, the lack of a reliable marker of UMN damage beyond the clinical evidence still remains a critical issue. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) represents a non-invasive method for assessing central motor pathway damage during the course of ALS. Although TMS has been considered as a sensitive test for UMN involvement in ALS, there is still no consensus on its sensitivity, especially for patients without or with doubtful UMN signs.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility in using TMS alterations indicative of UMN impairment in clinical practice in a cohort of ALS patients, to improve the diagnostic certainty level of ALS.

### Neuromuscular ultrasound in combination with nerve conduction studies helps identify inflammatory motor neuropathies from lower motor neuron syndromes [^1173mHXV]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Herein, 102 consecutive LMNS patients who presented with progressive limb weakness were prospectively enrolled to investigate the added value of nerve and muscle US for improving the detection of IMNs, making this cohort study the largest single‐center diagnostic study recruiting series of such patients to date. It was revealed that nerve enlargement and the absence of high intensity fasciculations, as assessed by nerve and muscle US studies, were useful predictive indicators of treatable motor neuropathies.

Identification of treatment‐responsive patients with pure LMN lesions from mimics, such as ALS with initial LMN presentation, is of paramount importance but often difficult. Although electrodiagnostic studies are recognized as complementary techniques, strict application of the electrodiagnostic criteria for MMN/CIDP can lead to misdiagnosis and delay the treatment of a few treatable LMNS patients without demyelinating features. In this study, a total of 16 patients (15.7%) improved after treatment. Seven treatment‐responders presented without electrodiagnostic demyelination features and accounted for 7.5% of the 93 LMNS patients without demyelination evidence, which was consistent with the findings of Simon and his colleagues (the rate of treatment response was 9.7% in LMNS patients, and they recommended not uniformly using IVIg in this set of patients). In contrast, earlier studies reported a higher response rate. This discrepancy might be partly attributed to the selection of patients with markedly longer disease durations (mean disease duration ≥ 4.5 years) in earlier studies, which naturally excluded most ALS patients with initial LMN lesions, and partly attributed to the fact that some researchers recruited LMNS patients without CB (patients with other demyelination features were not excluded). The seven TR‐LMNS patients in our study presented with asymmetric limb weakness (the clinical phenotype of MMN) and were more likely to have MMN without detectable CB. Furthermore, in this study, the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the seven TR‐LMNS patients were similar to those of patients with other diagnoses (mainly ALS), which complicated the differential diagnosis.

### Mild motor impairment as prodromal state in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a new diagnostic entity [^113xnHfV]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

SOD1 L106V mutation carrier (n = 1)

One SOD1 L106V subject (Case 16) developed ALS at age 38. Phenoconversion was preceded by a long (at least 4.4 years) prodromal period of MMI (Table 2). The initial MMI presentation was characterized by asymmetric UMN signs in one arm, followed ∼2 years later by contralateral UMN signs and a further ∼2 years later by weakness, atrophy and fasciculations in the arm where UMN signs were first observed. Plasma NfL levels were normal > 2.5 years before phenoconversion and were significantly elevated (15-fold above normative threshold) within 2 months after phenoconversion (Table 2). With no data available in the 2.5 years immediately preceding phenoconversion, however, it is not possible to define the timing of initial NfL rise, except that it was at least 1.5 years after MMI onset.

FUS c.521del6 mutation carrier (n = 1)

One FUS c.521del6 mutation carrier (Case 17) developed ALS at age 57. Phenoconversion was preceded by 8.8 months of prodrome characterized by asymptomatic left sided findings of extensor digitorum brevis atrophy, mild toe extensor weakness and EMG evidence of isolated ongoing denervation changes in tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus (Table 3). Subsequently, phenoconversion was deemed to have occurred based on the emergence of a left foot drop, at which time examination showed diffuse weakness in both legs with brisk reflexes bilaterally, as well as weakness atrophy and brisk reflexes in the left arm. EMG showed ongoing denervation changes in both legs, the left arm and the thoracic paraspinal muscles. Plasma NfL levels were elevated 1.9 years before phenoconversion, and well before the emergence of MMI (Table 3).

### Uncinate fasciculus lesion burden and anxiety in multiple sclerosis [^114B8xoT]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated neurological disorder that affects 2.4 million people worldwide. The rates of anxiety in MS are 3 times as high as in the general population, with up to 60% of persons with MS experiencing anxiety symptoms over their lifetime. Though anxiety in MS is associated with substantial disability, including worse physical functioning and quality of life, the mechanisms of anxiety in MS are not well understood. The few studies that have attempted to relate neuroinflammation and white matter pathology to anxiety in MS have not identified a reliable biomarker that directly links anxiety symptoms to brain pathology, leading some scientists to speculate that anxiety is a consequence of living with an unpredictable illness. However, 40% of those with MS do not have anxiety, suggesting that neural pathophysiology may contribute to anxiety risk. In this study, we evaluated whether lesions affecting white matter tracts that connect brain regions known to be associated with anxiety circuitry are associated with anxiety in MS.

Preclinical studies in rodents and primates have consistently demonstrated the importance of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the amygdala in anxiety and stress circuitry. Human neuroimaging studies have also shown convergent results. Across anxiety disorders, patients with anxiety show low OFC activation and high amygdala activation in functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A study of anxiety in MS also identified abnormalities in resting state activity in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. The prevailing hypothesis is that the OFC provides top-down control over the amygdala in healthy brain states and that disruption of that relationship leads to heightened amygdala activity, increased fear response, and subsequent activation of the sympathetic nervous system. The OFC and amygdala are structurally connected via the uncinate fasciculus (UF), and this structural relationship is conserved across species. Though lesions to the UF could theoretically lead to OFC and amygdala decoupling and cause anxiety, it is not possible to prospectively lesion the UF to test this hypothesis in humans.

### Burning pain: axonal dysfunction in erythromelalgia [^114pFQKv]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Initially, a stimulus–response curve was obtained. This curve was used to determine the threshold for a CMAP or SNAP around 40% of maximum; this was the target response and threshold was the stimulus required to obtain this potential. The strength–duration time constant (SDTC) of the nerve was then determined by adjusting the intensity of stimuli of different durations so that the target response was maintained. To measure threshold electrotonus (TE), prolonged 100-millisecond subthreshold currents were delivered and their strength was set to be +40% (depolarizing, TEd) and −40% (hyperpolarizing, TEh) of the control threshold current. Test pulses were delivered at varying intervals during and after the conditioning currents, and the change in threshold required to produce the target 40% response was recorded. Subsequently the current–threshold relationship (I/V) was measured, reflecting the rectifying properties of the axons. The I/V relationship was assessed by measuring the change in threshold at the end of polarizing currents of 200-millisecond duration, the strength of which was altered in 10% steps from +50% (depolarizing) to −100% (hyperpolarizing) of the control threshold. Finally, the recovery cycle (RC) was tested, which determines the change in threshold following a supramaximal stimulus at 18 conditioning-test intervals from 2 to 200 milliseconds. The RC consists of a relative refractory period at short interstimulus intervals, a superexcitable period, when a smaller stimulus is necessary to produce the test response, and a late subexcitable period, during which a greater stimulus than control is required.

Because warmth can trigger and exacerbate symptoms in otherwise asymptomatic areas, the influence of temperature on axonal excitability was examined in 6 SCN9A+ mutated patients with EM. The arm was covered with warm towels and heated gradually up to where the subject can tolerate (average skin surface temperature 5° higher than at rest).

Measurements of excitability indices have previously been used for noninvasive assessment and monitoring of the effects of mexiletine, which nonselectively partially blocks VGSCs. These studies included patients with neuropathic pain or muscle cramp or fasciculation and demonstrated with mexiletine therapy suppression of persistent Na + currents in human motor axons associated with improvements in clinical phenotype. To identify an effective treatment, we assessed the alterations in axonal excitability before and 3 months after mexiletine at a dose of 300 mg daily, a selective sodium channel blocker in 4 SCN9A+ mutated patients with EM.

### Succinylcholine chloride (Quelicin) [^117HYDL8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.9	Risk of Prolonged Neuromuscular Block in Patients with Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity

QUELICIN is not recommended in patients with known reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity due to the likelihood of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of QUELICIN in such patients.

Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, severe liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Patients homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (1 in 2,500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of succinylcholine. If QUELICIN is administered to a patient homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting apnea or prolonged muscle paralysis should be treated with controlled respiration.

5.10	Risk of Additional Trauma in Patients With Fractures or Muscle Spasms

QUELICIN should be employed with caution in patients with fractures or muscle spasm because the initial muscle fasciculations may cause additional trauma. Monitor neuromuscular transmission and the development of fasciculations throughout the use of neuromuscular blocking agents.

5.11	Increase in Intracranial Pressure

QUELICIN may cause a transient increase in intracranial pressure; however, adequate anesthetic induction prior to administration of QUELICIN will minimize this effect.

5.12	Risk of Aspiration due to Increase in Intragastric Pressure

Succinylcholine may increase intragastric pressure, which could result in regurgitation and possible aspiration of stomach contents. Evaluate patients at risk for aspiration and regurgitation. Monitor patients during induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade for clinical signs of vomiting and/or aspiration.

3 Results

3.1 The Demographic Profiles

In total, 87 AFM were analyzed, of which 37 were C9+ and 50 were C9−. The total number of pedigrees was 37, with a median number of AFM per pedigree: 2 (range: 1–13). All participants were up to the third degree of consanguinity with respect to the closest family member with ALS. Demographics of the participants are summarized in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Demographic and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic family members.

3.2 Physical Examination and Cognitive Functioning Scores Do Not Differ Between Groups

No clinical signs of lower motor neuron involvement (e.g. muscle atrophy, weakness, fasciculations, hyporeflexia) were detected during the physical examination. Mild signs suggestive of upper motor neuron involvement were observed in both groups, but no significant differences were found between them. Additionally, there were no significant group differences in cognitive functioning. A detailed breakdown of the physical examination and cognitive screening results is provided in Table S2.

3.3 Task Performance Is Similar Between Groups

The two groups did not differ significantly in any of the SART performance measures (Table 2), nor did they show different rates of fatigue (i.e. slowing of response times; p = 0.58).

TABLE 2
Performance measures of SART.

3.4 Sensor‐Space Stimulus‐Locked Analysis Shows Differences in the Central Electrodes

The group‐level stimulus‐locked NoGo ERPs in sensor‐space for all family members is shown in Figure 1A (see also Figure S1). During the NoGo condition, within the N2 (180–350 ms), both cohorts exhibited positive potentials over the parietal and occipital electrodes (Figure 1B). In the C9− group, this positive potential extended toward the central electrodes. During the P3 (300–600 ms), both groups displayed a similar positive potential over centroparietal electrodes (Figure 1B). Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the two groups during the N2 only, primarily driven by a cluster of central electrodes, which appeared as a negative potential (Figure 1B). Further inspection of the average ERPs from these significant central electrodes confirmed that this difference was due to an increased negative potential in the C9+ AFM group (Figure 1C). The outcomes of the statistical models are provided in Table S3.

### Iopamidol (Isovue-m 200) [^116g8aY2]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

While not observed in controlled clinical studies with ISOVUE-M (Iopamidol Injection), the following adverse reactions may occur because they have been reported with ISOVUE-M and other nonionic water soluble contrast agents: cardiovascular (arrhythmias); pulmonary (apnea); bacterial meningitis, and aseptic meningitis syndrome; allergy or idiosyncrasy (chills, pruritus, nasal congestion, Guillain_Barre syndrome); CNS irritation (psycho-organic syndrome: mild and transitory perceptual aberrations such as depersonalization, anxiety, deppression, hyperreflexia or areflexia, hypertonia or flaccidity, restlessness, tremor, echoacousia, echolalia, asterixis or dysphasia have occurred). Profound mental disturbances have rarely been reported (various forms and degrees of aphasia, mental confusion or disorientation); the onset is usually at 8 to 10 hours and lasts for about 24 hours without aftereffects. However, occasionally they have been manifest as apprehension, agitation or progressive withdrawal to the point of stupor or coma. In a few cases, these have been accompanied by transitory hearing loss or other auditory symptoms and visual disturbances (believed subjective or delusional). Persistent cortical loss of vision in association with convulsions, and ventricular block have been reported. Rarely, persistent though transitory weakness in the leg or ocular muscles has been reported. Peripheral neuropathies have been rare and transitory. They include sensory and/or motor or nerve root disturbances, myelitis, persistent leg muscle pain or weakness, or sixth nerve palsy, or cauda equina syndrome. Muscle cramps, fasciculation or myoclonia, spinal convulsion, paralysis, or spasticity are unusual.

Methods

Patient Inclusion and Follow-Up

The study population was recruited between November 2002 and March 2005. During this period, all Dutch neurologists and 1 large referral center for MND in Belgium (Leuven) were requested to enroll patients suspected of having PLS in this study.

The inclusion criteria for our study were as follows: (1) a gradually progressive UMN syndrome, (2) age at onset 18 years or older, (3) disease duration of at least 6 months, and (4) no evidence for an alternative diagnosis based on ancillary investigations.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) positive family history for ALS or HSP at inclusion, (2) sensory signs, (3) cerebellar or extrapyramidal signs, or (4) LMN involvement at inclusion. Regarding LMN involvement, we accepted patients with mild focal amyotrophy of the interosseous muscles of the hands, or of the anterior tibial or calf muscles, or fasciculations in muscles without weakness or atrophy. Patients were excluded if the EMG criteria for ALS were met at inclusion (evidence of both chronic neurogenic change and acute denervation, as defined in the revised El Escorial criteria [rEEC]).

### Predictors of delay in the diagnosis and clinical trial entry of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients: a population-based study [^115ooG41]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The El Escorial and the revised Airlie House diagnostic criteria for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were introduced to select patients for clinical trials. Heterogeneity of clinical presentation at onset and delay in diagnosis may decrease the likelihood for trial entry.

Objective

Identify risk factors for delay in the diagnosis and trial exclusion.

Methods

ALS incident cases were identified with El Escorial (EEC) and Airlie House criteria (AHC) through a population-based registry established in Puglia, Southern Italy, in the years 1998–99.

Results

130 ALS incident cases were diagnosed with a median interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of 9.3 months and not different across both EEC and AHC categories. Twenty percent of cases were not eligible for clinical trials according to the AHC. About 5% of subjects in this series died with only lower motor neuron signs. Predictors for delay in the diagnosis were age between 65 and 75 years and spinal onset while fasciculations and cramps as first symptoms were predictors of exclusion from trials.

Conclusions

In this population-based series, diagnostic delay was longer in subjects with spinal onset and age between 65 and 75 and fasciculation as first symptoms. About 80% of incident cases were trial eligible with AHC criteria. However, a significant number of subjects with ALS, characterized by a limited spread of signs, were not trial eligible while alive.

### Excitability properties of motor axons in patients with spontaneous motor unit activity [^115i9JHD]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Measures of nerve excitability provide information about biophysical properties of peripheral axons in disease states. One measure, the strength duration time constant (tau(SD)), was previously reported to be prolonged in motor axons of patients with acquired neuromyotonia. The present study used a new protocol that applies a more comprehensive and sensitive panel of measures of axonal excitability, to determine firstly whether changes in tau(SD) were present in a group of patients with evidence of spontaneous motor unit activity; and secondly, if such changes in tau(SD) were present, whether other parameters of axonal excitability were affected, to clarify the mechanism of the change in tau(SD).

Methods

Eleven patients with both symptoms and EMG evidence of spontaneous motor unit activity were studied. Eight patients had autoimmune associated acquired neuromyotonia (aNMT) and three had the cramp fasciculation syndrome. The protocol first measured stimulus-response behaviour using two stimulus durations (from which the distribution of strength-duration time constants was estimated), and then threshold tracking was used to determine threshold electrotonus to 100 ms polarising currents, a current-threshold relation (indicating inward and outward rectification), and the recovery of excitability after supramaximal activation.

Results

The results were compared with previously published normal data. The value for tau(SD) of motor axons in the patient group was 0.43 (0. 02) ms (mean (SEM)), identical with the control value. Most other indices of axonal excitability, including those dependent on fast potassium channels, were also found to be normal. When compared with age matched controls however, the patients with acquired neuromyotonia had significantly greater late subexcitability after an impulse, greater excitability overshoots after depolarisation or hyperpolarisation, and more accommodation.

Conclusions

No clear evidence for the mechanism of ectopic discharge in these patients was obtained, probably because the activity was generated focally, and most often at the motor nerve terminals. The unexpected finding of increased excitability overshoots and accommodation compared with age matched controls, suggests a relative up regulation of slow potassium conductance, possibly as a consequence of the continuous motor unit activity.

### Early diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by threshold tracking and conventional transcranial magnetic stimulation [^113AcVdC]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical scores

The disease duration (in months) from time of symptom onset and the region of onset were noted. UMN involvement was graded using a modified Penn UMN score (UMNS), with higher scores (maximum 27) corresponding to greater disease burden [. Single points were given for an abnormal jaw‐jerk reflex, palmomental sign and pseudobulbar affect [. In the extremities, deep tendon reflexes (biceps, triceps, ankle), pathological reflexes (Hoffman´s and Babinski´s sign and clonus) and spasticity [were scored.

Muscle strength using the Medical Research Council (MRC) score for shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, wrist extension, index finger abduction, thumb abduction, hip flexion, knee extension and ankle dorsiflexion was evaluated, yielding a maximum total score of 80. Disease severity was staged using the revised ALS Functional Rating Score (ALSFRS‐R) [which yields a maximum score of 48.

Nerve conduction studies and electromyography

Conventional methods were performed according to the department´s routine [. The only data presented here are the peak‐to‐peak amplitude recorded from the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI) and the FDI EMG data. For EMG, the incidence of fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves and fasciculations at 10 different sites was noted [and 20 motor unit potentials were recruited for quantitative analysis.

### Succinylcholine chloride (Anectine) [^111SDh1N]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. As does acetylcholine, it combines with the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate to produce depolarization. This depolarization may be observed as fasciculations. Subsequent neuromuscular transmission is inhibited so long as adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Onset of flaccid paralysis is rapid (less than one minute after intravenous administration), and with single administration lasts approximately 4 to 6 minutes.

The paralysis following administration of succinylcholine is progressive, with differing sensitivities of different muscles. This initially involves consecutively the levator muscles of the face, muscles of the glottis, and finally, the intercostals and the diaphragm and all other skeletal muscles.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block). This may be associated with prolonged respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness in patients who manifest the transition to Phase II block. When this diagnosis is confirmed by peripheral nerve stimulation, it may sometimes be reversed with anticholinesterase drugs such as neostigmine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. The transition from Phase I to Phase II block has been reported in seven of seven patients studied under halothane anesthesia after an accumulated dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg succinylcholine (administered in repeated, divided doses). The onset of Phase II block coincided with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery. In another study, using balanced anesthesia (N2O/O2/narcotic-thiopental) and succinylcholine infusion, the transition was less abrupt, with great individual variability in the dose of succinylcholine required to produce Phase II block. Of 32 patients studied, 24 developed Phase II block. Tachyphylaxis was not associated with the transition to Phase II block, and 50% of the patients who developed Phase II block experienced prolonged recovery.

### The new missense G376V-TDP-43 variant induces late-onset distal myopathy but not amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^11559E6g]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

In all nine patients tested, needle EMG showed myopathic patterns in affected muscles, including fibrillations, positive sharp waves at rest, and polyphasic motor unit potentials of short duration and low amplitude during voluntary contraction. No myotonic discharge, no fasciculation or neuropathic changes were found. Nerve conduction studies were unremarkable as well. MRI (four patients) and CT (three patients) showed marked distal muscle atrophy with relative sparing of the thigh muscles; in the upper limbs, muscle atrophy was predominant in the posterior forearm muscles; in the lower limbs, muscle atrophy was most prominent in the anterior leg muscles (Fig. 1G–O). Seven of eight tested patients had restrictive lung function with forced vital capacity (FVC) decreased by a median (IQR) percentage of 44% (33–55) of reference values. Cardiac disease occurred in three patients: one patient had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a second patient presented with atrial fibrillation with unremarkable cardiac ultrasound, and the third one had asymptomatic left bundle branch block with normal cardiac ultrasound and ECG Holter (Table 1). Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels were within normal ranges in five patients (62.5%) or moderately elevated to a maximum of 500 IU/l in three patients (37.5%).

Patients FA-II:2, FA-II:5, FA-II:8, FA-III:2 and FA-IV:1 from Family A were not examined in our reference centre (Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hôpital Neurologique P. Wertheimer). However, according to their relatives, these individuals were affected by progressive distal muscle weakness starting in adulthood. Patients FA-II:2, FA-II:5 and FA-II:8 had died at the age of 75, 65 and 68 years, respectively. Patient FA-III:2, currently 84 years old, was reported to present with distal muscle involvement occurring after the age of 60 years. Patient FA-IV:4 was reported to have no overt muscle weakness or atrophy at the age of 57 years; however, she had restrictive lung disease (FVC decreased by 30%).

Table 1
Medical Research Council sum score

Some other potentially interesting methods to evaluate the neuromuscular function include the use of handheld dynamometry and handgrip strength. Both are reproducible in the ICU. Preliminary data suggest that handgrip strength relates to outcome but these data need further confirmation. Muscle ultrasound allows detection of atrophy as well as architectural changes and fasciculation. Ultrasound findings in the ICU setting, in contrast to other settings, did not, however, correlate with muscle function or outcomes in the few studies that are available. Preliminary data showed that reduced abductor polices strength following ulnar nerve stimulation in critically ill patients but the relationship with global strength or outcome was not studied.

Respiratory muscle strength can be measured in the ICU using the maximal inspiratory pressure recorded following a volitional maneuver starting from the functional residual capacity. This may be difficult, however, in ICU patients who are not cooperative. For such patients, a nonvolitional method using a one-way valve is a good alternative. More sophisticated methods, such as measuring transdiaphragmatic pressure following magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation, is cumbersome and therefore not suited to daily practice.

Electrophysiological testing

Because of the shortcomings of the MRC sum score, the interest in alternative diagnostic tools remains. Full electrophysiological testing, including nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG), is cumbersome, not readily available in many ICUs, time consuming, and costly. NCS typically reveal reduced compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); in the case of (coexistent) CIP, sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) may be reduced, and nerve conduction velocity is normal or only slightly reduced. In both CIP and CIM, spontaneous electrical activity may be present on EMG. SNAPs in critically ill patients may also be reduced due to edema. Voluntary muscle contraction, which requires a cooperative patient, or alternatively more complex electrophysiological methods such as direct muscle stimulation can be used to differentiate between CIP and CIM. Simplified electrophysiological screening using the peroneal nerve CMAP, potentially supplemented by the sural nerve amplitude, may be used to identify patients who require more extensive testing. However, correlation between electrophysiological abnormalities and muscle weakness has not been studied in large patient populations; in particular, the importance of electrophysiological abnormalities in the absence of weakness is unclear.

### Neurogenic benign fasciculations, pseudomyotonia, and pseudotetany… [^116XPTZF]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- We studied two patients with abnormal spontaneous muscular activity. The first had widespread fasciculations, painful spasms, delayed muscular relaxation, and hyperhidrosis. Improvement occurred after several years. The second case had generalized paresthesia, mild stiffness, a positive result from Trousseau's test, and was relieved by administration of carbamazepine. Both patients had abnormal conduction velocity. Examination of muscle biopsy specimens disclosed fiber type grouping and increased collateral ramification of motor axons. These observations exemplify symptoms and signs that resemble those of myotonia and tetany and occasionally occur in partial denervation. They provide additional evidence of the neurogenic nature of Isaacs-Mertens syndrome. Coërs C, Telerman-Toppet N.

### Generalized muscular stiffness, fasciculations, and myokymia of peripheral nerve origin… [^113dDnoo]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE PERIPHERAL nerve disorders, unlike central nervous system and muscle diseases, have not been widely recognized as causes of generalized muscular stiffness. Isaacs, 1, 2 in 1961 and 1967, reported three patients with an entity of generalized muscular stiffness, fasciculations, continual electromyographic activity at rest and depressed deep tendon reflexes. The muscular stiffness and continual EMG activity were abolished by curare but persisted during spinal anesthesia and after peripheral nerve blocks, suggesting that the syndrome was due to isolated, spontaneous, peripheral nerve hyperactivity. Isaacs also discovered that diphenylhydantoin induced a substantial and sustained decrease in the muscular stiffness. Similar cases were reported by Mertens and Zschocke3 and by Levy et al, 4 both groups confirming the effects of spinal anesthesia and curare. Mertens and Zschocke3 also found carbamazepine as effective as DPH in treatment. Sig.

### Effects of denervation on fasciculations in human muscle… [^116GBoCU]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

IN A previous communication1 evidence was presented to the effect that fasciculations in voluntary muscle have their site of origin not in the anterior horn cell but at the myoneural junction. This evidence consisted of the demonstration of continued fasciculations during pharmacologic block of the appropriate peripheral nerves or nerve roots and of the alteration of the frequency of fasciculations by drugs acting at the myoneural junction. Subsequently, Denny-Brown2 mentioned the disadvantages of pharmacologic block and indicated that this type of block could not be considered absolute in the physiologic sense, for the drug employed need not affect all the fibers in a given nerve to the same degree nor could the interference with transmission of sensory or voluntary motor stimuli permit one to conclude that all impulses were blocked. For these reasons, confirmatory evidence for our previous premise regarding the site of origin of fasciculations was sought.
