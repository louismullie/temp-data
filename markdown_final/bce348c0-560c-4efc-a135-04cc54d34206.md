## Question

kefflex dosing for nipple piercing infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to dose cephalexin (Keflex) for a nipple piercing infection, with attention to likely pathogens, dosing ranges, renal and hepatic adjustments, safety issues, and when to choose alternatives or procedural management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame nipple piercing infections within skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) taxonomy and the anatomic implications. Then, I should verify the likely microbiology and whether cephalexin's spectrum is appropriate. Next, I will review labeled dosing and durations and carefully adjust for renal function, followed by confirming hepatic considerations. After that, I need to check contraindications, adverse effects, and drug interactions. Then, I will consider infection severity, need for drainage, and when to broaden empiric therapy for MRSA or Pseudomonas. Finally, I will outline monitoring, follow-up, and a succinct recommendation with contingencies for adherence and special circumstances.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. A nipple piercing infection is best categorized as a localized SSTI of the nipple–areolar complex, but I need to remember the unique ductal anatomy and fibrous tissue that can complicate spread and healing, potentially bridging simple cellulitis and deeper breast infections if not managed promptly [^1116XkXY] [^111aZ4mp].

> Next, I should review the expected microbiology. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while community SSTIs often involve methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes, piercing-related infections also show Pseudomonas aeruginosa when aftercare solutions are contaminated and occasionally atypical mycobacteria in chronic, nonhealing presentations, which would not be covered by cephalexin [^111YGZBF] [^1179Po4u] [^112HhPby] [^1177wgPP]. I need to ensure cephalexin is chosen only when MSSA and streptococci are the leading concerns because its labeled indications and expected spectrum support these organisms but not MRSA, Pseudomonas, or nontuberculous mycobacteria [^116sX1X2].

> I will now examine dosing. For adult uncomplicated SSTIs due to susceptible organisms, the FDA-labeled dosing for cephalexin is commonly 500 mg orally four times daily for 7 to 14 days, with alternatives including 500 mg twice daily or 250 mg four times daily depending on illness severity and clinical judgment; in practice, more frequent dosing is preferred for moderate infections to maintain time above MIC, but wait, let me verify the exact labeled regimens, which indeed list 500 mg QID and options of 500 mg BID or 250 mg QID within 7–14 days [^1168v5nK] [^112eXHDZ] [^112aLdjy].

> I should double-check renal dosing because nipple infections may present in adults with variable kidney function. For CrCl greater than 60 mL/min, no adjustment is required; for CrCl 30–59 mL/min, many labels cap at about 1 g total daily dose; for CrCl 15–29 mL/min, typical recommendations limit single doses to 250 mg with reduced frequency; for CrCl 5–14 mL/min, 250 mg once daily is advised; and for CrCl 1–4 mL/min, 250 mg every 48–60 hours is suggested, with hemodialysis dosing given after dialysis sessions and peritoneal dialysis commonly dosed at 250–500 mg every 12–24 hours, so I need to tailor frequency rather than push higher doses in renal impairment to avoid neurotoxicity including seizures [^116LHVZ9] [^112bZTkR] [^113bcM3J] [^116GDChX] [^115wfJ2B] [^113dHGL8] [^111y53Jb] [^113UyiEp].

> Let me consider hepatic impairment. I should confirm whether any dose change is needed in chronic liver disease; cephalexin labeling indicates no dose adjustment is required for hepatic dysfunction, so renal function remains the principal determinant of dose and interval in organ impairment scenarios [^113onHJm].

> I need to check contraindications and precautions before prescribing. Hypersensitivity to cephalexin or other beta-lactams, a history of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, and recent severe C. difficile are key red flags; warfarin coadministration can prolong PT and elevate bleeding risk, metformin levels can rise, and seizure risk is higher with renal impairment, so I should verify allergies, review concomitant medications, and counsel about diarrhea and skin reactions; using cephalexin without a strong suspicion of bacterial infection should be avoided to limit resistance and harm [^113UyiEp] [^115nh87R] [^111kmy2G] [^114doobY].

> But wait, what if the presentation is not a straightforward nonpurulent cellulitis. Next, I should review severity-based management. For purulent infections or abscesses, incision and drainage is the primary therapy; empiric MRSA-active agents may be needed based on risk and local patterns, and cephalexin alone would be insufficient if MRSA is likely; if Pseudomonas is suspected, especially with exposure to contaminated aftercare solutions or water, antipseudomonal coverage is indicated and may require parenteral agents such as ceftazidime in more severe cases pending culture results and clinical status; culture of purulent material guides de-escalation or targeted therapy [^1116XkXY] [^111YGZBF] [^114KN8Xc].

> I will now consider nipple-specific issues that could alter management. The nipple's ductal system means infections can extend into deeper breast tissue, healing is often prolonged compared to earlobe sites, and complications such as mastitis or abscess formation mandate timely evaluation for fluctuance and procedural drainage; in rare cases, systemic complications such as endocarditis have been reported after nipple piercing in patients with underlying valvular abnormalities, so I should keep systemic red flags in mind and escalate care if fever or bacteremia signs emerge [^111aZ4mp] [^112HTrFS]. Let me think about lactation for a moment; while beta-lactams are generally considered compatible with breastfeeding, I should confirm specifics for cephalexin in the current labeling or reliable lactation resources and counsel to monitor the infant for gastrointestinal changes if therapy proceeds, and of course active herpetic lesions of the breast would change breastfeeding guidance entirely, although that represents a different pathogen and management pathway [^115cXrfQ].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. Clinical improvement should be evident within 48 to 72 hours; if not, I need to re-evaluate for resistant organisms, inadequate source control, atypical pathogens, or an alternative diagnosis, and obtain cultures when drainage or purulence is present to direct therapy; wound care and avoidance of irritant or potentially contaminated aftercare products are advisable while maintaining close clinical reassessment [^1116XkXY] [^111YGZBF].

> Putting this together, for an uncomplicated nipple piercing infection without abscess or systemic features and with normal renal function and low MRSA/Pseudomonas risk, cephalexin 500 mg orally four times daily for 7 to 14 days is a reasonable first-line regimen; I should confirm no beta-lactam allergy, screen for drug interactions, and reinforce adherence to the QID schedule, with reassessment at 48 to 72 hours to ensure response and extend duration toward 10 to 14 days if improvement is slow or anatomy suggests deeper involvement [^1168v5nK] [^113UyiEp] [^1116XkXY].

> If adherence to QID dosing is a concern and the infection is very mild without risk modifiers, a twice-daily option of 500 mg for 7 to 14 days can be considered with the understanding that more frequent dosing may better sustain pharmacodynamic targets in moderate infections; I should verify that clinical response is adequate and switch or escalate if the course is suboptimal or if cultures dictate broader or different coverage [^112eXHDZ] [^1116XkXY].

For a nipple piercing infection, the standard Keflex (cephalexin) dose is 500 mg orally every 6 hours (QID) [^1168v5nK] for 7–14 days. Use the full 14 days for severe or slow-resolving infections. Adjust dosing for renal impairment: for CrCl 30–59 mL/min, max 1 g/day [^112bZTkR]; for CrCl 15–29 mL/min, 250 mg BID–TID [^113bcM3J]; for CrCl 5–14 mL/min, 250 mg once daily [^116GDChX]; and for CrCl 1–4 mL/min, 250 mg every 48–60 hours [^115wfJ2B]. Monitor for allergic reactions, C. difficile, and superinfections [^113UyiEp]; consider MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage if risk factors or severe infection are present [^111YGZBF] [^1116XkXY].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

- **Standard adult dose**: 500 mg orally every 6 hours (QID) [^1168v5nK] for 7–14 days [^1116XkXY].
- **Alternative dosing**: 500 mg orally every 12 hours (BID) for mild infections, but QID is preferred for piercing infections [^112eXHDZ].
- **Duration**: 7–14 days [^1168v5nK]; use 14 days for severe or slow-resolving infections.

---

## Clinical considerations

### Pathogens commonly associated with nipple piercing infections

- **Staphylococcus aureus**: Most common, including MRSA [^111YGZBF].
- **Streptococcus pyogenes**: Common skin pathogen [^111YGZBF].
- **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**: Associated with contaminated aftercare solutions [^111YGZBF] [^116NC1AY].
- **Atypical mycobacteria**: Rare, consider if poor response to standard therapy [^1177wgPP] [^112HhPby].

---

### Indications for antibiotic therapy

Initiate antibiotics for **localized infection** — characterized by erythema, warmth, swelling, or purulent discharge — and for **systemic manifestations** such as fever, chills, or malaise [^1116XkXY]. Use a lower threshold in **immunocompromised patients**, and treat if infection persists despite conservative local care [^116BgEGg].

---

### Contraindications and precautions

Cephalexin is **contraindicated** in patients with **hypersensitivity to cephalosporins or penicillins**. In renal impairment, **adjust the dose** as outlined below [^112bZTkR] [^113bcM3J] [^116GDChX] [^115wfJ2B]. Monitor for C. difficile–associated diarrhea and colitis [^113UyiEp] and for superinfection with fungal or resistant bacterial overgrowth [^113UyiEp].

---

## Adjustments for renal impairment

| **Creatinine clearance (CrCl)** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|
| > 60 mL/min | No adjustment [^116LHVZ9] |
| 30–59 mL/min | Max 1 g/day [^112bZTkR] |
| 15–29 mL/min | 250 mg BID–TID [^113bcM3J] |
| 5–14 mL/min | 250 mg once daily [^116GDChX] |
| 1–4 mL/min | 250 mg every 48–60 hours [^115wfJ2B] |

---

## Potential complications and side effects

- **Allergic reactions**: Rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis [^113UyiEp].
- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea [^113UyiEp], C. difficile colitis [^115nh87R].
- **Hematologic**: Hemolytic anemia [^115nh87R], thrombocytopenia, leukopenia [^113UyiEp].
- **Renal**: Interstitial nephritis, renal failure [^113UyiEp].
- **Neurologic**: Seizures (especially with renal impairment) [^113UyiEp].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Cephalexin is highly effective for MSSA [^1168v5nK] and streptococcal infections [^116sX1X2]; it **does not reliably cover MRSA**, so choose alternatives when MRSA is suspected. It also **lacks activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa** and **atypical mycobacteria**; use alternative agents if these pathogens are suspected.

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

For **suspected MRSA**, consider clindamycin, doxycycline, TMP-SMX, or linezolid [^11168A2z] [^1116XkXY]. For **Pseudomonas coverage**, use ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin [^111aZ4mp]; for **atypical mycobacterial infections**, use clarithromycin or azithromycin combined with ethambutol.

---

## Patient education and adherence

Advise patients to **complete the full antibiotic course** [^111zhWAe] even if symptoms improve and to promptly report severe side effects. During treatment, **avoid irritants** such as alcohol, harsh soaps, and swimming [^116BgEGg]. Arrange follow-up, and reassess if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours [^1116XkXY].

---

Keflex is appropriate for nipple piercing infections when MSSA or streptococci are likely; use **500 mg QID for 7–14 days** and adjust for renal function. Consider MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage if risk factors or severe infection are present.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^111YGZBF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Sporadic bacterial infections are relatively common after nonmedical body piercing procedures, such as ear piercing. Localized infections occur at 10%–30% of new piercing sites, most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Complications of piercing-related infections can range from minor superficial skin infections to abscess formation and necrosis requiring surgical intervention. Severe infections tend to occur in more avascular areas, such as auricular cartilage.

P. aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacterium commonly found in natural and built wet environments and is a well-established cause of sporadic piercing-related infections. Infections tend to occur, on average, 2–4 weeks after piercing procedures and have historically been attributed to exposure of piercing sites to swimming pools and fresh water, lack of adequate preoperative/intraoperative antisepsis of piercing sites, poor hand hygiene, and the use of contaminated solutions during or after piercing procedures. However, limited reports exist on P. aeruginosa infection outbreaks related to piercing.

In late April 2021, the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District Public Health Unit in Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), Australia, was notified by an ear, nose, and throat clinician that three patients had sought treatment for P. aeruginosa infections at two local hospital emergency departments after ear piercings. All piercings took place on April 1, 2021, at a newly opened skin penetration facility located in southeastern Sydney.

### Cefazolin [^112jqJg2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Dosage adjustment for patients with reduced renal function: Cefazolin for Injection, USP may be used in patients with reduced renal function with the following dosage adjustments: Patients with a creatinine clearance of 55 mL/min or greater or a serum creatinine of 1.5 mg% or less can be given full doses. Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 35 to 54 mL/min or serum creatinine of 1.6 to 3.0 mg% can also be given full doses, but the dosage should be restricted to at least 8-hour intervals. Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 11 to 34 mL/min or serum creatinine of 3.1 to 4.5 mg% should be given 1/2 the usual dose every 12 hours. Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 10 mL/min or less or serum creatinine of 4.6 mg% or greater should be given 1/2 the usual dose every 18 to 24 hours. All reduced dosage recommendations apply after an initial loading dose appropriate to the severity of the infection. For patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, see clinical pharmacology.

- **Pediatric dosage**: In pediatric patients, a total daily dosage of 25 to 50 mg per kg (approximately 10 to 20 mg per pound) of body weight, divided into 3 or 4 equal doses, is effective for most mild to moderately severe infections. The total daily dosage may be increased to 100 mg per kg (45 mg per pound) of body weight for severe infections. Since safety for use in premature infants and in neonates has not been established, the use of Cefazolin for Injection, USP in these patients is not recommended. In pediatric patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 70 to 40 mL/min)…

### Investigation of infection control practices and knowledge of hepatitis C among body-piercing practitioners [^117HoYhB]. American Journal of Infection Control (2003). Low credibility.

Body piercing has become increasingly popular, leading to concerns about the associated risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission during piercing. Many body-piercing practitioners (BPPs) have recently entered the industry, but little is known about their training and understanding of HCV transmission. This study measured BPP knowledge about HCV and infection control procedures. It also tested for HCV contamination within body-piercing establishments.

- **Methods**: BPPs completed a questionnaire about the number and type of piercings performed, their methods for disposing of and reprocessing piercing equipment, and their training and knowledge of HCV. Environmental swabs were collected and tested for HCV RNA.

- **Results**: BPPs at 35 establishments were recruited. A total of 31 BPPs had training as a BPP, ranging from 1 hour to 6 years (median: 15 days). Reprocessing of equipment was variable; 8 establishments inadequately reprocessed piercing guns, and 4 inadequately reprocessed forceps or guiding equipment. All BPPs were aware of HCV, but many did not know how the virus was transmitted. A total of 19 BPPs performed extra cleaning after piercing a customer known to be HCV positive. No environmental swabs tested were positive for HCV RNA.

- **Conclusions**: This study showed that many BPPs had inadequate training and lacked knowledge and understanding of HCV transmission, infection control, and universal precautions. To reduce the risk of HCV transmission, BPPs should be required to undergo formal training in infection control before being registered as BPPs.

### Complications of body piercing [^111aZ4mp]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The trend of body piercing at sites other than the earlobe has grown in popularity over the past decade. The tongue, lips, nose, eyebrows, nipples, navel, and genitals may be pierced. Complications of body piercing include local and systemic infections, poor cosmesis, and foreign body rejection. Swelling and tooth fracture are common problems after tongue piercing. Minor infections, allergic contact dermatitis, keloid formation, and traumatic tearing may occur after earlobe piercing.

"High" ear piercing through the ear cartilage is associated with more serious infections and disfigurement. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are advised for the treatment of auricular perichondritis because of their antipseudomonal activity. Many complications from piercing are body-site specific or related to the piercing technique used. Navel, nipple, and genital piercings often have prolonged healing times. Family physicians should be prepared to address complications of body piercing and provide accurate information to patients.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^111GRgo9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

The first limitation of our study is that not all suspected case-patients had clinical isolates collected, and not all probable cases had isolates retained for further characterization. Second, not all consumers had kept their bottles of aftercare solution or could recall the brand or batch number. Third, not all emergency departments in NSW are covered by PHREDDS; thus, some cases might have been missed. Nevertheless, sufficient evidence was available to issue timely clinician and consumer alerts and, eventually, a product recall, which prevented further infections.

Multiple outbreaks of P. aeruginosa infections from at least two continents have been caused by piercing aftercare products, suggesting that higher manufacturing standards might be required for such solutions. In Australia, although they are applied to recently penetrated skin, aftercare solutions are generally not regulated as therapeutic goods. Consumers expect aftercare solutions to be sterile, yet manufacturing processes reviewed in this investigation indicated that sterility could not be assured despite the manufacturer's intentions. Management of this outbreak has shown the importance of quality control and sterility assurance in manufacturing such solutions. Existing measures routinely and effectively imposed on regulated therapeutic goods to reduce contamination risk should also be applied to aftercare solutions, such as objectionable organism and microbial risk assessments, and sterility testing and control. Early detection of pathogen clusters linked to contaminated products and source attribution via effective surveillance is critical.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^1129LnQd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

In April 2021, the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District Public Health Unit in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, was notified of three patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections secondary to skin piercings performed at the same salon. Active case finding through laboratories, clinician alerts, and monitoring hospital visits for piercing-related infections identified additional cases across New South Wales, and consumers were alerted. We identified 13 confirmed and 40 probable case-patients and linked clinical isolates by genomic sequencing. Ten confirmed case-patients had used the same brand and batch of aftercare solution. We isolated P. aeruginosa from opened and unopened bottles of this solution batch that matched the outbreak strain identified by genomic sequencing. Piercing-related infections returned to baseline levels after this solution batch was recalled. Early outbreak detection and source attribution via genomic sequencing are crucial for controlling outbreaks linked to contaminated products. Manufacturing standards for nonsterile cosmetic products and guidance for piercing aftercare warrant review.

### Endocarditis after nipple piercing in a patient with a bicuspid aortic valve [^112HTrFS]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Piercing the skin for cosmetic reasons can be dangerous in young adults who have previously undergone surgery for congenital defects of the heart. We report the case of a 24-year-old man in whom coarctation of the aorta had been corrected 15 years earlier. Two months after piercing his left nipple without antibiotic prophylaxis, he developed a local mastitis, followed by bacterial endocarditis that required replacement of the aortic valve.

### Should the scope of NIPT be limited by a 'threshold of seriousness' [^114143pH]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Low credibility.

Given the issues associated with conceptualizing and applying a threshold of seriousness, we conclude that limiting the scope of NIPT on this basis is unjustified and unworkable. In the next section, we propose an alternative approach for responding to the concerns associated with expanded NIPT.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^1179Po4u]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

In total, we identified 13 case-patients who had P. aeruginosa–positive clinical isolates belonging to ST988 (2 case-patients had clinical samples taken from 2 different sites). Of the 13 case-patients with ST988 P. aeruginosa infections, 10 had used the implicated batch and 1 had used 2 different batches of Protat aftercare solution; information was not available for 2 cases. The case-patient with ST247 P. aeruginosa infection had used a different aftercare solution batch.

We reinterviewed the case-patient who reported using 2 different batches of Protat aftercare solution to confirm batch numbers. That case-patient had purchased those bottles 6 and 12 months earlier after other piercings and confirmed that additional aftercare solutions had not been purchased at the time of the latest piercing. However, a product was used in-store on their ear during the piercing procedure, and the case-patient was likely exposed to the implicated batch at that time.

### Zyvox [^11168A2z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adult patients with clinically documented complicated skin and skin structure infections were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy trial. The study compared medications administered intravenously, followed by oral medications for a total of 10 to 21 days of treatment. One group of patients received Zyvox I.V. injection 600 mg every 12 hours, followed by Zyvox tablets 600 mg every 12 hours. The other group received oxacillin 2 g every 6 hours intravenously, followed by dicloxacillin 500 mg every 6 hours orally. Concomitant aztreonam could be administered if clinically indicated.

A total of 400 linezolid-treated and 419 oxacillin-treated patients participated in the study. Among them, 245 (61%) linezolid-treated patients and 242 (58%) oxacillin-treated patients were clinically evaluable. The cure rates were 90% in linezolid-treated patients and 85% in oxacillin-treated patients.

- **Modified intent-to-treat analysis**: This analysis included 316 linezolid-treated and 313 oxacillin-treated patients who met all study entry criteria. The cure rates in the MITT analysis were 86% for linezolid-treated patients and 82% for oxacillin-treated patients.

The cure rates by pathogen for microbiologically evaluable patients are presented in Table 13.

Another study provided additional experience with the use of Zyvox in treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. This was a randomized, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients.

### Breast implant infections: Is cefazolin enough [^11534hwD]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Bacterial infection is a well-known risk of breast implant surgery, occurring in 2.0 to 2.5 percent of cosmetic cases and up to 20 percent of reconstructive cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a first-generation cephalosporin for perioperative prophylaxis; however, no guidelines exist for the empiric treatment of established breast implant infections. A recent increase in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections has prompted interest in using alternative antibiotics with anti-methicillin-resistant S. aureus activity for both prophylactic and empiric therapy. The goal of the present study was to assess the bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility of breast implant-related infections at two tertiary care hospitals in the Texas Medical Center to determine whether a baseline for empiric therapy for breast implant infections could be established.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of patients who developed periprosthetic infections within 1 month after breast implant placement between 2001 and 2006 was completed. One hundred six patients with 116 infected breasts were identified. Patients were included in the study only if they had documented culture data.

- **Results**: Thirty-one breasts in 26 patients met inclusion criteria. Sixty-seven percent of the infected breasts had S. aureus infections; of these, 68 percent were methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections, and 32 percent were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus infections. We noted Gram-negative rods and sterile cultures in 6 percent and 26 percent of breasts, respectively.

### Surgical procedure for reversal of nipple piercing [^111sn6ae]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Body piercing of the nipples for adornment with jewelry has increased worldwide. Many patients later regret their decision and request reversal, along with the desire to maintain their ability to breastfeed. The surgeon must remove the epithelial tunnel with minimum damage to adjacent ducts. The simple technique described uses the patient's jewelry post as a guide and a common disposable biopsy punch. Slid over the post, the punch excises the epithelial tunnel core with minimal harm to surrounding structures.

### Benlysta [^115o2UEd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important administration information**: Benlysta may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Vials are intended for intravenous use only (not for subcutaneous use), while autoinjectors and prefilled syringes are intended for subcutaneous use only (not for intravenous use).

- **Recommended intravenous dosage for adult and pediatric patients with SLE or lupus nephritis**:

	- Benlysta for intravenous use must be reconstituted and diluted prior to administration. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. The recommended intravenous dosage is 10 mg/kg at 2‑week intervals for the first 3 doses and at 4‑week intervals thereafter. Reconstitute, dilute, and administer as an intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an infusion reaction. The infusion must be discontinued immediately if the patient experiences a serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

	- **Precautions prior to intravenous use**: Benlysta should be administered by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Prior to intravenous dosing with Benlysta, consider administering premedication for prophylaxis against infusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- **Preparation of intravenous solutions**: Benlysta for intravenous use is provided as a lyophilized powder in a single‑dose vial and should be reconstituted and diluted accordingly.

### Fortaz [^114KN8Xc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). High credibility.

The usual adult dosage of Fortaz is 1 gram administered intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 to 12 hours. The dosage and route should be determined by the susceptibility of the causative organisms, the severity of infection, and the condition and renal function of the patient. The guidelines for the dosage of Fortaz are provided below.

- **Impaired hepatic function**: No adjustment in dosage is required for patients with hepatic dysfunction.

- **Impaired renal function**: Ceftazidime is excreted by the kidneys almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Therefore, in patients with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 50 mL/min), it is recommended that the dosage of ceftazidime be reduced to compensate for its slower excretion. In patients with suspected renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram of Fortaz may be given. An estimate of GFR should be made to determine the appropriate maintenance dosage. When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft's equation) may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

	- In patients with severe infections who would normally receive 6 grams of Fortaz daily if not for renal insufficiency, the unit dose given may be increased by 50% or the dosing frequency may be increased appropriately. Further dosing should be determined by therapeutic monitoring, the severity of the infection, and the susceptibility of the organism.

### Cefotaxime [^115E5gXX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dosage and route of administration for adults should be determined by the susceptibility of the causative organisms, severity of the infection, and the patient's condition. Cefotaxime may be administered intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV) after reconstitution. The maximum daily dosage should not exceed 12 grams. If Chlamydia trachomatis is suspected as a pathogen, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be added, as cefotaxime sodium has no activity against this organism.

To prevent postoperative infection in contaminated or potentially contaminated surgery, a single 1-gram dose, administered IM or IV, is recommended 30 to 90 minutes prior to the start of surgery.

For cesarean section patients, the first dose of 1 gram is administered intravenously as soon as the umbilical cord is clamped. The second and third doses should be given as 1 gram intravenously or intramuscularly at 6 and 12 hours after the first dose.

For neonates, infants, and children:

- **Neonates (birth to 1 month)**:
	- **0–1 week of age**: 50 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours IV
	- **1–4 weeks of age**: 50 mg/kg per dose every 8 hours IV
	- It is not necessary to differentiate between premature and normal-gestational age infants.

- **Infants and children (1 month to 12 years)**: For body weights less than 50 kg, the recommended daily dose is 50 to 180 mg/kg IM or IV, divided into four to six equal doses. Higher dosages should be used for more severe or serious infections, including meningitis. For body weights of 50 kg or more, the usual adult dosage should be used.

### Correction of inverted nipple: An alternative method using continuous elastic outside distraction [^115Qu4Bi]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Inverted nipple, defined as a nipple located on a plane lower than the areola, presents both functional and cosmetic problems. It is a source of repeated irritation and inflammation, interfering with nursing. Additionally, its abnormal appearance may cause psychological distress. Considering its underlying pathophysiologic components and severity, numerous techniques have been introduced for correction of this anomaly. Most techniques involve extensive skin incisions around the nipple that may jeopardize the blood and nerve supply to the nipple or create excessive scar tissue, which is aesthetically objectionable.

To correct the inverted nipple, the authors introduce an alternative, simple method using continuous elastic outside distraction. Compared with other methods using outside distraction, the authors employed an adjustable elastic instrument made of steel wire, spring, and plastic syringe to provide continuous distraction of the inverted nipples, sustaining this for 3 to 6 months. From August 2002 to December 2003, 14 patients (26 nipples) were treated. Of these, 12 patients had bilateral inverted nipples. Patients' ages at the time of operation ranged from 14 to 40 years, with a mean age of 24 years. All cases were congenital with no previous operations. According to Han and Hong's classification of inverted nipples, six nipples were grade I, nine were grade II, and eleven were grade III. The mean follow-up period was 7.3 months (ranging from 3 to 12 months). Follow-up examinations revealed no evidence of recurrence of inversion. Furthermore, there was no complication associated with the surgery.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: Cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: A randomized treatment trial [^112Q5Ewc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Not all the women who were eligible for the trial were interested in taking part. Some women expressed a reluctance to take antibiotics, while others were overwhelmed with the difficulties they were experiencing and preferred not to participate in a trial. The researchers had previously conducted studies involving breastfeeding women with high participation rates and had expected women to be more interested in taking part in a trial aimed at preventing mastitis. A lower participation rate should have been expected as this study involved the possibility of taking a medication, particularly an antibiotic.

A total of approximately 17,000 women give birth in these hospitals each year. It was estimated that 80% of women start breastfeeding, 5% develop cracked nipples, 80% would be eligible, and 95% would agree to participate. Thus, there would be 537 eligible women per year. The researchers anticipated recruiting approximately ten women with cracked nipples per week, expecting that it would take 57 weeks (57 × 10) to recruit the total sample.

However, recruitment was slow, as very few women were identified with damaged nipples. Hospital staff made unsolicited remarks that nipple damage was seen much less frequently than in the past. Midwives have been trained to help women position the baby and attach the baby at the breast, with women reporting the presence of nipple pain. Any nipple damage is usually identified at an early stage.

### Diagnosis and management of a herpes nipple infection that resulted in neonatal HSV encephalitis [^115cXrfQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

It is important to identify active herpetic lesions of the breast in a lactating person, as this is a contraindication to breastfeeding. However, in patients with a prior history of HSV, if there are no active lesions on the breast, then direct breastfeeding is considered safe. In those who develop herpes nipple infections, limited data are available regarding the optimal treatment of the breast lesions and the timing of resuming breastfeeding. Recommendations for mothers who wish to continue breastfeeding with an active herpes infection of the breast would be to maintain expressing/pumping and discarding the milk until the infection has been cleared.

Here, we present the work-up and management of a primigravida in her 30s who presented to our institution's postpartum clinic approximately 3 weeks after delivery via low transverse caesarean section. She delivered dichorionic diamniotic twins at 33 weeks of gestation and reported a painful cracked nipple at this visit. She had no known history of HSV, but her twin neonates were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) for disseminated HSV prior to the onset of visible maternal lesions.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: Cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: A randomized treatment trial [^116MR4b9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Recruitment began at two hospitals in November 2001, two others in February 2002, and a fifth hospital in June 2002. Recruitment was slow as few women had damaged nipples. During the months of the trial, the recruitment rate decreased rather than increased. Additionally, the flucloxacillin supplied by CSL was labeled for use before the end of November 2002. Therefore, it was decided to stop recruiting once a twelve-month recruiting period had elapsed. The trial stopped recruiting on the 14th of November 2002.

Of the 158 women referred to the study as possible participants, 48 women were eligible (i.e. they had a cracked nipple, were not allergic to penicillin, did not have concurrent "nipple thrush", and had adequate English). Twenty-six of these women refused to participate (10 were not interested, 9 didn't want to take antibiotics, 7 had other reasons). Therefore, 22 were potentially eligible in that they had at least one cracked nipple and consented to take part in the trial if the results of the nipple swab confirmed S. aureus. Thirteen of the nipple cultures were positive, and ten women were randomized to receive flucloxacillin (n = 5) or placebo capsules (n = 5). Two women had already developed mastitis prior to receiving the results, and a third woman developed a rash and did not want to take the capsules. All women were followed up at one week and six weeks. Of the ten women in the RCT, one woman in the placebo group developed mastitis (not in the first week of the trial; the baby was 32 days old, 28 days after randomization). Three women reported that they had not taken the capsules.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: Cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: A randomized treatment trial [^114D3RWB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

As we intended to recruit over 500 women, we planned a multi-centred trial involving a number of public and private maternity hospitals in inner Melbourne. All hospitals provide a breastfeeding clinic staffed with International Board Certified Lactation Consultants for women encountering breastfeeding difficulties following hospital discharge. The public hospitals, where women tend to have shorter hospital stays, also provide home visits by domiciliary midwives post-discharge. It was foreseen that there would be replication in the requirements of the hospital ethics committees and logistical difficulties for one researcher (LA) to conduct the study on multiple sites.

Approval was obtained from the ethics committees at La Trobe University (20/11/2000), Royal Women's Hospital (6/9/2000), Mercy Hospital for Women (12/2/2001), Frances Perry House (23/8/2001), Freemasons Maternity Hospital (15/3/2001), and Cabrini Private Hospital (24/4/2002). One private hospital did not appear to have a procedure in place for dealing with a research proposal. Negotiations continued with this hospital from late 2000 until mid-2002, when the hospital insisted that we sign a sponsor indemnity form, which the university advised us against.

The researcher visited the postnatal wards and breastfeeding clinics of these hospitals each day or every second day and asked a senior member of the nursing staff if there were any breastfeeding women with damaged nipples in the ward.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^116Lj4jm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

We retrieved 11 unopened bottles of Protat aftercare solution from various chain stores in Sydney and Wollongong on May 14, 2021. Nine had the implicated batch number and two had different batch numbers. Samples from three unopened bottles of the implicated batch were positive for P. aeruginosa, showing 850–2,000 CFU/mL. The remaining bottles showed no growth. Additional samples from 48 unopened Protat aftercare bottles, with the implicated batch number from South Australia, were tested, and 10 of those bottles were cultured with no bacterial growth.

WGS was performed for 28 bacterial isolates. This included 16 isolates from clinical samples, three from unopened bottles of Protat aftercare solution, and nine from opened bottles of the same solution. Out of these, 27 isolates were identified as P. aeruginosa and attributed to ST988. ST988 is a rare type that has not been previously identified in local isolate collections. The analysis identified 0–9 single-nucleotide polymorphism differences between the 27 isolate genomes. Sequences with fewer than 25 single-nucleotide differences were regarded as a genomically linked cluster. Cluster analysis confirmed that all 27 submitted ST988 isolates were genomically linked. The remaining P. aeruginosa isolate was from a clinical sample.

### Ceftriaxone and dextrose [^114Mx34R]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Adult population**: Ceftriaxone for injection and dextrose injection in the DUPLEX® Container should be used only in patients who require the entire 1 or 2 gram dose and not any fraction thereof. The recommended adult dosages are outlined in Table 1. Ceftriaxone for injection and dextrose injection should be administered intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required. When treating infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days.

- **Pediatric patients**: Ceftriaxone for injection and dextrose injection in the DUPLEX® Container is designed to deliver a 1 g or 2 g dose of ceftriaxone. To prevent unintentional overdose, this product should not be used in pediatric patients who require less than the full adult dose of ceftriaxone.

- **Preparation for use of ceftriaxone for injection and dextrose injection in DUPLEX® Container**: This reconstituted solution is for intravenous use only. Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use would result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.

### Cefotan [^113qdLaU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefotan and other antibacterial drugs, Cefotan should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empirical selection of therapy.

- **Therapeutic treatment**: Cefotan® (Cefotetan for Injection, USP) is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible strains of designated organisms:

	- **Urinary tract infections** caused by E. coli, Klebsiella spp. (including K. pneumoniae), Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, and Morganella morganii.

	- **Lower respiratory tract infections** caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible), Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella species (including K. pneumoniae), E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens.

	- **Skin and skin structure infections** due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible), Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Peptococcus niger, and Peptostreptococcus species.

	- **Gynecologic infections** caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible), Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible), and Streptococcus species.

### Cefoxitin [^111zhWAe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The total daily dose should be reduced when cefoxitin for injection is administered to patients with transient or persistent reduction of urinary output due to renal insufficiency because high and prolonged serum antibiotic concentrations can occur in such individuals from usual doses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Antibiotics, including cephalosporins, should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. As with other antibiotics, prolonged use of cefoxitin for injection may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential, and if superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

Prescribing cefoxitin for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to benefit the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including cefoxitin for injection, should only be used to treat bacterial infections, as they do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When cefoxitin for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and increase the likelihood of resistance development.

### The hole picture: Risks, decision making, purpose, regulations, and the future of body piercing [^114QRci1]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Can it be said that body piercing is ubiquitous, found across all socioeconomic groups? The major concentration is among adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 30 years, with some studies indicating 50% of the population. Commonly identified physical risks include bleeding, tissue trauma, and bacterial infections; psychosocial risks involve unhappiness, low self-esteem, and disappointment.

The Health Belief Model is employed to explain decision making; purposes for body piercing consistently center on personal expression (self-identity) and uniqueness. The international and US body piercing regulations are discussed, emphasizing the need for tracking complications globally and standardizing regulations. Proactive health education for clients and health providers remains a priority.

### Haemophilus aphrophilus endocarditis after tongue piercing [^113x8wfa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

In the United States, body piercing, which is becoming increasingly common, is mainly performed by unlicensed practitioners. Only 26% of states have regulatory authority over tattooing establishments, and only six of these states exercise authority over body-piercing establishments. Piercing occurs in regulated and unregulated shops, department stores, jewelry shops, homes, or physicians' offices. Generally, no antibiotic is used, and sterilization methods vary.

Studies show that ear piercing can cause cephalic tetanus (a local form of tetanus caused by wounds or other head and neck infections), Pseudomonas infections, or perichondrial auricular abscesses, especially with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tongue or oral piercing can cause Ludwig's angina or may be complicated by normal oral flora, such as Haemophilus aphrophilus, as in this case. Genital piercing may result in Escherichia coli infection and may increase the risk for sexually transmitted diseases through tissue damage and exposure, as well as unwanted pregnancy due to condom rupture. Systemic infections, such as toxic shock syndrome or sepsis, have also been reported.

Among noninfectious cases, granulomatous perichondritis of the nasal ala, sarcoidlike foreign body reaction from multiple piercings, paraphimosis from a distal penis piercing, and speech impairment, together with difficulty in chewing and swallowing from oral jewelry, have been reported. Metal-associated problems include allergy (especially to nickel), eczematous rash, and lymphocytoma. We describe an incidence of H. aphrophilus endocarditis following tongue piercing.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^117XT97L]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

We initially used broad case definitions to increase the sensitivity of active case finding. A confirmed case-patient was defined as a person who had a P. aeruginosa infection following a recent ear piercing. A probable case-patient was someone with no cultures taken or no culture growth but had attended the implicated facility, other facilities of the same franchise, or used the same brand of aftercare solution.

- **Emergency department syndromic surveillance**: The NSW Public Health Rapid Emergency, Disease, and Syndromic Surveillance (PHREDSS) system monitors treatment sought at most public hospital emergency departments in the state in near-real time. Patients are coded according to their illness and discharge destination (e.g. admitted or discharged home). We identified possible infection cases at hospitals via PHREDSS by using keyword searches.

- **Initial investigations**: We obtained details of procedures performed on confirmed case-patients, aftercare solutions used, notifications and complaints, and client lists from the initially implicated piercing salon. Additional cases of piercing-related infections in residents of Greater Sydney, Wollongong, and Newcastle were identified by examining the PHREDSS database.

- **Statewide investigations and case finding**: Beginning on April 30, 2021, weekly PHREDSS line lists of emergency department visits and admissions for piercing-related infections were provided to other public health units (PHUs) across NSW.

### Ofloxacin [^113A8jH6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, even if the symptoms improve. If ofloxacin otic solution ear drops are not used for as long as prescribed, the infection may be more likely to return.

- **Missed dose**: In patients with an ear canal infection ("swimmer's ear"), it is important to take the drops every day. If you miss a dose that was scheduled for earlier in the day, such as 8 AM, you should take that day's dose as soon as possible and then return to your regular daily dosing schedule. In patients with a middle ear infection, if a dose of ofloxacin otic solution is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and return to the regular dosing schedule. Do not use a double dose unless the doctor has instructed you to do so. If the infection is not improved after one week, consult your doctor. If you have two or more episodes of drainage within six months, it is recommended that you see your doctor for further evaluation.

- **Activities to avoid**: It is important that the infected ear(s) remain clean and dry. When bathing, avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet. Avoid swimming unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

### Improving the correct prescription and dosage of gentamicin [^112FNi87]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Gentamicin is an antibiotic from the class of aminoglycosides. It is predominantly used to treat gram-negative infections, particularly urinary, biliary, and abdominal, but it also has some anti-staphylococcal activity. Gentamicin is increasingly used in clinical care because of its lack of 'diffogenicity' (causing Clostridium difficile). However, there are several problems associated with it. Gentamicin is potentially nephrotoxic and ototoxic if administered incorrectly.

A patient is given a dose according to their body weight. For obese patients, the dosage is based on a corrected body weight. The patient's renal function also determines the dose in mg/kg. Once a patient receives an initial dose of gentamicin, a level should be taken 6–14 hours after to assess how well their kidneys are clearing the antibiotic, as it is renally excreted. This method is known as the once-daily extended interval regimen, which is replacing the traditional method of dosing based on peak and trough levels. It is presumed to be a safer and more effective method for administering the antibiotic.

Calculating the correct dose of gentamicin involves determining the patient's ideal body weight, followed by the corrected body weight, and finally their creatinine clearance. Not adhering to this protocol can lead to significant variations in dosing and subsequent prescription.

### Body piercing: Complications and prevention of health risks [^116BgEGg]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Body and earlobe piercing are common practices in the United States today. Minor complications, including infection and bleeding, occur frequently; although rare, major complications have been reported. Healthcare professionals should be cognizant of the medical consequences of body piercing. Complications vary depending on the body-piercing site, materials used, experience of the practitioner, hygiene regimens, and aftercare by the recipient. Localized infections are common. Systemic infections, such as viral hepatitis and toxic shock syndrome, and distant infections, such as endocarditis and brain abscesses, have been reported. Other general complications include allergic contact dermatitis (e.g. from nickel or latex), bleeding, scarring and keloid formation, nerve damage, and interference with medical procedures such as intubation and blood/organ donation.

Site-specific complications have been reported. Oral piercings may lead to difficulty speaking and eating, excessive salivation, and dental problems. Oral and nasal piercings may be aspirated or become embedded, requiring surgical removal. Piercing tracts in the ear, nipple, and navel are prone to tearing. Galactorrhea may be caused by stimulation from a nipple piercing. Genital piercings may lead to infertility secondary to infection and obstruction of the urethra secondary to scar formation. In men, priapism and fistula formation may occur. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and have a piercing or are considering obtaining one need to be aware of the rare complications that may affect them or their child.

### Fuzeon [^114U5Eg6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

To assure the safe and effective use of Fuzeon, the following information and instructions should be provided to patients:

- **Injection site reactions**: Inform patients that injection site reactions occur in almost all individuals taking Fuzeon. Patients must be familiar with the Fuzeon injection instructions to ensure proper administration and monitor for signs or symptoms of cellulitis or local infection. Instruct them on when to contact their healthcare provider regarding these reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Administration with Biojector 2000**: Inform patients that nerve pain (neuralgia and/or paresthesia) can occur at anatomical sites where large nerves are close to the skin, as well as bruising and hematomas with the use of the Biojector 2000 needle-free device for Fuzeon administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Post-injection bleeding**: Advise patients about the risk of post-injection bleeding if they are receiving anticoagulants or have coagulation disorders such as hemophilia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Systemic hypersensitivity**: Advise patients of the possibility of a systemic hypersensitivity reaction to Fuzeon. They should discontinue therapy and immediately seek medical evaluation if they develop signs or symptoms such as combinations of rash, fever, nausea and vomiting, chills, rigors, and/or hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions].

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: Cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: A randomized treatment trial [^112vTHkN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Our definitions of nipple damage are as follows: mild, 1 or 2 mm wide; moderate, 3–9 mm wide; severe, greater than 10 mm wide and/or yellow color visible in the crack. In addition to a clinical assessment, a more permanent record of nipple damage was created using digital photography. It was planned for the photographs to be reviewed independently by three lactation consultants to allow a thorough assessment of nipple damage and changes over time, rather than relying on the clinical assessment alone (as the trial ended prematurely, this did not take place).

Furthermore, although the WHO defines mastitis as an inflammation of the breast, there is no generally agreed-upon definition of mastitis for research purposes. The definition of mastitis used for this study was that a woman reported:

- **At least two breast symptoms**: (pain, redness, lump) and at least one of fever or 'flu-like symptoms.

### Is chronic nipple piercing associated with hyperprolactinemia [^111mHCGW]. Pituitary (2013). Low credibility.

Literature on hyperprolactinemia in the setting of a nipple piercing is limited to individuals with concomitant breast/chest wall infection. It is unclear if chronic nipple stimulation from a piercing alone can cause sustained elevations of serum prolactin. Nipple piercing is emerging as a more mainstream societal form of body art, and the answer to this clinical question would potentially alter patient management. Our aim was to assess serum prolactin levels in subjects with nipple piercing.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Men and women ≥ 18 years old with nipple piercing(s) present > 6 months.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Women who are pregnant, lactating or < 6 months postpartum; subjects on medications known to increase prolactin levels; chest wall/breast infection at the time of phlebotomy or conditions known to be associated with hyperprolactinemia.

Three men and eight women were enrolled. Median (range) ages for men and women were 33 (24–42) and 27 years (23–42), respectively. All except one subject had bilateral piercings. The median interval from nipple piercing to blood draw was 4.0 (2.0–12.0) years. None of the subjects had hyperprolactinemia. Median (range) prolactin levels for men and women were 5.6 ng/mL (3.8–7.4) and 8.0 ng/mL (2.8–10.9), respectively. Our results suggest that in the absence of any concomitant infection, chronic nipple piercing is not associated with hyperprolactinemia.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: Cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: A randomized treatment trial [^114aZF8M]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

A small, non-blinded RCT (randomized controlled trial) reported that oral antibiotics reduced the incidence of mastitis in lactating women with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-colonized cracked nipples. We aimed to replicate the study with a more rigorous design and adequate sample size.

- **Methods**: Our intention was to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if an antibiotic (flucloxacillin) could prevent mastitis in lactating women with S. aureus-colonized cracked nipples. We planned to recruit two groups of 133 women with S. aureus-colonized cracked nipples.

- **Results**: We spent over twelve months submitting applications to five hospital ethics committees and seven funding bodies before commencing the trial. Recruitment to the trial was very slow; only ten women were randomized to the trial after twelve months, leading to the trial being stopped early. In retrospect, we should have conducted a feasibility study, which would have revealed the low number of women in these Melbourne hospitals (maternity wards and breastfeeding clinics) with damaged nipples. The appropriate use of antibiotics for breastfeeding women with cracked nipples still needs to be tested.

### Jasmiel [^113SEPMm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any of the above conditions, as your healthcare provider can recommend another method of birth control.

What else should I know about taking Jasmiel? Birth control pills do not protect you against any sexually transmitted disease, including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Do not skip any pills, even if you do not have sex often.

If you miss a period, you could be pregnant. However, some women miss periods or have light periods on birth control pills, even when they are not pregnant. Contact your healthcare provider for advice if you:

- Think you are pregnant.
- Miss one period and have not taken your birth control pills every day.
- Miss two periods in a row.

Birth control pills should not be taken during pregnancy. However, birth control pills taken by accident during pregnancy are not known to cause birth defects.

You should stop Jasmiel at least four weeks before you have major surgery and not restart it until at least two weeks after the surgery due to an increased risk of blood clots. If you are breastfeeding, consider another birth control method until you are ready to stop breastfeeding. Birth control pills that contain estrogen, like Jasmiel, may decrease the amount of milk you make. A small amount of the pill's hormones pass into breast milk.

### Interventions for treating painful nipples among breastfeeding women [^114wik9k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Leading health authorities all recommend exclusive breastfeeding for up to six months postpartum. Although most women initiate breastfeeding, many discontinue due to difficult experiences rather than by choice. A common breastfeeding challenge is painful nipples, often caused by poor infant positioning or latch. Various interventions to alleviate nipple pain in breastfeeding women have been evaluated, but the most effective treatment remains unclear. Understanding nipple pain and exploring treatment options are crucial for improving breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, and systematically addressing one of the most frequent issues faced by breastfeeding women.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of all interventions on the resolution or reduction of nipple pain, and the impact on other outcomes such as nipple trauma, infections, breast mastitis, breastfeeding duration, exclusivity, and maternal satisfaction.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2014) and examined secondary references.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials designed to evaluate any intervention for treating nipple pain among breastfeeding women were eligible. Trials using a cluster-randomized design were included, while cross-over trials were not. Interventions compared included each other or usual care.

### Gonal-f [^112AQHSq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise women not to breastfeed because the secretion of prolactin during lactation can result in an inadequate response to ovarian stimulation with Gonal-F [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

- **Dosing and use of GONAL-F multi dose**: Instruct women and men on the correct usage and dosing of GONAL-F [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4, 2.5)]. Caution against changing the dosage or the schedule of administration unless instructed to do so by a healthcare provider.

- **Duration and necessary monitoring in patients undergoing therapy**: Prior to beginning therapy with GONAL-F, inform women and men about the time commitment and monitoring procedures necessary for treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4, 2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

- **Instructions regarding a missed dose**: Inform women and men that if they miss or forget to take a dose of GONAL-F, they should not double the next dose and should call their healthcare provider for further dosing instructions.

### Nipple piercing may be contraindicated in male patients with chest implants [^1143F51t]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The authors present a man who underwent chest augmentation and nipple piercing. The patient developed chronic nipple infection, which led to unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures, serious implant infection, and eventually urgent explantation. This unfavorable scenario illustrates the distinct features of the procedure in men, which include the close proximity of the nipple to the implant and reduced awareness by healthcare providers. Based on this case, the authors recommend avoiding nipple piercing in men with chest implants.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^116NC1AY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

We found microbiological, environmental, and epidemiologic evidence linking a single batch of aftercare solution to a piercing-related P. aeruginosa infection outbreak across NSW during April–June 2021. The distinct whole-genome sequence type shared by 27 isolates from various sources, including clinical specimens and aftercare solution samples (both client-used and unopened bottles), established a single common source for this outbreak. Therefore, we successfully used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to establish a causative link between an aftercare product and a piercing-related P. aeruginosa infection outbreak.

Piercing-related P. aeruginosa infection outbreaks associated with aftercare solutions have been reported previously. In a 2016 outbreak in England, variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) typing was used to identify isolates from clinical samples collected from suspected case-patients and from environmental samples (opened and unopened bottles of aftercare solutions) to investigate possible links. The VNTR type for cases connected to that 2016 outbreak differed from cases unrelated to the outbreak and matched the VNTR type of isolates found in bottles of aftercare solution. In another outbreak in 2016 linked to a northwestern England piercing event, VNTR typing was also used to identify isolates from clinical samples of suspected case-patients, which matched isolates from water samples collected from the premises. Molecular subtyping was used to investigate an outbreak at an Oregon, USA, jewelry store in 2004 and successfully linked isolates from case-patients with P. aeruginosa.

### Silicone nipple shields: An innovative postoperative dressing technique after nipple reconstruction [^1153JNkz]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The newly reconstructed nipple is extremely sensitive to mechanical pressure and shearing forces, which can cause flap necrosis and sloughing of the skin, eventually promoting infection. Available dressing solutions are cumbersome, inefficient, displeasing, or otherwise not readily obtainable.

- **Methods**: In this study, 10 patients with newly reconstructed nipples were instructed to use breastfeeding nipple shields as the sole means of nipple dressing after the reconstruction procedure.

- **Results**: No complications were observed overall. Patients reported full adherence to the postoperative dressing regimen as well as ease of use, availability, low costs, and pleasing aesthetic appearance under garments.

- **Discussion**: Silicone breastfeeding nipple shields offer an efficient, affable, cheap, widely available, and aesthetically pleasing form of postoperative dressing for reconstructed nipples. Their use may enhance patient compliance with the dressing regimen and lower the postoperative complication rate.

### Community outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with contaminated piercing aftercare solution, Australia, 2021 [^115SHKFr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

The implicated solution was manufactured by Protat Tattoo Supplies. Case definitions for probable cases include Protat aftercare use for Franchise A piercings. This case definition was used to help monitor the burden of disease during the outbreak and monitor the involvement of batches other than the implicated batch.

- **Outbreak control measures**: On May 4, after identifying several additional P. aeruginosa piercing-related infections in clients who had attended Franchise A stores across multiple NSW local health districts, the implicated franchisee agreed to cease using and selling Protat aftercare solution pending further investigation. NSW Health issued a clinician alert on May 13 to advise of an increase in hospital admissions because of P. aeruginosa infections after piercing procedures and to encourage clinicians to consider P. aeruginosa in patients with infections at piercing sites.

	- After confirmation of the presence of P. aeruginosa in unopened bottles of Protat aftercare solution, the distributor/manufacturer issued a voluntary recall of the contaminated batch from market shelves on May 14 and issued a product recall media release on May 31. On June 1, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission published a recall notice for the implicated batch, which had been supplied to Franchise A stores in NSW, Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia.

### Easy-ceft1g [^112JuMjT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Pediatric patients**: For the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg, given once a day or in equally divided doses twice a day. The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams. For the treatment of acute bacterial otitis media, a single intramuscular dose of 50 mg/kg (not to exceed 1 gram) is recommended (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). For the treatment of serious miscellaneous infections other than meningitis, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg, given in divided doses every 12 hours. The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams. In the treatment of meningitis, it is recommended that the initial therapeutic dose be 100 mg/kg (not to exceed 4 grams). Thereafter, a total daily dose of 100 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 4 grams daily) is recommended. The daily dose may be administered once a day or in equally divided doses every 12 hours. The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 14 days.

- **Adults**: The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day or in equally divided doses twice a day, depending on the type and severity of infection. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams. If *Chlamydia trachomatis* is a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism. For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg is recommended. For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram should be administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery.

### Effect of nipple shield use on milk removal: A mechanistic study [^115ZE5HB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Breastfeeding mothers of term healthy infants aged 1 to 6 months were recruited through the Australian Breastfeeding Association and international board certified lactation consultants. These participants were associated with the Breastfeeding Centre of Western Australia, King Edward Memorial Hospital, or recruited from the community between August 2016 and July 2018. The study focused on mothers who were predominantly breastfeeding, defined as feeding no more than one bottle of infant formula per day, and who had prior experience using a breast pump.

- **Participants**: Two groups were recruited for the study. The Pain Group (PG) consisted of mothers using a nipple shield to manage unexplained nipple pain. The Control Group (CG) included mothers without breastfeeding difficulties. Inclusion criteria for the PG required mothers to have persistent nipple pain during breastfeeding despite professional lactation advice. For the CG, inclusion required mothers to have no breastfeeding pain or difficulties. Exclusion criteria for both groups included mothers with a diagnosed cause of nipple pain, such as infection or nipple vasospasm, a history of breast and/or nipple surgery or piercings, mothers under 18 years of age, and those unable to read and speak English without assistance. Additionally, mothers of infants born before 37 completed weeks of gestation, those with infants having an oral anomaly, prior oral surgery, or a diagnosed health condition were excluded. Mothers completed a demographic questionnaire at recruitment.

The study was approved by The University of Western Australia (RA/4/1/7863). Mothers provided written informed consent prior to participation.

### Body piercing complicated by atypical mycobacterial infections [^1177wgPP]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Body piercing is a growing trend, especially among young people. However, the literature on complications of piercing consists mostly of case reports involving ear piercing. Previous reported complications of piercing include contact dermatitis, keloids, traumatic tearing, viral transmission, and bacterial infections. We report two patients who presented with atypical mycobacterial infections at body piercing sites. It is important to recognize the association between piercing and mycobacterial infections so that tissue can be obtained for histopathologic examination and appropriate culture.

### Kalliga [^114mrLqb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The dosage of Kalliga™ for the initial cycle of therapy is one white to off-white "active" tablet administered daily from the 1st day through the 21st day of the menstrual cycle, counting the first day of menstrual flow as "Day 1". Tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One white to off-white "active" tablet daily for 21 days, then one green "reminder" tablet daily for 7 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started and a white to off-white "active" tablet is taken the next day.

Use of Kalliga™ for contraception may be initiated 4 weeks postpartum in women who elect not to breastfeed. When the tablets are administered during the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS concerning thromboembolic disease. See also PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers). If the patient starts on Kalliga™ postpartum and has not yet had a period, she should be instructed to use another method of contraception until a white to off-white "active" tablet has been taken daily for 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.

If the patient misses one (1) white to off-white "active" tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the white to off-white "active" tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two (2) white to off-white "active" tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, she should take two (2) white to off-white "active" tablets the day she remembers and two (2) white to…

### Enhanced identification of postoperative infections among outpatients [^111s42wa]. Emerging infectious diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The identification of postoperative infections in outpatients is categorized by the type and timing of the infection concerning childbirth. These infections can be either specified or unspecified and are further classified based on antepartum or postpartum conditions:

- **Specified infections include**:
	- 675.81 Other specified infection of the breast and nipple associated with childbirth, delivered, with or without mention of antepartum condition
	- 675.82 Other specified infection of the breast and nipple associated with childbirth, delivered, with mention of postpartum complication
	- 675.83 Other specified infection of the breast and nipple, antepartum
	- 675.84 Other specified infection of the breast and nipple, postpartum

- **Unspecified infections include**:
	- 675.9 Unspecified infection of the breast and nipple associated with childbirth
	- 675.90 Unspecified infection of the breast and nipple, unspecified as to prenatal or postnatal episode
	- 675.91 Unspecified infection of the breast and nipple associated with childbirth, delivered, with or without mention of antepartum condition
	- 675.92 Unspecified infection of the breast and nipple associated with childbirth, delivered, with mention of postpartum complication
	- 675.93 Unspecified infection of the breast and nipple, antepartum
	- 675.94 Unspecified infection of the breast and nipple, postpartum

This classification aids healthcare professionals in recognizing and addressing postoperative infections timely and efficiently.

### Cefdinir [^111pj5Yr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The recommended dosage and duration of treatment for infections in adults and adolescents are described in the following chart; the total daily dose for all infections is 600 mg. Once-daily dosing for 10 days is as effective as BID dosing. However, once-daily dosing has not been studied in pneumonia or skin infections; therefore, cefdinir capsules should be administered twice daily for these infections. Cefdinir capsules may be taken without regard to meals.

- **Patients with renal insufficiency**: For adult patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, the dose of cefdinir should be 300 mg given once daily. Creatinine clearance is difficult to measure in outpatients. However, the following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance (CLcr) in adult patients. For estimates to be valid, serum creatinine levels should reflect steady-state levels of renal function.

	- **Males**: CLcr = (weight) (140 – age) / (72) (serum creatinine)

	- **Females**: CLcr = 0.85 x [value from the males' equation]

	- Here, creatinine clearance is in mL/min, age is in years, weight is in kilograms, and serum creatinine is in mg/dL.

	- **Pediatric patients**: The following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance in pediatric patients:

		CLcr = K x body length or height / serum creatinine

		where K = 0.55 for pediatric patients older than 1 year and 0.45 for infants (up to 1 year). In the above equation, creatinine clearance is in mL/min/1.73 m², body length or height is in centimeters, and serum creatinine is in mg/dL.
