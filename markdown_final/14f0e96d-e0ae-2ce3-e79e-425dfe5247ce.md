## Question

Did the TaLaR trial demonstrate that transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) is noninferior to laparoscopic TME (laTME) for mid–low rectal cancer? Include the 3-year disease-free survival rates, the absolute difference with its 97.5% CI, and the noninferiority margin.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the TaLaR randomized trial demonstrated that transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) is noninferior to laparoscopic TME (laTME) for mid-low rectal cancer, and specifically wants the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates, the absolute difference with its 97.5% confidence interval, and the prespecified noninferiority margin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and whether it was powered for a noninferiority conclusion. Then, I should verify the exact DFS estimates and the confidence interval for the difference. Next, I will check the noninferiority margin and whether the lower bound of the CI meets it. After that, I should review secondary outcomes like local recurrence and overall survival to ensure consistency. Finally, I will consider external validity, surgeon expertise, and guideline context before synthesizing a clear answer with the requested figures.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and analytic framework. TaLaR was a multicenter, open-label, phase 3, randomized noninferiority trial in 16 centers in China that enrolled 1115 patients with clinical stage I–III mid-low rectal cancer and used 3-year DFS as the primary endpoint with a prespecified noninferiority margin of −10 percentage points, analyzed with a modified intention-to-treat approach and a one-sided α of 2.5% for the noninferiority test, which aligns with standard noninferiority methodology [^112JsaEs].

> I need to verify the exact DFS results. In the primary analysis, 3-year DFS was 82.1% (97.5% CI, 78.4%–85.8%) in the taTME group versus 79.4% (97.5% CI, 75.6%–83.4%) in the laTME group, yielding an absolute difference of 2.7 percentage points with a 97.5% CI of −3.0% to 8.1% [^112JsaEs] [^114cpnwH]. Wait, let me double-check the confidence interval direction: yes, the lower tail of the 2-tailed 97.5% CI for the difference is −3.0%, which sits above the −10% noninferiority margin, supporting noninferiority by definition in a noninferiority trial [^112JsaEs].

> Hold on, I should verify the noninferiority margin and the statistical interpretation. The prespecified noninferiority margin was −10 percentage points, and because the lower bound of the 97.5% CI for the difference (−3.0%) is greater than −10%, the trial meets the criterion for noninferiority of taTME compared with laTME for 3-year DFS [^112JsaEs].

> Next, I should review secondary outcomes to ensure consistency. Local recurrence at 3 years was 3.6% with taTME versus 4.4% with laTME, and overall survival at 3 years was 92.6% with taTME versus 90.7% with laTME, with neither difference reaching statistical significance, which reinforces the plausibility of the noninferiority finding for DFS [^112JsaEs] [^114cpnwH].

> But wait, what about external validity and surgeon expertise. I need to ensure we don't overgeneralize. The participating surgeons were highly experienced, with each team having performed at least 100 laTME and 50 taTME procedures and passing credentialing via video review, and the trial excluded patients with threatened circumferential resection margins on MRI, which may limit applicability to more challenging anatomies or less experienced centers; nonetheless, the results are consistent with contemporary guidance that taTME can be considered in selected patients when performed by experienced teams [^1166Dph6] [^115xbeRw] [^1168ZfFY].

> Let me consider the broader evidence context. Earlier randomized trials comparing laparoscopic to open TME often failed to meet noninferiority on composite pathologic endpoints but ultimately showed similar long-term oncologic outcomes, underscoring why DFS is the more clinically relevant endpoint here; TaLaR's DFS noninferiority aligns with that pattern and provides the first high-quality RCT evidence for taTME versus laTME, complementing meta-analyses and cohort data suggesting comparable or favorable perioperative and pathologic outcomes in experienced hands [^113x4B2p] [^115ycczT] [^1127DUGr] [^112JsaEs].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, the TaLaR randomized trial demonstrated that transanal TME is noninferior to laparoscopic TME for mid-low rectal cancer with respect to 3-year disease-free survival, with taTME 82.1% versus laTME 79.4% and an absolute difference of 2.7 percentage points (97.5% CI, −3.0% to 8.1%), where the lower bound of the CI exceeds the prespecified −10% noninferiority margin, establishing noninferiority [^112JsaEs] [^114cpnwH].

The TaLaR trial demonstrated that transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) is **noninferior to laparoscopic TME (laTME)** for mid-low rectal cancer at 3 years, with a 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 82.1% in the taTME group versus 79.4% in the laTME group (absolute difference 2.7%; 97.5% CI, −3.0% to 8.1%) [^112JsaEs]. The lower bound of the 97.5% CI (−3.0%) lies above the prespecified noninferiority margin of −10%, confirming noninferiority [^112JsaEs]. Local recurrence and overall survival were also similar between groups, supporting oncologic equivalence [^114cpnwH].

## Trial design and methodology

- **Design**: Multicenter, open-label, randomized, noninferiority, phase 3 trial.
- **Participants**: 1,115 patients aged 18–75 years with clinical stage I–III mid-low rectal cancer (≤ 10 cm from anal verge) [^1166Dph6].
- **Interventions**: 1:1 randomization to taTME vs laTME [^1166Dph6].
- **Primary endpoint**: 3-year DFS; noninferiority margin set at −10% [^116Y5P5L].
- **Analysis**: Modified intention-to-treat (mITT) with 97.5% CI for the difference in DFS [^116Y5P5L].

---

## Primary outcome: 3-year disease-free survival

- **taTME**: 82.1% (97.5% CI, 78.4%–85.8%) [^112JsaEs].
- **laTME**: 79.4% (97.5% CI, 75.6%–83.4%) [^112JsaEs].
- **Absolute difference**: 2.7% (97.5% CI, −3.0% to 8.1%) [^112JsaEs].
- **Noninferiority**: The lower bound of the 97.5% CI (−3.0%) exceeds the −10% margin, establishing noninferiority [^116Y5P5L].

---

## Secondary outcomes

- **Local recurrence**: 3.6% (taTME) vs 4.4% (laTME); no significant difference [^114cpnwH].
- **Overall survival**: 92.6% (taTME) vs 90.7% (laTME); no significant difference [^114cpnwH].
- **Pathologic outcomes**: Similar rates of negative circumferential and distal margins and complete TME between groups [^115xRJV1].

---

## Clinical implications

These results indicate that taTME achieves **oncologic outcomes comparable to laTME** at 3 years, supporting its use in experienced hands for mid-low rectal cancer. The findings align with prior evidence of similar or improved pathologic quality and lower conversion rates with taTME, though long-term outcomes and surgeon expertise remain key considerations [^1127DUGr] [^11125Xmh] [^1168ZfFY].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Surgeon expertise**: Participating surgeons were highly experienced; results may not generalize to low-volume centers [^1166Dph6].
- **Learning curve**: taTME has a recognized learning curve, and outcomes may vary during early adoption [^111ejtVp].
- **Longer follow-up**: 5-year outcomes are pending to confirm durability [^1166Dph6].

---

The TaLaR trial confirms that taTME is **noninferior to laTME** for mid-low rectal cancer at 3 years, with similar DFS, local recurrence, and overall survival, supporting its role when performed by experienced surgeons [^112JsaEs].

Importance

Previous studies have demonstrated the advantages of short-term histopathological outcomes and complications associated with transanal total mesorectal excision (TME) compared with laparoscopic TME. However, the long-term oncological outcomes of transanal TME remain ambiguous. This study aims to compare 3-year disease-free survival of transanal TME with laparoscopic TME.

Objective

To evaluate 3-year disease-free survival between transanal TME and laparoscopic TME in patients with rectal cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized, open-label, noninferiority, phase 3 clinical trial was performed in 16 different centers in China. Between April 2016 and June 2021, a total of 1115 patients with clinical stage I to III mid-low rectal cancer were enrolled. The last date of participant follow-up was in June 2024.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio before their surgical procedure to undergo either transanal TME (n = 558) or laparoscopic TME (n = 557).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was 3-year disease-free survival, with a noninferiority margin of -10% for the comparison between transanal TME and laparoscopic TME. Secondary outcomes included 3-year overall survival and 3-year local recurrence.

Results

In the primary analysis set, the median patient age was 60 years. A total of 692 male and 397 female patients were included in the analysis. Three-year disease-free survival was 82.1% (97.5% CI, 78.4%-85.8%) for the transanal TME group and 79.4% (97.5% CI, 75.6%-83.4%) for the laparoscopic TME group, with a difference of 2.7% (97.5% CI, -3.0% to 8.1%). The lower tail of a 2-tailed 97.5% CI for the group difference in 3-year disease-free survival was above the noninferiority margin of -10 percentage points. Furthermore, the 3-year local recurrence was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.0%-5.1%) for transanal TME and 4.4% (95% CI, 2.6%-6.1%) for laparoscopic TME. Three-year overall survival was 92.6% (95% CI, 90.4%-94.8%) for transanal TME and 90.7% (95% CI, 88.3%-93.2%) for laparoscopic TME.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with mid-low rectal cancer, 3-year disease-free survival for transanal TME was noninferior to that of laparoscopic TME.

### Transanal vs laparoscopic total mesorectal excision and 3-year disease-free survival in rectal cancer: the TaLaR randomized clinical trial [^114cpnwH]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study TaLaR was published by Ziwei Zeng and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Rectal cancer. In the TaLaR study, the trial question was: is transanal total mesorectal excision noninferior to laparoscopic total mesorectal excision in patients with mid-low rectal cancer? In the TaLaR study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the TaLaR study, the population was: 1089 patients (397 female, 692 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients aged 18–75 years with clinical stage I-III rectal adenocarcinoma below the peritoneal reflection. The key exclusion criteria were T1 cancers amenable to local resection; confirmed involvement of the circumferential resection margin by preoperative imaging; abdominoperineal resection; tumors involving the internal sphincter or levator ani; contraindications to surgery. In the TaLaR study, the interventions were: n = 544 transanal TME (rectum mobilized and resected transanally according to total mesorectal excision principles) n = 545 laparoscopic TME (traditional laparoscopic total mesorectal excision performed via standard laparoscopic techniques). In the TaLaR study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in disease-free survival at 3 years (82.1% vs. 79.4%; HR 0.86, 97.5% CI 0.63 to 1.18). In the TaLaR study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in local recurrence at 3 years (3.6% vs. 4.4%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.49) No significant difference in overall survival at 3 years (92.6% vs. 90.7%; HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.92) No significant difference in the rate of overall first-time recurrence within 3 years (15.8% vs. 17.6%; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.18). In the TaLaR study, the conclusion was: in adult patients aged 18–75 years with clinical stage I-III rectal adenocarcinoma below the peritoneal reflection, transanal TME was noninferior to laparoscopic TME with respect to a disease-free survival at 3 years.

METHODS

Study Design

This trial of transanal versus conventional laparoscopic TME for rectal cancer (TaLaR) is a phase 3, open-labeled, multicenter, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial conducted at 16 centers in 10 Chinese provinces from April 2016 to June 2021. The primary endpoints of this trial were 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) after surgery. Approval was obtained from the institutional review board of each participating hospital, and all patients provided written informed consent. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 02966483. The approved study protocol and statistical analysis plan are available in Supplemental Digital Content (SDC).

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Eligible patients were aged 18 to 75 years; had an American Society of Anesthesiologists class I to III; had clinical stage I to III rectal adenocarcinoma below peritoneal reflection based on preoperative imaging; and were expected to undergo a sphincter-sparing procedure via TME principles for curative intent. Patients were excluded if they had T1 cancers that can be locally resected; had involvement of the circumferential resection margin (CRM) as indicated by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging; had tumors with ingrowth in the internal sphincter or levator ani; and had contraindications for surgery. Detailed eligibility criteria are shown in the study protocol in SDC.

Randomization

Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo either taTME or laTME using a Web site–based randomization system using the central dynamic and with stratification by the center. Participating centers submitted the patient information to the data center at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, where central randomization was done. Information on treatment assignment was subsequently sent to each participating center. The surgeons and patients were not masked to treatment allocation.

Eligibility of Surgeons

Surgeons were selected from the members of the CTESC group who met the following criteria: (1) have a minimum of 100 laTME and 50 taTME procedures performed by each surgical team; (2) were confirmed to be qualified surgeons by the CTESC Research Committee based on the evaluation of the unedited videos of 2 laTME and 2 taTME procedures in obese male patients [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg/m²] with rectal cancer below the peritoneal reflection. After approval by the committee, 17 surgical teams at 16 centers (1 surgical team per center except in 1 center) participated in the trial.

### Morbidity, mortality, and pathologic outcomes of transanal versus laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer short-term outcomes from a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^115ThaJY]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the morbidity, mortality, and pathologic outcomes of transanal total mesorectal resection (taTME) versus laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (laTME) among patients with rectal cancer with clinical stage I to III rectal cancer below the peritoneal reflection.

Background

Studies with sufficient numbers of patients allowing clinical acceptance of taTME for rectal cancer are lacking. Thus, we launched a randomized clinical trial to compare the safety and efficacy of taTME versus laTME.

Methods

A randomized, open-label, phase 3, noninferiority trial was performed at 16 different hospitals in 10 Chinese provinces. The primary endpoints were 3-year disease-free survival and 5-year overall survival. The morbidity and mortality within 30 days after surgery, and pathologic outcomes were compared based on a modified intention-to-treat principle; this analysis was preplanned.

Results

Between April 13, 2016, and June 1, 2021, 1115 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive taTME or laTME. After exclusion of 26 cases, modified intention-to-treat set of taTME versus laTME groups included 544 versus 545 patients. There were no significant differences between taTME and laTME groups in intraoperative complications [26 (4.8%) vs 33 (6.1%); difference, -1.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI), -4.2% to 1.7%; P = 0.42], postoperative morbidity [73 (13.4%) vs 66 (12.1%); difference, 1.2%; 95% CI, -2.8% to 5.2%; P = 0.53), or mortality [1 (0.2%) vs 1 (0.2%)]. Successful resection occurred in 538 (98.9%) versus 538 (98.7%) patients in taTME versus laTME groups (difference, 0.2%; 95% CI, -1.9% to 2.2%; P > 0.99).

Conclusions

Experienced surgeons can safely perform taTME in selected patients with rectal cancer.

### Morbidity, mortality, and pathologic outcomes of transanal versus laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer short-term outcomes from a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^116Y5P5L]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Sample size calculation of this trial was on the basis of 3-year DFS and 5-year OS; but the sample size according to 5-year OS was larger than that based on 3-year DFS. The 3-year DFS and 5-year OS among patients with clinical stage I to III rectal cancer treated with laTME were assumed to be 74.6% and 77.4%, respectively. According to a log-rank test with an α error of 2.5% (in a 2-sided test), power of 80%, and a noninferiority margin of 10%, at least 610 and 910 patients would be required to sufficiently declare taTME noninferior to laTME in 3-year DFS and 5-year OS, respectively. Assuming a dropout rate of 20%, a total of 1114 patients were planned to enroll for this trial.

A modified intention­to­treat method (excluding patients who no longer met inclusion criteria after randomization) was adopted here. Continuous variables were shown as the median and interquartile range (IQR) and were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test if not normally distributed, or were presented as the mean and SD and analyzed using t test if normally distributed. Categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and were analyzed by Fisher exact test or χ² test as appropriate. The Newcombe method with an adjustment for randomization strata was used to calculate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for between-group differences in intraoperative and postoperative complication rates, as well as successful resection rates. SAS 9.3 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for all statistical analyses and a 2-sided P value < 0.05 indicated significance.

DISCUSSION

The key findings of our TaLaR trial demonstrated taTME could yield similar surgical safety and pathologic outcomes as laTME, and thus it generally seems to be safe and feasible for skilled surgeons. To our knowledge, this study is the first reported multicenter RCT with sufficient power to directly compare taTME with laTME. The primary outcomes of 3-year DFS and 5-year OS are expected on a future date.

Given its technical merits, taTME has the potential to improve the quality of resected specimens with superior radicality, particularly for patients with distal rectal cancer, visceral obesity, bulky tumors, or a narrow pelvis. However, controversy with respect to the surgical safety and efficacy of taTME persists. An analysis of 17 reports comparing 600 patients receiving taTME versus 639 cases undergoing laparoscopic/robotic TME showed taTME is associated with a lower risk of positive CRM. By contrast, a recent Norwegian moratorium challenged the status quo of taTME by showing a relatively high local recurrence rate of 9.5% after a median postoperative interval of 11 months. In such a contradictory context, our results are of great significance. The initial results from this trial established the surgical safety and feasibility of taTME performed by skilled surgeons in selected patients with rectal cancer. More importantly, pathologic outcomes indicated had taTME could yield adequate surgical resection, similar to laTME.

### Oncologic outcomes after transanal total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer [^116aBeSC]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the standard surgical technique for rectal cancer because it is associated with reduced local recurrence and improved cancer-free survival rates. Randomized prospective clinical trials, including COLOR II, COREAN, and CLASICC, demonstrated better short-term and long-term perioperative outcomes for laparoscopic TME with no significant differences in local recurrence and disease-free survival compared with the open approach. – More recently, however, oncologic outcomes of the laparoscopic approach have been challenged because the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z6051and the Australasian Laparoscopic Cancer of the Rectum Trial (ALaCaRT)failed to demonstrate the noninferiority of laparoscopic surgery compared with open surgery on pathologic outcomes.

Transanal TME (TaTME) arose as an alternative surgical approach to address the technical challenges encountered during open, laparoscopic, and robotic rectal mobilization and resection of tumors of the mid and low rectum. Compared with laparoscopic and robotic approaches, TaTME may be advantageous for patients with unfavorable anatomic characteristics, such as a narrow pelvis, previous pelvic irradiation, male sex, and high BMI. Early studies demonstrated safety and feasibility with satisfactory short-term oncologic results in highly experienced centers, and consequently TaTME was met with rapid, widespread interest and adoptiondespite a lack of evidence from multicenter, randomized controlled trials. When the first long-term outcome data from an expert center demonstrated low local recurrence rates of 2% in 3 years of follow-up, this further encouraged the global adoption of TaTME.

Regarding surgical interventions for rectal cancer, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for surgery, choice of surgical approach, ASCRS 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that transanal total mesorectal excision for mid and low RCs has similar overall complication rates and functional outcomes as laparoscopic and robotic total mesorectal excision.

### COLOR III: a multicentre randomised clinical trial comparing transanal TME versus laparoscopic TME for mid and low rectal cancer [^115zbNUw]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Total mesorectal excision (TME) is an essential component of surgical management of rectal cancer. Both open and laparoscopic TME have been proven to be oncologically safe. However, it remains a challenge to achieve complete TME with clear circumferential resections margin (CRM) with the conventional transabdominal approach, particularly in mid and low rectal tumours. Transanal TME (TaTME) was developed to improve oncological and functional outcomes of patients with mid and low rectal cancer.

Methods

An international, multicentre, superiority, randomised trial was designed to compare TaTME and conventional laparoscopic TME as the surgical treatment of mid and low rectal carcinomas. The primary endpoint is involved CRM. Secondary endpoints include completeness of mesorectum, residual mesorectum, morbidity and mortality, local recurrence, disease-free and overall survival, percentage of sphincter-saving procedures, functional outcome and quality of life. A Quality Assurance Protocol including centralised MRI review, histopathology re-evaluation, standardisation of surgical techniques, and monitoring and assessment of surgical quality will be conducted.

Discussion

The difference in involvement of CRM between the two treatment strategies is thought to be in favour of the TaTME. TaTME is therefore expected to be superior to laparoscopic TME in terms of oncological outcomes in case of mid and low rectal carcinomas.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, taTME in selected patients with rectal cancer can be safely performed by experienced surgeons and provide satisfactory oncologic radicality. However, the applicability of taTME to rectal cancer patients should continue to be considered until the long-term oncologic outcomes from this well-established RCT are analyzed.

Stage 3: Assessment

At this stage, effectiveness of the new technique against current standards is assessed. A new intervention has shown early promise and is used increasingly by the surgical community; however, the intervention's relative benefit compared with conventional approaches is still uncertain. Properly conducted RCTs should be the primary choice, as new techniques are prone to overoptimistic assessment by their developers. If an RCT is not feasible, which is not exceptional in surgical innovation studies, alternative designs could be used.

The outcomes of the International TaTME Registry also contributed to the set-up of three RCTs. The aim of these studies is to validate the efficacy and safety of TaTME, with respect to perioperative outcomes, short and long-term complications and oncological and functional results. The COLOR III trialand GRECCAR 11 trialare international, multicenter, randomized trials comparing TaTME and laparoscopic TME for mid and low rectal carcinomas. The RESET trialwill be a prospective, observational, case-matched, four-cohort, multicenter trial. It is designed to study all surgical options available for TME in patients with rectal cancer: open laparotomy, laparoscopy, robot-assisted surgery, or transanal surgery. Participating surgeons treat all their eligible patients with rectal cancer with their preferred intervention. This design minimizes the influence of the learning curve effect and surgeons might be more willing to participate in expertise-based trials.

Attention will shift to the next phase, once valid evidence on the intervention's relative effectiveness is obtained. At present for TaTME, definitive studies are needed. Furthermore, aspects requiring long-term monitoring should be identified in this stage, in order to set up studies related to the last phase of the IDEAL framework.

### Effect of laparoscopic-assisted resection vs open resection of stage II or III rectal cancer on pathologic outcomes: the ACOSOG Z6051 randomized clinical trial [^113x4B2p]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Evidence about the efficacy of laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer is incomplete, particularly for patients with more advanced-stage disease.

Objective

To determine whether laparoscopic resection is noninferior to open resection, as determined by gross pathologic and histologic evaluation of the resected proctectomy specimen.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter, balanced, noninferiority, randomized trial enrolled patients between October 2008 and September 2013. The trial was conducted by credentialed surgeons from 35 institutions in the United States and Canada. A total of 486 patients with clinical stage II or III rectal cancer within 12 cm of the anal verge were randomized after completion of neoadjuvant therapy to laparoscopic or open resection.

Interventions

Standard laparoscopic and open approaches were performed by the credentialed surgeons.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome assessing efficacy was a composite of circumferential radial margin greater than 1 mm, distal margin without tumor, and completeness of total mesorectal excision. A 6% noninferiority margin was chosen according to clinical relevance estimation.

Results

Two hundred forty patients with laparoscopic resection and 222 with open resection were evaluable for analysis of the 486 enrolled. Successful resection occurred in 81.7% of laparoscopic resection cases (95% CI, 76.8%-86.6%) and 86.9% of open resection cases (95% CI, 82.5%-91.4%) and did not support noninferiority (difference, -5.3%; 1-sided 95% CI, -10.8% to ∞; P for noninferiority = .41). Patients underwent low anterior resection (76.7%) or abdominoperineal resection (23.3%). Conversion to open resection occurred in 11.3% of patients. Operative time was significantly longer for laparoscopic resection (mean, 266.2 vs 220.6 minutes; mean difference, 45.5 minutes; 95% CI, 27.7–63.4; P < .001). Length of stay (7.3 vs 7.0 days; mean difference, 0.3 days; 95% CI, -0.6 to 1.1), readmission within 30 days (3.3% vs 4.1%; difference, -0.7%; 95% CI, -4.2% to 2.7%), and severe complications (22.5% vs 22.1%; difference, 0.4%; 95% CI, -4.2% to 2.7%) did not differ significantly. Quality of the total mesorectal excision specimen in 462 operated and analyzed surgeries was complete (77%) and nearly complete (16.5%) in 93.5% of the cases. Negative circumferential radial margin was observed in 90% of the overall group (87.9% laparoscopic resection and 92.3% open resection; P = 0.11). Distal margin result was negative in more than 98% of patients irrespective of type of surgery (P = 0.91).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with stage II or III rectal cancer, the use of laparoscopic resection compared with open resection failed to meet the criterion for noninferiority for pathologic outcomes. Pending clinical oncologic outcomes, the findings do not support the use of laparoscopic resection in these patients.

### Three-year outcomes of transanal total mesorectal excision versus standard laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for mid and low rectal cancer [^114u9GXN]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) was introduced, it has become an important topic in rectal cancer treatment. Many previous studies reported positive relevant short-term results, histopathological results, and associated complications. Recently, concerns regarding the oncological safety of taTME have been raised due to reports showing high local recurrences (LR) rates. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the 3-year outcomes between taTME and laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (laTME) for mid-low rectal cancer.

Methods

A total of 104 patients who underwent taTME were matched with 208 patients treated by laTME. The primary endpoint was 3-year LR rate; secondary endpoints in this matched-cohort study included the perioperative outcomes and histopathological outcomes.

Results

taTME was associated with lower permanent ostomy rate (1% vs 13.5%) and lower conversion rate (0% vs 3.4%) compared to laTME. A similar quality of resected specimens was detected for each group. In both groups, the local recurrence rate was 3.8%. Within 3 years after surgery, the disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 78.8% in the taTME group and 76.9% in the laTME group (P = 0.640), while the overall survival (OS) rates were 93.3% in the taTME group and 89.9% in the laTME group (P = 0.327).

Conclusion

No significant differences regarding 3-year local recurrence rate (3.8%) were observed in the taTME group compared to laTME group.

### Transanal versus laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for mid and low rectal cancer (Ta-LaTME study): multicentre, randomized, open-label trial [^114r9oAN]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) is a minimally invasive surgical technique that tries to avoid conversion to open surgery. However, specific intraoperative complications and local recurrences have cast some doubt on the suitability of the technique. The primary endpoint of the present study was a composite outcome of conversion surgery. Secondary objectives were to assess postoperative recovery, and pathological and oncological outcomes.

Methods

This was a prospective, multicentre, randomized, controlled open-label study of patients diagnosed with mid and low rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent laparoscopic TaTME or laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LaTME). The TaTME technique comprised intracorporeal resection and anastomosis. Main outcomes were conversion to open surgery. Secondary outcomes were postoperative morbidity, mortality, pathological, oncological results, and survival. Modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol analyses were performed.

Results

The study was conducted between April 2015 and May 2021. Patients were randomized to the LaTME (57 patients) or TaTME (59) group. Fifty patients from the LaTME group and 55 from the TaTME group were eligible for mITT analysis. The procedure was converted to open surgery in 11 patients (11 per cent): 10 (20 per cent) in the LaTME group and 1 (2 per cent) in the laparoscopic TaTME group (difference 18.8, 95 per cent c.i. 30 to 7; P = 0.003). No significant differences were found in terms of postoperative recovery and morbidity at 30 days; nor were there significant differences in anastomotic leakage, although it was less common in laparoscopic TaTME. With a median follow-up of 39 months, there were three instances of local recurrence (6.1 per cent) in the LaTME group and one (1.8 per cent) in the laparoscopic TaTME group (95 per cent c.i. 60 to 69; P = 0.3). Registration number: NCT02550769 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).

Conclusion

The conversion rate was significantly lower in laparoscopic TaTME than in LaTME. At centres with experienced surgeons, laparoscopic TaTME can avoid conversion to open surgery.

Rectal cancer laparoscopic versus open outcomes — the UK MRC-CLASSIC Trial Group found no difference in overall survival, disease-free survival, local recurrence, wound recurrence, or quality of life between laparoscopic and open approaches, consistent with case series showing that laparoscopic total mesorectal excision can be performed safely and adequately and that mid and long-term outcomes appear similar. In the trial, Thirty four per cent of the patients randomized to the laparoscopic group underwent conversion to an open procedure and this cohort had a higher incidence of post-operative complications (p = 0.002) as well as worsened overall survival, but equivalent disease-free survival at five years. Additionally, in patients undergoing laparoscopic low anterior resection there was a higher rate of positive circumferential margins without impact on local recurrence or survival, and overall, male sexual and erectile function was worse in the laparoscopic group.

### COLOR III: a multicentre randomised clinical trial comparing transanal TME versus laparoscopic TME for mid and low rectal cancer [^112zCvBz]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Involved CRM in laparoscopic TME for mid and low rectal carcinomas is estimated to be 7%. The primary objective of the trial is to demonstrate a reduction in 4% of involved CRM after TaTME compared to laparoscopic TME. To demonstrate a difference of 4% (7–3%) at a randomisation ratio of 2:1, 732 TaTME patients and 366 laparoscopic TME patients are required for inclusion to generate a power of 80% for this trial. Baseline numerical data will be described in means, standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges; baseline categorical data will be displayed in percentages. All comparative analyses will be conducted on an 'intention to treat' basis. Consequently, patients who are randomised to TaTME and converted to a laparoscopic or open TME will be analysed in the TaTME group. Patients who are randomised to a laparoscopic resection and converted to TaTME or open TME will be analysed in the laparoscopic group. Ninety days post-operative mortality, pathological resection margin and complication rates will be compared using the Chi-square test or an exact test if necessary. Local recurrence rate, disease-free and overall survival will be compared using the log-rank test. Exploratory analysis of the prognostic effects of various baseline factors on disease-free survival will be carried out through multivariate Cox regression. Apart from intention to treat analyses, per protocol analyses will be applied.

Accrual and limitations

For inclusion of 1098 patients, approximately 4 years are needed. Because at the start of the trial accrual will be limited to the main centres, the estimated accrual per year will be as follows:
Year 1: 108 patients (5 hospitals, approximately 2 patients per month)
Year 2: 290 patients (15 hospitals, approximately 1–2 patients per month)
Year 3: 300 patients (25 hospitals, approximately 1–2 patients per month)
Year 4: 400 patients (30 hospitals, approximately 1–2 patients per month)

Centralising MRI review will not be limitation of this study, because MRIs will be uploaded through an online tool and can be reviewed the same day.

Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) comparative outcomes and safety — A systematic analysis of 17 studies comparing 600 taTME vs 639 laparoscopic/robotic total mesorectal excision (TME) found lower circumferential resection margin (CRM) positivity with taTME (OR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29–0.75; p = 0.002). However, a Norwegian case review of 110 taTME procedures reported a local recurrence rate of 9.5% after a median postoperative interval of 11 months, prompting a moratorium by Norwegian health authorities; controversy persists and a randomized trial (COLOR III) is expected to enroll 1098 patients.

Pathologic Outcomes

Successful resection, measured by a negative CRM and DRM and complete or nearly complete TME, occurred in 538 (98.9%) patients in the taTME group and 538 (98.7%) patients in the laTME group (difference, 0.2%; 95% CI, −1.9% to 2.2%; P > 0.99) (Table 4). In considering components of surgical resection quality, DRM result was negative in 99.6% and 99.3% of patients receiving taTME and laTME, respectively. Clear CRM was obtained in 99.1% of patients irrespective of the type of surgery. The quality of the TME specimen was complete (87.8%) and nearly complete (12.2%) in all of the 1089 cases, whereas none of the patients in had an incomplete TME.

Currently, taTME as an alternative to laTME in selected patients with rectal cancer has become popular in skilled surgeons. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated similar technical success with acceptable oncologic and perioperative outcomes in rectal cancer patients treated by taTME versus laTME, and other systematic reviews verified these trends. By contrast, an international taTME registry found a relatively high percentage of perioperative complications including an anastomotic failure rate of 15.7%, and a Norwegian case review of 110 taTME procedures indicated increased early multifocal local recurrences, resulting in a moratorium on taTME. Therefore, the role of taTME is still a matter of debate pending the outcomes from the multicenter ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) COLOR III and ETAP-GRECCAR 11. Against this background, the Chinese Transanal Endoscopic Surgery Collaborative (CTESC) group launched a phase 3, open-labeled, multicenter, noninferiority RCT to assess the surgical safety and oncologic outcomes of taTME versus laTME in patients with rectal cancer. Herein, we report the initial results on the morbidity and mortality as well as pathologic outcomes; this early analysis was preplanned.

Rectal cancer — laparoscopic versus open and robotic-assisted resection outcomes are reported across randomized trials and database analyses. Locoregional recurrence at 3 years was identical at 5.0% with no statistically significant differences in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS). In CLASICC, a 5-year follow-up showed a trend toward better 5-year OS after laparoscopic surgery, at 52.9% and 60.3% for open and laparoscopic surgery, respectively; P = 0.132. In COREAN, 3-year DFS did not differ between open and laparoscopic surgery at 72.5% (95% CI, 65.0%–78.6%) versus 79.2% (95% CI, 72.3%–84.6%). In ACOSOG Z6051, the primary endpoint was a composite of circumferential resection margin (CRM) > 1 mm, negative distal margin, and total mesorectal excision (TME) completeness, and no significant differences were observed between arms; complete or nearly complete TME occurred in 92.1% versus 95.1% with a difference of −3.0 (95% CI, −7.4 to 1.5; P = 0.20). Non-inferiority criteria were not met initially, but follow-up reported similar 2-year DFS at 79.5% versus 83.2%, and recurrence rates were also similar at 4.6% versus 4.5% (locoregional) and 14.6% versus 16.7% (distant). In ALaCaRT, successful resections occurred in 82% versus 89% for laparoscopic and open surgery, respectively, for a difference of −7.0% (95% CI, −12.4% to infinity), with negative CRM achieved in 93% and 97% (risk difference, −3.7%; 95% CI, −7.6% to 0.1%; P = 0.06). Follow-up at 2 years showed laparoscopic versus open outcomes of locoregional recurrence 5.4% versus 3.1%, DFS 80% versus 82%, and OS 94% versus 93%; as in Z6051, the criteria for non-inferiority of the laparoscopic approach were not met in the initial report, but techniques were found to not differ significantly after longer follow-up with oncologic outcomes. An NCDB analysis of > 18,000 individuals undergoing LAR found short-term oncologic outcomes to be similar between open and laparoscopic approaches, and older reviews/meta-analyses consistently found laparoscopy to be safe and feasible even though a 2017 meta-analysis found a significantly higher risk for a non-complete mesorectal excision with laparoscopy compared with open resection. Studies comparing robotic-assisted to conventional laparoscopy generally report comparable results in conversion to open resection, TME quality, postoperative complications, and quality of life.

### COLOR III: a multicentre randomised clinical trial comparing transanal TME versus laparoscopic TME for mid and low rectal cancer [^114u4nKy]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Annually approximately 737.000 patients are diagnosed with rectal cancer worldwide. The standard potentially curative treatment of rectal cancer is total mesorectal excision (TME). With the introduction of laparoscopic TME, concerns arose about the oncological safety. The COlorectal cancer Laparoscopic or Open Resection (COLOR) II trial demonstrated improved short-term outcomes and similar long-term outcomes after laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer, compared with open resection.

However, particularly resection of mid and low rectal cancer is technically demanding due to tapering of the mesorectum in the pelvis and the forward angle of the distal rectum rendering this part of the rectum less accessible from the abdominal cavity. These factors predispose to incomplete mesorectal excision and involved circumferential resection margins (CRMs), with consequent local recurrences. Moreover, high morbidity rates are reported as result of poor anastomotic techniques and high conversion rates because of the limited view on the distal margin of the tumour and difficult mobilisation in the narrow pelvis. Despite the increasing uptake of laparoscopic TME in the treatment of rectal cancer, conversion rates to open procedures are reported up to 34%. Conversion is frequently needed in male, obese patients or in case of bulky or distally located tumours. Furthermore, mid and low rectal cancer surgery is associated with poor functional outcome with high colostomy rates compared to high rectal cancer. Large randomised trials reported rates of abdominoperineal resection (APR) in laparoscopic rectal cancer resection of 25–29%.

To improve visualisation and potentially improve functional and oncological results, the transabdominal transanal (TATA) technique was introduced in the 1990's, which included an open approach from below to rectal tumours located in the distal one-third of the rectum. The use of single port laparoscopic platforms has enabled the introduction of transanal TME (TaTME) by Lacy in 2010. Both techniques have in common to adhere to TME principles, achieving tumour-free distal and circumferential margins (CRMs) and harvesting a minimum of 12 lymph nodes for pathological assessment. The TaTME technique takes the most important developments in rectal cancer surgery from the last 30 years and combines them into one surgical technique.

TaTME for mid and low rectal cancer has potential benefits: better specimen quality with better radicality, less morbidity as result of better anastomotic techniques and less conversions and more sphincter-saving rectal resections without compromising oncological outcomes.

RESULTS

Between April 13, 2016, and June 1, 2021, 1115 enrolled patients from 16 centers in China were randomized 1:1 to receive taTME (n = 558) or laTME (n = 557). After the exclusion of 26 cases, 544 patients in the taTME group and 545 patients in the laTME group were included in the final modified intention­to­treat analysis of the morbidity, mortality, and pathologic outcomes (Fig. 1). The baseline characteristics of the patients are provided in Table 1, which were well balanced between the 2 groups. The mean distance from the inferior margin of the tumor to the anal verge was 5.2 cm (SD: 1.5 cm). As indicated by preoperative imaging, the 2 groups had no difference in clinical staging at baseline.

### Effect of laparoscopic-assisted resection vs open resection on pathological outcomes in rectal cancer: the ALaCaRT randomized clinical trial [^112tYGNx]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Laparoscopic procedures are generally thought to have better outcomes than open procedures. Because of anatomical constraints, laparoscopic rectal resection may not be better because of limitations in performing an adequate cancer resection.

Objective

To determine whether laparoscopic resection is noninferior to open rectal cancer resection for adequacy of cancer clearance.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, noninferiority, phase 3 trial (Australasian Laparoscopic Cancer of the Rectum; ALaCaRT) conducted between March 2010 and November 2014. Twenty-six accredited surgeons from 24 sites in Australia and New Zealand randomized 475 patients with T1-T3 rectal adenocarcinoma less than 15 cm from the anal verge.

Interventions

Open laparotomy and rectal resection (n = 237) or laparoscopic rectal resection (n = 238).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was a composite of oncological factors indicating an adequate surgical resection, with a noninferiority boundary of Δ = -8%. Successful resection was defined as meeting all the following criteria: (1) complete total mesorectal excision, (2) a clear circumferential margin (≥ 1 mm), and (3) a clear distal resection margin (≥ 1 mm). Pathologists used standardized reporting and were blinded to the method of surgery.

Results

A successful resection was achieved in 194 patients (82%) in the laparoscopic surgery group and 208 patients (89%) in the open surgery group (risk difference of -7.0% [95% CI, -12.4% to ∞]; P = 0.38 for noninferiority). The circumferential resection margin was clear in 222 patients (93%) in the laparoscopic surgery group and in 228 patients (97%) in the open surgery group (risk difference of -3.7% [95% CI, -7.6% to 0.1%]; P = 0.06), the distal margin was clear in 236 patients (99%) in the laparoscopic surgery group and in 234 patients (99%) in the open surgery group (risk difference of -0.4% [95% CI, -1.8% to 1.0%]; P = 0.67), and total mesorectal excision was complete in 206 patients (87%) in the laparoscopic surgery group and 216 patients (92%) in the open surgery group (risk difference of -5.4% [95% CI, -10.9% to 0.2%]; P = 0.06). The conversion rate from laparoscopic to open surgery was 9%.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with T1-T3 rectal tumors, noninferiority of laparoscopic surgery compared with open surgery for successful resection was not established. Although the overall quality of surgery was high, these findings do not provide sufficient evidence for the routine use of laparoscopic surgery. Longer follow-up of recurrence and survival is currently being acquired.

### Transanal total mesorectal excision: how are we doing so far? [^112xeXWh]. Colorectal Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the gold standard for rectal resection. This surgical technique, involving resection of the fatty envelope surrounding the rectum, has substantially contributed to local control and survival of rectal cancer 1, 2.

Minimally invasive techniques have been introduced for rectal surgery. Several randomized controlled trials have shown that oncological outcomes are comparable for open and laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer. The COREAN trial has shown short‐term benefits for laparoscopic surgery compared to open surgery and an equivalent quality of oncological resection 3. In the long term, disease‐free survival was similar for the two techniques 4. In addition, The COLOR‐II trial has confirmed that laparoscopic and open surgery for rectal cancer provide similar long‐term outcomes 5.

Recently, it has been shown that age above 65 years, a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 and tumour location close to the anal verge are risk factors for the conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery 6. In addition, factors such as a narrow pelvis or limited views of the distal rectum make the laparoscopic approach difficult. These considerations emphasize the need for a new minimally invasive technique that overcomes the limitations of laparoscopy.

Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) may be the solution. Since its introduction in 2010, TaTME has been shown to be a feasible and safe technique for rectal cancer resections and has subsequently achieved widespread acceptance 7, 8. Nevertheless, to date, most evidence has been obtained from cohort studies with small sample sizes and retrospective design 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Therefore, this study is important because it is the first to provide results of a prospective multicentre cohort study. The aim of the study was to compare postoperative morbidity between TaTME and laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LaTME).

ASCRS rectal cancer — GRADE recommendations are summarized as follows: Tumors of the upper rectum do not usually benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and should typically be treated with initial surgical resection (Conditional; Moderate). Total neoadjuvant therapy is typically recommended for stage II or III mid or low rectal adenocarcinoma (Conditional; High). Following neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer, patients should be assessed to determine the response to treatment (Strong; Low). The value of endoscopic biopsy to assess for the presence of residual disease is limited by the high false negative rate (Conditional; Very low). A watch-and-wait strategy can be offered to selected patients with a clinical complete response in experienced centers with established protocols (Conditional; Moderate). In addition to routine surveillance for disease recurrence, patients managed using a watch-and-wait strategy should undergo surveillance to assess for local tumor regrowth (Strong; Expert consensus). Compared to laparoscopic and robotic total mesorectal excision (TME), transanal TME for mid and low rectal cancer has similar overall complication rates and functional outcomes (Conditional; Moderate).

### Total mesorectal excision for low and middle rectal cancer: laparoscopic versus transanal approach-a meta-analysis [^11125Xmh]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) appeared to be a challenging alternative to Laparoscopic Total Mesorectal Excision (LaTME) for low and middle rectal cancer. However, evidence remains low on the possible benefits of TaTME. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of comparative studies between TaTME and LaTME.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted on Medline, Embase, and Cochrane database. The following outcomes were assessed: conversion, operative time, morbidity, length of stay, readmission rate, and pathological and oncological results.

Results

After review of 756 identified records, 14 studies were included (case-matched control n = 10, prospective cohort n = 3, retrospective study n = 1) comparing 495 TaTME and 547 LaTME. No randomized trial was available. Following criteria were significantly improved after TaTME vs. LaTME: readmission's rate (9% after TaTME vs. 18% after LaTME, OR0.44, 95%CI 0.26–0.74, p = 0.002), length of stay (OR- 2.17, 95%CI- 3.68 to - 0.66, p = 0.005), overall morbidity (34 vs. 41%, OR 0.65, 95%CI0.46–0.91, p = 0.001), major morbidity (8.7 vs. 14%, OR 0.53, 95%CI0.34–0.83, p = 0.005), anastomotic leak (6.4 vs. 11.6%, OR 0.53, 95%CI0.31–0.93, p = 0.03), and circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement (4 vs. 8.8%, OR 0.48, 95%CI0.27–0.86, p = 0.01). No significant differences were observed between TaTME and LaTME regarding conversion's rate (3.2 vs. 8.8%, p = 0.09), operative time (OR - 10.73, p = 0.26), intraoperative complications (8.1 vs. 6.3%, p = 0.48), minor morbidity (27.9 vs. 29.6%, p = 0.27), positive distal resection margin (1.4 vs. 1.4%, p = 0.93), complete TME (75 vs. 75%, p = 0.74), harvested lymph nodes (OR 0.38, p = 0.44), and local recurrence rate (3.5 vs. 2.2%, p = 0.64).

Conclusion

This meta-analysis based on nonrandomized studies suggests that TaTME seems better than LaTME in terms of overall and major morbidities, anastomotic leak, readmission rate, CRM involvement, and length of stay. These results need to be confirmed by randomized controlled trial.

Background

Laparoscopic surgery has been widely used for rectal cancer; however, its long-term outcomes remain controversial. This study aimed to assess the long-term oncological safety of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer using 10-year follow-up data of the Comparison of Open versus laparoscopic surgery for mid or low REctal cancer After Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (COREAN) trial.

Methods

The COREAN trial is a, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial. Eligible participants were aged 18–80 years, had cT3N0-2M0 middle or low rectal cancer with lesions located within 9 cm of the anal verge, and had been treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to open or laparoscopic surgery with a computer-generated random allocation sequence with a random permuted block design. Neither patients nor clinicians were masked to treatment assignment. Open or laparoscopic total mesorectal excision was done 6–8 weeks after the administration of preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (fluoropyrimidines alone, doublet therapy, or triplet therapy) at a dose of 50.5 Gy over 5.5 weeks. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was administered for 4 months. The primary endpoint of 3-year disease-free survival was published previously. Here, we report 10-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and local recurrence. Analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population of all participants who were randomly assigned and provided follow-up data. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00470951.

Findings

Of the 340 patients enrolled in the COREAN trial between April 4, 2006, and Aug 26, 2009 (170 patients in each group), two patients in the laparoscopic surgery group moved abroad and were lost to follow-up, so were not included in this 10-year analysis. The median duration of follow-up was 143 months (IQR 122–156). No differences were observed in 10-year overall survival (74.1% [95% CI 66.8–80.0] in the open surgery group vs 76.8% [69.6–82.5] in the laparoscopic surgery group; p = 0.44), 10-year disease-free survival (59.3% [51.1–66.5] vs 64.3% [56.0–71.5]; p = 0.20), or 10-year local recurrence (8.9% [5.2–15.0] vs 3.4% [1.4–7.9]; p = 0.050) between the open surgery and laparoscopic surgery groups at 10 years after surgery. The stratified hazard ratios, adjusted for ypT and ypN classification and tumour regression grade, for open surgery versus laparoscopic surgery were 0.94 (95% CI 0.63–1.43) for overall survival, 1.05 (0.74–1.49) for disease-free survival, and 2.22 (0.78–6.34) for local recurrence.

Interpretation

The 10-year follow-up of the COREAN trial confirms the long-term oncological safety of laparoscopic surgery in patients with rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Similar to open surgery, laparoscopic surgery does not compromise long-term survival outcomes in rectal cancer when performed by well trained surgeons.

### Laparoscopic-assisted versus open total mesorectal excision with anal sphincter preservation for mid and low rectal cancer: a prospective, randomized trial [^1114S4eU]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This single-center, prospective, randomized trial was designed to compare the short-term clinical outcome between laparoscopic-assisted versus open total mesorectal excision (TME) with anal sphincter preservation (ASP) in patients with mid and low rectal cancer. Long-term morbidity and survival data also were recorded and compared between the two groups.

Methods

Between August 2001 and August 2007, 80 patients with mid and low rectal cancer were randomized to receive either laparoscopic-assisted (40 patients) or open (40 patients) TME with ASP. The median follow-up time for all patients was 75.7 (range 16.9–115.7) months for the laparoscopic-assisted group and 76.1 (range 4.7–126.6) months for the open group. The primary endpoint of the study was short-term clinical outcome. Secondary endpoints included long-term morbidity rate and survival. Data were analyzed by intention-to-treat principle.

Results

The demographic data of the two groups were comparable. Postoperative recovery was better after laparoscopic surgery, with less analgesic requirement (P < 0.001), earlier mobilization (P = 0.001), lower short-term morbidity rate (P = 0.043), and a trend towards shorter hospital stay (P = 0.071). The cumulative long-term morbidity rate also was lower in the laparoscopic-assisted group (P = 0.019). The oncologic clearance in terms of macroscopic quality of the TME specimen, circumferential resection margin involvement, and number of lymph nodes removed was similar between both groups. After curative resection, the probabilities of survival at 5 years of the laparoscopic-assisted and open groups were 85.9 and 91.3%, respectively (P = 0.912). The respective probabilities of being disease-free were 83.3 and 74.5% (P = 0.114).

Conclusions

Laparoscopic-assisted TME with ASP improves postoperative recovery, reduces short-term and long-term morbidity rates, and seemingly does not jeopardize survival compared with open surgery for mid and low rectal cancer (http://ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00485316).

### Controversies in surgical oncology: does the minimally invasive approach for rectal cancer provide equivalent oncologic outcomes compared with the open approach? [^116CQw6n]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Compared with open surgery, minimally invasive surgery for colon cancer has been shown to improve short-term outcomes and yield equivalent long-term oncologic results. It remains to be seen if oncologic outcomes for the minimally invasive approach for rectal cancer are equivalent to traditional open rectal resection.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of Medline, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases. Relevant studies were selected using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Five key questions comparing minimally invasive and open oncologic outcomes for rectal cancer were specifically analyzed. A meta-analysis was not done due to heterogeneity of studies.

Results

Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria, including six randomized controlled trials. The laparoscopic approach to rectal resection was not more likely than the traditional open approach to have clear circumferential and distal margins, a complete total mesorectal excision grade, ≥ 12 lymph nodes in the resected specimen, reduced local recurrence rates, or reduced overall survival rates. Two randomized trials revealed that successful laparoscopic resection was not noninferior to open.

Conclusions

Caution should be exercised when choosing surgical options for rectal cancer. Results of randomized trials could not prove that short-term oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic surgery were equivalent to those after open surgery even when performed by surgeons with laparoscopic expertise. However, reported long-term data have not shown a difference in outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgery. Future advances in minimally invasive technology may improve oncologic margins but these will require careful study and scrutiny.

### Chemoradiotherapy and local excision vs total mesorectal excision in T2-T3ab, N0, M0 rectal cancer: the TAUTEM randomized clinical trial [^113tzSY3]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

According to international guidelines, the standard treatment for stage T2-T3ab, N0, M0 rectal cancer is total mesorectal excision (TME), but it is associated with high morbidity and quality of life disorders.

Objective

To analyze locoregional recurrence (LR) after a follow-up of 2 years, applying a 1-sided noninferiority margin of 10%, and to assess distant recurrence (DR), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a multicenter, prospective, open-label, noninferiority, phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing TME (TME group) with chemoradiotherapy followed by local excision with transanal endoscopic microsurgery (CRT-TEM group). This study involved 17 hospitals in Spain. Eligibility criteria included patients with rectal adenocarcinoma located lower than 10 cm from the anal verge; stage T2-T3ab N0, M0; tumor size less than or equal to 4 cm in diameter; and American Society of Anesthesiologists stage III or less with no metastasis. Sample size was calculated with a 1-sided significance level of 2.5% and a power of 80%, assuming a nonrecurrence rate of 95% in each arm and a possible loss of 15%. Randomization was performed with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Data were analyzed from July 2010 to October 2021.

Interventions

The 2 treatment groups were CRT-TEM and TME.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main study outcome was LR.

Results

From July 2010 to October 2021, 173 patients (median [IQR] age, 67 [59–75] years; 116 male [67.1%]) were included (CRT-TEM, n = 86; TME, n = 87). In the 5-year modified intention-to-treat analysis, LR was 6.2% (5 of 81 patients) in the TME group and 7.4% (6 of 81 patients) in the CRT-TEM group (difference, -1.23%; 95% CI, 6.51% to -8.98%). DR was 17.3% (14 of 81 patients) in the TME group and 12.3% (10 of 81 patients) in the CRT-TEM group (difference, 4.94%; 95% CI, 15.85% to -5.98%). OS was 85.2% (69 of 81 patients) in the TME group and 82.7% (67 of 81 patients) in the CRT-TEM group (difference, 2.47%; 95% CI, 0.38%-1.78%). DFS in both groups was 88.9% (72 of 81), with a 95% CI of 9.68 to -9.68.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this randomized clinical trial reveal that CRT-TEM achieved noninferior results compared with standard TME treatment in terms of LR and similar results in terms of DR, OS, and DFS. CRT-TEM appears to be a suitable treatment option for patients with T2-T3ab, N0, M0 rectal cancer.

### Comparison of survival among adults with rectal cancer who have undergone laparoscopic vs open surgery: a meta-analysis [^117S9pHP]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The present meta-analysis comparing laparoscopic vs open surgery for adult patients with rectal cancer included 12 RCTs with 3709 participants. The analysis showed that laparoscopic surgery was associated with a similar DFS but a significantly better OS than open surgery for adults with rectal cancer. To our knowledge, this was the first time that the association between laparoscopic rectal cancer resection and improved long-term outcome was shown using data from RCTs.

Three aspects of a new surgical approach for oncologic surgery need to be evaluated: short-term outcomes, pathologic outcomes, and long-term outcomes. Compared with traditional open surgery, favorable or noninferior short-term outcomes after laparoscopic surgery have been demonstrated in previous RCTs (CLASICC trial, COREAN [Comparison of Open Versus Laparoscopic Surgery for Mid and Low Rectal Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy] trial, and COLOR II [Colorectal Cancer Laparoscopic or Open Resection II] trial), and meta-analyses. These outcomes include blood loss, restoration of bowel function, length of hospital stay, complication rates, and postoperative mortality. Furthermore, these 3 large RCTs, also found similar pathologic outcomes between the laparoscopic surgery and open surgery groups, such as a similar rate of positive circumferential resection margin and a similar rate of noncomplete mesorectal excision.

Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) versus laparoscopic TME (l-TME) and robotic TME (r-TME) — taTME for mid and low rectal cancer has similar overall complication rates and functional outcomes. Strength of recommendation: conditional, based on moderate-quality evidence. Early experience raised safety concerns, with LR in 10 of 110 patients (9.5%) at a median follow-up of 11 months leading to a national moratorium in 2018. In a multicenter RCT of 1089 patients, there were no conversions in taTME versus 6 patients (1.1%) in l-TME converted to taTME (p = 0.03), with no significant differences in intraoperative complications (6.1% vs 4.8%; p = 0.42) or anastomotic leak (5.3% vs 7.2%; p = 0.21); among 544 taTME patients there were 2 urethral injuries (0.4%) and 2 CO2 emboli (0.4%). A Spanish multicenter RCT reported a higher conversion rate in l-TME versus taTME (20% vs 2%; p = 0.003), 70% of conversions were to taTME and 30% to open surgery, and at a median follow-up of 39 months LR rates were 6.1% (l-TME) versus 1.8% (taTME) (p = 0.3). No published RCTs compare r-TME with taTME; a Dutch propensity score–matched cohort showed similar complication rates (54.6% vs 43.5%; p = 0.251), specimen quality (96.3% vs 98.1% complete or near-complete mesorectum, standardized mean difference 0.677), and conversion to open surgery (4.6% vs 1.9%; p = 0.518), with no difference in anastomotic leak (r-TME 21.6% vs taTME 17.6%; p = 0.62). A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis of 37 studies found similar pooled conversion rates (1.0% vs 1.2%; p = 0.91) and circumferential resection margin positivity (3.2% vs 2.7%; p = 0.22) comparing taTME to r-TME, and a meta-analysis of 30 trials including 8545 patients found no statistically significant differences in DFS or LR rates among open TME, l-TME, r-TME, and taTME.

Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) — recommendation, operative metrics, and safety signals: Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) remains controversial with regard to perioperative and long-term oncologic outcomes, with the guideline stating: "Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B". A systematic review of 7 retrospective studies comparing taTME (n = 270) with laparoscopic TME (n = 303) reported shorter operation times (weighted mean difference −23.45; 95% CI, −37.43 to −9.46; p < 0.01) and a lower conversion rate (OR = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11–0.81; p = 0.02) for taTME. TaTME has a technical learning curve of approximately 40 cases, and registry data describe carbon dioxide embolism events — 25 cases among 6375 cases, yielding an estimated incidence of 0.4%.

### Oncologic outcomes after transanal total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer [^113hNjt1]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study had a 2-year DFS of 91.2% and OS rate of 94.7%. There was no local recurrence, and 13.5% of patients experienced distant recurrence at a median of 14 months (range, 0.6–53) after TaTME. Our 2-year survival rates are similar to those of the ALaCaRT trial: overall (this cohort 94.7% vs ALaCaRT 94%) and disease-free (91.2% vs 80%). Our rate of 13.5% distant recurrence/metastasis at nearly 2½ years was comparable to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program rate of 24% at 3 years and the 13.8% reported by Hol et alin a recent study, despite a relatively high proportion of patients with node-positive disease (70.9% vs 46% in their cohort). Although a single-center study cannot be used in isolation to demonstrate the safety of a technique, our 2-year rates are similar to what has been reported in the wider literature. With a low overall complication rate and short postoperative length of stay (median, 4 days), 73% of patients were able to receive their adjuvant chemotherapy, limiting the impact postoperative complications have on the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and potential impact on long-term survival.

Transanal TME is a technical advance that can aid in dissection by providing in-line visualization of the deep pelvis in the most challenging cases, specifically obese men with mid to low rectal tumors following radiotherapy. One of the greatest strengths of our series is the high rate of obese (32%), male (64%), irradiated patients (85%) in our cohort. Despite these real-world challenges, our conversion rate was only 1.2% and the sphincter preservation rate was 94%. Consistent with our findings, Ma et aldemonstrated that laparoscopic TME had a 4 times higher likelihood of conversion than TaTME, whereas the International TaTME registry reported low conversion rates (4.3%). The high-definition visualization and direct access to the low pelvis provided by the TaTME approach contribute to the technical success of the operation, with no reported adjacent organ injuries, no positive distal resection margins, and low positive CRMs, despite including consecutive patients with locally advanced tumors, including T4, and threatened CRM on MRI.

### Three-year disease-free survival after transanal vs. laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer (TaLaR): a randomized clinical trial… [^113sDGq5]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract 3516 Background: Transanal total mesorectal excision has gained significant traction as an effective approach for treating rectal cancer. Many previous studies reported positive relevant short-term results, histopathological results and associated complications of taTME compared to laparoscopic total mesorectal excision. Nonetheless, long-term oncological outcomes of taTME remain controversial. This study aimed to compare the 3-year DFS of taTME with laTME. Methods: We conducted a phase 3, randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial to compare the survival outcomes of taTME versus laTME in patients with rectal cancer located below the peritoneal reflection. This trial encompassed 16 hospitals across 10 provinces in China, with a total enrollment of 1, 115 patients. We set the 3-year disease-free survival and 5-year overall survival as the primary endpoints for analysis.

The analysis of the 3-year DFS was conducted following a predefined modified intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT02966483. Results: The taTME group exhibited a 3-year DFS rate of
83. 42%, and the laTME group achieved a 3-year DFS rate of 82. 86%. The marginal difference of 0. 56% between the DFS rates of the two groups suggests comparable outcomes. Moreover, the rates of local recurrence were 3. 90% in the taTME group and
3. 62% in the laTME group, indicating similar degrees of localized tumor control. Regarding overall survival, the taTME group demonstrated a rate of 94. 50% compared to
92. 01% in the laTME group. In the taTME group, patients who are male or underwent neoadjuvant showed a higher 3-year OS than that in the laTME group. Conclusions: In patients with mid-low rectal cancer, the 3-year DFS of taTME is not inferior to that of laTME.

This study provides evidence supporting the clinical effectiveness of taTME in the treatment of rectal cancer. Clinical trial information: NCT02966483.

### Transanal vs laparoscopic TME and disease-free survival in patients with rectal cancer… [^111kPtJP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

bTransanal TME − laparoscopic TME. Question Is transanal total mesorectal excision noninferior to laparoscopic TME in 3-year disease-free survival in patients with rectal cancer. Findings The transanal TME group exhibited 3-year disease-free survival of 82. 1%, compared with
79. 4% in the laparoscopic TME group. The lower tail of a 2-tailed 97. 5% CI for the group difference in 3-year disease-free survival was above the noninferiority margin of −10 percentage points. Results In the primary analysis set, the median patient age was 60 years. A total of 692 male and 397 female patients were included in the analysis. Three-year disease-free survival was 82. 1% for the transanal TME group and
79. 4% for the laparoscopic TME group, with a difference of 2. 7%. Three-year overall survival was 92. 6% for transanal TME and
90. 7% for laparoscopic TME.

Conclusions and Relevance In patients with mid-low rectal cancer, 3-year disease-free survival for transanal TME was noninferior to that of laparoscopic TME. Although the Ta-LaTME study group reported undiminished short-term outcomes between transanal TME and laparoscopic TME, 19 and the TaLaR trial demonstrated comparable surgical safety of transanal TME and laparoscopic TME with improved recovery time for patients with mid-low rectal cancer, 20 evidence is still lacking to establish the effectiveness of long-term oncological outcomes of transanal TME for rectal cancer from large-scale randomized clinical trials. The findings indicate that 3-year disease-free survival for transanal TME is noninferior to that of laparoscopic TME. Furthermore, this trial demonstrated that 3-year overall survival and 3-year local recurrence in patients with rectal cancer who underwent transanal TME were comparable to those who underwent laparoscopic TME.

### Laparoscopic versus open resection for rectal cancer: a noninferiority meta-analysis of quality of surgical resection outcomes [^112N7kvY]. Annals of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether laparoscopic surgery is noninferior to open surgery for rectal cancer in terms of quality of surgical resection outcomes.

Background

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have evaluated the oncologic safety of laparoscopic versus open surgery for rectal cancer with conflicting results. Prior meta-analyses comparing these operative approaches in terms of quality of surgical resection aimed to demonstrate if one approach was superior. However, this method is not appropriate and potentially misleading when noninferiority RCTs are included.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane were searched to identify RCTs comparing these operative approaches. Risk differences (RDs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. One-sided Z tests were used to determine noninferiority. Noninferiority margins (ΔNI) for circumferential resection margin (CRM), plane of mesorectal excision (PME), distal resection margin (DRM), and a composite outcome ("successful resection") were based on the consensus of 58 worldwide experts.

Results

Fourteen RCTs were included. Laparoscopic resection was noninferior compared with open resection for the rate of positive CRM [RD 0.79%, 90% confidence interval (CI) -0.46 to 2.04, ΔNI = 2.33%, PNI = 0.026], incomplete PME (RD 1.16%, 90% CI -0.27 to 2.59, ΔNI = 2.85%, PNI = 0.025), and positive DRM (RD 0.15%, 90% CI -0.58 to 0.87, ΔNI = 1.28%, PNI = 0.005). For the rate of "successful resection" (RD 6.16%, 90% CI 2.30–10.02), the comparison was inconclusive when using the ΔNI generated by experts (ΔNI = 2.71%, PNI = 0.07), although no consensus was achieved for this ΔNI.

Conclusions

Laparoscopy was noninferior to open surgery for rectal cancer in terms of individual quality of surgical resection outcomes. These findings are concordant with RCTs demonstrating noninferiority for long-term oncologic outcomes between the 2 approaches.

Laparoscopic versus open rectal cancer surgery — noninferiority and early oncologic outcomes: Two phase III trials "failed to demonstrate noninferiority of laparoscopy compared with open surgery" using composite pathologic end points. ACOSOG Z6051 randomized laparoscopic (n = 244) versus open (n = 222) surgery and reported the composite primary end point met less often with laparoscopy (81.7%; 95% CI, 76.8%–86.6% versus 86%; 95% CI, 82.5%–91.4%), and ALaCaRT similarly found successful resection less frequent with laparoscopy (82% versus 89%; risk difference of −7.0%; 95% CI, −12.4% to −2%; p = 0.038). A meta-analysis reported higher incomplete resection with laparoscopy (13.2% versus 10.4%; RR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05–1.64; p = 0.02). Early survival analyses showed no difference in ACOSOG Z6051 for 2-year DFS and recurrence (2-year DFS laparoscopic 79.5%; 95% CI, 74.4–84.9 versus open 83.2%; 95% CI, 78.3–88.3; locoregional 4.6% versus 4.5%; distant 14.6% versus 16.7%) at a median of 3.9 years, and in ALaCaRT, follow-up of 3.2 years showed no significant differences in 2-year local recurrence or 2-year DFS.

### Structured training pathway and proctoring; multicenter results of the implementation of transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) in the Netherlands [^113NNrjg]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) has been proposed as a potentially better alternative to the laparoscopic standard TME for mid and distal rectal cancer. The bottom-up approach for the deep pelvic region increases exposure and facilitates the distal mesorectal excision. Especially those difficult cases such as obese patients, low rectal cancer, and (male) patients with a narrow pelvis seem to benefit from this approach. TaTME has been introduced in 2010 and has had enthusiastic uptake throughout the world. Current evidence from non-randomized studies shows that the TaTME technique for mid and low rectal cancer has similar short-term clinical outcomes compared to laparoscopic TME (Lap TME) in terms of complications including anastomotic leakage, margin involvement, and specimen quality. Especially the conversion rate seems to benefit from TaTME compared to Lap TME (2% versus 12%) as shown in both registry and systematic reviews. The circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement after TaTME has shown to be slightly lower as observed in conventional or robotic TME in pooled analysis by weighted averages: 4.6% versus 7.9% versus 5.1%, respectively. However, direct comparison in large trials has yet to confirm this difference and demonstrate oncological safety. Within the international TaTME registry, a relative high percentage of intraoperative and postoperative complications has been presented including an anastomotic failure rate of 15.7%. Since the TaTME has only recently been introduced, a learning curve is probably partly a reason for the relative high morbidity rate. TaTME seems technically demanding because of the required single port surgery skills and due to a different approach to the anatomy: down-to-up. The traditional landmarks are missing and surgeons inexperienced in this technique may encounter TaTME-specific related complications. A well-trained TaTME surgeon might show benefits, but for those less trained and capable surgery by TaTME will probably result in worse short- and long-term outcomes. A meta-analysis of TaTME cohorts showed a quality difference in low- versus high-volume centers, indicating a potential learning curve.

### Multicenter phase II trial of transanal total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer: preliminary results [^113d9Ton]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This phase II multicenter North American trial is the most recent large prospective trial to confirm the procedural safety, favorable pathologic outcomes, and low rates of conversion achieved with taTME when performed by experienced surgeons using a 2-team hybrid approach. The 2% abdominal open conversion rate is consistent with the 0–5.1% conversion rates reported in large taTME series of patients, and was achieved despite a predominantly male cohort with the highest proportion of patients with BMI ≥ 30 reported to date (33%) and in whom 67% of tumors were located ≤ 6 cm from the AV. The current trial results validate prior findings that combining taTME with a laparoscopic or robotic abdominal approach enables completion of minimally invasive sphincter-preserving TME, particularly in obese patients with low rectal tumors. Intraoperative complications related to transanal dissection are rare and included 2 vaginal injuries but no rectal perforation or urethral injury, which underscores the experience of participating surgeons.

The primary endpoint of the trial was mesorectal TME grade, an important pathologic endpoint and strong predictor of local recurrence and disease-free survival that also serves as an accurate marker of surgical quality. Complete and near-complete TME grade was achieved in 90% with a 10% rate of incomplete TME and 3% rate of positive margins. These results are in line with the 1.5–11% rates of incomplete TME reported in large retrospective taTME series, and the 8% and 9.3% rates reported in the laparoscopic arm of the ACOSOG RCT and the robotic arm of the ROLAAR RCT, respectively. But this rate is significantly higher than the recently reported 0% rate of incomplete TME in the taTME arms of the 2 laparoscopic vs taTME RCT in China and Spain. Relative to the RCT by Liu et al. in which tumors were similarly located (5.0 vs 5.8 cm from the AV) in patients with higher BMI (22.9 vs 27.8), our higher rate of incomplete TME may reflect a more challenging dissection in a previously radiated field, given that 69% of our taTME cohort was treated with NRT vs only 14% of the Chinese cohort. Among 10 incomplete TME specimens in our trial, 8 occurred in patients treated with neoadjuvant long-course CRT or TNT, and for every 1 week increase in time from end of NRT to surgery, the risk of incomplete TME increased by 7%.

### Outcomes of transanal versus laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer: a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of matched cohort studies [^11438pxi]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The perioperative and oncological results of laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (laTME) and transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) have been compared. However, because there are not enough high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the results cannot be trusted. In order to get more trustworthy results, this article analyzed matched cohort studies.

Methods

Until January 20, 2025, extensive searches were conducted across the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed databases. Using meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA), we assessed the oncological and perioperative results. Quality assessment was done using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. To gauge the overall level of certainty in the evidence, we employed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system (GRADE).

Results

6970 patients from 32 papers were included in the analysis. Comparing the taTME group to the laTME group, the open conversion rate (OR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.22, P < 0.01), circumferential resection margin (CRM) positivity rate (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.85, P < 0.01), and distal resection margin (DRM) positivity rate (OR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.36 to 0.89; P = 0.01) were significantly lower. Other perioperative problems and oncological outcomes did not differ. The cumulative Z-curve for CRM positivity rate and open conversion both exceeded the conventional boundary and the trial sequential monitoring border, suggesting strong evidence; however, the DRM positivity rate showed possible false positives. In contrast to the poor CRM and DRM-positive rates, the recommendations for open conversion had a moderate grade.

Conclusion

Based on matched cohort studies, this meta-analysis shows that taTME may offer advantages in CRM positivity and open conversion rate but shows comparable results for other outcomes. To ascertain whether taTME offers benefits in terms of DRM positively, more investigation is required.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: rectal cancer, version 3.2024 [^114jynnv]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Rectal cancer — laparoscopic versus open resection shows no significant oncologic differences across multiple trials. A multicenter study including 4405 patients with rectal cancer found no differences in recurrence or survival. In COLOR II, locoregional recurrence at 3 years was identical at 5.0%, with no statistically significant differences in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS), and no differences in completeness of resection, positive CRM, morbidity, or mortality. A 5-year follow-up of CLASSIC maintained no difference in local recurrence, DFS, or OS, with 5-year OS 52.9% for open and 60.3% for laparoscopic surgery (P = 0.132). In COREAN, 3-year DFS did not differ at 72.5% (95% CI, 65.0%–78.6%) for open versus 79.2% (95% CI, 72.3%–84.6%) for laparoscopic, and longer-term outcomes from laparoscopic rectal surgery have not been reported. Pathologic-outcome trials (ACOSOG Z6051 and ALaCaRT) observed no significant differences in the composite of successful resection; in Z6051, complete or nearly complete TME occurred in 92.1% (95% CI, 88.7%–95.5%) with laparoscopic and 95.1% (95% CI, 92.2%–97.9%) with open resection, for a difference of −3.0 (95% CI, −7.4 to 1.5; P = 0.20), the criteria for non-inferiority were not met, and follow-up showed similar 2-year DFS rates of 79.5% for laparoscopic versus 83.2% for open resection.

### Chemoradiotherapy and local excision vs total mesorectal excision in T2-T3ab, N0, M0 rectal cancer: the TAUTEM randomized clinical trial [^116t1NBe]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The study TAUTEM was published by Xavier Serra-Aracil and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Surg. This study is related to the following diseases: Rectal cancer. In the TAUTEM study, the trial question was: is chemoradiotherapy and local excision noninferior to total mesorectal excision in patients with rectal cancer? In the TAUTEM study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the TAUTEM study, the population was: 162 patients (54 female, 108 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with stage T2-T3ab, N0, M0 rectal adenocarcinoma. The key exclusion criteria were distant metastases; synchrony with other colorectal adenocarcinomas; undifferentiated rectal adenocarcinomas in the preoperative biopsy; intolerance of preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In the TAUTEM study, the interventions were: n = 81 chemoradiotherapy and local excision (neoadjuvant chemotherapy administered concomitantly with radiotherapy followed by local excision with transanal endoscopic microsurgery) n = 81 total mesorectal excision (standard surgical treatment). In the TAUTEM study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in locoregional recurrence at 5 years (7.4% vs. 6.2%; HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.37 to 4). In the TAUTEM study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in distant recurrence at 5 years (12.3% vs. 17.3%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.64) No significant difference in overall survival at 5 years (82.7% vs. 85.2%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.78) No significant difference in disease-free survival at 5 years (88.9% vs. 88.9%; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.4). In the TAUTEM study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with stage T2-T3ab, N0, M0 rectal adenocarcinoma, chemoradiotherapy and local excision were noninferior to total mesorectal excision with respect to locoregional recurrence at 5 years.

### Oncological safety of transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) for rectal cancer: mid-term results of a prospective multicentre study [^115GR69z]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no consensus regarding the gold standard technique for rectal cancer as Total Mesorectal Excision (TME) may be safely performed either by open or minimally invasive surgery. The laparoscopic approach, however, may carry technical difficulties. For this reason, a novel technique has emerged in the last decade combining a dual laparoscopic dissection (abdominal and transanal) to perform the TME technique (TaTME). When focusing on oncological outcomes, there is a lack of literature regarding mid-long term results. The aim of this study is to evaluate the mid-term oncological impact of TaTME for treating rectal cancer.

Methods

A prospective multicentre study was performed in four tertiary centres including consecutive patients who underwent TaTME for mid-low rectal cancer by the same group of experienced surgeons. The analysed data included pathological results on the quality of TME and mid-term oncological outcomes.

Results

In total, 173 patients were included throughout a study period of 6 years. Our series included 70% males and 68% of patients with neoadjuvant treatments. The median follow-up was 23 [15–37.5] months. Regarding pathological results, a complete TME was achieved in 72.8%, while circumferential and distal margins were affected in 1.4 and 1.1%, respectively. Five patients developed local recurrences (3%) and 8.1% presented distant disease during the follow-up. The 2-year disease-free survival and the overall survival rates were 88% and 95%, respectively.

Conclusions

There is currently a lack of evidence in the literature regarding TaTME and oncological outcomes with no data available from randomized clinical trials. In the meantime, the reported results from different multicentre series are controversial. This study showed positive mid-term outcomes at 2 years of follow-up and supported notable oncological outcomes with TaTME. However, it must be emphasized that previous experience in minimally invasive and transanal surgeries is essential for surgeons before intending to perform TaTME.

### Multicenter phase II trial of transanal total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer: preliminary results [^117Rz6wg]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Sample size and statistical analysis

The primary objective of this study was to determine whether taTME was non-inferior to standard LAR in terms of the proportion of subjects that achieve complete or near-complete mesorectal excision. With a sample size of 100, the one-sided binomial test will reject the null hypothesis that the success rate is ≤ 80% if the study procedure leads to efficacy of the total mesorectal excision for 87 or more subjects. This design achieves a power of 87% using one-sided binomial test for non-inferiority with 5% type 1 error assuming the true success rate is 90%. Patient demographic, disease-related, treatment-related, operative characteristics as well as pathologic outcomes and 90-day surgical complications were summarized for continuous variables as median and first and third quartiles, Q1–Q3, and for categorical variables as counts and percentages. Distributions of categorical variables were compared among group using the χ² or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. Univariable log-binomial regression was used to investigate associations between some of the aforementioned characteristics, identified through an extensive literature search as potential risk factors, and incomplete pathologic TME grade, reporting relative risks (RRs), corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values. RRs were selected instead of odds ratios via logistic regression because the latter tends to overestimate the strength of the association when the incidence of the outcome is 10% or more, as it is in this study. Times from surgery to stoma closure were analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier (KM) method. Comparison of stoma closure KM distributions was made between groups with the log-rank test. Eighty-two patients were censored for anastomotic leak at the time of their ileostomy reversal or permanent colostomy creation. Two patients were censored for stoma closure at their permanent colostomy creation. Duration of follow-up for postoperative complications was calculated as the maximum of 90 days and days to ileostomy reversal or permanent colostomy creation, except for in one patient whose follow-up was only 70 days due to death. Univariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to investigate associations between characteristics identified through literature search as potential risk factors for anastomotic leak and/or stoma closure, reporting hazard ratios (HRs), corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p values. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). Hypothesis testing was conducted at the 5% level of significance. However, p values less than 10% were considered borderline significant in exploratory regression analyses.

### Open versus laparoscopic surgery for mid-rectal or low-rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (COREAN trial): survival outcomes of an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^1126hvDv]. The Lancet: Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Compared with open resection, laparoscopic resection of rectal cancers is associated with improved short-term outcomes, but high-level evidence showing similar long-term outcomes is scarce. We aimed to compare survival outcomes of laparoscopic surgery with open surgery for patients with mid-rectal or low-rectal cancer.

Methods

The Comparison of Open versus laparoscopic surgery for mid or low REctal cancer After Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (COREAN) trial was an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial done between April 4, 2006, and Aug 26, 2009, at three centres in Korea. Patients (aged 18–80 years) with cT3N0-2M0 mid-rectal or low-rectal cancer who had received preoperative chemoradiotherapy were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either open or laparoscopic surgery. Randomisation was stratified by sex and preoperative chemotherapy regimen. Investigators were masked to the randomisation sequence; patients and clinicians were not masked to the treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was 3 year disease-free survival, with a non-inferiority margin of 15%. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00470951.

Findings

We randomly assigned 340 patients to receive either open surgery (n = 170) or laparoscopic surgery (n = 170). 3 year disease-free survival was 72.5% (95% CI 65.0–78.6) for the open surgery group and 79.2% (72.3–84.6) for the laparoscopic surgery group, with a difference that was lower than the prespecified non-inferiority margin (-6.7%, 95% CI -15.8 to 2.4; p < 0.0001). 25 (15%) patients died in the open group and 20 (12%) died in the laparoscopic group. No deaths were treatment related.

Interpretation

Our results show that laparoscopic resection for locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy provides similar outcomes for disease-free survival as open resection, thus justifying its use.

### Oncologic outcomes after transanal total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer [^116GqB4Y]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

Our series additionally demonstrates a low rate of anastomotic complications that are a substantial cause of early and long-term morbidity and may also adversely impact cancer outcomes. Historically, anastomotic complications are known to occur in approximately 20% of patients following low anterior resection in the setting of preoperative radiotherapy. Mirnezami et alrevealed a significant association between colorectal anastomotic leak and local recurrence, reducing long-term cancer-specific survival. Despite the administration of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in 87% of patients and all patients receiving low coloanal anastomoses, the rate of anastomotic leak in this study is notably low at 3.8%. Our default anastomotic technique is the double-pursestring, single-stapled method, which has been demonstrated to have low rates of leak with open and laparoscopic approaches. This anastomosis is accessible through the transanal platform and can be inspected and suture reinforced to close any staple line defects. Our low anastomotic leak rate may reflect a benefit of TaTME when performing a coloanal anastomosis, which has been shown to have the highest leak rate of any colorectal anastomosis at 5% to 19%.

There are important limitations to this study. First, our data set is only mature enough to report on 29-month follow-up; the standard 5-year oncologic outcomes for this cohort of patients are pending. Considering the pressing international concerns over oncologic outcomes following TaTME, we felt it was imperative to provide our experience to date, because our series represents the largest experiences in the United States and, by virtue of introducing the technique in 2014, our center is one of the few US centers able to analyze and present these data. Although our follow-up is limited to 29 months, the majority of local recurrences occur within 2 years of resection, as shown by the COLOR II trial and the Dutch TME trial. In addition, our 29-month median follow-up period exceeds the 19.5-month median follow-up period reported in the updated Norwegian study. Second, although this study may be limited by selection bias, it is important to note that patients with mid to low rectal tumors were included consecutively, and all patients with low rectal cancer at our center underwent TaTME exclusively. Third, this study may not be widely generalizable, because it includes data from a single academic institution where the perineal portion of the TaTME is performed by 2 highly experienced surgeons.

### Laparoscopic versus open total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer [^111Vqcbs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer including rectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer deaths in the western world. For colon carcinoma, laparoscopic surgery is proven to result in faster postoperative recovery, fewer complications and better cosmetic results with equal oncologic results. These short-term benefits are expected to be similar for laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery. However, the oncological safety of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer remained controversial due to the lack of definitive long-term results. Thus, the expected short-term benefits can only be of interest when oncological results are at least equal.

Objectives

To evaluate the differences in short- and long-term results after elective laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) for the resection of rectal cancer compared with open total mesorectal excision (OTME).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1990 to February 2013), EMBASE (January 1990 to February 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (February 2013) and Current Controlled Trials (February 2013). We handsearched the reference lists of the included articles for missed studies.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LTME and OTME, reporting at least one of our outcome measures, was considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality according to the CONSORT statement, and resolved disagreements by discussion. We rated the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We identified 45 references out of 953 search results, of which 14 studies met the inclusion criteria involving 3528 rectal cancer patients. We did not consider the risk of bias of the included studies to have impacted on the quality of the evidence. Data were analysed according to an intention-to-treat principle with a mean conversion rate of 14.5% (range 0% to 35%) in the laparoscopic group. There was moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic and open TME had similar effects on five-year disease-free survival (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.76 to1.38, 4 studies, N = 943). The estimated effects of laparoscopic and open TME on local recurrence and overall survival were similar, although confidence intervals were wide, both with moderate quality evidence (local recurrence: OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.57 to1.39 and overall survival rate: OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.87 to1.52). There was moderate to high quality evidence that the number of resected lymph nodes and surgical margins were similar between the two groups. For the short-term results, length of hospital stay was reduced by two days (95% CI -3.22 to -1.10), moderate quality evidence), and the time to first defecation was shorter in the LTME group (-0.86 days; 95% CI -1.17 to -0.54). There was moderate quality evidence that 30 days morbidity were similar in both groups (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.8 to 1.1). There were fewer wound infections (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.93) and fewer bleeding complications (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.93) in the LTME group. There was no clear evidence of any differences in quality of life after LTME or OTME regarding functional recovery, bladder and sexual function. The costs were higher for LTME with differences up to GBP 2000 for direct costs only.

Authors' Conclusions

We have found moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) has similar effects to open TME on long term survival outcomes for the treatment of rectal cancer. The quality of the evidence was downgraded due to imprecision and further research could impact on our confidence in this result. There is moderate quality evidence that it leads to better short-term post-surgical outcomes in terms of recovery for non-locally advanced rectal cancer. Currently results are consistent in showing a similar disease-free survival and overall survival, and for recurrences after at least three years and up to 10 years, although due to imprecision we cannot rule out superiority of either approach. We await long-term data from a number of ongoing and recently completed studies to contribute to a more robust analysis of long-term disease free, overall survival and local recurrence.

### A randomized trial of laparoscopic versus open surgery for rectal cancer [^114YrANr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study COLOR II was published by H Jaap Bonjer and colleagues in 2015 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Rectal cancer. In the COLOR II study, the trial question was: is laparoscopic surgery noninferior to open surgery in patients with rectal cancer? In the COLOR II study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the COLOR II study, the population was: 1044 patients (385 female, 659 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with rectal cancer within 15 cm from the anal verge without evidence of distant metastases. The key exclusion criteria were T4 tumors or T3 tumors within 2 mm of the endopelvic fascia; T1 tumors treated by local excision; signs of acute intestinal obstruction; > 1 colorectal tumor. In the COLOR II study, the interventions were: n = 699 laparoscopic surgery (laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection) n = 345 open surgery (open laparotomy and rectal resection). In the COLOR II study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in locoregional recurrence at 3 years (5% vs. 5%;). In the COLOR II study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in disease-free survival at 3 years (74.8% vs. 70.8%; AD 4%, 95% CI -1.9 to 9.9) No significant difference in overall survival at 3 years (86.7% vs. 83.6%; AD 3.1%, 95% CI -1.6 to 7.8). In the COLOR II study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with rectal cancer within 15 cm from the anal verge without evidence of distant metastases, laparoscopic surgery was noninferior to open surgery with respect to locoregional recurrence at 3 years.

### Comparison of pathological outcomes after transanal versus laparoscopic total mesorectal excision: a prospective study using data from randomized control trial [^113mVTSb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the standard procedure for middle lower rectal cancer, and transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) was founded as a valid alternative to the open and laparoscopic TME. The quality of the procedure performed is important for prognosis of patients. This study was designed to compare the pathological results of taTME with those of laparoscopic TME (laTME), based on the data from a randomized control trial (RCT: NCT02966483).

Methods

Between April 2016 and November 2018, all rectal cancer patients who underwent taTME or laTME in the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China) and enrolled in the RCT were included in this study. The data from all participants were prospectively input in a standardized database.

Results

In total 128 patients were included in the taTME group and 133 patients were included in the laTME group. The demographics and tumor characteristics were not significantly different between the two group. T3 or N0 lesions were most common in both groups. The mesorectum specimen was complete or nearly complete in all patients. The positive distal resection margin (DRM) was detected in 2 (1.5%) cases in the laTME group versus no cases in the taTME group (P = 0.498), and the distance between the tumor and DRM in the taTME group (1.4 ± 1.1) may have the longer tendency than that in the laTME group (1.3 ± 0.9) (P = 0.745). The positive circumferential resection margin was detected in 2 cases in each group (P = 0.674). The median number of resected lymph nodes was 15.0 in taTME group versus 16.0 in the laTME group (P = 0.069).

Conclusion

The pathological outcomes between transanal and laparoscopic total mesorectal excision are similar. The rate of positive resection margin could not be significant decreased, nonetheless the decrease trend could be shown.

### Oncologic outcomes after transanal total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer [^114eFFpF]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

As the largest series from one of the few high-volume TaTME sites in the United States, our results provide long-awaited data on safety and oncologic local control. As early adopters of TaTME, we demonstrate in this consecutive, longitudinal series both the safety and excellent short- and mid-term oncologic outcomes for mid to low rectal cancer, with few involved circumferential margins (5%), no involved distal margins, and no local recurrences. Although not mature enough to report on 5-year oncologic outcomes, our follow-up of 29 months (range, 7–60) represents the longest time period from any US site, further supporting the oncologic durability of the TaTME procedure.

These findings are particularly relevant in the context of the ongoing global debate regarding the oncologic safety of TaTME. The negligible recurrence rate in this study is far lower than reported by Larsen et alin the Norwegian study. Although surgeon expertise and center volume have been hypothesized to play a role in the Norwegian outcomes, a multidisciplinary approach to rectal cancer remains critical. Our center followed a standard protocol according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, resulting in 87% of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, in stark contrast to the 21% of patients in the Norwegian trial. Although surgical technique clearly impacts patient outcomes, the multidisciplinary approach itself, including the administration of up-front chemotherapy and radiotherapy, has been proven to impact local recurrence and survival rates. The technical advantages of the TaTME approach are further supported by our favorable rectal specimen results, including specimen grading (98.7% complete/near complete grade), no positive distal margins, low CRM positivity rate (5.1%), and no rectal perforations. The ACOSOG and ALaCaRT trials defined "optimal pathology" as a surrogate for surgical quality by meeting the following criteria: complete or nearly complete TME, clear (> 1 mm) CRM, and clear (> 1 mm) distal margin. Our series compares favorably to benchmarks because this composite score was achieved in 95% (n = 75) of the consecutive patients in this study, compared with 82% in the laparoscopic surgery group and 89% in the open surgery group in the ALaCaRT trial. Although tumor exposure at the CRM predicts a higher rate of local recurrence and poorer DFS, the CRM was negative in 95% of specimens in this study. Because 78.4% of patients were alive with no evidence of disease at the end of follow-up and the total cohort survival rate was 86.6%, these favorable histopathologic outcomes support the role of TaTME related to patient outcomes.

### COLOR III trial: transanal vs laparoscopic TME… [^111avM3A]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Background Surgery for mid and low rectal cancer is associated with relative high rates of incomplete mesorectal excisions and high rates of circumferential resection margin involvement resulting in significant number of local recurrences. Moreover, patients with mid and low rectal cancer suffer from high rates of morbidity, permanent colostomies and impairment of quality of life. The transanal TME has been developed to improve the quality of TME surgery in mid and low rectal cancer. Hypothesis The hypothesis is that TaTME will result in a comparable local recurrence rate at 3-years follow-up with benefit of lower morbidity and conversions. Furthermore, because of direct endoscopic visualization, even in very low tumors a coloanal anastomosis can be created, resulting in a lower colostomy rate compared with laparoscopic and open resection.

Because long-term outcomes are unknown, within a trial setting the technique can be standardized and quality control can be performed. To improve oncological and functional outcomes of patients with rectal cancer new surgical techniques are being developed. The adoption of the TME technique has resulted in better oncological outcome in the last decades. The addition of neoadjuvant therapy has further improved oncological outcome. The minimal invasive laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer has shown to be safe and to result in improved short-term outcomes and reduced morbidity. In attempt to improve the quality of the TME procedure in low rectal cancer and further improve oncological results the TaTME has been developed, in which the rectum is dissected transanally according to TME principles. First series have been described since 2010 and although randomised evidence is still lacking this new technique has shown to be feasible and safe.

The rectum including the total mesorectum is mobilised transanally in a reversed way with minimally invasive surgery including high quality imaging techniques. The TaTME technique for mid and low rectal cancer has shown to have potential benefits: better specimen quality with less R1 resections, less morbidity, less conversion to laparotomy and more sphincter saving rectal resections without compromising oncological outcomes. The investigators propose to evaluate the TaTME technique compared with conventional laparoscopic rectal resection for patients with mid and low rectal cancer in an international randomised trial: the COLOR III trial.

### Effect of transanal total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer: comparison of short-term outcomes with laparoscopic and open surgeries [^115kEDfu]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare short-term results of total mesorectal excision (TME) for mid and low rectal cancer, achieved by transanal (TaTME), laparoscopic (LaTME), and open (OpTME) approaches.

Background

The impact of TaTME on the surgical treatment of mid and low rectal cancer has yet to be clarified.

Methods

This is a case-matched study, based on data from a prospectively maintained database of patients who underwent TaTME from May 2015 to March 2017, and a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent LaTME and OpTME in the previous period. Each patient in the TaTME group was matched to one LaTME and one OpTME based on sex, BMI, tumor status, and the height of the tumor from the anal verge. Primary end-points were rates of positive circumferential resection margin (CRM), distal resection margin, and the macroscopic quality of the surgical specimen. Composite of these outcomes was compared as an indication for successful surgery. Secondary end-points included intraoperative data and postoperative course and complications.

Results

Three hundred patients were included (TaTME = 100, LaTME = 100, OpTME = 100). The three groups were comparable in the baseline characteristics. TaTME resulted in lower rates of incomplete TME specimens than LaTME, but not OpTME (P = 0.016, P = 0.750, respectively). The rates of CRM involvement, mean CRM distance, and the percentages of successful surgery were comparable among the three groups (P = 0.368). The conversion to open surgery occurred only in the LaTME group. TaTME resulted in shorter operation time and less blood loss than the other two groups (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001). Hospital stay was shorter in the TaTME group (P = 0.002); complication rate and mortality were comparable among the groups.

Conclusions

TaTME had, in our hands, some obvious benefits over other approaches. The pathological results were not significantly superior to LaTME and OpTME. The procedure is however feasible and safe. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term oncological and quality of life outcomes.

### Transanal total mesorectal excision versus anterior total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer: a propensity score matched, population-based study in catalonia, Spain [^113Ugeqr]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical value of transanal total mesorectal excision is debated.

Objective

This study aimed to compare short- and medium-term effects of transanal versus anterior total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer.

Design

This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study.

Setting

The study included all Catalonian public hospitals.

Patients

All patients receiving transanal or anterior total mesorectal excision (open or laparoscopic) for nonmetastatic primary rectal cancer in 2015 to 2016 were included.

Main Outcome Measures

Data on vital status were collected to March 2019. Between-group differences were minimized by applying propensity score matching to baseline patient characteristics. Competing risk models were used to assess systemic and local recurrence along with death at 2 years, and multivariable Cox regression was used to assess 2-year disease-free survival. Results are expressed with their 95% CIs.

Results

The final subsample was 537 patients receiving total mesorectal excision (transanal approach: n = 145; anterior approach: n = 392). Median follow-up was 39.2 months (interquartile range, 33.0–45.8). Accounting for death as a competing event, there was no association between transanal total mesorectal excision and local recurrence (matched subhazard ratio 1.28, 95% CI 0.55–2.96). There were no statistical differences in the comparative rate of local recurrence (transanal: 1.77 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 0.76–3.34; anterior: 1.37 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 0.8–2.15) or mortality (transanal: 3.98 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 2.36–6.16; anterior: 2.99 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 2.1–4.07). Groups presented similar 2-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence (4.83% versus 3.57%) and disease-free survival (HR, 1.33; 95% CI 0.92–1.92).

Limitations

We used data only from the public system, the study is retrospective, and data on individual surgeons are not reported.

Conclusion

These population-based results support the use of either the transanal, open, or laparoscopic approach for rectal cancer in Catalonia.

Antecedentes

Se debate el valor clínico de la escisión mesorrectal total transanal.

Objetivo

Comparar los efectos a corto y mediano plazo de la escisión mesorrectal total transanal versus anterior para el cáncer de recto.

Diseo

Este fue un estudio de cohorte retrospectivo multicéntrico.

Ajuste

El estudio incluyó a todos los hospitales públicos de Cataluña.

Pacientes

Todos los pacientes no metastásicos que recibieron escisión mesorrectal total anterior o transanal (abierta o laparoscópica) por cáncer de recto primario en 2015–16.

Principales Medidas De Valoracion

Los datos sobre el estado vital se recopilaron hasta marzo de 2019. Las diferencias entre los grupos se minimizaron aplicando el emparejamiento de puntajes de propensión a las características iniciales del paciente. Se utilizaron modelos de riesgo competitivo para evaluar la recurrencia sistémica y local junto con la muerte a los dos años, y la regresión de Cox multivariable para evaluar la supervivencia libre de enfermedad a dos años. Los resultados se expresan con sus intervalos de confianza del 95%.

Resultados

La submuestra final fue de 537 pacientes que recibieron escisión mesorrectal total (abordaje transanal: n = 145; abordaje anterior: n = 392). La mediana de seguimiento fue de 39,2 meses (rango intercuartílico 33,0–45,8). Teniendo en cuenta la muerte como un evento competitivo, no hubo asociación entre la escisión mesorrectal total transanal y la recurrencia local (cociente de subriesgo apareado 1,28, 0,55–2,96). No hubo diferencias estadísticas en la tasa comparativa de recurrencia local (transanal: 1,77 por 100 personas-año, 0,76–3,34; anterior: 1,37 por 100 personas-año, 0,8–2,15) o mortalidad (transanal: 3,98 por 100 personas-año, 2,36–6,16; anterior: 2,99 por 100 personas-año, 2,1–4,07). Los grupos presentaron una incidencia acumulada de dos años similar de recidiva local (4,83% frente a 3,57%, respectivamente) y supervivencia libre de enfermedad (índice de riesgo 1,33, 0,92–1,92).

Limitaciones

Utilizamos datos solo del sistema público, el estudio es retrospectivo y no se informan datos sobre cirujanos individuales.

Conclusiones

Estos resultados poblacionales apoyan el uso del abordaje transanal, abierto o laparoscópico para el cáncer de recto en Cataluña. Consulte. Video Resumen en http://links.lww.com/DCR/B744. (Traducción- Dr. Francisco M. Abarca-Rendon).

### Transanal versus abdominal low rectal dissection for rectal cancer: long-term results of the bordeaux' randomized trial [^111p49nh]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of the current study is to report long-term outcomes after transanal low rectal dissection compared with the conventional laparoscopic approach within the context of the Bordeaux' randomized trial. Results from this randomized trial have indicated that transanal approach was more effective than laparoscopic dissection regarding the rate of negative circumferential resection margin (CRM). Despite a high number of publications regarding the transanal approach for TME, there were no long-term data on survival and local recurrence which are now required.

Methods

One hundred patients with low rectal cancer suitable for laparoscopic TME with handsewn coloanal anastomosis were randomized in transanal versus laparoscopic low rectal dissection from 2008 to 2012. The randomization ratio was 1:1. All patients included in the trial were considered for long-term assessment. Local recurrence, overall- and disease-free survival were assessed by Kaplan-Meier and compared with Log-rank test.

Results

The follow up was 60.2 months, similar in both group (p = 0.321). Overall, there were no differences of long-term outcomes. There was a significant association between CRM involvement and local recurrence (p = 0.011), however, the 5-year local recurrence rate was 4%, without any significant difference between transanal and laparoscopic dissection: 3% vs. 5%; p = 0.300. The 5-year disease-free survival was 73%: 72% vs. 74; p = 0.351.

Conclusion

Lower positivity of the circumferential resection margin was reported after transanal low rectal dissection, but it did not translate into a decreased incidence of local recurrence. Further investigations are necessary to demonstrate advantages of this new procedure.

### Long term oncological outcomes for laparoscopic versus open surgery for rectal cancer – A population-based nationwide noninferiority study [^117HP7dJ]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

What does this paper add to the literature?

In this cohort of patients from an entire nation undergoing curative abdominal rectal cancer surgery, laparoscopic and open technique were compared on an intention to treat basis. In order to mimic a randomized setting, a non‐inferiority design was employed and the study population permitted a low non inferiority margin of 2%. The present study demonstrated that laparoscopic was not inferior to open technique regarding overall survival at 5 years. In Multivariabable Cox regression analysis overall survival was higher in laproscopy when cT4 was included but not when cT4 was excluded. Converted patients had a slightly worse outcome.

### Short-term outcomes of transanal completion total mesorectal excision (cTaTME) for rectal cancer: a case-matched analysis [^115M7CSx]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite the correction for potential selection bias, the small sample size should be noted as a limitation of this study. Identification of predictive factors or multivariate analysis for worse pathological outcome is therefore not possible. Due to substantial differences in follow-up in cTME versus cTaTME, the focus of this article is only on short-term results. Long-term follow-up, including oncological and functional outcomes, will be evaluated after 36 months to report on local recurrence rate and disease-free survival. For conclusive results to be made, a larger cohort should be reviewed. This preliminary case-matched cohort study, however, shows promising short-term results. Hesitation to undertake TAMIS in cases of rectal polyps/carcinoma due to fear of completion surgery with worse pathological outcome and increased morbidity may be omitted by the introduction of completion TaTME. Instead of immediate TME when stage I carcinoma is expected, a low threshold for local therapy could be offered in early rectal cancer staged with MRI (T1/2 N0 with a diameter of < 3 cm) since completion surgery with TaTME seems feasible and safe and has favorable short-term outcomes. The majority will have low-risk features and for the minority indication for additional completion TaTME in this step-up approach should be considered. For these patients with poor-risk features after TAMIS, a rectal preserving treatment option is currently under investigation in the TESAR trial, which is a randomized clinical trial comparing radical completion surgery versus adjuvant chemoradiation after TAMIS. Until these results are available, completion surgery will be the golden standard for rectal cancer surgery and therefore, based on our results, transanal approach should be considered in these patients.

In conclusion, completion surgery with TaTME after a primary local excision for rectal cancers leads to significantly better quality of specimen, less perforation of the rectum, lower conversion rate, increased number of harvested lymph nodes, and shorter hospital stay compared to abdominal completion TME and has comparable pathological and short-term outcomes compared to primary TME. These results strengthen the step-up strategy of local excision followed by TaTME, if indicated based on pathology. Future studies are needed to evaluate potential differences in long-term functional and oncological outcomes between conventional TME and TaTME after full-thickness local excision.

### Long-term oncological outcomes of transanal total mesorectal excision in rectal cancer: a retrospective study from a high-volume Italian center [^111kBGmA]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the documented technical advantages in terms of pelvis dissection and increased rate of sphincter-preserving procedures, the long-term oncological outcomes after transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) are still a matter of debate. This study aimed to report mid- and long-term survival outcomes of patients with rectal cancer treated with TaTME.

Methods

Patients with non-metastatic mid to low rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent double-team trans-anal/laparoscopic trans-abdominal total mesorectal excision between 2015 and 2020 were selected and reviewed. Three and 5-year overall survival (OS), 3 and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS), 3 and 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS), and 3 and 5-year local recurrence (LR) rate. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to correlate clinical and pathological variables with the outcomes of interest.

Results

Of 146 patients treated with TaTME during the study period, 114 non-metastatic patients were analyzed (M/F 1.7; mean age: 69.1 years). The mean follow-up time was 58.6 months. Sixty four percentage received neoadjuvant treatment before TaTME. Pathologic stages were documented as being stage 0-I in 62 (54.4%) and stage II-III in the remaining 52 patients (45.6%); 5 patients had a positive circumferential margin (4.4%), and overall, one-third of the cohort received adjuvant therapy. 3-year survival outcomes were: OS 89.4%, DFS 95.5%, DSS 85.5%, and LR 3.5%. The multivariable analysis of the 3-year outcomes showed a significant association between OS and age at the time of surgery and between DFS and pathological stages. A 5-year survival analysis was conducted on 68 patients. 5-year survivals were OS 75.0%, DFS 91.0%, and DSS 82.0%. Multivariate analysis showed that elderly age had a negative impact on 5-year OS.

Conclusions

When performed by experienced surgeons in a high-volume center, TaTME is a mini-invasive procedure with good mid/long-term oncological outcomes.

### Comparing perioperative and oncological outcomes of transanal and laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and prospective studies [^1127DUGr]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Meta-analysis of the results of transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) and laparoscopic TME (laTME) regarding perioperative and oncological outcomes have been conducted. Due to the lack of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective studies in the included literature, the conclusions are unreliable. This study included RCTs and prospective studies for analysis to obtain more reliable conclusions.

Materials and Methods

Systematic searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were conducted up to June 2023. To assess the quality, the Cochrane quality assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were employed. The perioperative and oncological outcomes were then analyzed. The I 2 statistic was used to evaluate statistical heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses was conducted.

Results

A total of 22 studies, comprising 5056 patients, were included in the analysis, of which 6 were RCTs and 16 were prospective studies. The conversion rate in the taTME group was significantly lower than that in the laTME group (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.22, P < 0.01), and the circumferential resection margin (CRM) was longer (MD 0.99 mm, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.32 mm, P < 0.01), with a lower rate of positive CRM involvement (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.97, P = 0.03). No statistically significant differences were found in terms of the operation time, intraoperative blood loss, complications, anastomotic leakage, uroschesis, obstruction, secondary operation, hospital stay, urethral injury, readmission, mortality rate within 30 days, mesorectal resection quality, number of harvested lymph nodes, distal resection margin (DRM), positive DRM, local recurrence, and distance recurrence (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

According to the findings of this meta-analysis, which is based on RCTs and prospective studies, taTME appears to have an advantage over laTME in terms of conversion rate and CRM involvement.

### Disease-free survival and local recurrence after laparoscopic-assisted resection or open resection for rectal cancer: the australasian laparoscopic cancer of the rectum randomized clinical trial [^116RNoQ1]. Annals of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of laparoscopic rectal resection (Lap) versus open laparotomy and rectal resection (Open) for rectal cancer on locoregional recurrence (LRR) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years.

Summary Background Data

Although a Lap approach to colon cancer surgery may offer similar oncological outcomes to Open with potentially less morbidity, this remains to be clearly established for the treatment of rectal cancer.

Methods

A randomized, multicenter noninferiority phase 3 trial of 475 patients with T1 to T3 rectal adenocarcinoma < 15cm from anal verge, given Lap or Open and followed for a minimum 2 years to assess LRR, DFS, and overall survival (OS).

Results

Secondary endpoint analyses included 450 patients (95%) without metastases at baseline (mean age 64; 34% women) who received Lap (n = 225) or Open (n = 225). Median follow-up was 3.2 years (range: 0.1–5.4 yrs). LRR cumulative incidence at 2 years: Lap 5.4%; Open 3.1% [difference, 2.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.5% to 6.1%; hazard ratio (HR) 1.7; 95% CI, 0.74–3.9]. DFS at 2 years: Lap 80%; Open 82% (difference, 2.0%; 95% CI, -9.3% to 5.4%; HR for recurrence or death, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.81–1.68; P = 0.41). After adjustment for baseline factors HR = 1.07 (95% CI, 0.7–1.6). OS at 2 years: Lap 94%; Open 93% (difference 0.9%; 95% CI, -3.6% to 5.4%).

Conclusions

Laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer did not differ significantly from open surgery in effects on 2-year recurrence or DFS and OS. Confidence intervals included potentially clinically important differences favoring open resection, so that the combination of primary and secondary study endpoints may not support laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer as a routine standard of care and further follow-up is required.

### Organ preservation with chemoradiotherapy plus local excision for rectal cancer: 5-year results of the GRECCAR 2 randomised trial [^114wT7Qc]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Background

GRECCAR 2 was the first multicentre, randomised trial to compare local excision with total mesorectal excision in downstaged low rectal cancer. Encouraging oncological results were noted at 3 years' follow-up but needed to be corroborated with longer follow-up. In this study, we aimed to report the 5-year oncological outcomes, including local recurrence, metastatic disease, and survival.

Methods

Patients age 18 years and older with T2T3 low rectal cancer, of maximum size 4 cm, who were clinically good responders after chemoradiotherapy (residual tumour ≤ 2 cm) were randomly assigned before surgery to either local excision or total mesorectal excision. Randomisation was centralised and not stratified and used permuted blocks of size eight. In the local excision group, a completion total mesorectal excision was performed if pathological tumour stage was ypT2-3. The primary objective of this study was to assess the 5-year oncological outcomes of local recurrence, metastatic disease, disease-free survival, overall survival, and cancer-specific mortality, which were the secondary endpoints of GRECCAR 2. We used Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox modelling to estimate and compare recurrence and survival in modified intention-to-treat and as-treated populations. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00427375.

Findings

Between March 1, 2007, and Sept 24, 2012, 148 patients who were good clinical responders were randomly assigned to treatment, three patients were excluded after randomisation (because they had metastatic disease, tumour > 8 cm from anal verge, or withdrew consent), leaving 145 for analysis: 74 in the local excision group and 71 in the total mesorectal excision group. Median follow-up was 60 months (IQR 58–60) in the local excision group and 60 months (57–60) in the total mesorectal excision group. 23 patients died and five were lost to follow-up. In the local excision group, 26 had a completion total mesorectal excision for ypT2-3 tumour. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, there was no difference between the local excision and total mesorectal excision groups in 5-year local recurrence (7% [95% CI 3–16] vs 7% [3–16]; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.71 [95% CI 0.19–2.58]; p = 0.60), metastatic disease (18% [CI 11–30] vs 19% [11–31]; 0.86 [0.36–2.06]; p = 0.73), overall survival (84% [73–91] vs 82% [71–90]; 0.92 [0.38–2.22]; p = 0.85), disease-free survival (70% [58–79] vs 72% [60–82]; 0.87 [0.44–1.72]; p = 0.68), or cancer-specific mortality (7% [3–17] vs 10% [5–20]; 0.65 [0.17–2.49]; p = 0.53).

Interpretation

The 5-year results of this multicentre randomised trial corroborate the 3-year results, providing no evidence of difference in oncological outcomes between local excision and total mesorectal excision. Local excision can be proposed in selected patients having a small T2T3 low rectal cancer with a good clinical response after chemoradiotherapy.

### Comparison of survival among adults with rectal cancer who have undergone laparoscopic vs open surgery: a meta-analysis [^116cwSCr]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Rectal cancer is currently one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although much progress has been achieved with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, surgery is still the most important treatment for patients with rectal cancer. In the era of minimally invasive surgery, comparable long-term outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgery for rectal cancer have been demonstrated by several worldwide randomized clinical trials (RCTs), during the past 15 years.

However, 2 RCTs (ACOSOG Z6051and ALaCaRT [Australasian Laparoscopic Cancer of the Rectum]), which were designed to compare pathologic outcomes between the 2 surgical approaches, demonstrated that laparoscopic surgery failed to yield a noninferior rate of "successful resection", which was considered as a surrogate end point for long-term outcomes and included negative circumferential resection margin, complete or near-complete total mesorectal excision, and negative distal margin. However, comparable long-term survival outcomes, including disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), between the 2 approaches were found in the follow-up of the 2 RCTs. The authors of the 2 RCTs ascribed the contradiction between the surrogate end point and corresponding long-term outcomes to insufficient statistical power for long-term outcomes. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a meta-analysis to obtain enough power to support or oppose laparoscopic surgery for patients with rectal cancer in terms of long-term outcomes.

Numerous meta-analyses, have been conducted to compare laparoscopic surgery with open surgery in terms of long-term outcomes. However, the method of the pooled analysis was inappropriate in most of the previous meta-analyses. These survival meta-analyses combined dichotomous data, which could lead to misleading results and are not recommended by the Cochrane handbook. Conversely, time-to-event data are the most appropriate data for survival meta-analysis; furthermore, individual participant data (IPD) are believed to be particularly advantageous for analysis of time-to-event data. Therefore, we performed an IPD meta-analysis using time-to-event data and focused on the long-term survival outcomes after laparoscopic or open surgery for adult patients with rectal cancer.

### Morbidity, mortality, and pathologic outcomes of transanal versus laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer short-term outcomes from a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^115wcvwG]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In the current literature, the surgical resection quality for patients receiving taTME varies greatly. A meta-analysis assessed the pathologic outcomes of taTME versus laTME for middle and low rectal cancer, and results indicated that the positive CRM ranged from 0/46 to 4/34 (11.8%) and that the DRM ranged from 0/41 to 3/41 (7.3%). Recently, an observational study using data from an online registry system showed that incomplete TME, positive CRM, and positive DRM were noted in 0.1% (1/849), 2.8% (22/849), and 0.7% (7/849) of patients, respectively. Although the findings from different reports could not be directly compared, this trial showed a relatively high rate of successful resection. This phenomenon could be ascribed to the expertise of the surgical teams and the exclusion of patients with the involvement of the CRM as indicated by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, all patients who participated in this study were Chinese. Taking the characteristics of Asian populations into consideration, especially the average BMI, which is lower than that observed for non-Asian populations, the results might also contribute to the good pathologic outcomes of this trial.

Despite similar surgical safety and pathologic outcomes of taTME versus laTME in this trial, several potential disadvantages of taTME technique should be put forward. First, all the surgeons participating in this trial had technical expertise in taTME. The steep learning curve resulting from the complexity of taTME inevitably impedes the generalizability of our findings. Thus, the establishment of an effective learning system is necessary to foster optimal taTME training. Second, a higher rate of intersphincteric resection was found in patients receiving taTME in this trial, and the sacrifice of the internal sphincter could potentially impair functional outcomes. Third, due to the use of a wide anal platform, patients undergoing taTME suffered from the prolonged anal dilatation, which was likely to interfere with functional results as well. Last, this trial demonstrated the 1-team taTME procedure took longer than laTME, and this might represent a potential disadvantage of taTME. Given these potential limitations of taTME, the clinical acceptance of taTME requires further efforts.

### A systematic review of outcomes after transanal mesorectal resection for rectal cancer [^117RowTV]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Transanal mesorectal resection has been developed to facilitate minimally invasive proctectomy for rectal cancer.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the evidence regarding technical parameters, oncological outcomes, morbidity, and mortality after transanal mesorectal resection.

Data Sources

The Cochrane Library, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases were reviewed.

Study Selection

Systematic review of the literature from January 2005 to September 2015 was used for study selection.

Intervention

Intervention included transanal mesorectal resection for rectal cancer.

Main Outcome Measures

Technical parameters, histological outcomes, morbidity, and mortality were the outcomes measured.

Results

Fifteen predominately retrospective studies involving 449 patients were included (mean age, 64.3 years; 64.1% men). Different platforms were used. The operative mortality rate was 0.4% and the cumulative morbidity rate 35.5%. Circumferential resection margins were clear in 98%, and the resected mesorectum was grade III in 87% of patients. Median follow-up was 14.7 months. There were 4 local recurrences (1.5%) and 12 patients (5.6%) with metastatic disease. No study followed patients long enough to report on 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates. Functional outcome was only reported in 3 studies.

Limitations

A low number of procedures were performed by expert early adopters. There are no comparative or randomized data included in this study and inconsistent reporting of outcome variables.

Conclusions

Transanal mesorectal resection for rectal cancer may enhance negative circumferential margin rates with a reasonable safety profile. Contemporary randomized, controlled studies are required before there can be universal recommendation.

### Open versus laparoscopic surgery for advanced low rectal cancer: a large, multicenter, propensity score matched cohort study in Japan [^115nWrsR]. Annals of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

With regard to OS, RFS, and local RFS, there are no large studies showing a significant difference between laparoscopic and open surgery for rectal cancer. In the COLOR II study, similar locoregional recurrence after laparoscopic surgery to that after open surgery was demonstrated. Similarly, the COREAN study showed the noninferiority of disease-free survival after laparoscopic surgery compared with that after open surgery. In the other 2 studies, the ALaCaRT trial and the ACOSOG Z6051 trial, the noninferiority of a positive CRM rate could not be shown after laparoscopic surgery compared with open surgery, and long-term results are awaited. Our study included only low rectal cancer (median tumor distance 4.5 cm from the anal verge), so the recurrence rate seemed high (3-year RFS: laparoscopic group, 71.8%; open surgery group, 70.9%). However, the 3-year-RFS rates for pathological stage III disease were 64.6% and 57.9%, respectively (Supplemental data 4). These data are comparable with those reported by the COREAN trial (around 50% from the graph) and COLOR-II trial (laparoscopic group, 64.9%; open surgery group, 52.0%). In this study, there was no significant difference in OS and RFS between the 2 groups; however, we acknowledge that our study might be somewhat underpowered and our OS and DFS results should be interpreted with caution, particularly given that we only had 3.3 years of follow-up data available. Further study is needed to clarify the long-term outcomes.

The strengths of our study are the number of patients analyzed, the large number of participating institutes, the meticulous selection of patients with rectal cancer located below the peritoneal reflection only, and the validated populations matched by propensity score. In addition, the period during which the patients underwent rectal cancer surgery was very short, at only 2 years. Although some limitations exist such as selection bias due to retrospective cohort in our study, this was reduced as much as possible using propensity score matching. Although TME is known to be important, the quality of TME was not assessed in this study. The difference between the groups in the number of lateral lymph node dissections performed may have contributed to the difference in complication rates. The conceivable bias was reduced as much as possible using propensity score matching. Thus, we believe that this study offers the highest level of evidence currently available for patients with locally advanced low rectal cancer.

### Short-term outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted vs open surgery for patients with low rectal cancer: the LASRE randomized clinical trial [^111U9HCf]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the cornerstone of rectal cancer surgery. In recent decades, laparoscopic surgery has been increasingly performed to treat rectal cancer. However, it remains challenging to achieve oncological outcomes equivalent to open surgery, particularly for low rectal cancer. Low-lying rectal cancer in narrow pelvic spaces increases the difficulty of sharp dissection in laparoscopic surgery and could jeopardize surgical quality.

Surgical quality indicators, such as TME quality, negative circumferential resection margins (CRMs), negative distal resection margins (DRMs), and number of retrieved lymph nodes, are surrogate markers of local rectal cancer recurrence. Previous randomized clinical trials comparing laparoscopic and open surgeries for rectal cancer have yielded conflicting results. The MRC CLASICC trialshowed similar rates of negative CRM between laparoscopic and open surgeries. The COREANand COLOR IItrials reported comparable rates of high-quality TME in addition to similar rates of negative CRM. However, the ACOSOG Z6051and ALaCaRT trialsfailed to demonstrate noninferiority of the composite "successful resection" outcome (complete or nearly complete TME, negative CRMs and DRMs) in the laparoscopic group. Nevertheless, given the small sample sizes in these trials, little is known about the surgical quality of laparoscopic vs open surgery for low rectal cancer.

Two retrospective cohort studies have suggested equivalent perioperative safety and long-term outcomes for laparoscopic and open surgeries for low rectal cancer. Given the scarcity of results regarding surgical quality, evidence supporting the use of laparoscopic surgery for low rectal cancer remains insufficient. Thus, a large-scale randomized clinical trial of laparoscopic surgery for low rectal cancer was warranted.

The Laparoscopy-Assisted Surgery for Carcinoma of the Low Rectum (LASRE) trial was designed to compare the oncological outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgeries for low rectal cancer. We herein report the short-term pathologic and surgical outcomes. The primary end point measure of the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate will be reported later when data become available.

### Morbidity, mortality, and pathologic outcomes of transanal versus laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer short-term outcomes from a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^113Dqhtt]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical Complications

Morbidities and mortalities are described in Table 3. Intraoperative complications occurred in 26 (4.8%) of 544 patients in the taTME arm (hemorrhage in 10 patients, vascular injury in 7, intestinal injury in 4, urethral injury in 2, ureter injury in 1, subcutaneous emphysema in 1, and CO₂ embolism in 2) and 33 (6.1%) of 545 in the laTME arm (hemorrhage in 12 patients, vascular injury in 5, intestinal injury in 5, ureter injury in 4, subcutaneous emphysema in 3, spleen injury in 3, and pancreatic injury in 1). These rates had no significant difference (difference, −1.3%; 95% CI, −4.2% to 1.7%; P = 0.42). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the overall postoperative complication rate of 13.4% in the taTME and 12.1% in the laTME groups (difference, 1.2%; 95% CI, −2.8% to 5.2%; P = 0.53). In the first 30 days after surgery, 1 patient in the taTME group died of septic shock as a result of abdominal infection, and 1 patient in the laTME group died of a cerebrovascular accident. Based on the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications, the distribution of severity between the 2 groups did not differ. Specifically, the overall rate of anastomotic leakage was 6.2% [39 (7.2%) of 544 vs 29 (5.3%) of 545; difference, 1.9%; 95% CI, −1.1% to 5.0%; P = 0.21]. In addition, 24 (4.4%) and 19 (3.5%) in the taTME and laTME groups required secondary surgery within 30 days after surgery as a result of anastomotic leakage (21 vs 12), anastomotic bleeding (1 vs 4), intestinal obstruction (0 vs 2), abdominal/pelvic infection (1 vs 1), and intraperitoneal bleeding (1 vs 0).

### Organ preservation for rectal cancer (GRECCAR 2): a prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial [^113f2mcG]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Organ preservation is a concept proposed for patients with rectal cancer after a good clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, to potentially avoid morbidity and side-effects of rectal excision. The objective of this study was to compare local excision and total mesorectal excision in patients with a good response after chemoradiotherapy for lower rectal cancer.

Methods

We did a prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial at 15 tertiary centres in France that were experts in the treatment of rectal cancer. Patients aged 18 years and older with stage T2T3 lower rectal carcinoma, of maximum size 4 cm, who had a good clinical response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (residual tumour ≤ 2 cm) were centrally randomly assigned by the surgeon before surgery to either local excision or total mesorectal excision surgery. Randomisation, which was done via the internet, was not stratified and used permuted blocks of size eight. In the local excision group, a completion total mesorectal excision was required if tumour stage was ypT2-3. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome of death, recurrence, morbidity, and side-effects at 2 years after surgery, to show superiority of local excision over total mesorectal excision in the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) population (expected proportions of patients having at least one event were 25% vs 60% for superiority). This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00427375.

Findings

From March 1, 2007, to Sept 24, 2012, 186 patients received chemoradiotherapy and were enrolled in the study. 148 good clinical responders were randomly assigned to treatment, three were excluded (because they had metastatic disease, tumour > 8 cm from anal verge, and withdrew consent), and 145 were analysed: 74 in the local excision group and 71 in the total mesorectal excision group. In the local excision group, 26 patients had a completion total mesorectal excision. At 2 years in the modified ITT population, one or more events from the composite primary outcome occurred in 41 (56%) of 73 patients in the local excision group and 33 (48%) of 69 in the total mesorectal excision group (odds ratio 1.33, 95% CI 0.62–2.86; p = 0.43). In the modified ITT analysis, there was no difference between the groups in all components of the composite outcome, and superiority was not shown for local excision over total mesorectal excision.

Interpretation

We failed to show superiority of local excision over total mesorectal excision, because many patients in the local excision group received a completion total mesorectal excision that probably increased morbidity and side-effects, and compromised the potential advantages of local excision. Better patient selection to avoid unnecessary completion total mesorectal excision could improve the strategy.

### Landmark study comparing surgical approaches for rectal cancer [^113qYnPp]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Although numerous studies have reported the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer, the results of large multicentre randomized controlled trials have been lacking. A study including 1,103 patients has now shown that laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer can result in similar safety, resection margins and completeness of resection with improved recovery compared with laparotomy.

### Radical surgery versus organ preservation via short-course radiotherapy followed by transanal endoscopic microsurgery for early-stage rectal cancer (TREC): a randomised, open-label feasibility study [^115MVmpW]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Short-course radiotherapy and transanal endoscopic microsurgery, after an interval of 8–10 weeks, led to 30% of randomised patients and 41% of non-randomised patients achieving a complete response, which is similar to studies of chemoradiotherapy where 40–45% of patients achieved a complete response. A 10-week interval from short-course radiotherapy to transanal endoscopic microsurgery was chosen to balance the potential benefits of waiting longer for optimal tumour regression with the risk of disease progression through treatment delay in a small proportion of patients who might be resistant to radiotherapy. At the inception of the TREC study the benefits of a good histopathological tumour response were appreciated, and the available evidence suggested that short-course radiotherapy produced downstaging after an interval to surgery of 10 days or more; however, the optimal timing for assessment of radiotherapy response was unknown. TREC used transanal endoscopic microsurgery routinely, as did other contemporary studies following reports of extremely poor correlation between clinical and histopathological staging in the context of a relatively short interval between radiotherapy and radical surgery. Emerging data on the oncological safety of non-operative approaches to rectal cancer treatment, combined with the high complete response rates observed in this study and others, suggest that the adoption of a watch-and-wait strategy with selective use of transanal endoscopic microsurgery is feasible with the aim of further reducing treatment-related toxicity and improving HRQOL. However, the small sample size of TREC and the low number of events preclude meaningful analysis of oncological outcomes. We found no significant difference in either overall survival or disease-free survival between patients randomly assigned to organ preservation versus those randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision, in line with the GRECCAR 2 study, with very wide confidence intervals for the hazard ratios, reflecting the small sample size and relatively small number of events. A consistent proportion of patients relapse with distant metastasis regardless of primary therapy. Isolated and technically salvageable local recurrence was detected in two (7%) of 27 patients randomly assigned to organ preservation, each associated with strong histological indicators for early conversion to total mesorectal excision (ypT3R0 and ypT2R1), but the patients had declined early conversion to total mesorectal excision and opted for close observation. Local recurrence might have been avoided with early conversion. These data emphasise the need for a phase 3 trial to more precisely define the risks and benefits associated with adopting an organ preservation approach.

### Transanal total mesorectal excision: pathological results of 186 patients with mid and low rectal cancer [^1143dW9o]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) seems to be a valid alternative to the open or laparoscopic TME. Quality of the TME specimen is the most important prognostic factor in rectal cancer. This study shows the pathological results of the largest single-institution series published on TaTME in patients with mid and low rectal cancer.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all consecutive patients with rectal cancer, treated by TaTME between November 2011 and June 2016. Patient data were prospectively included in a standardized database. Patients with all TNM stages of mid (5–10 cm from the anal verge) and low (0–5 cm from the anal verge) rectal cancer were included.

Results

A total of 186 patients were included. Tumor was in the mid and low rectum in, respectively, 62.9 and 37.1%. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was given in 62.4%, only radiotherapy in 3.2%, and only chemotherapy in 2.2%. Preoperative staging showed T1 in 3.2%, T2 in 20.4%, T3 in 67.7%, and T4 in 7.5%. Mesorectal resection quality was complete in 95.7% (n = 178), almost complete in 1.6% (n = 3), and incomplete in 1.1% (n = 2). Overall positive CRM (≤ 1 mm) and DRM (≤ 1 mm) were 8.1% (n = 15) and 3.2% (n = 6), respectively. The composite of complete mesorectal excision, negative CRM, and negative DRM was achieved in 88.1% (n = 155) of the patients. The median number of lymph nodes found per specimen was 14.0 (IQR 11–18).

Conclusions

The present study showed good rates regarding total mesorectal excision, negative circumferential, and distal resection margins. As the specimen quality is a surrogate marker for survival, TaTME can be regarded as a safe method to treat patients with rectal cancer, from an oncological point of view.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: rectal cancer, version 3.2024 [^114pqHn5]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Rectal cancer — laparoscopic versus open resection outcomes and minimally invasive surgery guidance are as follows: Recurrence rates were similar between laparoscopic and open resection (4.6% vs. 4.5% for locoregional recurrences and 14.6% vs. 16.7% for distant recurrences), and in ALaCaRT successful resections were achieved in 82% of the laparoscopic resection arm and 89% of the open resection arm, for a difference of -7.0% (95% CI, -12.4% to infinity); a negative circumferential resection margin was achieved in 93% and 97% (risk difference, -3.7%; 95% CI, -7.6% to 0.1%; P = 0.06), with two-year outcomes of locoregional recurrence 5.4% and 3.1%, disease-free survival 80% and 82%, and overall survival 94% and 93% for laparoscopic and open resection, respectively. An analysis of results from greater than 18,000 individuals undergoing low anterior resection found short-term oncologic outcomes to be similar between the open and laparoscopic approaches, although other studies have shown the laparoscopic approach to be associated with higher rates of CRM positivity and incomplete TME. The panel defined principles by which minimally invasive resection of rectal cancer can be considered: the procedure can be considered by an experienced surgeon, should include thorough abdominal exploration, and should be limited to lower-risk tumors.

### Local excision after preoperative chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer: results of a multicenter phase II clinical trial [^114wtDiG]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Transanal local excision has been suggested as an attractive approach for patients with rectal cancer who show a major clinical response after preoperative chemoradiotherapy.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of transanal local excision on the local recurrence of rectal cancer in patients who had a major clinical response after preoperative chemoradiotherapy.

Design

Sequential 2-stage phase II study for early efficacy.

Setting

Multicenter study.

Patients

Patients with clinical T3 or low-lying T2 rectal adenocarcinoma that showed a major clinical response after a preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Eligible patients underwent a full-thickness transanal local excision. According to their histopathology, the patients staged as ypT0-1 were observed, while the remaining patients were recommended to undergo a subsequent total mesorectal excision.

Main Outcome Measures

A local recurrence rate of ≤ 5% was set as a successful rate for stopping the trial early after the first stage.

Results

The study group included 63 patients. Before chemoradiotherapy, patients were staged as clinical T3 (n = 42) and T2 (n = 21). After the local excision, 43 patients fulfilled the criteria to be observed with no further treatment. Nine of the remaining 20 patients for whom a subsequent total mesorectal excision was recommended refused surgery. Two of these patients who refused surgery had intraluminal local recurrence; both had a ypT2 tumor and underwent salvage surgery. The estimated cumulative 3-year overall survival, disease-free survival and local disease-free survival were 91.5% (95% CI: 75.9–97.2), 91.0% (95% CI: 77.0–96.6) and 96.9% (95% CI: 80.3–99.5), respectively.

Limitations

The time of follow-up is still short and the sample size is limited.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that local excision is a good option for patients with a major clinical response after chemoradiotherapy. A longer period of follow-up is required to confirm these findings.

### The evolution of rectal cancer treatment: the journey to total neoadjuvant therapy and organ preservation [^116bzAGF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

TME and evolution of surgical approach

Surgery with curative intent for LARC consists of TME, ideally with an R0 resection. This removes the mesorectal tissue that contains all perirectal lymph nodes and should control any local tumor invasion (Fig. 2). The most important predictor of local recurrence is the circumferential margin, which should be greater than 2 mm. Distal margins are more debatable. Typically, if one is unable to achieve a 1-cm distal margin during a low anterior resection (LAR) for a low rectal tumor, an abdominoperineal resection is indicated. However, some data suggest that distal margins < 5 mm are not associated with higher pelvic recurrence rates.

Though TME is the current standard of care for resecting localized rectal cancer, there is growing evidence to support alternative surgical strategies with an organ preservation approach for lower-grade rectal tumors (< T2, N0), to avoid the morbidity associated with TME. The TREC trial (Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery [TEM] and Radiotherapy in Early rectal Cancer) showed that short-course CRT followed by TEM was able to achieve high rates of organ preservation, excellent compliance, and beneficial health-related quality of life (QoL) scores when compared to TME alone. They also showed less treatment-related toxicity and no difference in disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 years. Additional prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to further investigate long-term oncologic outcomes.

### Laparoscopic versus robot-assisted versus transanal low anterior resection: 3-year oncologic results for a population-based cohort in experienced centers [^115bF5eT]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and transanal total mesorectal excision are the minimally invasive techniques used most for rectal cancer surgery. Because data regarding oncologic results are lacking, this study aimed to compare these three techniques while taking the learning curve into account.

Methods

This retrospective population-based study cohort included all patients between 2015 and 2017 who underwent a low anterior resection at 11 dedicated centers that had completed the learning curve of the specific technique. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) during a 3-year follow-up period. The secondary outcomes were 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and 3-year local recurrence rate. Statistical analysis was performed using Cox-regression.

Results

The 617 patients enrolled in the study included 252 who underwent a laparoscopic resection, 205 who underwent a robot-assisted resection, and 160 who underwent a transanal low anterior resection. The oncologic outcomes were equal between the three techniques. The 3-year OS rate was 90% for laparoscopic resection, 90.4% for robot-assisted resection, and 87.6% for transanal low anterior resection. The 3-year DFS rate was 77.8% for laparoscopic resection, 75.8% for robot-assisted resection, and 78.8% for transanal low anterior resection. The 3-year local recurrence rate was in 6.1% for laparoscopic resection, 6.4% for robot-assisted resection, and 5.7% for transanal procedures. Cox-regression did not show a significant difference between the techniques while taking confounders into account.

Conclusion

The oncologic results during the 3-year follow-up were good and comparable between laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and transanal total mesorectal technique at experienced centers. These techniques can be performed safely in experienced hands.

### Laparoscopy-assisted versus open surgery for low rectal cancer (LASRE): 3-year survival outcomes of a multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^116UiCfX]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

The study LASRE was published by Weizhong Jiang and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol. This study is related to the following diseases: Rectal cancer. In the LASRE study, the trial question was: is laparoscopic surgery noninferior to open surgery in patients with low rectal cancer? In the LASRE study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the LASRE study, the population was: 1039 patients (419 female, 620 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18–75 years with rectal adenocarcinoma within 5 cm from the dentate line. The key exclusion criteria were diagnosis of invasive cancer within 5 years; locally advanced cancer requiring en bloc multivisceral resection; intestinal obstruction; intestinal perforation; history of colorectal surgery; mental disorder; pregnancy/lactation. In the LASRE study, the interventions were: n = 685 laparoscopic surgery (laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection) n = 354 open surgery (conventional open rectal resection). In the LASRE study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in disease-free survival at 3 years (81.4% vs. 79.8%; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.23). In the LASRE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in overall survival at 3 years (91.7% vs. 93.7%; HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.19) No significant difference in locoregional recurrence at 3 years (3.7% vs. 2.3%; HR 1.64, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.63) No significant difference in overall survival at 5 years (84.6% vs. 86.6%; HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.64). In the LASRE study, the conclusion was: in patients aged 18–75 years with rectal adenocarcinoma within 5 cm from the dentate line, laparoscopic surgery was noninferior to open surgery with respect to a disease-free survival at 3 years.

### Long-term outcomes of local excision following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer [^117VZfns]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Local excision might represent an alternative to total mesorectal excision for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who achieve a major or complete clinical response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

Methods

Between August 2005 and July 2011, 63 patients with mid-low rectal adenocarcinoma who had a major/complete clinical response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were enrolled in a multicenter prospective phase 2 trial and underwent transanal full thickness local excision. The main endpoint of this study was to evaluate the 5- and 10-year overall, relapse-free, local, and distant relapse-free survival, which were calculated by applying the Kaplan–Meier method. The rate of patients with rectum preserved and without stoma were also calculated.

Results

Of 63 patients, 38 (60%) were male and 25 (40%) were female, with a median (range) age of 64 (25–82) years. At baseline, the following clinical stages were found: cT2, n = 21 (33.3%); cT3, n = 42 (66.6%), 39 (61.9%) patients were cN+. At a median (range) follow-up of 108 (32–166) months, the estimated cumulative 5- and 10-year overall survival, relapse-free survival, local recurrence-free survival, and distant recurrence-free survival were 87% (95% CI 76–93) and 79% (95% CI 66–87), 89% (95% CI 78–94) and 82% (95% CI 66–91), both 91% (95% CI 81–96), and 90% (95% CI 80–95) and 86% (95% CI 73–93), respectively. Overall, 49 (77.8%) patients had their rectum preserved, and 54 (84.1%) were stoma-free.

Conclusion

In highly selected patients, the local excision approach after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is associated with excellent long-term outcomes, high rates of rectum preservation and absence of permanent stoma.

### Multidisciplinary management of elderly patients with rectal cancer: recommendations from the SICG (Italian society of geriatric surgery), SIFIPAC (Italian Society of Surgical Pathophysiology), SICE (Italian society of endoscopic surgery and new technologies), and the WSES (World Society of Emergency Surgery) international consensus project [^112fmWeH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Manceau et al. evaluated 446 consecutive rectal cancer patients grouping them into 10-year intervals from under 45 to older than 64 years. Elderly patients presented significantly higher ASA score, higher Charlson comorbidity index, and more frequent cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological comorbidities. Despite these baseline differences, there was no difference in postoperative complications and age was not a significant independent risk factor for postoperative morbidity. Octogenarians rectal cancer patients were matched to controls between the ages of 60–69 in the study by Otsuka et al. They similarly found that the ASA score was significantly higher in the octogenarian group, but this did not correlate with increased postoperative complications and long-term rectal cancer-specific survival.

In the AlaCaRT trial, the primary end point was a composite of oncological factors (complete total mesorectal excision, a clear circumferential resection margin ≥ 1mm, a clear distal resection margin ≥ 1mm) indicating an adequate surgical resection, with a noninferiority boundary of Δ = − 8%. The primary outcome was achieved in 194 patients (82%) in the laparoscopic surgery group and 208 patients (89%) in the open surgery group, the circumferential resection margin was clear in 222 patients (93%) in the laparoscopic surgery group and in 228 patients (97%) in the open surgery group, the distal margin was clear in 236 patients (99%) in the laparoscopic surgery group and in 234 patients (99%) in the open surgery group, and total mesorectal excision was complete in 206 patients (87%) in the laparoscopic surgery group and 216 patients (92%) in the open surgery group. The study concluded that, among patients with T1–T3 rectal tumors, noninferiority of laparoscopic surgery compared with open surgery for successful resection was not established. Similarly, in the ACOSOG Z6051 trial, the primary outcome of efficacy was a composite of circumferential radial margin ≥ 1 mm, distal margin without tumor, and completeness of total mesorectal excision. A 6% noninferiority margin was chosen according to clinical relevance estimation. Two hundred forty patients with laparoscopic resection and 222 with open resection were evaluable for analysis of the 486 enrolled. The primary outcome occurred in 81.7% of laparoscopic resection cases and 86.9% of open resection cases and did not support noninferiority. However, subsequent analyses of the ACOSOG Z6051 trial found that laparoscopic-assisted resection of rectal cancer was not found to be significantly different to open resection of rectal cancer based on the outcomes of disease-free survival and recurrence. The 2-year disease-free survival was 79.5% in the laparoscopic group and 83.2% in the open group. Local and regional recurrence was 4.6% in the laparoscopic group and 4.5% in the open group. Distant recurrence was 14.6% in the laparoscopic group and 16.7% in the open group.

### 2D versus 3D laparoscopic total mesorectal excision: a developmental multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113eD5ob]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

The role of minimal access surgery (MAS) in total mesorectal excision (TME) is hotly contested. Oncological outcomes are closely linked to the technical performance of surgery, specifically through the quality of the TME specimen. Medium-term follow-up of multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that laparoscopic rectal surgery can be performed without oncological compromise; however, two recent large RCTs showed that although the majority of laparoscopic cases had acceptable specimens, laparoscopic non-inferiority could not be shown. This topic is highly pertinent as because of perceived short-term patient benefits 68% of UK rectal cancer patients presently receive a laparoscopic operation.

The MAS revolution is facilitated by continuous technological development. Advances in laparoscopic platforms include commercially available three-dimensional (3D) HD systems. Initial adoption was hampered by poor image resolution and bulky headgear associated with unacceptable user side effects. Modern refinement of 3D technology has revived surgical interest as contemporary systems have overcome these issues without increasing cognitive load.

The potential advantages of 3D imaging systems on the performance or outcomes following advanced laparoscopic procedures have not been proved as the available literature predominantly focusses on trainee performance of ex-vivo box trainer tasks with significant methodological concerns raised. Therefore, we designed a development trial with the dual aims of comparing specialist surgical performance of laparoscopic TME surgery using 2D and 3D imaging and to generate evidence to identify and power the appropriate primary endpoint for use in a future definitive TME study.

### Long-term oncologic outcomes of transanal TME compared with transabdominal TME for rectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1156LoEw]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Total mesorectal excision (TME) has been considered the standard surgical procedure for patients with rectal cancer since it was first described in 1982 by Heald. This procedure was initially performed with an open abdominal approach, and laparoscopic TME has been recently suggested as an alternative to open TME. However, the surgical technique is complex and requires extensive experience to safely perform for high-quality surgical resection and good oncologic outcomes, particularly in patients with lower rectal cancer. With recent advances in minimally invasive surgery, a transanal and laparoscopic combined approach was introduced as transanal TME (TaTME), and this was proposed as a possibility for overcoming the technical difficulties of transabdominal TME. Although a majority of rectal cancers can be safely operated on with the transabdominal approach, difficult anatomical conditions, unfavorable tumor characteristics, or a combination of these factors can lead to difficulties. Narrow pelvis, fatty mesorectum, male sex, high BMI, and anterior-located large tumor are risk factors for noncurative resection. The transanal approach may provide better access and visualization of the distal part of the rectum.

Many studies, including a meta-analysis, have reported favorable results in terms of perioperative, pathological, and functional outcomes in patients receiving TaTME for rectal cancer. The above-mentioned risk factors, in combination with the difficulty of perpendicular division of the rectum, seem to be related to circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement, incompleteness of TME, and anastomotic leakage, which are considered to have negative oncologic impacts. However, despite favorable results for CRM involvement, incompleteness of TME, and anastomotic leakage in TaTME, there is still a lack of evidence on long-term oncologic outcomes to support its widespread introduction. Therefore, our aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate survival outcomes such as 2-year or 3-year survivals, or if possible 5-year survivals, and recurrence rates of TaTME in comparison with transabdominal TME in patients with rectal cancer. Evaluated outcomes were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and local and distant recurrence.

### Oncologic outcomes after transanal total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer [^113TR7Xn]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

Oncologic Outcomes

There were no local recurrences identified after a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 7–60). Further oncologic outcomes are summarized in Table 4. Fifty-eight (73.2%) patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Distant recurrence was identified in 10 (13.5%) patients, all underwent adjuvant therapy, and 2 underwent interventional procedures, such as metastectomy or radiofrequency ablation. There were no intraperitoneal recurrences. Median time to distant metastases was 14 months (range, 0.6–53). Sixty-two patients (78.5%) were alive with no evidence of disease. For this interim analysis, total cohort survival rate was 85.7% with a total of 10 deaths. Four mortalities (5.1%) were due to progression of disease.

### Postoperative morbidity and mortality after mesorectal excision with and without lateral lymph node dissection for clinical stage II or stage III lower rectal cancer (JCOG0212): results from a multicentre, randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial [^1116QTH6]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Background

Mesorectal excision is the international standard surgical procedure for lower rectal cancer. However, lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis occasionally occurs in patients with clinical stage II or stage III rectal cancer, and therefore mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection is the standard procedure in Japan. We did a randomised controlled trial to confirm that the results of mesorectal excision alone are not inferior to those of mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection.

Methods

This study was undertaken at 33 major hospitals in Japan. Eligibility criteria included histologically proven rectal cancer of clinical stage II or stage III, with the main lesion located in the rectum with the lower margin below the peritoneal reflection, and no lateral pelvic lymph node enlargement. After surgeons had confirmed macroscopic R0 resection by mesorectal excision, patients were intraoperatively randomised to mesorectal excision alone or with lateral lymph node dissection. The groups were balanced by a minimisation method according to clinical N staging (N0 or N1, 2), sex, and institution. Allocated procedure was not masked to investigators or patients. This study is now in the follow-up stage. The primary endpoint is relapse-free survival and will be reported after the primary analysis planned for 2015. Here, we compare operation time, blood loss, postoperative morbidity (grade 3 or 4), and hospital mortality between the two groups. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00190541.

Findings

351 patients were randomly assigned to mesoretcal excision with lateral lymph node dissection and 350 to mesorectal excision alone, between June 11, 2003, and Aug 6, 2010. One patient in the mesorectal excision alone group underwent lateral lymph node dissection, but was analysed in their assigned group. Operation time was significantly longer in the mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection group (median 360 min, IQR 296–429) than in the mesorectal excision alone group (254 min, 210–307, p < 0.0001). Blood loss was significantly higher in the mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection group (576 mL, IQR 352–900) than in the mesorectal excision alone group (337 mL, 170–566; p < 0.0001). 26 (7%) patients in the mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection group had lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis. Grade 3–4 postoperative complications occurred in 76 (22%) patients in the mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection group and 56 (16%) patients in the mesorectal excision alone group. The most common grade 3 or 4 postoperative complication was anastomotic leakage (18 [6%] patients in the mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection group vs 13 [5%] in the mesorectal excision alone group; p = 0.46). One patient in the mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection group died of anastomotic leakage followed by sepsis.

Interpretation

Mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection required a significantly longer operation time and resulted in significantly greater blood loss than mesorectal excision alone. The primary analysis will help to show whether or not mesorectal excision alone is non-inferior to mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection.

### Laparoscopic total mesorectal excision with coloanal anastomosis for rectal cancer [^114Szvf2]. Annals of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Oncologic and functional outcomes were compared between transanal and transabdominal specimen extraction after laparoscopic coloanal anastomosis for rectal cancer.

Background

Laparoscopic coloanal anastomosis is an attractive new surgical option in patients with low rectal cancer because laparotomy is not necessary due to transanal specimen extraction. Risks of tumor spillage and fecal incontinence induced by transanal extraction are not known.

Methods

Between 2000 and 2010, 220 patients with low rectal cancer underwent laparoscopic rectal excision with hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis. The rectal specimen was extracted transanally in 122 patients and transabdominally in 98 patients. End points were circumferential resection margin, mesorectal grade, local recurrence, survival, and functional outcome.

Results

The mortality rate was 0.5% and surgical morbidity rate was 17%. The rate of positive circumferential resection margin was 9% and the mesorectum was graded complete in 79%, subcomplete in 12%, and incomplete in 9%. After a follow-up of 51 months (range, 1–151), the local recurrence rate was 4% and overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 83% and 70% at 5 years, respectively. The continence score was 6 (range, 0–20). There was no difference of mortality rate, morbidity rate, circumferential resection margin, mesorectal grade, local recurrence (4% vs 5%, P = 0.98), and disease-free survival rate (72% vs 68%, P = 0.63) between transanal and transabdominal extraction groups. Continence score was also similar (6 vs 6, P = 0.92).

Conclusions

Transanal extraction of the rectal specimen did not compromise oncologic and functional outcome after laparoscopic surgery for low rectal cancer and seems as a safe option to preserve the abdominal wall.

Follow‐up schedules

Patients who select organ preservation commit to regular endoscopic and MRI examination of the rectum, quarterly in the first year and at least 6 monthly thereafter to 3 years. Full surveillance details for both organ preservation and TME surgery are provided in Table 4.

Surveillance schedule for STAR‐TREC phase III

Sample size

In a comparison of two active treatments, the goal of the analysis is to identify whether either is superior. As the difference between two active treatments may be relatively small, conventional statistical significance (P < 0.05) is not an appropriate criterion because important differences may not be statistically significant [. Using only significant differences to establish the superiority of an intervention also increases the risk of substantially exaggerating the treatment effect as significance will only occur where, by chance, the estimated treatment effect is large. Instead, we will use Bayesian methods to estimate the probability that each treatment is superior, as well as providing estimates of the treatment effect and its uncertainty. There is no fixed threshold for regarding a treatment as sufficiently likely to be superior that it should be adopted in preference to the alternative, because this is a clinical judgement that will depend on other effects of the intervention and patient characteristics. We have set the timescale for recruitment to the phase III study at 4 years, which is acceptable to the clinical community, and the organ preservation sample size achievable within this is expected to be 380 (including 80 patients randomized to organ‐preserving treatments from phase II). The expected incidence of the primary outcome is approximately 60%, and we predict that a 10% difference between treatment arms will be regarded as clinically important, while smaller differences are unlikely to promote therapy change due to the presence of established geo‐regional practices relating to the use of CRT versus SCRT. A sample size of 380 allowing for an 8% dropout yields 350 evaluable cases, which our simulations have shown would have a probability of around 80%, or higher, of correctly identifying the superior treatment, irrespective of whichever is better, if the true difference is 10%. If the organ preservation rate turns out to be higher than anticipated (70% or 80%), the probability of detecting a 10% improvement remains over 85%. In all cases, the probability of identifying the wrong treatment as superior is very low (less than 1%). It is estimated that an additional 120 TME cases will be recruited to the partially randomized TME reference group, comprising 40 cases randomized to TME in phase II and a further 80 non‐randomized cases recruited in phase III.

During the follow-up period, a total of 57 patients (9.4%) developed SR, 47 of whom did not have stage IV disease (Table 2); the probability of being SR free at 36 months in this subset was 92% (95% CI, 89%-94%) (Figure 1). The probability was reduced among patients with a positive CRM (78%; 95% CI, 65%-95%) compared with those with a negative CRM (91%; 95% CI, 88%-95%) (Figure 2), similar to the reduction observed among patients with a positive DRM (59%; 95% CI, 33%-100%) compared with patients with a negative DRM (91%; 95% CI, 88%-94%) (Figure 2). The probability of being SR free at 36 months was also lower among patients with disease stage II (93%; 95% CI, 89%-98%) or III (88%; 95% CI, 83%-93%) than among patients with stage I disease (95%; 95% CI, 90%-99%) (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). After removing the 35 patients with initial stage IV disease from the data analysis, the rate of SR was significantly higher among patients with stage III disease than among those with stage I disease (HR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.31–4.03), among patients with a positive CRM than among those with a negative CRM (HR, 4.00; 95% CI, 2.22–7.19), and among patients who received neoadjuvant therapy than among those who did not receive therapy (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.27–3.13). In a multivariable model including disease stage, neoadjuvant therapy, CRM, and DRM, only a positive CRM remained significantly associated with SR (adjusted HR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.26–6.91).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: rectal cancer, version 3.2024 [^113kq57T]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Rectal cancer — local excision after neoadjuvant therapy — Completion total mesorectal excision (TME) after neoadjuvant chemoRT and local excision has been associated with higher major complications and worse function versus TME alone, and the GRECCAR-2 trial observed increased major morbidity/side effects when TME followed local excision; subsequent resections after chemoRT plus local excision have reported concerning outcomes including only a 60% 2-year local recurrence-free rate. Selecting local excision therefore requires well-informed and careful patient selection and could be a viable option for patients with a strong but incomplete response who are unable or unwilling to undergo standard TME surgery and who meet near complete response criteria. Local excision is not routinely recommended for patients who have achieved a clear cCR following neoadjuvant therapy.

### Comparison of laparoscopic versus robot-assisted surgery for rectal cancers: the COLRAR randomized controlled trial [^114uhcCw]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether robotic for middle or low rectal cancer produces an improvement in surgical outcomes compared with laparoscopic surgery in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).

Background

There is a lack of proven clinical benefit of robotic total mesorectal excision (TME) compared with a laparoscopic approach in the setting of multicenter RCTs.

Methods

Between July 2011 and February 2016, patients diagnosed with an adenocarcinoma located < 10 cm from the anal verge and clinically rated T1-4aNxM0 were enrolled. The primary outcome was the completeness of TME assessed by a surgeon and a pathologist.

Results

The RCT was terminated prematurely because of poor accrual of data. In all, 295 patients were assigned randomly to a robot-assisted TME group (151 in R-TME) or a laparoscopy-assisted TME group (144 in L-TME). The rates of complete TME were not different between groups (80.7% in R-TME, 77.1% in L-TME). Pathologic outcomes including the circumferential resection margin and the numbers of retrieved lymph nodes were not different between groups. In a subanalysis, the positive circumferential resection margin rate was lower in the R-TME group (0% vs 6.1% for L-TME; P = 0.031). Among the recovery parameters, the length of opioid use was shorter in the R-TME group (P = 0.028). There was no difference in the postoperative complication rate between the groups (12.0% for R-TME vs 8.3% for L-TME).

Conclusions

In patients with middle or low rectal cancer, robotic-assisted surgery did not significantly improve the TME quality compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery (ClinicalTrial.gov ID: NCT01042743).

### Laparoscopic sphincter-preserving total mesorectal excision: 10-year report [^113MYiaE]. Colorectal Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

Total mesorectal excision (TME) is currently the gold standard for resection of mid or low rectal cancer and is associated with a low local recurrence rate. However, few studies have reported the long-term oncological outcome following use of a laparoscopic approach. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term oncological outcome after laparoscopic sphincter-preserving TME with a median follow up of about 4 years.

Method

Patients with mid or low rectal cancer who underwent laparoscopic sphincter-preserving TME with curative intent between March 1999 and March 2009 were prospectively recruited for analysis.

Results

During the 10-year study period, 177 patients underwent laparoscopic sphincter-preserving TME with curative intent for rectal cancer. Conversion was required in two (1%) patients. There was no operative mortality. At a median follow-up period of 49 months, local recurrence had occurred in nine (5.1%) patients. The overall metastatic recurrence rate after curative resection was 22%. The overall 5-year survival and 5-year disease-free survival in the present study were 74% and 71%, respectively.

Conclusion

The results of this study show that laparoscopic sphincter-preserving TME is safe with long-term oncological outcomes comparable to those of open surgery.

### Open versus laparoscopic surgery for advanced low rectal cancer: a large, multicenter, propensity score matched cohort study in Japan [^111vrD8t]. Annals of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Rectal cancer is a major cause of death worldwide, and the number of patients has significantly increased. The treatment strategy for rectal cancer, especially low rectal cancer, has changed dramatically in the last century. First described around 1900, abdominoperineal resection subsequently became the standard surgical treatment for rectal cancer, but the attendant risk of operative mortality was very high. Preservation of the anal sphincter is a long-running theme that still exists today. Anterior resection and the pull-through technique were developed, and progress has been made in these procedures. In the 1980s, total mesorectal excision was advocated, and laparoscopic surgery was introduced. In Japan, conducting an ideal randomized controlled study for rectal cancer patients is quite difficult because several treatment options exist, such as the open approach, the laparoscopic approach, lateral lymph node dissection, and preoperative chemoradiotherapy determined by the surgeon's preference and/or institutional policy. In 2009, a total of 1057 cases of laparoscopic rectal surgery were reported by Miyajima et al. They concluded that laparoscopic surgery is feasible and safe in selected patients with rectal cancer, with favorable short-term and mid-term outcomes. Laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer was reported to be more difficult than that for colon cancer, so rectal cancer had been eliminated from clinical trials in the early 2000s. – Several large-scale clinical trials proved the usefulness of laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer compared with open surgery with regard to short-term outcomes, and long-term noninferiority has also been demonstrated. However, only a few clinical trials demonstrated the benefit of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer compared with open surgery, whereas other clinical trials did not show the noninferiority of laparoscopic surgery. To the best of our knowledge, there is no large-scale study on low rectal cancer only.

Therefore, we planned this large retrospective cohort study of laparoscopic and open surgery for locally advanced "low" rectal cancer. Patient data from 69 institutes were collected and analyzed. Propensity score matching was used for protocol analysis.

### Oncological outcomes of laparoscopic versus open rectal cancer resections: meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111er45w]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery has been questioned owing to conflicting reports on pathological outcomes from recent RCTs. However, it is unclear whether these pathological markers and the surgical approach have an impact on oncological outcomes. This study assessed oncological outcomes of laparoscopic and open rectal cancer resections.

Methods

A meta-analysis of RCTs was performed. Primary endpoints included oncological outcomes (disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), local recurrence). Secondary endpoints included surrogate markers for the quality of surgical resection.

Results

Twelve RCTs including 3744 patients (2133 laparoscopic, 1611 open) were included. There was no significant difference in OS (hazard ratio (HR) 0.87, 95 per cent c.i. 0.73 to 1.04; P = 0.12; I2 = 0 per cent) and DFS (HR 0.95, 0.81 to 1.11; P = 0.52; I2 = 0 per cent) between laparoscopic and open rectal resections. There was no significant difference in locoregional (odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95 per cent c.i. 0.72 to 1.48; P = 0.86; I2 = 0 per cent) or distant (OR 0.87, 0.70 to 1.08; P = 0.20; I2 = 7 per cent) recurrence between the groups. Achieving a successful composite score (intact mesorectal excision, clear circumferential resection margin and distal margin) was significantly associated with improved DFS (OR 0.55, 0.33 to 0.74; P < 0.001; I2 = 0 per cent). An intact or acceptable mesorectal excision (intact mesorectal excision with or without superficial defects) had no impact on DFS. Finally, a positive CRM was associated with worse DFS.

Conclusion

Well performed surgery (laparoscopic or open) achieves excellent oncological outcomes with very little difference between the two modalities. The advantage and benefit of minimally invasive surgery should be assessed on an individual basis.
