## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diene precursor will cyclize to 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, and to choose the correct option among A, B, C, and D. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the target cyclohexene structure and map its substituents to a 6-membered ring. Then, I should verify the ring-closing metathesis mechanism and determine where the new double bond will form. Next, I will count carbons and locate the two terminal alkenes that must be present in the acyclic diene. After that, I will name each candidate diene and check which one matches the required connectivity. Finally, I will double-check for any numbering or naming traps that could mislead the choice and confirm the answer with a brief mechanistic rationale.

> Let me first confirm the target structure and its numbering. 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene is a cyclohexene with a double bond between C1 and C2, methyl groups at C3 and C4, and an isopropyl group at C5; this means the double bond is adjacent to C6 and C1, and the substituents are on the opposite side of the ring from the double bond, which is exactly the pattern we need to reproduce in the acyclic precursor.

> Now, I need to think about the RCM mechanism. Ring-closing metathesis forms a new double bond by linking the two terminal alkenes of a diene and extruding ethene; in this case, the new double bond will be at the positions where the two terminal carbons of the diene meet, so I should look for a diene that places those terminal carbons where C1 and C6 of the cyclohexene will be, with the correct substituents in between.

> Wait, let me verify the carbon count and chain length. A cyclohexene has 6 carbons, so the acyclic precursor should have 6 carbons in the main chain that will become the ring, plus the two terminal carbons that are lost as ethene; that means the diene should be an octa-diene with 8 total carbons, and the ring will form from carbons 2 through 7 of the diene, leaving the terminal carbons 1 and 8 to form the new double bond; this matches the expected octa-diene framework in the options.

> I will now examine each option and map it to the target. Option A is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene; this means terminal alkenes at C1 and C7, isopropyl at C5, and methyls at C3 and C4; when RCM links C1 and C7, the new double bond sits between the former C1 and C7, which correspond to C1 and C6 of the cyclohexene, and the substituents at C3, C4, and C5 map directly to C3, C4, and C5 of the cyclohexene, which fits the target perfectly.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check the other options to ensure none also fit. Option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene, which has internal double bonds; RCM requires terminal alkenes, so this cannot cyclize to the desired product, and I should eliminate it. Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene; here one alkene is terminal at C1, but the other is internal at C6, so again RCM cannot close the ring as required, and I should eliminate it. Option D is 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene; the substituents are shifted by one carbon relative to the target, so the isopropyl and methyls would not land at the correct ring positions after cyclization, making this incorrect as well.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if option C might still work because the chain length is right; but I should confirm that both alkenes must be terminal for a straightforward RCM to a cyclohexene, and indeed only option A satisfies that constraint while placing the substituents correctly, so my earlier hesitation was misplaced and option A remains the only viable choice.

> Let me reconsider the numbering to ensure consistency. In the target, the double bond is between C1 and C2, methyls are at C3 and C4, and isopropyl is at C5; in the precursor A, the terminal carbons that become C1 and C6 of the ring are C1 and C7 of the diene, with methyls at C3 and C4 and isopropyl at C5, so after cyclization the substituents align exactly with the target numbering, confirming the match.

> Final answer: A. 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene is the correct starting material for RCM to 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, because it is the only option with two terminal alkenes and the substituents positioned to yield the desired cyclohexene upon ring closure [^80f56d45] [^0115f5e4].

The correct starting material for synthesizing 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene** (Option A). This diene has terminal alkenes at positions 1 and 7, which are required for RCM to form a cyclohexene ring with the isopropyl and methyl substituents correctly positioned [^80f56d45]. Options B and C have internal alkenes that cannot undergo RCM, and Option D has the isopropyl group at position 4, which would place it incorrectly on the ring.

## Analysis of the target molecule

The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a cyclohexene with a double bond between C1 and C2, methyl groups at C3 and C4, and an isopropyl group at C5. The numbering follows IUPAC rules, with the double bond between C1 and C2 and substituents numbered to give the lowest possible locants.

---

## Requirements for ring-closing metathesis

RCM requires a diene with **two terminal alkenes** that react to form a cyclic alkene and ethylene. The distance between the terminal alkenes determines the ring size: a 1,7-diene yields a six-membered ring, a 1,6-diene a five-membered ring, and so on. Substituents must be positioned so that they end up at the correct locations on the ring after cyclization.

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Option** | **Structure** | **Analysis** |
|-|-|-|
| A | 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene | Terminal alkenes at C1 and C7; isopropyl at C5, methyls at C3 and C4. RCM forms a cyclohexene with the isopropyl at C5 and methyls at C3 and C4, matching the target. |
| B | 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene | Internal alkenes at C2 and C6; RCM cannot occur because both alkenes are internal. |
| C | 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene | Terminal alkene at C1, internal at C6; RCM cannot occur because one alkene is internal. |
| D | 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene | Terminal alkenes at C1 and C7, but isopropyl at C4; RCM would place the isopropyl at C4, not C5, so the product would be 4-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, not the target. |

---

## Conclusion

The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene** (Option A), as it is the only diene with two terminal alkenes and the substituents positioned to yield 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene upon RCM [^80f56d45].

### Kinetically E-selective macrocyclic ring-closing metathesis [^80f56d45]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

Macrocyclic compounds are central to the development of new drugs, but preparing them can be challenging because of the energy barrier that must be surmounted in order to bring together and fuse the two ends of an acyclic precursor such as an alkene (also known as an olefin). To this end, the catalytic process known as ring-closing metathesis (RCM) has allowed access to countless biologically active macrocyclic organic molecules, even for large-scale production. Stereoselectivity is often critical in such cases: the potency of a macrocyclic compound can depend on the stereochemistry of its alkene; alternatively, one isomer of the compound can be subjected to stereoselective modification (such as dihydroxylation). Kinetically controlled Z-selective RCM reactions have been reported, but the only available metathesis approach for accessing macrocyclic E-olefins entails selective removal of the Z-component of a stereoisomeric mixture by ethenolysis, sacrificing substantial quantities of material if E/Z ratios are near unity. Use of ethylene can also cause adventitious olefin isomerization-a particularly serious problem when the E-alkene is energetically less favoured. Here, we show that dienes containing an E-alkenyl-B(pinacolato) group, widely used in catalytic cross-coupling, possess the requisite electronic and steric attributes to allow them to be converted stereoselectively to E-macrocyclic alkenes. The reaction is promoted by a molybdenum monoaryloxide pyrrolide complex and affords products at a yield of up to 73 per cent and an E/Z ratio greater than 98/2. We highlight the utility of the approach by preparing recifeiolide (a 12-membered-ring antibiotic) and pacritinib (an 18-membered-ring enzyme inhibitor), the Z-isomer of which is less potent than the E-isomer. Notably, the 18-membered-ring moiety of pacritinib-a potent anti-cancer agent that is in advanced clinical trials for treating lymphoma and myelofibrosis-was prepared by RCM carried out at a substrate concentration 20 times greater than when a ruthenium carbene was used.

### Synthesis of macrocyclic natural products by catalyst-controlled stereoselective ring-closing metathesis [^0115f5e4]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

Many natural products contain a C = C double bond through which various other derivatives can be prepared; the stereochemical identity of the alkene can be critical to the biological activities of such molecules. Catalytic ring-closing metathesis (RCM) is a widely used method for the synthesis of large unsaturated rings; however, cyclizations often proceed without control of alkene stereochemistry. This shortcoming is particularly costly when the cyclization reaction is performed after a long sequence of other chemical transformations. Here we outline a reliable, practical and general approach for the efficient and highly stereoselective synthesis of macrocyclic alkenes by catalytic RCM; transformations deliver up to 97% of the Z isomer owing to control induced by a tungsten-based alkylidene. Utility is demonstrated through the stereoselective preparation of epothilone C (refs 3-5) and nakadomarin A (ref. 6), the previously reported syntheses of which have been marred by late-stage, non-selective RCM. The tungsten alkylidene can be manipulated in air, delivering the products in useful yields with high stereoselectivity. As a result of efficient RCM and re-incorporation of side products into the catalytic cycle with minimal alkene isomerization, desired cyclizations proceed in preference to alternative pathways, even under relatively high substrate concentration.

General Procedure A. Acetylation of pMLs

To a mixture of pyridine (5 mL) and acetic anhydride (5 mL) was added DMAP (0.5 mg, 0.004 mmol). To a vial containing the macrocyclic alcohol was added the mixture of pyridine/acetic anhydride/DMAP (0.5 mL). After stirring for 1–2 h, the mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure (<1 torr) until dry. The residue was dissolved in EtOAc and run through a short plug of silica gel eluting with further EtOAc (ca. 5–10 mL), and the eluted liquid was blown down to dryness with air and purified via flash column chromatography.

General Procedure B. Ring-closing metathesis

To a warm (60 °C), solution of diene (1 eq.) in dry deoxygenated toluene (ca. 2.5 mM in diene) with N 2 sparging was added a solution of Grubbs II catalyst (0.20 eq.) in a small volume of toluene (ca. 1–5 mL). The reaction mixture was allowed to stir under continuous N 2 until consumption of starting material as monitored by TLC analysis. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and quenched by addition of potassium 2-isocyanoacetate (excess) in methanol (ca. 1–10 mL). After stirring for 1 h at room temperature, the mixture was concentrated to dryness, filtered, and solvent was removed in vacuo. The crude product was purified via flash column chromatography with the appropriate eluent to provide the pure protected macrocyclic cores. Precise reaction conditions can be found for each ring-closing metathesis in the Supplementary information.

Production of hydrocarbons from bio-based resources via (chemo-)enzymatic cascades.

Engineering a chemo-enzymatic cascade that comprises a decarboxylase and a ring-closing metathesis catalyst leads to the production of bio-based cycloalkenes

Herein we report on our efforts to combine ring-closing metathesis with an engineered multi-enzyme cascade to produce cyclopentene, cyclohexene, and cycloheptene from olive oil-derived intermediates (Fig. 1). This development, combining a concurrent RCM with up-to nine enzymatic steps hosted by whole cells of E. coli in a single reaction vessel, showcases the potential of integrating biocompatible, new-to-nature reactions with synthetic biology at high sophistication.

### Chemo-enzymatic cascades to produce cycloalkenes from bio-based resources [^43d8d0ef]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering hold great promise for sustainable chemical production from renewable resources via engineered microbial cell factories operating in single-vessel processes –. Combining enzymes from different organisms substantially expands the scope of bioproduction; however, it remains limited to the existing enzymes’ repertoire. For example, the recent discovery of decarbonylases and decarboxylases has led to bioproduction of various hydrocarbons –, including various linear alkanes,, linear alkenes – and aromatics, (Fig. 1). However, to the best of our knowledge, cycloalkanes and cycloalkenes have not been reported via enzymatic pathways. Cycloalkenes are bulk petrochemicals widely employed in various industrial processes, including use as solvents, synthesis of cyclic compounds (e.g. cyclohexanol)and ring-opened chemicals (e.g. adipic acid). Currently, cycloalkenes are derived from fossil-fuels (e.g. steam cracking of naphtha and partial hydrogenation of benzene). The unavailability of enzymatic production is likely due to the limited number of enzyme-catalyzed C–C cyclization reactions. Indeed, most of these enzymes, (e.g. terpene cyclases) are highly substrate-specific thus limiting their widespread implementation. Recent advances in heme-proteins that catalyze an abiotic carbene transfer offer a powerful means to generate cyclopropane or cyclopropene rings (C3) –. Building on our previous work on ring-closing metathesis (RCM) in a biocompatible environment –, we contemplated the possibility of capitalizing on RCM to construct cycloalkenes (C5-C7) from diolefins produced from renewable sources.

Results

Synthesis and characterization

A bio-based α,ω-difunctional diene 1 was synthesized by combining structurally rigid isomannide and flexible undecenoic acid (Fig. 2a). 1 can undergo acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization to produce a polyester. Despite considerable efforts on this reaction, the stepwise polymerization mechanism posed challenges in achieving the desired molecular weight as a result of limited conversion. This limitation resulted in the achievement of only a modest molecular weight, as evidenced in Supplementary Table S1. We selected the sample with the highest molecular weight (P1, M n = 23.3 kDa, Table 1) for testing. The presence of linear alkyl chains derived from undecenoic acid can lead to the formation of crystalline polymers. As expected, P1 shows the ability to crystallize with a low melting enthalpy (5.0 J/g, Supplementary Fig. S4), indicating a low crystallinity. The mechanical property test demonstrated a characteristic behavior of elastic materials (with a low Young’s modulus of 0.22 ± 0.05 MPa) but exhibited poor mechanical strength (0.03 ± 0.01 MPa, Supplementary Fig. S6) due to its low molecular weight that lack significant entanglement. This polymer could undergo ring-closing metathesis depolymerization to yield a cyclic olefin 2 (trans -isomer dominated, in accordance with their ring strain, Supplementary Fig. S7), the same product as obtained from the diene under ring-closing metathesis conditions (Supplementary Fig. S8). This cyclic olefin 2, as a product for upgrading the recycling of P1, could be used in ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) via the chain growth polymerization mechanism –. Due to the low ring strain of this monomer (~4 kcal mol −1, Supplementary Table S4), the polymerization is favored by high monomer concentration, which progressed smoothly with quantitative conversion (>95%) under mild conditions (at 25 °C within 1 h under 1.0 M condition). The molecular weight can be adjusted with the reaction time or the monomer-to-catalyst feeding ratio (Supplementary Table S2), providing greater control and enabling the production of TPEs with high molecular weights (Table 1, P2 − P9, 40 kDa−800 kDa) with enhanced chain entanglement. The improved molecular mass could allow finding outstanding and unique mechanical properties.

As well as drug molecules, the natural products (E)-γ-bisabolene and (Z)-γ-bisabolene could also be synthesized efficiently with our methodology (Fig. 4c). Chlorodiene 19 (ref.) was treated with LDA to give alkynyl-Li 20, which was reacted with borane 21. Addition of allyl bromide gave alkenyl borane 22, which was treated with MeLi and I 2 to promote a stereoretentive Zweifel olefination (method A), giving the tetrasubstituted alkene (Z)- 24 in 77% yield with 12:1 Z / E selectivity. Alternatively, oxidation of 22 to alkenyl borinic ester 23, followed by our stereoinvertive Zweifel olefination conditions (method B) favoured the E isomers of 24 (12:1, E / Z). Subjecting the two stereoisomers of 24 to ring-closing metathesis using Grubbs-I catalyst gave (E)-γ-bisabolene and (Z)-γ-bisabolene in almost quantitative yield. The stereodivergent synthesis of bisabolene in just three or four steps (longest linear sequence) from the same set of starting materials highlights the versatility, efficiency and generality of our methodology.

### Catalytic enantioselective synthesis of alkylidenecyclopropanes [^99d03001]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

We investigated the effect of substituents attached to the cyclopropene’s bridging methylene carbon. Four ester variations, Et (18a), i -Pr (19a), t -Bu (20a) and Bn (21a) were trialled. In each case deconjugation occurred in excellent yield and, despite the increased bulk at the bridge, enantioselectivity was maintained. Removal of the bridging esters was also possible as demonstrated with substrate 22a. The reaction progressed slowly over 24 h and despite the new gem -dimethyl motif, 22b was obtained in 97% yield and 90% e.e.

We next designed a new substrate featuring a pendant ketone (23a). On exposure to the reaction conditions the prototropic shift proceeded smoothly, and the resulting ACP underwent further transformation to enone 23b. All three stereocentres were formed with excellent control resulting in a single trans configured cyclopropane diastereomer (more than 20:1 d.r) and near-perfect enantiomeric excess (98% e.e.).

### Iron (III)-catalysed carbonyl-olefin metathesis [^415f7f65]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

The olefin metathesis reaction of two unsaturated substrates is one of the most powerful carbon-carbon-bond-forming reactions in organic chemistry. Specifically, the catalytic olefin metathesis reaction has led to profound developments in the synthesis of molecules relevant to the petroleum, materials, agricultural and pharmaceutical industries. These reactions are characterized by their use of discrete metal alkylidene catalysts that operate via a well-established mechanism. While the corresponding carbonyl-olefin metathesis reaction can also be used to construct carbon-carbon bonds, currently available methods are scarce and severely hampered by either harsh reaction conditions or the required use of stoichiometric transition metals as reagents. To date, no general protocol for catalytic carbonyl-olefin metathesis has been reported. Here we demonstrate a catalytic carbonyl-olefin ring-closing metathesis reaction that uses iron, an Earth-abundant and environmentally benign transition metal, as a catalyst. This transformation accommodates a variety of substrates and is distinguished by its operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions, high functional-group tolerance, and amenability to gram-scale synthesis. We anticipate that these characteristics, coupled with the efficiency of this reaction, will allow for further advances in areas that have historically been enhanced by olefin metathesis.

### Highly active ruthenium metathesis catalysts enabling ring-opening metathesis polymerization of cyclopentadiene at low temperatures [^30f4d3a6]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Ring-closing metathesis

The developed catalysts were further examined in the RCM of diethyl diallylmalonate (1a) under the standard conditions reported by Grubbs and colleagues(Fig. 2c); these catalysts exhibited dramatically improved reactivities compared with those previously reported for Fischer-type carbene-based ruthenium complexes (Supplementary Figs. 4, 5, and 6). Complexes Ru-8 and Ru-9 exhibited the fastest initiation rates among the developed catalysts and showed even higher activities compared with that of G-II. Ru-10 gave only 2% of the desired product at 30 °C after 2 h. When the temperature was elevated to 80 °C (C 6 D 6), the RCM of 1a was completed by Ru-10 within 10 min (Supplementary Fig. 7). Other catalysts also exhibited predictable reactivities based on the electronic characteristics of their ligands.

A variety of standard olefin-metathesis reactionswere compared and evaluated using complex Ru-9, which has similar RCM reactivity to that of Ru-8 but is expected to be more stable for challenging metathesis reactions (Supplementary Table 2). First, the RCM activity of complex Ru-9 was further investigated with a variety of dienes; it was faster in the chosen RCM reaction than G-II, which is the most popular catalyst for a variety of metathesis reactions. Even the sterically hindered trisubstituted olefin S1 reacted very fast to give a 95% conversion in 10 min and a 97% final yield after 1 h. Under the same conditions, G-III provided a conversion of <50% in 10 min and an 80% yield after 70 min (Supplementary Table 2, entry 1). Further RCM reactivity was monitored using G-III, to compare initial conversions with those obtained using Ru-9. Based on the results obtained, Ru-9 performed faster and more efficiently than G-III in the RCM of N, N -diallyl-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide S2 (>99% vs. >85%) (Supplementary Table 2, entry 2). In the case of G-III, the reaction was observed to gradually slow down due to the instability of the methylidene species in the presence of pyridine, consistent with previous reports.

### Blocking-cyclization technique for precise synthesis of cyclic polymers with regulated topology [^7112cf14]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Ring-closure and ring-expansion techniques are the two routes for extensive synthesis of cyclic polymers. Here, we report an alternative blocking-cyclization technique referred to as the third route to prepare cyclic polymers with regulated ring size and ring number by ring-opening metathesis polymerization of di- and monofunctional monomers in a one-pot process, where the polymer intermediates bearing two single-stranded blocks are efficiently cyclized by the cyclizing unit of propagated ladderphane to generate corresponding mono-, bis-, and tricyclic polymers, and the well-defined ladderphane structure plays a crucial role in forming the cyclic topology. Monocyclic polymer is further modified via Alder-ene reaction and the cyclic molecular topology is clearly demonstrated. The diversity features of cyclic polymers are comprehensively revealed. This strategy has broken through the limitations of previous two cyclizing routes, and indeed opens a facile and popular way to various cyclic polymers by commercial Grubbs catalyst and conventional metathesis polymerization.

### Photo-induced intramolecular dearomative [ 5 + 4 ] cycloaddition of arenes for the construction of highly strained medium-sized-rings [^e536b791]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

It is well known that the synthesis of medium-sized-ring compounds ranks among challenging goals in organic chemistry due to unfavorable transannular interactions and entropy effect –. In planning a synthesis towards a target molecule having a medium-sized-ring structure, only limited strategies, such as ring-closing metathesis –, sigmatropic rearrangement and related ring-expansion from small-ring precursors –, and multi-component cyclization –, etc. are typically employed to fulfill the task of ring-closure. Particularly, the synthetic difficulty will be further increased if an E -olefin moiety is embedded in the medium-sized-ring. Compared with the Z -olefin, the connection of the E -olefin with the remaining part of the medium-sized-ring through the two bonds at the opposite side of a C = C double bond imposes significant inherent rigidity of the ring structure as well as the strong ring strain, which impedes the facile synthesis of natural products and bioactive molecules possessing such structural units (Fig. 1a) –. Traditional methods to access these structures mainly relied on intramolecular cyclization or the functional group manipulations on a pre-assembled medium-sized-ring (such as elimination, semi-hydrogenation, and photoinduced isomerization, etc.), which usually suffered from low reactivity and selectivity issues,. To be noted, Cheng and Wagner reported in 1994 an intramolecular cycloaddition of cyclopropyl-substituted p– (butenyloxy)acetophenone under the irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light. The [5 + 4] adduct possessing an E -olefin was identified as a major product in the reaction mixture but not isolable due to its instability (Fig. 1b). In this regard, the development of efficient methods for the construction of medium-sized-ring molecular scaffolds with an E -olefin embedded is highly desirable but synthetically challenging.

### Processive ring-opening metathesis polymerization of low ring strain cycloalkenes via molecularly confined catalyst [^2141df1f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Controlling the reactivity of the propagating chain end in polymerization reactions is crucial for achieving well-defined polymers in both synthetic polymer chemistry and biology. Processive enzymes in nature have evolved substrate-enclosing structures, safeguarding the catalytic center against reentry by the nascent polymer. Here, we present a strategy for processive catalytic polymerization by encapsulating catalysts for ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) into the sub-surface cages of a metal-organic framework. The sub-surface encapsulation of the catalysts within the framework allowed the nascent polymer to grow out of the framework with minimal impedance and achieve continuous chain growth, while protecting the propagating polymer chain end from the secondary metathesis reaction with the alkenes in the backbone of the nascent polymer. As a result, ultra-high-molecular-weight polymers with low dispersity were generated from the ROMP of low ring strain cycloalkenes such as cis-cyclooctene and cyclopentene. We demonstrate that ultra-high-molecular-weight polymers with degradable backbones and enhanced mechanical and adhesive properties could be readily generated from this approach.

### Divergent synthesis and identification of the cellular targets of deoxyelephantopins [^85510641]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Synthesis of deoxyelephantopins and analogues

The synthesis of deoxyelephantopin analogues was envisioned to proceed as shown in Fig. 1 making use of a Barbier reaction (conditions are known for syn or anti addition products) and a ring-closing metathesis (RCM) to join two readily available fragments (1 and 2). Mindful that there are few precedents for the RCM of strained 10-membered ringswith a triply substituted alkene, we reasoned that the strategy might provide a rapid entry into the hitherto unknown nordeoxyelephantopin and its analogues.

The synthesis commenced with the alkylation of butenal 3 with lithiated alkyne 4 affording the alcohol required in the subsequent hydroxyl-directed alkyne conversion to vinyl iodide 5 (Fig. 2). Nickel-catalysed carbonylationyielded the first key intermediate 6. The second fragment 2 was assembled from the pentadienol 7. Acylation with acryloyl chloride followed by a Baylis–Hillman reaction with formaldehyde provided the cyclization substrate 8 that was engaged with Grubbs II followed by a conversion of the allylic alcohol to the bromide under Appel conditions to yield 2 as a racemate. While the prochiral substrate 8 might be desymmetrized via enantioselective RCM with the newly developed ruthenium-based catalysts, we anticipated to separate diastereomers arising from this racemic fragment at a latter stage. Conversion of the dimethyl acetal 6 to the corresponding aldehyde using hydrated iron trichloride followed by Barbier coupling with allylic bromide 2 afforded the addition product 9 with >9:1 relative stereochemistry for the two newly established stereocenters at C-7 and C-8 and a 1:1 diastereomeric mixture based on the relative stereochemistry of both fragments. With the intermediate in hand, we proceeded to experiment with the RCM. All attempts to carry out a RCM directly on 9 failed using various catalysts. However, introduction of the methacrylate side chain (10) provided an intermediate that did afford nordeoxyelephantopin in the RCM with the desired E -alkene geometry. Interestingly, the RCM proceeded only under the action of first generation catalyst (Grubbs I). Furthermore, only the diastereomer corresponding to deoxyelephantopin relative stereochemistry afforded the cyclization product, the C-2 epimer failed to give cyclization. A high correlation between nordeoxyelephantopin and deoxyelephantopin NMR coupling constants suggests that the two products have very similar dihedral angles along the 10-membered ring and hence, a comparable conformation. Furthermore, comparison of NOESY spectra showed similar interactions between the protons on either face of the 10-membered ring for both compounds (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). With these ring-closing conditions in hand, the same strategy was pursued to access analogues wherein one of the exocyclic conjugate acceptors was reduced (11 and 12 respectively). While the same reaction starting with 3b afforded the cyclization precursor (not shown), no cyclization product was observed under a variety of metathesis conditions.

### One-carbon homologation of alkenes [^0a423216]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

One-carbon homologues are structurally related and functionally identical organic molecules whose chain lengths differ by a single methylene (-CH 2 -) unit 1 . Across many classes of molecule-including pharmaceutical agents, natural products, agrochemicals, fragrances and petroleum products-the physicochemical characteristics exhibited by members of a homologous series subtly differ from one compound to another, which can impart remarkable differences to their function 2 . The efficient generation of homologues is, therefore, an important strategy in molecular discovery programmes 3,4 . Despite the availability of homologation strategies for several functional groups 5,6 , direct and general methods for one-carbon chain extension in alkenes remain an unmet synthetic need 7,8 . Here we report a catalytic one-carbon homologation process that is effective for many classes of alkene in simple and complex molecules. By leveraging the intrinsic reactivity of a new multifaceted allylsulfone reagent, a streamlined one-pot process, involving cross-metathesis and a fragmentation-retro-ene cascade, formally inserts a single methylene unit into the alkene chain. Among the applications of this process to several structurally and functionally complex molecules, we demonstrate how this practical transformation generates previously unexplored homologues of cyclosporine A 9 . These homologues exhibit modulated pharmacological and biological properties and could provide promising leads as cyclophilin inhibitors, a target that has great potential in many disease areas 10 .

### Orthogonal ring-closing alkyne and olefin metathesis for the synthesis of small GTPase-targeting bicyclic peptides [^0f0f2999]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Methods

General

For abbreviations and detailed information about the experimental procedures, analytical data and FP binding curves, see Supplementary Figs 1–16, Supplementary Tables 1–5, Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Methods.

Synthesis of building blocks 1 – 4

Synthesis of the Fmoc protected building blocks 1 – 4 was performed according to adapted protocols using Ni(II)-BPB ((R/S)-2-[N-(N′-benzylpropyl)amino]benzophenone) complexes. For a detailed description of building block synthesis and analytical data, see Supplementary Methods.

Peptide synthesis

Peptides were synthesized according to standard Fmoc-chemistry for SPPS using HCTU (O -(6-chlorobenzotriazol-1-yl)- N, N, N ′, N ′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) and COMU (1-[(1-(cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethylidenaminooxy)-dimethylaminomorpholino)]-uronium hexafluorophosphate) as coupling reagents (Supplementary Fig. 1). For more detailed information about peptide synthesis, see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.

Ring-closing alkyne metathesis

The dried resin was swollen and shrunken under argon alternating in dry diethyl ether and dry toluene (3 × each). Afterwards 0.5 ml of a solution of the alkyne-metathesis complex 5 (2 mg ml −1) in dry toluene was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 1.5 h. During the reaction time, argon was bubbled through the reaction mixture to evaporate the 2-butyne. After addition of 0.5 ml of fresh complex 5 solution, the mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 1.5 h.

Ring-closing olefin metathesis

The dried resin was swollen in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) for 15 min. Subsequently, 0.5 ml of a solution of Grubbs first-generation catalyst (2 mg ml −1) in DCE was added to the resin and reacted for 2 h at room temperature. During the reaction time, argon was bubbled through the reaction mixture to remove ethene. The procedure was repeated twice.

### One-carbon homologation of alkenes [^556a3b16]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

The geometry of the homologated internal alkenes (14) generated by the retro-ene reaction was not retained with respect to the E / Z ratio in the allylsulfone intermediates (13). This observation is in general agreement with previous reports of the retro-ene reaction of allylsulfinic acids,, which also demonstrated that increasing the size of the allylic substituent favours preferential formation of the E -isomer. To further probe this observation, we prepared both geometric isomers of the latent homologue 17 by de novo routes. When (E)- 17 was exposed to the standard fragmentation–retro-ene conditions, we observed the homologated alkene product 18 in a 3:1 mixture of E and Z isomers (Fig. 4d). However, when (Z)- 17 was reacted under the same conditions, exclusive conversion to the E -isomer of 18 was observed. The origin of this unexpected observation remains unclear. However, the differing reactivity of the two geometric isomers is proposed to arise from destabilizing 1,3-diaxial interactions that affect the energies of the corresponding retro-ene transition states (Supplementary Information).

The synthetic use of the homologation process was further demonstrated by its use for macrocyclic alkene ring expansion. Ambrettolide, a 17-membered macrocyclic lactone, belongs to a valuable class of alkene-containing musks that are widely used in the fragrance industry. Application of the two-step homologation process to ambrettolide yielded intermediate diene 19 by a ring-opening cross-metathesis sequence using 1CTR 1a. Subsequent RCM of 19 yielded the Z -isomer of the 19-membered macrocycle 20 in excellent yield, using the M2001 catalyst. Alternatively, RCM could be performed using UltraNitroCat, which led to the preferential formation of the E -isomer of 20 (Supplementary Information). This two-carbon macrocycle expansion strategy constitutes a straightforward method to access higher-order ring-homologues, which may exhibit subtle differences in conformational properties.

### Highly active ruthenium metathesis catalysts enabling ring-opening metathesis polymerization of cyclopentadiene at low temperatures [^29ae898f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Olefin metathesis is a key C–C double-bond forming reaction that is widely applied in the chemical synthesis,, pharmaceuticals,, agrochemicals, and polymer industries,. Polymerization, especially ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), has been studied for several decades, as it is a highly efficient way of obtaining a variety of functionalized linear and controlled polymers. The basic driving force for ROMP is the release of the strain energies of constrained monomers, such as norbornene and its derivatives (>20 kcal/mol) –. Cyclopentenes, however, have significantly lower ring strains (4.5–6.8 kcal/mol) than those of norbornene derivatives; consequently, fewer examples of ROMP involving cyclopentenes have been reported –. Notably, the ROMP of cyclopentadiene (CPD), which is easily obtained by the cracking of naphtha and rapidly dimerized to dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) even below 0 °C, has, to the best of our knowledge, never been achieved. Polymers derived from cyclopentenes are attractive and potentially highly useful materials because of their natural rubber-like properties and their recyclability through the ring-closing metathesis (RCM) of the polypentenamer,. In addition, functionalized linear polymers obtained by the ROMP of functionalized cyclopentenes, such as hydroxyl-, siloxy-, or ester, -functionalized polypentenamers, are of great industrial significance due to their distinct mechanical and thermal properties. However, the low ring strains of cyclopentene derivatives are intrinsic obstacles to polymerization; hence, controlling the thermal equilibrium is the key to achieving polymerization. As polymerization is an entropically disfavored reaction, low-temperature conditions are preferred, as they thermodynamically drive the reaction toward polymerization,. Unfortunately, low-temperature conditions are kinetically unfavorable for precatalyst initiation, which usually requires ligand dissociation. Therefore, a rapidly initiating catalyst that can be activated at low temperatures would be ideal for facilitating the ROMP of challenging low-strained cyclopentene derivatives (Fig. 1a).

### A multi-substrate screening approach for the identification of a broadly applicable diels-alder catalyst [^c3670baf]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

When developing a synthetic methodology, chemists generally optimize a single substrate and then explore the substrate scope of their method. This approach has led to innumerable and widely-used chemical reactions. However, it frequently provides methods that only work on model substrate-like compounds. Perhaps worse, reaction conditions that would enable the conversion of other substrates may be missed. We now show that a different approach, originally proposed by Kagan, in which a collection of structurally distinct substrates are evaluated in a single reaction vessel, can not only provide information on the substrate scope at a much earlier stage in methodology development, but even lead to a broadly applicable synthetic methodology. Using this multi-substrate screening approach, we have identified an efficient and stereoselective imidodiphosphorimidate organocatalyst for scalable Diels-Alder reactions of cyclopentadiene with different classes of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes.

Synthesis of 13 C-labeled neryl- and GPP

Chemical synthesis of (Z)-[1,2- 13 C 2]-neryl pyrophosphate 5a and its isomer (E)-[1,2- 13 C 2]-geranyl pyrophosphate 5b was performed according to the following procedure:

To synthesize ethyl (Z)-[1,2- 13 C 2]-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dienoate (3a) and ethyl (E)-[1,2- 13 C 2]-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dienoate (3b), a neat mixture of LiCl (0.25 g, 5.9 mmol), triethyl phosphono- 13 C 2- acetate (1) (1.0 g, 4.4 mmol) and DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene) (0.72 mL, 4.9 mmol) was stirred at rt for 1.0 h under Ar followed by the addition of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (2) (2.3 mL, 15.6 mmol). Stirring was continued at rt for 24 h. The reaction was quenched with water (50 mL) and the reaction mixture was extracted with Et 2 O (200 mL). The extract was washed with brine and dried (MgSO 4). The solvent was evaporated and chromatographed on silica (100 g) with 0–10% Et 2 O in n-pentane to afford the separation of the pure (Z)-isomer 3a as colorless oil (87.0 mg, 10%), E / Z -mixture (560.0 mg, 68%) and pure (E)-isomer 3b (175.0 mg, 20%) (829.0 mg in total, 95%).

### Titanium catalyzed [ 2 σ + 2 π ] cycloaddition of bicyclo [ 1.1.0 ]-butanes with 1, 3-dienes for efficient synthesis of stilbene bioisosteres [^5218ee16]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Natural stilbenes have shown significant potential in the prevention and treatment of diseases due to their diverse pharmacological activities. Here we present a mild and effective Ti-catalyzed intermolecular radical-relay [2σ+2π] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]-butanes and 1,3-dienes. This transformation enables the synthesis of bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane (BCH) scaffolds containing aryl vinyl groups with excellent regio- and trans-selectivity and broad functional group tolerance, thus offering rapid access to structurally diverse stilbene bioisosteres.

### Direct synthesis of imino-C-nucleoside analogues and other biologically active iminosugars [^1eb644c2]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Short syntheses of polyhydroxy pyrrolizidines and indolizidines

Figure 5 highlights the further application of this convenient strategy to the rapid preparation of several structurally complex polyhydroxy indolizidine and pyrrolizidine alkaloids, including analogues of the glycosidase inhibitors hyacinthacine and steviamine. While several strategies could be exploited for the second annulation event, ready access to the N -allyl pyrrolidine 40, alkyl chloride 33 and protected ketones 34 and 35 suggested annulation events involving ring closing metathesis, alkylationor reductive amination. For example, heating the dienylpyrrolidine 40 with the Hoveyda–Grubbs 2nd generation catalystin toluene provided the unsaturated indolizidine 45 in excellent overall yield from 4-pentenal (44). Alternatively, starting with 6-chloropentanal (46) or 5-chloropentanal (48), α-chlorination-DKR aldol reactionsfollowed by reductive amination and cyclization provided the chloroalkylpyrrolidine 33 and pyrrolizidine 49, respectively. Conversion of 33 into the corresponding indolizidine 47 (ref.) required hydrogenolytic removal of the benzyl-protecting group and brief treatment with base. Completion of the total synthesis of 7a -epi -hyacinthacine A 1 (50)simply involved hydrogenolysis of 49 in acidic media.

The reductive amination strategy was explored in short syntheses of the hyacinthacine and steviamine analogues 2 (ref.) and ent - 3 (ref.). In both cases, the ketone function in the readily available pyrrolidines 34 and 35 was unveiled in concert with hydrogenolytic cleavage of the N -benzyl group, and the resulting iminium species (not shown) was reduced in situ to afford the products depicted as single diastereomers. Importantly, each of the total syntheses depicted in Fig. 5 requires 5 steps or less, originates with inexpensive and readily available chemicals, and is completed in a matter of days, which compares well with the reported syntheses of these and related compounds (see for example, Fig. 1).

### Chemo-enzymatic cascades to produce cycloalkenes from bio-based resources [^2253e66f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Design of chemo-enzymatic cascades

We applied a biocatalytic retrosynthetic analysis, to design chemo-enzymatic cascades to produce cyclopentene (1a), cyclohexene (1b), and cycloheptene (1c) from oleic acid (6) (Fig. 2a, b). We hypothesized that cycloalkenes (1a - 1c) may be accessed via ring-closing metathesis of the corresponding α,ω-dienes (2a-2c), which, in turn, can be produced from an oxidative bis-decarboxylation of α,ω-dicarboxylic acids (4a-4c) using a decarboxylase – (Fig. 2a). Exploratory studies using oleic acid (6) suggested that decarboxylation of carboxylate 6 affords 1,8-heptadecadiene (5), which may undergo ring-closing metathesis to afford cycloheptene 1c and 1-decene (Fig. 2b). To access the synthetically more useful cyclopentene (1a) and cyclohexene (1b) from oleic acid 6, we surmised that one could complement previously reported enzyme cascades–for the production of diacids from oleic acid– with a decarboxylase and an RCM catalyst. The diacids 4a and 4b are produced via a six- and four enzyme-cascade, respectively (Fig. 2b). This is achieved via hydration of oleic acid (6) by OhyA2, followed by oxidation with MlADH to the corresponding keto-acid. Subjecting the keto-acid to a Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase, using either PpBVMO or PfBVMO, followed by hydrolysis by TLL affords either sebacic acid (4b) – with PfBVMO– or a hydroxy-carboxylic acid –with PpBVMO–. The latter may be oxidized by ChnD and ChnE to afford azelaic acid (4a)(Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 1 for details). As olive oil is readily hydrolyzed by TLL to afford oleic acid 6, one may thus be able to produce cycloalkenes 1a-1c, typically derived from petroleum-based feedstocks, from renewable resources via a concurrent chemo-enzymatic cascade.

### Ring-closing C-O / C-O metathesis of ethers with primary aliphatic alcohols [^ad8c9f65]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In canonical organic chemistry textbooks, the widely adopted mechanism for the classic transetherifications between ethers and alcohols starts with the activation of the ether in order to weaken the C-O bond, followed by the nucleophilic attack by the alcohol hydroxy group, resulting in a net C-O/O-H σ-bond metathesis. In this manuscript, our experimental and computational investigation of a Re 2 O 7 mediated ring-closing transetherification challenges the fundamental tenets of the traditional transetherification mechanism. Instead of ether activation, the alternative activation of the hydroxy group followed by nucleophilic attack of ether is realized by commercially available Re 2 O 7 through the formation of perrhenate ester intermediate in hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), which results in an unusual C-O/C-O σ-bond metathesis. Due to the preference for the activation of alcohol rather than ether, this intramolecular transetherification reaction is therefore suitable for substrates bearing multiple ether moieties, unparalleled by any previous methods.

### Deacylative transformations of ketones via aromatization-promoted C-C bond activation [^c1d83f6f]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Carbon-hydrogen (C-H) and carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds are the main constituents of organic matter. Recent advances in C-H functionalization technology have vastly expanded our toolbox for organic synthesis 1 . By contrast, C-C activation methods that enable editing of the molecular skeleton remain limited 2-7 . Several methods have been proposed for catalytic C-C activation, particularly with ketone substrates, that are typically promoted by using either ring-strain release as a thermodynamic driving force 4,6 or directing groups 5,7 to control the reaction outcome. Although effective, these strategies require substrates that contain highly strained ketones or a preinstalled directing group, or are limited to more specialist substrate classes 5 . Here we report a general C-C activation mode driven by aromatization of a pre-aromatic intermediate formed in situ. This reaction is suitable for various ketone substrates, is catalysed by an iridium/phosphine combination and is promoted by a hydrazine reagent and 1,3-dienes. Specifically, the acyl group is removed from the ketone and transformed to a pyrazole, and the resulting alkyl fragment undergoes various transformations. These include the deacetylation of methyl ketones, carbenoid-free formal homologation of aliphatic linear ketones and deconstructive pyrazole synthesis from cyclic ketones. Given that ketones are prevalent in feedstock chemicals, natural products and pharmaceuticals, these transformations could offer strategic bond disconnections in the synthesis of complex bioactive molecules.

### Highly stereoselective synthesis of cyclopentanes bearing four stereocentres by a rhodium carbene-initiated domino sequence [^feca1f22]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Stereoselective synthesis of a cyclopentane nucleus by convergent annulation constitutes a significant challenge for synthetic chemists. Although a number of biologically relevant cyclopentane natural products are known, more often than not, the cyclopentane core is assembled in a stepwise manner because of the lack of efficient annulation strategies. Here we report the rhodium-catalysed reactions of vinyldiazoacetates with (E)-1,3-disubstituted 2-butenols generate cyclopentanes, containing four new stereogenic centres with very high levels of stereoselectivity (99% ee, >97: 3 dr). The reaction proceeds by a carbene-initiated domino sequence consisting of five distinct steps: rhodium-bound oxonium ylide formation, [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, oxy-Cope rearrangement, enol-keto tautomerization and finally an intramolecular carbonyl ene reaction. A systematic study is presented detailing how to control chirality transfer in each of the four stereo-defining steps of the cascade, consummating in the development of a highly stereoselective process.

### Synthesis of dienes from pyrrolidines using skeletal modification [^011c40fb]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Results

The pyrrolidine-containing compound, azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane, is a scaffold often used in drug discovery. Accordingly, we chose azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane (1a) as the substrate with which to test our hypothesis (Fig. 2a, see Supporting Information - SI for details). Our experiments show that 1a reacts with a DCM solution of N 3 SO 2 N 3 to produce a sulfamoyl azide intermediate, which decomposes under thermal conditions to yield a 1,4-diene, ethyl (E)−2-styrylpent-4-enoate (1b) in an overall yield of 81% (entry 1). The use of a DCM solution of N 3 SO 2 N 3, generated from commercially available reagents SO 2 Cl 2 and NaN 3, minimizes the associated purification and storage risks. The reaction is highly stereoselective, and 1b was obtained in an E configuration. None of the isomer (1c) with a Z configuration was detected. The excellent chemoselectivity of the reaction was demonstrated by the absence of the N-atom deletion product, cyclobutane (1d), whose formation requires overcoming the strain in the four-membered ring. The yield of 1b was reduced when the reaction was performed in the absence of t BuOLi, at a lower temperature, or when dioxane was used as a solvent or the organic base DBU was used instead of t BuOLi (entries 2–5). Imidazolium sulfonyl azide (Imi-SO 2 N 3), developed by Fokin’s group, has been used as an efficient sulfonyl azide transfer agent. It can be prepared in crystalline solid form at a scale of tens of grams, with high yield and purity. Thus, two-step one-pot synthetic procedure has been developed by using 1.05 equivalents of imidazolium sulfonyl azide (Fig. 2b, standard conditions II - SC-II, see SI for details), affording desired product 1b in 89% yield. This one-pot reaction, utilizing solid Imi-SO 2 N 3 as the sulfonyl azide transfer agent, is easier to operate and more practical. To further study the stereoselectivity of the reaction, the isomers 2,3- trans -pyrrolidine (2a) and 2,3- cis -pyrrolidine (3a) were prepared and subjected to the standard reaction conditions (Fig. 2c). The reactions demonstrated exclusive stereoselectivity, yielding isomers 2b and 3b with E- and Z-olefinic structures, respectively. The stereo-chemistry of the products was determined by the structure of the starting materials.

### Silver-catalyzed direct conversion of epoxides into cyclopropanes using N-triftosylhydrazones [^81c5fbeb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

This catalytic protocol also operates effectively with 2-(phenylethynyl)oxirane to furnish cyclopropane 17 (54% yield and >20:1 d.r.), where the internal alkynyl remains intact for [2 + 1] cycloaddition with carbenes. Under standard conditions, 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane readily converted to n -hexene-substituted cyclopropane 18 (80% yield and >12:1 d.r.) but produced the expected 1,4-dicyclopropylbutane 19 (74% yield and 8:1 d.r.) with 6 equiv. of 4-chlorophenyl trifluoromethyl N -triftosylhydrazone. Next, an array of aryl-substituted oxiranes was subjected to the reaction system. Aryl epoxides with various substitution groups (e.g. methyl, phenyl, chloro, methoxy, and trifluoromethyl) and electronic properties were well tolerated with this transformation, affording cyclopropanes 20 – 28 in high yields (62–93%) and excellent diastereoselectivities (>20:1 d.r.). Similarly, disubstituted phenyl-, naphthyl-, and 2-thienyl-substituted epoxides were converted into cyclopropanes 29 – 31 in good yield with >20:1 d.r. The scope of various disubstituted oxiranes was then examined. Several 2,2-disubstituted epoxides, including 2,2-dimethyl, sterically hindered 2,2-diaryl, and 2-(cyclo)alkyl-2-aryl-substituted epoxides, as well as cyclohexyl ketal, pyran, N -Cbz protected piperidine fused epoxides proved compatible, leading to highly substituted cyclopropanes 32 – 40 in high yields with d.r. as high as 16:1. Similarly, various 2,3-disubstituted epoxides (e.g. cyclopentane, 2,3-dihydro indene oxirane, 2,3-dialkyl-, 2-alkyl-3-aryl-, and 2,3-diaryl-substituted epoxides) afforded the corresponding cyclopropanes 41 – 45 with good to excellent yields and moderate to good d.r.

### Easy access to medium-sized lactones through metal carbene migratory insertion enabled 1, 4-palladium shift [^f38ad852]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Reactions that efficiently construct medium-sized lactones are significant, as they overcome the unfavorable entropic factor and transannular interactions for ring closure, and the lactones produced are common structural motifs recurring in many biologically active compounds. Herein, we describe a valuable strategy for medium-sized lactone synthesis by accomplishing site-selective C-H bond functionalization via a palladium carbene migratory insertion enabled 1,4-palladium shift. The overall process achieves the formal dimerization of two readily available benzaldehyde derivatives, providing value-added products medium-sized lactones. Our method is amenable to late-stage modification of approved drugs and other complex molecules. Mechanistic studies including deuterium-labeling experiments and DFT calculation shed light on the reaction pathways.

### Catalytic enantioselective synthesis of alkylidenecyclopropanes [^937f5496]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Catalyst C12 was then used to investigate the scope of ketone substrates. Replacement of 4a ’s n -Pr chain with a cyclopentane ring (31a) was well tolerated and 31b was obtained in 90% yield and 99% e.e. in 4 hours. para -Methoxyphenyl ketone (32a) could also be used albeit with moderately reduced enantioselectivity of 84% e.e. but an excellent yield of 97% and complete diastereocontrol (more than 20:1 d.r.).

As of 2020, pyrethroid insecticides accounted for 25% of global insecticide sales. Despite the differing biological properties of their stereoisomers, few direct enantioselective methods exist for their synthesis. Current routes involve chiral auxiliaries, resolution approachesor stoichiometric quantities of chiral reagents. The development of catalytic enantioselective approaches have been met with limited success.

Pyrethroids have several common, recurring structural features, most notably their gem -dimethyl cyclopropane, alkene and carbonyl motifs (Fig. 1a). To incorporate these features into our ACP products, a modified strategy was realized. Placement of a suitably protected alcohol at the site of deprotonation would result in the formation of an enol-ether on successful migration of the double bond. Deprotection of the enol-ether would then reveal an aldehyde amenable to further functionalization while allowing two stereocentres to be set in a single step (Fig. 3a). A test substrate 33a containing the required structural features was accordingly synthesized (Supplementary Information).

### A diels-alder super diene breaking benzene into C2H2 and C4H4 units [^f52f1a03]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Results

Diels–Alder reactions of cyclobutadiene 2

Dried acetylene or ethylene gas was bubbled into a toluene solution of pentafluorophenyltris(trimethylsilyl)cyclobutadiene 2 for 5 min to afford Dewar benzene 3 (in 79% yield) or bicyclo[2.2.0]hex-2-ene 4 (in 82% yield), respectively (Fig. 1). In both cases, the red colour of 2 disappeared within 3 min of the introduction of gas into the reaction vessel. Compounds 3 and 4 could be isolated and were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry and X-ray diffraction analysis. For the molecular structures of 3 and 4 determined by X-ray crystallography, see Supplementary Figs 1 and 5, respectively.

We found that on heating a solution of 2 in benzene to 120 °C for 15 h in a sealed reaction tube, benzene derivative 5, cyclooctatetraene derivative 6 and tetracyclodecadiene derivative 7 could be isolated in 25, 24 and 19% yields, respectively (Fig. 2).

The thermal reaction of 2 was also performed in benzene- d 6. A mixture of 2, benzene- d 6 and hexane was sealed in a reaction tube and heated at 140 °C for 14 h. After purification using HPLC, compounds 5- d 2, 6- d 4 and 7- d 6 were obtained as colourless crystals (12%), a pale yellow oil (9%) and colourless crystals (17%), respectively. The formation of the products 5, 6, 7, 5- d 2, 6- d 4 and 7- d 6 clearly indicates that the solvent serves as a reagent in the reaction and that the C 2 H 2 unit in compound 5 and the C 4 H 4 unit in compound 6 originate from benzene, while 7 is a thermal isomerization product of the Diels–Alder cycloadduct of 2 and benzene. Compounds 5, 6, 7, 5- d 2, 6- d 4 and 7- d 6 were characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry, and the molecular structures of 5 and 7 were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis (Supplementary Fig. 9 for 5). Figure 3 shows the molecular structure of 7 determined by X-ray crystallography.

### Modulation of virus-induced NF-κ B signaling by NEMO coiled coil mimics [^0152d6f5]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Synthesis of hydrogen-bond surrogate NEMO mimic (HBS NEMO)

HBS NEMO was synthesized as previously described. Peptide sequences up to the i + 3rd residue of the parent strand were synthesized on solid phase on a GYROS Protein Technologies Prelude X instrument. A solution containing premixed o-nitrobenzesulfonyl chloride (10 eq) and 2,4,6-collidine (10 eq) in DCM was added to resin containing Fmoc-deprotected peptide. Resin was washed sequentially with dichloromethane, dimethylformamide and diethyl ether (3 × 5 mL each). Resin was dried overnight under vacuum. Dried resin, PPh 3, and Pd 2 (dba) 3 were flushed under inert argon for 30 min. The resin with reactants was swelled in THF, and allylmethylcarbonate was added to the reaction vessel. The solution was agitated at room temperature for 3 to 5 h under argon to afford allylated peptide. Resin was filtered and washed with DCM, DMF, 0.2 M sodium diethylcarbamate trihydrate in NMP, and diethyl ether (3 × 5 mL). The nosyl protecting group was then removed by the addition of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU, 5eq) and 2-mercaptoethanol (10 eq.) in DMF. Resin was washed with DMF, DCM, and diethyl ether (3 × 5 mL) and treated with the desired Fmoc amino acid (20 eq.), DIC (20 eq.) and HOAt (10 eq.) in DMF. The reaction was allowed to agitate at room temperature for 12 to 16 h. Resin containing elongated peptide was washed, and coupled to the desired Fmoc amino acid residue (5 eq.) and 4-pentenoic acid (5 eq.) with HBTU (5 eq.) and DIEA (10 eq.) in DMF. Ring-closing metathesis of bis-olefin was performed with Hoveyda-Grubbs II catalyst (20 mol%) in 1,2-dichloroethane under microwave irradiation at 120 °C for 10 min as previously described,. The ring-closing reaction was monitored by MALDI-TOF. Peptides were cleaved from the resin using 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% TIPS, and 2.5% H 2 O, and purified by reversed-phase HPLC (gradient 15–60 acetonitrile/water with 0.1% TFA over 60 min) and characterized by MALDI-TOF.

### Synthesis of dienes from pyrrolidines using skeletal modification [^2d64ecac]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The substrate scope of compounds with the azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane scaffold was explored to assess the functional group tolerance and substituent group diversity (Fig. 3). The electron-donating and electron-withdrawing aryl groups at the α-position of the amino group were compatible with the reaction, which showed good yields for the production of 1,4-dienes (4b - 9b) containing different substituted styrene fragments. Heteroaryl substrates, such as those substituted with furanyl (10b) or benzo-furanyl (11b) groups, were found to be particularly suitable. The reactions cleaved both benzylic C–N and alkyl C–N bonds synergistically. When the substrates had a cis stereochemical structure between the aryl group and the carbon chain link, the products (4b - 11b) retained this cis stereochemistry, while substrates with a trans stereochemistry yielded the trans products (12b, 13b). Substrates containing an alkynyl group at the α-position of the amino group were also good substrates, producing the desired products (14b, 15b) by breaking the propargyl C–N and alkyl C–N bonds, respectively. Even relatively electron-deficient amines, such as an α-amino ester (16a) or an α-amino amide (17a), reacted under standard conditions to produce the desired 1,4-dienes in 72% (16b) and 82% (17b) yields. Substrates without substituents (18a, 19a) or with a linear or branched alkyl group (20a, 21a) at the α-position of the amino group also generated dienes (18b - 21b) in good yields. Surprisingly, two strong alkyl C–N bonds were cleaved in the reaction –. A range of substituted olefins, including tri-substituted (4b - 11b), 1,2-disubstituted (12b, 13b), 2,2-disubstituted (18b), and mono-substituted (19b) olefins, were synthesized using this method. Polysubstituted dienes, such as the 1,2,4-trisubstituted-1,4-diene (22b) and the 1,2,3,4-tetra-substituted-1,4-diene (23b), were also produced. The method can generate various types of alkenes, including conjugated aryl alkenes (4b - 9b), heteroaryl alkenes (10b, 11b, 13b), alkynyl alkenes (14b, 15b), and electron-deficient acrylates (16b, 17b). The link between the two double bonds in the products is varied, and can be a secondary carbon (14b, 15b), a tertiary carbon (23b) or a quaternary carbon (13b, 16b). The method can prepare dienes with links of varying lengths, including the conjugated 1,3-diene (25b) and the 1-4-diene (26b), the 1,5-diene (27b), and the1,6-diene (28b). A simple 1,7-diene (29b) was prepared in low yield, and a 1,6(7)-diene (30b) was produced from a bridge compound (30a) high efficiently. The method tolerates many functional groups, such as ester (4b), methoxyl (5b), fluoro (7b), chloro (8b), bromo (9b), heteroaryl (10b, 11b, 19b), amido (17b), alkynyl (15b, 24b) and cyano (19b), providing various opportunities for the derivatization of the resulting dienes. Importantly, only a single alkene isomer was obtained in all cases. These synthetic transformations are significant as the resulting conjugated 1,3-diene and non-conjugated 1,4- (sometimes known as a skipped diene), 1,5-, 1,6-, 1,7-diene motifs are crucial intermediates in organic synthesis and ubiquitous in natural products,. Development of a direct and general method for the construction of two double bonds in one step is challenging, but this method achieves it without the use of oxidants or reductants.

### Discovery and characterization of a terpene biosynthetic pathway featuring a norbornene-forming diels-alderase [^94d7bf6a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In particular, it is intriguing how the hydrocarbon cycloaraneosene can be morphed to form the norbornene core in sordaricin. To the best of our knowledge, IMDA reaction has not been reported to take place during the maturation of a terpene natural product, although one example of cycloaddition between a sesquiterpene dienophile and a polyketide-derived quinone methide dienehas been documented. Extensive modifications of the cycloaraneosene skeleton are expected to ready the molecule for norbornene formation: (1) unlike IMDA reactions observed for polyketide chains that are conformationally flexible to position dienes and dienophiles in spatial proximity (Fig. 1b) –, the polycyclic terpene molecule is rigid, thereby requiring breaking one or more C-C bonds to afford rotational freedom; (2) desaturation of sp 3 - sp 3 C-C bond(s) in the cyclized terpenes such as cycloaraneosene must take place to generate the diene moiety; and (3) the diene and especially the dienophile require activation to lower the transition state (TS) energy barrier for IMDA. Whereas dienophiles in polyketides that undergo IMDA are typically conjugated to electron withdrawing groups as a result of polyketide synthase programing, the hydrocarbon scaffold of a terpene molecule must be strategically oxidized prior to the pericyclic reaction.

Here, we report the complete reconstitution of sordaricin biosynthesis from cycloaraneosene and the chemical logic that setups an IMDA reaction to form the norbornene structure. A pericyclase that accelerates the IMDA cycloaddition and attenuates competing shunt product formation is discovered and characterized. The findings in this work represent an example of a pericyclic reaction involved in building terpene structural complexity.

The ring-closing metathesis reactions of alkenesand alkyneshave evolved into one of the methods of choice in assembling cyclic compounds of varying ring sizes (Fig. 1f), which are of irrebuttable significance in both organic synthesisand materials science. Recently, with the advent of novel multiple-bond metathesis reactions such as those between alkenes and carbonyl compounds –, this strategy has been empowered with more flexibility regarding substrate preparation (Fig. 1g). On the other hand, much less effort has been dedicated to the development of metathesis reactions of the more easily available C–C and C–X bonds –, the intramolecular variant of which could potentially provide rapid access to saturated carbo- and heterocyclic compounds. In 2018, the Morandi group reported a novel Fe(OTf) 3 mediated ring-closing C–O/C–O σ-bond metathesis of aliphatic ethers for the synthesis of cyclic ethers. Recently, the Liu group used an ionic liquid under metal-free conditionsand the Kerton group utilized functionalized biochar, respectively, to catalyze the same transformation (Fig. 1h).

Here we show a Re 2 O 7 mediated ring-closing σ-bond metathesis between ethers and aliphatic alcohols. The success of this protocol relies on selective hydroxy group activation via perrhenate ester formation,, even in the presence of acid-labile ether or acetal functionalities, which provides an unusual C–O/C–O σ-bond metathesis reaction between ethers and aliphatic alcohols that represents a reversal in the mechanism of transetherification. This method can provide facile access to various substituted chromanes and several other frequently encountered cyclic ethers.

### Orthogonal ring-closing alkyne and olefin metathesis for the synthesis of small GTPase-targeting bicyclic peptides [^263f578a]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Bicyclic ligands of the small GTPase Rab8

To demonstrate the potential of this robust orthogonal RCM/RCAM macrocyclization, we aimed at the improvement of a monocyclic bioactive peptide targeting a challenging protein. Small GTPases comprise a protein superfamily with clinically highly relevant, yet particularly challenging, drug targets. Despite enormous efforts, no efficient inhibitors of small GTPases have reached clinical trials. Importantly, the target affinity of small molecule modulators typically does not exceed the low-to-medium micromolar range. Among the small GTPase superfamily, Rab proteins (Ras-related in brain) constitute key regulators of intracellular vesicular transport and trafficking. As starting point for the generation of a bicyclic peptide, we selected the hydrocarbon-stapled monocyclic peptide StRIP3, which binds the small GTPase Rab8a with moderate affinity (dissociation constant (K d)=20.7 μM, Table 1, entry 2). StRIP3 resembles the only known inhibitor of a Rab protein–protein interactionand is based on the interaction motif of Rab6-interacting protein 1 (wt-R6IP, Table 1, entry 1). Initially, alkyne-bearing macrocycles based on StRIP3 were explored in which the i, i +4 olefin crosslink was replaced by alkynes with varying crosslink length (9–10 carbon atoms, Table 1, entry 3–5). The 10-carbon crosslink requires double incorporation of building block 2 (entry 3). A nine-carbon crosslink is generated by incorporation of two different building blocks (1 and 2), which results in two different architectures (entry 4: 1 / 2, entry 5: 2 / 1). The synthesis of an eight-carbon crosslinked StRIP3 derivative containing building block 1 twice was not possible, most likely due to high ring strain caused by the linear geometry of the triple bond.

### Aromatic ring-opening metathesis [^c3dd2810]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Aromatic ring-opening metathesis

To assess the viability of ArROM, the [2+2] cycloaddition was, thus, coupled to an arene-forming ring-closing metathesis (RCM) step to promote ring cleavage through a common metallacycle intermediate (Fig. 2a). In a first exploratory study, the reactivity of the readily accessible tetraphene 1 was thereby evaluated in the presence of the commercial molybdenum catalyst C1. Here, when using 10 mol% catalyst at 65 °C, the desired product 2 was obtained with a yield of 82%. The thermodynamically favourable formation of product 2 associates with its higher overall aromatic stabilization compared with substrate 1 (for density functional theory calculations, see Supplementary Table 16). This result served as the first evidence that aromatic rings are addressable by metathesis, constituting our starting point for further exploration of the ring opening of a diversity of aromatics. We next set out to evaluate whether ArROM could break aromatic rings with increased stabilization by drawing our attention to the cleavage of naphthalene substrate 3 (Fig. 2b). For this purpose, ArROM was combined with twofold RCM in a cascade reaction. The obtained alkylidene intermediate was, therefore, expected to further react with the appended alkene to form a terminal aromatic ring, which was observed in the desired chrysene 4 obtained with a yield of 74%, representing an unconventional approach to forge fused polyaromatics. Encouraged by these results, we envisaged the possibility of ArROM for five-membered ring heterocycles (Fig. 2c). To test the reactivity of nitrogen and oxygen heterocycles in heteroaromatic ring-opening metathesis, we first examined the indole substrate 5a, which was indeed efficiently converted by ArROM with twofold RCMby forming an additional arene as well as a heterocycle. Mild catalytic conditions at 65 °C were sufficient for converting 5a into the desired naphtho-indole 6a with a remarkable yield of 98%, in which proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the crude reaction mixture confirmed the absence of detectable side products formed in this transformation. Similarly, substrate 5b bearing a benzofuran ring also effectively provided the phenanthro-furan product 6b under the same reaction conditions with a yield of 92%. With the possibility of expeditiously creating planar polyaromatics, we explored whether bidirectional synthesis by twofold ArROM and twofold RCM enables the direct generation of extended polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Fig. 2d). Indeed, substrates 7a and 7b efficiently provided arylated benzo[k]tetraphenes (8a, 67%; 8b, 56%), whereas the regioisomeric 7c gave benzo[m]tetraphene 8c with another characteristic geometry (63%). Furthermore, even the highly unstable dibenzo[a, j]tetracene 8d with an expanded polyaromatic core was accessible by twofold ArROM with double RCM. Although the reaction conditions for ArROM emerged as compatible for the synthesis of such a labile compound, the yield was diminished by the spontaneous decomposition of the product, as observed on isolation. Aiming to explore the general potential of ArROM for distinct heteroarene ring-opening transformations, we tested a class of indole substrates for an alternative opening mode of the five-membered rings (Fig. 2e). To assess the feasibility of this opposite indole cleavage reaction, we subjected substrates 9a – 9 i to ArROM. Because another N - o -styryl indole is formed in this transformation, the metathesis reaction is reversible, providing the possibility to equilibrate indoles by ArROM–RCM. The experiments, thus, yielded an equilibrium mixture of the substituted indoles 9a – 9i and the corresponding constitutional isomers 10a – 10i, enabling the investigation of their relative stabilities. The fluorine substituent in 9d and 10d was consequently found to have a minor impact, leading to a 1:1 mixture of these interconverting indoles. However, the introduction of substituents with strong stabilizing and destabilizing effects gave markedly different isomeric ratios. A discernible trend was observed in the ArROM–RCM indole equilibration, revealing that electron-donating groups of indoles 9a and 9b shift the ratios towards their corresponding isomers (10a and 10b, respectively). By contrast, the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups (9f – 9i) led to the opposite behaviour, whereas the impact of the substitution pattern was evident in the equilibration of 9c – 9e. This possibility to isomerize indole heterocycles, hence, represents a mechanistically distinct approach to interconvert the constitutional isomers of aromatics. Subsequently, we questioned if complex cascade reactions involving multiple ArROM and RCM steps are also feasible (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Specifically, bis-(o -styryl)-biindole 11 was expected to transform into the product 12 conceivably through indole ring-opening metathesis to produce an alkylidene intermediate that then participates in the ArROM of the second indole moiety, forming the phenanthrene system. The last step of the cascade comprises a third RCM step leading to the formation of a second indole ring system. Here, with catalyst C1 at 120 °C, the desired diindolyl-phenanthrene 12 was obtained with 41% yield after an 18 h reaction. This intricate domino reaction underlines the distinct potential of ArROM in complex transformations by merging several consecutive steps in a catalytic reaction cascade. To evaluate the spectrum of reactions enabled by (hetero)ArROM even more, we studied a third class of indole ring-opening reactions by the combination with twofold RCM (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Fig. 1b and Extended Data Table 1). At the outset of our studies, it was observed that the reaction of 13a also proceeds with the ruthenium-based Hoveyda–Grubbs II (HG-II) catalyst, giving 47% product, whereas remarkable yields (96%–98%) were achieved with molybdenum catalyst C2. ArROM provides the desired phenanthrenyl-indole 14a after a particularly simple purification procedure and is amenable to 2.0 mol% C2 on a 112-mg scale (97%). Computational studies aligned with the observed reactivity differences between the Ru and Mo catalysts, with markedly lower activation energies predicted for the aromatic ring opening to Mo metallacycles (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3). Notably, the methodology proved to be highly efficient for substrates bearing both electron-donating (14c) and electron-withdrawing (14b and 14d – 14f) groups. Even a sterically hindered system and a substrate containing an azaindole core engaged in the transformation to form 14g and 14h, although with a lower yield at partial conversion, whereas [4]helicenyl-indole 14i was forged in a 98% isolated yield.

### [ 2 ]-ladderanes as isosteres for meta-substituted aromatic rings and rigidified cyclohexanes [^105e6770]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

After exploration of several strategies, a robust and scalable route to the 2,6-disubstituted [2]-ladderane was developed (Fig. 2A). The general route begins with addition of homoallyl Grignard to either cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives or (E, E)-2,4-decadienal (all common and commercially available reagents). Photosensitized [2 + 2] cycloaddition provided access to cyclobutane 3,. While this reaction could be conducted in batch (see SI, General Procedure C for batch set-up), scale up of the process was more easily performed in a flow photochemical reactor. Oxidation of the secondary alcohol with DMP followed by diazoketone synthesis provided access to 4. This is the first chromatography performed in the sequence. Irradiation of the diazoketone with 365 nm LEDs in the presence of MeOH provided access to ester 5 with the endo-diastereomer predominating. At this stage, two final elaborations to useful building blocks were established. Epimerization of 5 to the exo-diastereomer when R = Ph followed by esterification and exhaustive oxidation led to synthesis of ester/acid 6. When R = heptene, oxidative cleavage followed by silyl protection and epimerization allowed for the synthesis of acid/silyl ether building block 7. Both routes could easily be conducted to provide hundreds of milligrams of 6 and 7. At this stage of development, the current bottleneck is the conversion of 2 to 3 with our current commercial photochemical flow setup due to challenges with lamp cooling over extended reaction times. Finally, various aryl groups were tolerated and allowed for synthesis of 8 – 13 (Fig. 2B).

### Reagent-controlled regiodivergent ring expansions of steroids [^9d7b1e35]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Ring expansion provides a powerful way of introducing a heteroatom substituent into a carbocyclic framework. However, such reactions are often limited by the tendency of a given substrate to afford only one of the two rearrangement products or fail to achieve high selectivity at all. These limitations are particularly acute when seeking to carry out late-stage functionalization of natural products as starting points in drug discovery. In this work, we present a stereoelectronically controlled ring expansion sequence towards selective and flexible access to complementary ring systems derived from common steroidal substrates. Chemical diversification of the reaction intermediate affords over 100 isomerically pure analogs with spatial and functional diversity. This regiodivergent rearrangement, and the concept of using chiral reagents to affect regiocontrol in chiral natural products, should be broadly applicable to late-stage natural product diversification programs.

### A three-membered ring approach to carbonyl olefination [^fadb61da]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The carbon-carbon double bond, with its diverse and multifaceted reactivity, occupies a prominent position in organic synthesis. Although a variety of simple alkenes are readily available, the mild and chemoselective introduction of a unit of unsaturation into a functionalized organic molecule remains an ongoing area of research, and the olefination of carbonyl compounds is a cornerstone of such approaches. Here we show the direct olefination of hydrazones via the intermediacy of three-membered ring species generated by addition of sulfoxonium ylides, departing from the general dogma of alkenes synthesis from carbonyls. Moreover, the mild reaction conditions and operational simplicity of the transformation render the methodology appealing from a practical point of view.

### Control of four stereocentres in a triple cascade organocatalytic reaction [^a34eb0e4]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

Efficient and elegant syntheses of complex organic molecules with multiple stereogenic centres continue to be important in both academic and industrial laboratories. In particular, catalytic asymmetric multi-component 'domino' reactions, used during total syntheses of natural products and synthetic building blocks, are highly desirable. These reactions avoid time-consuming and costly processes, including the purification of intermediates and steps involving the protection and deprotection of functional groups, and they are environmentally friendly and often proceed with excellent stereoselectivities. Therefore, the design of new catalytic and stereoselective cascade reactions is a continuing challenge at the forefront of synthetic chemistry. In addition, catalytic cascade reactions can be described as biomimetic, as they are reminiscent of tandem reactions that may occur during biosyntheses of complex natural products. Here we report the development of an asymmetric organocatalytic triple cascade reaction for the synthesis of tetra-substituted cyclohexene carbaldehydes. This three-component domino reaction proceeds by way of a catalysed Michael/Michael/aldol condensation sequence affording the products with good to moderate yields (25-58 per cent). During this sequence, four stereogenic centres are formed with high diastereoselectivity and complete enantioselectivity. In addition, variation of the starting materials can be used to obtain diverse polyfunctional cyclohexene derivatives, which can be used as building blocks in organic synthesis.

### Orthogonal ring-closing alkyne and olefin metathesis for the synthesis of small GTPase-targeting bicyclic peptides [^2c56bc65]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Bicyclic peptides are promising scaffolds for the development of inhibitors of biological targets that proved intractable by typical small molecules. So far, access to bioactive bicyclic peptide architectures is limited due to a lack of appropriate orthogonal ring-closing reactions. Here, we report chemically orthogonal ring-closing olefin (RCM) and alkyne metathesis (RCAM), which enable an efficient chemo- and regioselective synthesis of complex bicyclic peptide scaffolds with variable macrocycle geometries. We also demonstrate that the formed alkyne macrocycle can be functionalized subsequently. The orthogonal RCM/RCAM system was successfully used to evolve a monocyclic peptide inhibitor of the small GTPase Rab8 into a bicyclic ligand. This modified peptide shows the highest affinity for an activated Rab GTPase that has been reported so far. The RCM/RCAM-based formation of bicyclic peptides provides novel opportunities for the design of bioactive scaffolds suitable for the modulation of challenging protein targets.

### Amide nitrogen pyramidalization changes lactam amide spinning [^a615edd9]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Analysis of amide cis-trans isomerization

We used ring-closing metathesis (RCM), to staple model bridgehead-substituted bicyclic dimers with various lengths of alkyl side chain (Fig. 2). Cyclic dimer lactams (16–20) with linkers of different lengths were synthesized as racemic mixtures (for details, see Supplementary Methods). The RCM reactions of 1–5, which are Boc-protected open-chain model dimers with alkenyl side chains of various lengths, were performed using the Grubbs I catalyst to afford stapled olefin products 6–10 as mixtures of E -olefins and Z -olefins in good yields (Supplementary Fig. 18). Hydrogenation of the alkenes gave N-Boc saturated compounds 11–15, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 18). Some of the structures were confirmed by means of X-ray crystallographic analyses (see below).

### Photoinduced site-selective alkenylation of alkanes and aldehydes with aryl alkenes [^36657386]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Substrate scope

With the optimized conditions in hand, we set out to examine the scope and site-selectivity of this C-H alkenylation (Fig. 3). Throughout these studies, the C–H substrate was used as the limiting reagent. A wide range of alkanes were smoothly alkenylated in moderate to good yields with exclusive E selectivity (11 – 32). Cyclic alkanes with ring sizes ranging from 5 to 12 gave alkenylated products 11 – 15 in good yields (54–78%). The alkenylation reaction was amenable to scale-up, delivering alkene 16 in 71% yield on a 5.0-mmol scale. Interestingly, this dual-catalytic system exhibits a strong preference for the functionalization of sterically accessible and electron-rich C-H sites. For instance, the secondary C–H bonds in norbornane (16), 1,4-epoxycyclohexane (17) and trans -1,4-dimethylcyclohexane (18) were selectively alkenylated, while the sterically hindered tertiary C–H bonds were not reactive despite their relatively lower bond dissociation energies (BDEs). Primary C–H bonds, owing to their high BDEs, were barely functionalized in the presence of secondary C–H bonds (18 – 19). The steric preference of this transformation is also illustrated by the regiospecific alkenylation of 1-methylcyclopentanol (19) at the remote methylene site. Similarly, the least hindered and most electron-rich methylene site of azaspirodecanedione (20) was selectively alkenylated. The reaction of adamantane (21) furnished two regioisomers (1.3:1) in 82% yield, while the reaction of adamantane derivatives bearing electron-withdrawing groups (22 – 24) occurred predominantly at the tertiary sites. This unique selectivity observed among adamantane derivatives probably originated from the steric accessibility of the tertiary C–H bond due to its equatorial characterand the remarkably long life-time of 1-adamantyl radicals compared to 2-adamantyl radicals. For linear alkanes, pentane (25, α:β:γ 1.1:4.2:1) and hexane (26, α:β:γ 1:3.7:1.7) were preferentially functionalized at the internal secondary positions. Hexamethyldisilane, which possesses one of the strongest C sp3 -H bonds (BDE = 101.3 kcal/mol, see Supplementary Discussion), underwent alkenylation to afford product 27 in 50% yield. Activated C sp3 –H bonds were also examined. Ethers (28 – 30), amides (31) and alkylbenzenes (32) were all found to be competent substrates (38–67%). Notably, substituted tetrahydropyrans afforded alkenylation products (29 and 30) with excellent regio- and diastereoselectivity.

### Orthogonal ring-closing alkyne and olefin metathesis for the synthesis of small GTPase-targeting bicyclic peptides [^d086f35f]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Molybdenum-catalysed ring-closing alkyne metathesis(RCAM) shares many of the advantageous properties of RCM, and is in principle chemically orthogonal to ruthenium-catalysed RCM. RCAM has been applied for peptide macrocyclizations in solution. However, the synthesis of bicyclic peptides by orthogonal ring-closing olefin and alkyne metathesis has not been explored so far. Here, we report the solid-phase synthesis of bicyclic peptides by means of orthogonal ring-closing olefin- and alkyne-metathesis reactions. We demonstrate that the alkyne macrocycle can be further functionalized selectively. The orthogonal RCM/RCAM system was successfully used to evolve a monocyclic peptide inhibitor of the small GTPase Rab8 into a bicyclic ligand with increased target affinity.

General procedure for nitrogen-atom-rich tricyclics

General conditions a (4a - 5j, 5s - 6x, 7c - 7h): The reactions did not require the protection of inert gases. In a 35 mL sealed tube were added arylmethyl ketones 1 (1.2 mmol), iodine (254 mg, 1.0 mmol), and dimethyl sulfoxide (5 mL), and the resulting mixture was stirred at 100 °C (heating block), the reaction tube was removed after about 1 h. Then additional enamines 2 (1.0 mmol), 5-hydroxypyrazoles 3 (1.0 mmol), and DTBP (292 mg, 2.0 mmol) were added at room temperature, followed by reaction at 100 °C for 4 h until substrate conversion was almost complete by TLC analysis. After the reaction stopped and cooled at room temperature, the reaction mixture was quenched with saturated Na 2 S 2 O 3 solution (50 mL) and NaCl solution (200 mL). The mixture was then extracted with EtOAc (150 mL × 2), and the organic layers were separated and merged. The mixture was dried with anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (200–300 mesh) to afford the product.

### Regio-and enantioselective synthesis of acyclic quaternary carbons via organocatalytic addition of organoborates to (Z)-enediketones [^82ce20ee]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To demonstrate the utility of these quaternary 1,4-diketone products –,, examples were transformed into key synthetic building blocks (Fig. 8). Chiral cyclopentenones (see 8), which exist widely in bioactive compounds –, could be formed in high yield and er via aldol condensation. The absolute stereochemistry of 9 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Chemoselective hydrogenation reduced the benzoyl carbonyl and the alkene of 3a or 3q to form the aliphatic quaternary carbon centers in 10a and 10q, respectively, with the latter containing an otherwise difficult to access alkylated quaternary center with high er. The oxidative cleavage of the styrenyl olefin gave ketoaldehyde 11, which would be useful in recently reported pyrrolidine syntheses,. Non-planar heterocycle dihydropyridazine 12, a bioactive pharmacophore,, could be generated in good yield. Using the bromo substrate 3e to incorporate an intramolecular Heck coupling reaction gave the quinone-like derivative 12.

Fig. 8 
Utility of quaternary diketone products.

The chemical synthesis of several important molecular motifs is illustrated. Examples include α-quaternary cyclopentenes (9), quaternary alkanes that are achiral (10a) or chiral and enantioenriched (10q), tricarbonyls (11), dihydropyridazines (12), and methide-quinones (13).

In conclusion, we successfully synthesized challenging quaternary centers enantioselectively from (Z)-1,4-enediketones via organocatalyzed conjugate addition. Control experiments showed that the cis-relationship of the ketones was vital to reactivity, and keto-ene bond rotation at the location of C–C bond formation was important for enantioselectivity. DFT calculations showed that the additional ketone provided 5-exo-trig reactivity and a stabilizing interaction through an n→π*cyclic ouroboros activation. The regioselectivity for quaternary carbon formation appeared to be based primarily on the greater HOMO/LUMO overlap in the formation of the quaternary carbon relative to the tertiary carbon. A broad substrate scope of chiral α-quaternary 1,4-diketones were synthesized. Further transformations to quaternary carbon-containing enantio-enriched cyclopentenones, linear hydrocarbons, dihydropyridazines, and quinone methides were demonstrated in good yield and er.

### Synthesis of meta-substituted arene bioisosteres from [ 3.1.1 ] propellane [^c95b5d56]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Small-ring cage hydrocarbons are popular bioisosteres (molecular replacements) for commonly found para-substituted benzene rings in drug design 1 . The utility of these cage structures derives from their superior pharmacokinetic properties compared with their parent aromatics, including improved solubility and reduced susceptibility to metabolism 2,3 . A prime example is the bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane motif, which is mainly synthesized by ring-opening of the interbridgehead bond of the strained hydrocarbon [1.1.1]propellane with radicals or anions 4 . By contrast, scaffolds mimicking meta-substituted arenes are lacking because of the challenge of synthesizing saturated isosteres that accurately reproduce substituent vectors 5 . Here we show that bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (BCHeps), which are hydrocarbons for which the bridgehead substituents map precisely onto the geometry of meta-substituted benzenes, can be conveniently accessed from [3.1.1]propellane. We found that [3.1.1]propellane can be synthesized on a multigram scale, and readily undergoes a range of radical-based transformations to generate medicinally relevant carbon- and heteroatom-substituted BCHeps, including pharmaceutical analogues. Comparison of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties of these analogues reveals enhanced metabolic stability relative to their parent arene-containing drugs, validating the potential of this meta-arene analogue as an sp 3 -rich motif in drug design. Collectively, our results show that BCHeps can be prepared on useful scales using a variety of methods, offering a new surrogate for meta-substituted benzene rings for implementation in drug discovery programmes.

### Synthesis of dienes from pyrrolidines using skeletal modification [^cd7cab0c]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Mechanism studies

In order to investigate the reaction mechanism, several intermolecular radical trapping experiments were conducted (Fig. 5a). It was observed that the addition of three equivalents of radical trapping reagent TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy), BHT (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol), 1,1-diphenylethylene, or 9,10-dihydroanthracene had no significant effect on the reactions of 28a or 29a. The high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis indicated the potential existence of trapping products 28b’ and 29b’, both of which contain two TMPO units. The reaction of 2-phenyl pyrrolidine 46b under standard conditions was carried out with the use of diethyl fumarate to capture the intermediates. The HRMS analysis suggests that the formation of deamino cyclic product 46b’ is possible. N-Aminopyrrolidine (45a’) was prepared to gain further insight into the reaction mechanism. The reaction of 45a’ under different oxidative conditions, which are known to oxidize 1,1-disubstituted hydrazines to the corresponding isodiazene intermediates –, failed to lead to the formation of the diene (45b) or cyclobutane (45c), judging by GCMS analysis (Fig. 5b). This demonstrates the advantages of our non-oxidative conditions. To further probe the mechanism, pyrrolidine (47a), bearing a cyclopropyl unit, was designed and synthesized. Its N-removal and deconstruction product (47b) was isolated in 89% yield, and no other detectable geometrical isomers were observed in the 1 H NMR spectrum of the crude reaction mixture (Fig. 5c, see details and crude 1 H NMR in SI). As depicted in Fig. 5d (see details and crude 1 H NMR spectrum in SI), the reaction chemoselectivity is associated with the C 3 –C 4 bond in the pyrrolidine substrate. When this C 3 –C 4 bond is part of a cyclopropane or cyclobutane ring, only N-removal and deconstruction products (26b, 27b) were observed, suggesting that the released energy from the strained 3- or 4-membered ring opening processes may be responsible. Despite the decreased bent bond character of the C 3 –C 4 bond in the cyclopentane ring, no notable decrease in stereospecificity or chemoselectivity was observed. A small amount of a cyclobutane product (40c) was observed, but N-removal and deconstruction products (36b, 40b) predominated. Comparatively, the N-deletion reaction became the major reaction pathway when the C 3 -C 4 bond was part of a cyclohexane fragment (29b vs 29c, Fig. 5a). The reaction of 2-phenyl pyrrolidine 46a led to the generation of both the deconstruction product styrene 46b and N-deletion cyclobutane 46c, judging by GCMS and 1 H NMR analysis (Fig. 1d). These results suggest that the bent bond character of the reacting C 3 -C 4 bond could significantly influence the chemoselectivity of reactions in which the N-removal and deconstruction process is dominant in most cases. Based on previous studies –,–, a mechanism is proposed and is shown in Fig. 5e. Pyrrolidine reacts with N 3 SO 2 N 3 to form a sulfamoyl azide, which undergoes a Curtius-type rearrangement to generate an isodiazene intermediate. Its decomposition results in the formation primarily of a singlet 1,4-biradical intermediate. When the reacting C 3 –C 4 bond is bent even slightly, rapid cleavage of C 3 −C 4 bond occurs (path i), affording the dienes with excellent stereoselectivity and chemoselectivity. When the back bond is part of a cyclohexane, the N-atom deletion product was achieved via an intramolecular radical coupling reaction (path ii). However, a synergetic cycloreversion of isodiazene, a reaction in which three π bonds are formed and three σ bonds are consumed (path iii), can not be excluded,.

### Synthesis of spiro quasi [ 1 ] catenanes and quasi [ 1 ] rotaxanes via a templated backfolding strategy [^a72d0c05]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

Design of the building blocks

To avoid the requirement of protective groups and to facilitate the sterically difficult macrocyclizations, robust transformations were selected, that is, transesterification/lactonizationfor the scaffolding temporal connection to the template, Cu-catalysed azide alkyne cycloaddition(CuAAC) for the first ring closure and olefin metathesisfor the second and final ring closure or introduction of the quasi-rotaxane stopper elements. For synthetic reasons and to ensure the perpendicular mutual arrangement of the two pairs of ring-precursor chains at precursor 5, we have chosen a spiro-linkage via the tetrahedral carbon atom of a 9 H -fluorene moiety (Fig. 3). The design of the temporal covalent scaffolding tether at the central precursor 5 is based on amide- N -benzylic moieties containing phenolic hydroxyl groups that will be esterified to template 6 and may be removed from the final spiro or rotaxane compounds by consecutive transesterification and protolytic cleavage of the amide benzylic linkages. As the template, 2,5-bis(pent-4-yn-1-yloxy)-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic ester 6 was chosen. The tether length in precursor 5 and template 6 gives access to spiro architectures of 27- and 31-membered rings, resulting from CuAAC and ring-closing metathesis (RCM) macrocyclizations, respectively. These ring sizes are significantly larger than the smallest accessible rotaxane ring fragment of 21 atoms and in the same range as the natural peptide rotaxanes. For mechanically locking the conformation of the 31-membered ring of the quasi[1]rotaxane by cross-metathesis, we selected tris(4-(tert -butyl)phenyl)methane-functionalized acrylamide 11 as the stopper element. For the multigram scale synthesis of the central tetrahedral precursor 5, template 6 and rotaxane stopper 11, please see the Supplementary Information.

### Controllable multiple-step configuration transformations in a thermal / photoinduced reaction [^631b3692]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Single-crystal CPs appear to be potentially powerful platforms for tracking the stereo-chemical structure of reaction intermediates. Many structural characterization techniques, especially single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD),, are available but in most cases, single crystals of CPs do not withstand the internal stress resulting from external stimuli and lose the single-crystal character required for SCXRD investigation –. Exploring the stereochemical structures of intermediates involved in a multiple-step thermal/photoinduced reaction using a single-crystal CP platform appears highly attractive but challenging.

In this work, using a single-crystal CP platform, we describe for the first time controllable configuration transformations in the course of a multiple thermal/photoinduced reaction. The diolefin ligand 4,4′-(5-fluoro-1,3-phenylene)bis-(ethene-2,1-diyl)) dipyridine (F-1,3-bpeb) is used to synthesize CP [Cd 2 (F-1,3-bpeb) 2 (3,5-DBB) 4] (CP1, 3,5-HDBB = 3,5-dibromobenzoic acid). Two diene isomers, 4,4′-(3,4-bis(3-fluoro-5-(2-(pyridin-4-yl)vinyl)phenyl)cyclobutane-1,2-diyl)dipyridine (1 and 1′), and two isomeric metacyclophanes, syn-3,4,12,13-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)-8,17-bisfluoro-1,2,9,10-diethano[2.2]metacyclophane (2α and 2β), are obtained after photoirradiation and/or thermal treatment of the F-1,3-bpeb pairs in single-crystal CP1 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, the original configuration of the monomer in the initial CP1 is altered at different temperatures during the thermal/photoinduced reaction process. As shown in Fig. 1, the synthesis of CP1-2α from CP1 requires a change in the configuration of three C = C double bonds of two opposite ligands in CP1, which implies going through three or more steps and isomeric intermediates. The good crystallinity of CP1 allows us to set different temperature domains to trace the changes in the configuration of the isomers in the synergistic thermal/photoinduced reactions using SCXRD and other techniques. Although the crystal used has cracks, its morphology and transparent appearance are retained in the multiple-step transformations. By investigating the stepwise changes and collecting the snapshots in a series of thermal/photoinduced reactions, the configurations of C = C groups and the reversible ring-closing/opening changes in a dicyclobutane system are revealed, which allow the use of temperature to control the whole stereochemical process. The proposed mechanism is further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

### Unlocking regioselective meta-alkylation with epoxides and oxetanes via dynamic kinetic catalyst control [^beff2c09]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Regioselective arene C-H bond alkylation is a powerful tool in synthetic chemistry, yet subject to many challenges. Herein, we report the meta-C-H bond alkylation of aromatics bearing N-directing groups using (hetero)aromatic epoxides as alkylating agents. This method results in complete regioselectivity on both the arene as well as the epoxide coupling partners, cleaving exclusively the benzylic C-O bond. Oxetanes, which are normally unreactive, also participate as alkylating reagents under the reaction conditions. Our mechanistic studies reveal an unexpected reversible epoxide ring opening process undergoing catalyst-controlled regioselection, as key for the observed high regioselectivities.

### Desymmetrization of cyclohexanes by site-and stereoselective C-H functionalization [^01f9a8e2]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds have long been considered unreactive and are inert to traditional chemical reagents, yet new methods for the transformation of these bonds are continually being developed 1-9 . However, it is challenging to achieve such transformations in a highly selective manner, especially if the C-H bonds are unactivated 10 or not adjacent to a directing group 11-13 . Catalyst-controlled site-selectivity-in which the inherent reactivities of the substrates 14 can be overcome by choosing an appropriate catalyst-is an appealing concept, and substantial effort has been made towards catalyst-controlled C-H functionalization 6,15-17 , in particular methylene C-H bond functionalization. However, although several new methods have targeted these bonds in cyclic alkanes, the selectivity has been relatively poor 18-20 . Here we illustrate an additional level of sophistication in catalyst-controlled C-H functionalization, whereby unactivated cyclohexane derivatives can be desymmetrized in a highly site- and stereoselective manner through donor/acceptor carbene insertion. These studies demonstrate the potential of catalyst-controlled site-selectivity to govern which C-H bond will react, which could enable new strategies for the production of fine chemicals.

### Highly active and efficient catalysts for alkoxycarbonylation of alkenes [^396d1849]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, tetra- and/or tri-substituted alkenes are interesting feedstocks and this bond motif is frequently found in natural products, pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals. Interestingly, for several industrial bulk processes, pure α-olefins are not available at an economically viable price. Therefore, mixtures are used including internal and branched olefins. As an illustrative example, so-called dibutene is a mixture of more >30 compounds including mainly octenes, methylheptenes, and dimethylhexenes. Notably, this feedstock is produced via dimerization of 1-butene and 2-butene on a 500,000-ton-per-annum scale. Due to the low reactivity of sterically hindered internal olefins, a significant amount of this feedstock cannot be further functionalized, which leads to unwanted waste. Hence, the development of improved catalyst systems for the carbonylation of tetra- and tri-substituted alkenes is an important and rewarding but highly challenging task.

A scarcely explored possibility to valorize such ‘inert' internal olefins would be a fast isomerization to more reactive alkenes. Unfortunately, despite the vast knowledge on isomerization reactions, such catalyst systems, which operate under mild conditions in the presence of CO, are not known. On the basis of our long-standing interest in this areaas well as the elegant works of other groups, we started to explore the development of a more efficient isomerization–carbonylation catalyst. In this regard, herein we report a rationally designed palladium catalyst, which allows for alkoxycarbonylations of both highly demanding alkenes and industrially relevant bulk olefins such as ethylene with unpreceded activity and selectivity.

### Construction of azaheterocycles via Pd-catalyzed migratory cycloannulation reaction of unactivated alkenes [^0d098c3c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Azahetereocycles constitute important structural components in many biologically active natural compounds and marketed drugs, and represent the most promising scaffolds in drug discovery. Accordingly, the development of efficient and general synthetic methods for the construction of diverse azaheterocycles is the major goal in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report the efficient construction of a wide range of azaheterocycles via a Pd-catalyzed migratory cycloannulation strategy with unactivated alkenes. This strategy enables the rapid synthesis of a series of 6-, 7- and 8-membered azaheterocycles in high efficiency, and features a broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance under redox-neutral conditions. The significance of this finding is demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of drug-like molecules with high step-economy. Preliminary mechanistic investigations reveal that this reaction underwent a sequentially migratory insertion to alkenes, metal migration process, and the aza-Michael addition to a quinone methide intermediate.

### Organocatalytic atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral styrenes [^dea83ca5]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Axially chiral compounds are widespread in biologically active compounds and are useful chiral ligands or organocatalysts in asymmetric catalysis. It is well-known that styrenes are one of the most abundant and principal feedstocks and thus represent excellent prospective building blocks for chemical synthesis. Driven by the development of atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral styrene derivatives, we discovered herein the asymmetric organocatalytic approach via direct Michael addition reaction of substituted diones/ketone esters/malononitrile to alkynals. The axially chiral styrene compounds were produced with good chemical yields, enantioselectivities and almost complete E/Z-selectivities through a secondary amine-catalysed iminium activation strategy under mild conditions. Such structural motifs are important precursors for further transformations into biologically active compounds and synthetic useful intermediates and may have potential applications in asymmetric synthesis as olefin ligands or organocatalysts.

### Divergent synthesis of chiral cyclic azides via asymmetric cycloaddition reactions of vinyl azides [^c6bbaa0f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Vinyl azides bearing azide and alkene functional groups conjugated together, could be easily obtained by the reaction of silver-catalzyed hydroazidation of terminal alkynes, and have been recognized as versatile building blocks in organic synthesis,–. Generally, vinyl azides undergo a fast release of two nitrogens to generate vinyl nitrene or strained 2 H -aziridine intermediates, and subsequent cycloaddition or radical addition reactions lead to structurally diverse N -heterocycles – (Fig. 1a). Vinyl azides can also react with electrophiles to form iminium ions, or undergo Schmidt-type rearrangements driven by loss of a dinitrogen unit to afford functionalized amides. In this general denitrogenation reactivity mode, vinyl azides act as an important three-atom synthon in the construction of complex N -heterocyclic skeletons and have been extensively studied in recent years. Although keeping the conjugated azide moiety intact in organic transformations is a challenge, such reactions can afford valuable organic azides which are highly desirable. For instance, in 2017, López et al. developed a copper(I)-catalyzed [3+2]-cycloaddition of vinyl azides, with unsaturated carbene precursors, to produce azidocyclopentenes. However, this reaction requires 50 mol% of catalyst loading and only racemic reactions were reported. Consequently, the development of an efficient catalytic asymmetric cycloaddition reaction of vinyl azides to produce chiral azides is important. We report here the copper(II)-catalyzed asymmetric [4+2]-cycloaddition of vinyl azides with unsaturated ketone esters (1) to build chiral cyclic azides (Fig. 1b). More importantly, structurally diverse cyclic azides were obtained through a substrate reactivity-guided inverse-electron-demand hetero-Diels–Alder or Diels–Alder reactions. The Diels–Alder reaction produces a very important decalin motif, which is an omnipresent structural unit in a wide range of natural products, with various significant biological activities (Fig. 1c) –. Many important natural sesquiterpenoids and diterpenoids are isoprenoid decalins, for example, cadinene and cyperone are components of important essential oils from plants, and the natural indole sesquiterpenes pentacyclindoleand 5-epi-nakijinol Ehave important antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities. Generally, such decalin scaffolds are built by a long linear stepwise construction of a chiral triene structure, followed by an intramolecular DA reaction,. The intermolecular catalytic asymmetric Diels–Alder reaction not reported to date is a more effective synthetic route to access this scaffold.

### Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of meta benzene isosteres [^53a8ba8c]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Although aromatic rings are common elements in pharmaceutically active compounds, the presence of these motifs brings several liabilities with respect to the developability of a drug 1 . Nonoptimal potency, metabolic stability, solubility and lipophilicity in pharmaceutical compounds can be improved by replacing aromatic rings with non-aromatic isosteric motifs 2 . Moreover, whereas aromatic rings are planar and lack three-dimensionality, the binding pockets of most pharmaceutical targets are chiral. Thus, the stereochemical configuration of the isosteric replacements may offer an added opportunity to improve the affinity of derived ligands for target receptors. A notable impediment to this approach is the lack of simple and scalable catalytic enantioselective syntheses of candidate isosteres from readily available precursors. Here we present a previously unknown palladium-catalysed reaction that converts hydrocarbon-derived precursors to chiral boron-containing nortricyclanes and we show that the shape of these nortricyclanes makes them plausible isosteres for meta disubstituted aromatic rings. With chiral catalysts, the Pd-catalysed reaction can be accomplished in an enantioselective fashion and subsequent transformation of the boron group provides access to a broad array of structures. We also show that the incorporation of nortricyclanes into pharmaceutical motifs can result in improved biophysical properties along with stereochemistry-dependent activity. We anticipate that these features, coupled with the simple, inexpensive synthesis of the functionalized nortricyclane scaffold, will render this platform a useful foundation for the assembly of new biologically active agents.

### 1, 3-difunctionalization of [ 1.1.1 ] propellane through iron-hydride catalyzed hydropyridylation [^9d529db0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Current methodologies for the functionalization of [1.1.1]propellane primarily focus on achieving 1, 3-difunctionalized bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane or ring-opened cyclobutane moiety. Herein, we report an innovative approach for the 1, 3-difunctionalization of [1.1.1]propellane, enabling access to a diverse range of highly functionalized cyclobutanes via nucleophilic attack followed by ring opening and iron-hydride hydrogen atom transfer. To enable this method, we developed an efficient iron-catalyzed hydropyridylation of various alkenes for C-H alkylation of pyridines at the C4 position, eliminating the need for stoichiometric quantities of oxidants or reductants. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the resulting N-centered radical serves as an effective oxidizing agent, facilitating single-electron transfer oxidation of the reduced iron catalyst. This process efficiently sustains the catalytic cycle, offering significant advantages for substrates with oxidatively sensitive functionalities that are generally incompatible with alternative approaches. The strategy presented herein is not only mechanistically compelling but also demonstrates broad versatility, highlighting its potential for late-stage functionalization.

### Processive ring-opening metathesis polymerization of low ring strain cycloalkenes via molecularly confined catalyst [^e3144470]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The aperture-opening encapsulation was performed by first incubating the catalysts and the MOFs in acetonitrile at room temperature for 72 hours for HG2 or 24 hours for G3, before the solvent was switched to dichloromethane to keep the apertures closed. Furthermore, alternating dichloromethane wash and short sonication cycles were repeated six times to remove physically adsorbed catalysts on the exterior of the MOFs. 1 H NMR spectroscopy confirmed that HG2 and G3 remained stable under the encapsulation and washing conditions (Fig. S 3). Notably, excessive 3-bromopyridine (5 equiv. to G3) was necessary to prevent G3 from decomposition during encapsulation. The crystallinity, morphology, size, and porosity of both UiO-66 and UiO-67 before and after the encapsulation procedure remain largely unchanged, evidenced by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis (Figs. S 4 – 7 and Table S1). The ruthenium loading after encapsulation for four different encapsulated catalysts, namely HG2@UiO-66, HG2@UiO-67, G3@UiO-66, and G3@UiO-67, was determined by ICP-OES to be 0.020 ~ 0.10 wt% (Fig. 2b). UiO-67 with larger cages were found to encapsulate ~40% more of both Ru-based catalysts than UiO-66. The catalytic activities of the encapsulated catalysts were evaluated using a ring-closing metathesis (RCM) reaction of diallyl ether (1) (Fig. 2b and Table S2). Under the same catalyst loading, HG2@UiO-67 and G3@UiO-67 showed markedly higher turnover frequency (TOF) in the RCM reaction than HG2@UiO-66 and G3@UiO-66, suggesting the larger cage of UiO-67 enabled better mass transport and provided adequate space for the encapsulated catalyst to interact with the substrate.

### A modular synthesis of tetracyclic meroterpenoid antibiotics [^9697660c]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

We began our investigations with the synthesis of stachyflin (1) which contains a rare isoindolinone subunit (Fig. 3a). As initial efforts to construct intermediate 15 according to a previously reported protocolwere low yielding and not reproducible on a large scale, we set out to develop a more robust route. Our synthesis begins with a solvent-free Alder–Rickert reaction between the dimedone-derived bis -trimethylsilyl enol ether 10 and dimethyl 2-butynedioate (DMAD)to afford resorcinol 11 (86%). Careful monitoring of the reaction progress enables mono-methylation (Me 2 SO 4, K 2 CO 3, acetone) of 11 to furnish phenol 12 as a white crystalline solid in 73% yield. Exposure of 12 to a solution of 3,4-dimethoxybenzylamine (DMBNH 2) and trimethylaluminum (Me 3 Al) effected clean conversion to the corresponding N, N -3,4-dimethoxydibenzyl phthalamide. The subsequent formation of imide 13 was induced by heating the neat phthalamide at 210 °C under reduced pressure (1 mbar) with simultaneous removal of the liberated N, N -3,4-dimethoxydibenzyl amine. While bromination (Br 2, CH 2 Cl 2 or Br 2, AcOH) of 13 gave predominately the para -substituted phenol, exclusive formation of 14 occurred upon treatment with substoichiometric amounts of both iodine (0.6 equiv.) and periodic acid (0.2 equiv.). Treating a solution of 14 in tetrahydrofuran (1.0 M) in a sealed tube with borane tetrahydrofuran complex (3.0 equiv.) and substoichiometric quantities of sodium borohydride (0.05 equiv.) at elevated temperature (70 °C) effected regioselective reduction of the imide. This protocol was crucial to obtain the product as a single regioisomer in high yield. Protection of the free phenol as its methoxymethyl ether completed the synthesis of isoindolinone 15 (435 mg). The overall sequence to 15 proceeds in six steps and involves only crystalline intermediates, thus making it practical on a large scale.

### Σ-bond insertion reactions of two strained diradicaloids [^f9d98d03]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

The development of new synthetic methodologies is instrumental for enabling the discovery of new medicines. The methods that provide efficient access to structural alternatives for aromatic compounds (that is, saturated arene bioisosteres) have become highly coveted 1-4 . The incorporation of these bioisosteres typically leads to favourable drug-like properties and represents an emerging field of research. Here we report a new synthetic method that furnishes a coveted motif, the bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold 5,6 , using mild reaction conditions and an operationally simple protocol. The methodology proceeds through the uncommon coupling of two strained fragments: transiently generated cyclic allenes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, which possess considerable strain energies of about 30kcalmol -1 (ref. 7 ) and about 60kcalmol -1 (ref. 6 ), respectively. The reaction is thought to proceed by a σ-bond insertion through a diradical pathway. However, rather than requiring an external stimulus to generate radical species, reactivity is thought to arise as a result of innate diradical character present in each reactant. This diradicaloid character 8 , an underused parameter in reaction design, arises from the severe geometric distortions of each reactant. Our studies provide a means to access functionalized bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes of value for drug discovery, underscore how geometric distortion of reactants can be used to enable uncommon modes of reactivity and should encourage the further exploration and strategic use of diradicaloids in chemical synthesis.

### Ligand-controlled regiodivergent aminocarbonylation of cyclobutanols toward 1, 1-and 1, 2-substituted cyclobutanecarboxamides [^37f75308]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Four-membered carbocycles are among the most sought-after backbones which are commonly found in biologically active molecules. However, difficulties on their producing are existing due to its highly strained ring system. On the other hand, cyclobutanols can be straightforwardly prepared and can serves as precursors for synthesizing cyclobutane derivatives. Here we report an example of regioselective aminocarbonylation of cyclobutanols in which the cyclobutane core remained intact. The method exhibits good functional group compatibility, as well as high regio- and stereoselectivity, offering new pathways for synthesizing several pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, this strategy enables the rapid installation of cyclobutane as a conformational restricted skeleton, greatly facilitating direct access to valuable drug molecules that require conformational restriction.

### Benzene construction via organocatalytic formal [ 3 + 3 ] cycloaddition reaction [^67a114f8]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The benzene unit, in its substituted forms, is a most common scaffold in natural products, bioactive molecules and polymer materials. Nearly 80% of the 200 best selling small molecule drugs contain at least one benzene moiety. Not surprisingly, the synthesis of substituted benzenes receives constant attentions. At present, the dominant methods use pre-existing benzene framework to install substituents by using conventional functional group manipulations or transition metal-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen bond activations. These otherwise impressive approaches require multiple synthetic steps and are ineffective from both economic and environmental perspectives. Here we report an efficient method for the synthesis of substituted benzene molecules. Instead of relying on pre-existing aromatic rings, here we construct the benzene core through a carbene-catalyzed formal [3+3] reaction. Given the simplicity and high efficiency, we expect this strategy to be of wide use especially for large scale preparation of biomedicals and functional materials.

### Asymmetric dihydroboration of allenes enabled by ligand relay catalysis [^a51a9066]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The synthetic utilities of this method were then investigated. First, a gram-scale reaction of 1a was carried out to give the 1,4-diboronate product 2a’ in 1.38 g and 72% yield with 94% ee, which was used for further transformations (Fig. 3a). Initially, product 2a’ was reacted with vinyl magnesuim bromide in the presence of I 2 to afford 4-vinyl borylalkane 3 in 52% yield and 93% ee, which can go further both carbon–carbon double bond functionalization and C–B bond transformation to give more complex chiral fragments. 1,6-Diene 4 can also be formed in 57% yield with 94% ee by increasing the equivalents of vinyl magnesuim bromide and I 2. The coupling of furan with 2a’ led to the formation of 5 in 64% yield with 94% ee. The chiral diamine 6 was obtained in 52% yield and 94% ee via a Cu-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. In addition, Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of 2a’ with 6-bromo-1-benzothiophene allowed the synthesis of product 7 in good yield and excellent enantioselectivity, which can be used for downstream diversification. The synthetic utility of this method was further highlighted by the synthesis of a bioactive molecule. Starting from allene 1d, the desired chiral 1,4-diol (S)- 2d was isolated in 58% yield with 95% ee under the standard reaction conditions with (R)- L*4 as the ligand. The Ru-catalyzed oxidation of (S)- 2d provided the chiral lactone 9. Subsequent treatment of 9 with LDA followed by trapping with the electrophile m -OMeC 6 H 4 CH 2 Br gave the artigenin analog 10 in 48% yield and 95% ee (Fig. 3b).

### Total synthesis of 25 picrotoxanes by virtual library selection [^c7a6a704]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

The synthesis of a complex molecule begins from an initial design stage 1-4 in which possible routes are triaged by strategy and feasibility, on the basis of analogy to similar reactions 2,3 . However, as molecular complexity increases, predictability decreases 5 ; inevitably, even experienced chemists resort to trial and error to identify viable intermediates en route to the target molecule. We encountered such a problem in the synthesis of picrotoxane sesquiterpenes in which pattern-recognition methods anticipated success, but small variations in structure led to failure. Here, to solve this problem but avoid tedious guess-and-check experimentation, we built a virtual library of elusive late-stage intermediate analogues that were triaged by reactivity and altered the synthesis pathway. The efficiency of this method led to concise routes to 25 naturally occurring picrotoxanes. Costly density-functional-theory transition-state calculations were replaced with faster reactant parameterizations to increase scalability and, in this case, inform the mechanism. This approach can serve as an add-on search to human or computer-assisted synthesis planning applicable to high-complexity targets and/or steps with little representation in the literature or reaction databases.

### Pyrrolidine synthesis via ring contraction of pyridines [^64d024b3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A ring contraction of easily available cyclic compounds to smaller cycles that are valuable but difficult to synthetically access is one of important skeletal editing strategies. Pyrrolidine synthesis via a ring contraction of pyridines, which are abundant, cheap, and readily available bulk chemicals in chemical industry, is highly promising to accelerate drug discovery and development research due to the great demand of pyrrolidine skeletons in medicinal molecules. Herein we report a photo-promoted ring contraction of pyridines with silylborane to afford pyrrolidine derivatives bearing a 2-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hex-3-ene skeleton. The reaction demonstrates broad substrate scope with high functional group compatibility, realizing facile access to 6-silyl-2-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hex-3-ene derivatives that work as powerful synthons for the synthesis of functionalized pyrrolidines and nitrogen-containing compounds. The reaction mechanism is clarified to proceed via 2-silyl-1,2-dihydropyridine and vinylazomethine ylide as intermediates, which are connected via photochemical or thermal silyl migration.

### A concise access to bridged [ 2, 2, 1 ] bicyclic lactones with a quaternary stereocenter via stereospecific hydroformylation [^418d36ad]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

a The reaction of 1a (0.2 mmol) was performed in the presence of Rh(acac)(CO) 2 (2 mol%), L11 (4 mol%), H 2 /CO = 5/5 bar in toluene (1 mL) at 70 °C for 24 h, The reaction was cooled to room temperature and the pressure was carefully released in a well-ventilated hood, then the mixture was treated with PCC (0.5 mmol), additive (0.1 mmol) in DCM (4 mL) 25 °C for 12 h in one pot.

b Determined by HPLC analysis on a chiral stationary phase.

c Performed at 40 °C.

Under the optimal conditions, we investigated the substrate scope. All the bridged [2,2,1] bicyclic lactones were prepared in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (Fig. 4). Substrates bearing halides on the phenyl ring performed well in this transformation, giving target products with high yields and excellent ee’s (3b – 3f). The absolute configuration of 3d was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituted groups on the phenyl ring were also tolerated, furnishing 3f, 3g, 3h, 3i, 3j with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities, respectively. The yield of 3k was dropped sharply due to the ortho effect of methoxy group, but the high enantioselectivity was remained. In addition, functional groups, such as trifloromethyl, phenyl and borate (3l – 3n) on the para -position of the benzene ring were compatible, and the corresponding products were afforded with moderate to good yields and high ee’s. Replacing phenyl by a naphthyl group (3o), the reaction also proceeded smoothly, providing the desired compound with high yield and excellent ee. Notably, alkyl substituents, such as benzyl, n -hexyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl were also well tolerated in this transformation, delivering bridged [2,2,1] bicyclic lactones with excellent ee’s and high yields (3p – 3u). Cyclopent-3-en-1-ol bearing a bulky sterically hindered damantyl group also proceeded effectively, affording target product with high yield (3v). Moreover, the oxo-product 2w was produced with high diastereoselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity. Interestingly, 1-phenylcyclohept-4-en-1-ol, a challenge substrate for AHF because of the substituent far away from reaction site, which made it difficult to control the stereoselectivity, also worked very well in this transformation, delivering 6-oxabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-7-one 3x with high yield and good enantioselectivity.

### [ 2, 3 ]-sigmatropic rearrangement with [ 1.1.1 ] propellane [^b0bcb1aa]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The Doyle–Kirmse reaction, a [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of onium ylides rendered by reacting a metal carbene with allyl or propargyl compounds, is among the powerful methods for the concomitant formation of C–C and C-X bonds –. This reaction has found a plethora of applications in the preparation of complex natural products and pharmaceuticals –. Due to the broad applicability of the Doyle–Kirmse reaction, developing carbene precursors for this rearrangement, particularly with versatile functionalities, could significantly expand the potential chemical space. We envisioned that the carbenes generated by C–C bond activation of [1.1.1]propellane under metal catalysis could be exploited in the Doyle–Kirmse reaction (Fig. 1C). However, a major concern with this strategy is the formation of unwanted dimerization and polymerization products from the highly reactive metal-carbene species. This proposal not only presents a unique reactivity between methylenecyclobutyl carbenes and allyl or propargyl sulfides/selenides but also offers a mechanistically distinct method to access valuable functionalized methylenecyclobutanes (MCBs). In addition to their presence in several naturally occurring and biologically active compounds, MCBs are versatile reactive intermediates due to the presence of both the exo -methylene unit and reactive four-membered ring and thus participate in a variety of cycloadditions, difunctionalizations, ring-expansions leading to highly valuable building blocks (Fig. 1D) –. Herein, we report our success in the development of the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement with MCB carbenes under copper catalysis (Fig. 1E). A wide range of propargyl and allyl -sulfides and -selenides are well tolerated. The reaction exhibits broad scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Noteworthy, the obtained products were efficiently transformed into trisubstituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes through a photocatalyzed radical cascade cyclization. Additionally, the exo -methylene, the allyl or allenyl groups, and the sulfide moieties of the products can serve as versatile synthetic handles for further transformations. Density functional theory calculations provide insight into the reaction mechanism and suggest a Cu(I)-bound five-membered envelope transition state to give the product.

### Photo-induced intramolecular dearomative [ 5 + 4 ] cycloaddition of arenes for the construction of highly strained medium-sized-rings [^780b367f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The dearomative cycloaddition reactions of electronically unbiased arenes are more challenging than those of heteroarenes like indoles, because excitation of unbiased π-electrons required much more energy inputs –. Traditional reactions under UV conditions were synthetically less useful due to often-uncontrollable selectivity –. Notably, a series of enabling dearomative transformations of naphthalenes/benzenes have been reported, which were initiated with visible-light-induced cycloaddition with arenophiles like 4-methyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (MTAD) by Sarlah – and 1,2-dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-diones (TETRADs) by Yoshino and Matsunaga. The groups of Glorius and others achieved a series of photo-induced dearomative [2 + 2] and related cycloadditions of naphthalenes (Fig. 1c) or bicyclic (aza)arenes with alkenes or bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes –. As a further step forward to our long-term goal of catalytic dearomatizations –, we recently realized the photo-induced dearomative [5 + 4] cycloaddition of naphthalene-derived VCPs (Fig. 1d). Unlike the reaction with the indole-based starting materials, this reaction dominantly delivered the dearomatized products possessing an E -olefin moiety embedded in a nine-membered-ring (E / Z ratio up to 8.8/1). The reaction provides a unique entry into highly strained medium-sized-ring compounds and allows further increases of molecular complexity by diverse transformations of the [5 + 4] cycloadducts. Combined experimental and computational studies demonstrate the origin of this uncommon synthesis of highly strained medium-sized-ring compounds. Herein, we report the results from this study.

### Molybdenum chloride catalysts for Z-selective olefin metathesis reactions [^1da27a57]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

The development of catalyst-controlled stereoselective olefin metathesis processes has been a pivotal recent advance in chemistry. The incorporation of appropriate ligands within complexes based on molybdenum, tungsten and ruthenium has led to reactivity and selectivity levels that were previously inaccessible. Here we show that molybdenum monoaryloxide chloride complexes furnish higher-energy (Z) isomers of trifluoromethyl-substituted alkenes through cross-metathesis reactions with the commercially available, inexpensive and typically inert Z-1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluoro-2-butene. Furthermore, otherwise inefficient and non-stereoselective transformations with Z-1,2-dichloroethene and 1,2-dibromoethene can be effected with substantially improved efficiency and Z selectivity. The use of such molybdenum monoaryloxide chloride complexes enables the synthesis of representative biologically active molecules and trifluoromethyl analogues of medicinally relevant compounds. The origins of the activity and selectivity levels observed, which contradict previously proposed principles, are elucidated with the aid of density functional theory calculations.

### Efficient access to aliphatic esters by photocatalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of alkenes with alkyloxalyl chlorides [^b09ffad4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Synthesis of α,β-unsaturated esters

Late-stage carbon–hydrogen bond functionalization of pharmacologically active compounds is a remarkable strategy for the discovery of functional compounds because it avoids laborious de novo construction of analogs, increases the efficiency of structure–activity relationship investigation, and provides candidates that might have never been explored. Since β-chloro esters generated from direct alkoxycarbonylchlorination could undergo HCl elimination upon workup leading to α,β-unsaturated esters, we envisioned that this formal β-selective alkenyl C–H alkoxycarbonylation could be accomplished and quite appealing. Additionally, α,β-unsaturated esters are key components of synthetic building blocks, pharmaceuticals, and natural products –. Thus, synthesis of α,β-unsaturated esters remains an actual interesting task in the context of development of improved synthetic methodologies. As illustrated in Fig. 4, by treatment of alkenes and ethyl chlorooxoacetate 2a under the optimal conditions, followed by elimination in the presence of excess amount of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) at 25 °C for 30 min, α,β-unsaturated esters 6 were obtained with high levels of chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity. A wide range of olefins could participate in this transformation, affording the corresponding α,β-unsaturated esters. Various electron-neutral, electron-rich, and electron-poor styrenes were viable substrates (6a – 6j, 47–75% yield). 1,1-Disubstituted aryl alkenes reacted with ethyl chlorooxoacetate 2a giving rise to the corresponding tri-substituted α,β-unsaturated esters in moderate yields (6k – 6 l, 54–59% yield). Reaction of 3,4,5-trimethoxystyrene could produce the desired cinnamic ester derivative 6 m. To demonstrate the amenability of this alkoxycarbonylation process to late-stage application, bexaroteneanalog was subjected to the standard conditions and the corresponding alkoxycarbonylation product 6n was obtained in 57% yield. Additionally, unactivated alkenes could be workable as well, affording the desired products (6o and 6p) in moderate yields.

### Nineteen-step total synthesis of (+)-phorbol [^5764d7e6]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Phorbol, the flagship member of the tigliane diterpene family, has been known for over 80 years and has attracted attention from many chemists and biologists owing to its intriguing chemical structure and the medicinal potential of phorbol esters. Access to useful quantities of phorbol and related analogues has relied on isolation from natural sources and semisynthesis. Despite efforts spanning 40 years, chemical synthesis has been unable to compete with these strategies, owing to its complexity and unusual placement of oxygen atoms. Purely synthetic enantiopure phorbol has remained elusive, and biological synthesis has not led to even the simplest members of this terpene family. Recently, the chemical syntheses of eudesmanes, germacrenes, taxanes and ingenanes have all benefited from a strategy inspired by the logic of two-phase terpene biosynthesis in which powerful C-C bond constructions and C-H bond oxidations go hand in hand. Here we implement a two-phase terpene synthesis strategy to achieve enantiospecific total synthesis of (+)-phorbol in only 19 steps from the abundant monoterpene (+)-3-carene. The purpose of this synthesis route is not to displace isolation or semisynthesis as a means of generating the natural product per se, but rather to enable access to analogues containing unique placements of oxygen atoms that are otherwise inaccessible.

### Light-directed trapping of metastable intermediates in a self-assembly process [^7569bb4e]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Self-assembly, a spontaneous process that leads to formation of a functional supramolecule from building blocks, is elegantly utilized in nature for construction of a variety of complex biological structures. Chemists and material scientists have extensively investigated nature’s self-assembly principles, to devise methods to fabricate diverse biomimetic nanomaterials –. Self-assembly is a dynamic process often occurring through pathways in which kinetically favored metastable intermediates are first generated and then dissociate and reorganize to form thermodynamically more stable molecular assemblies –. Although information about the metastable intermediates can provide an important understanding of the nature of the self-assembly pathway, “trapping” of these intermediates without altering temperature, concentration, solvent/chemical composition, and morphology is difficult.

Elegant methods that utilize a ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP)and a Click chemistryto lock the structures of metastable intermediates in self-assembly pathways have been described recently. A Grubbs catalyst-promoted ROMP of norbornene-functionalized hexabenzocoronene derivatives was found to effectively trap nanocoil intermediates. A Click reaction between terminal alkyne-containing building blocks and azide cross-linkers resulted in locking of a perylene diimide (PDI) supramolecular polymer. However, these methods lack generality, because they require the use of catalysts that may interfere with the self-assembly process. In addition, a substantial amount of time (greater than several hours) is required for the catalyst-promoted ROMP or Click reaction to take place in solution. Thus, fast trapping of the metastable intermediates is difficult to achieve using these methods.

### Assembly-line synthesis of organic molecules with tailored shapes [^43a6696e]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

Molecular 'assembly lines', in which organic molecules undergo iterative processes such as chain elongation and functional group manipulation, are found in many natural systems, including polyketide biosynthesis. Here we report the creation of such an assembly line using the iterative, reagent-controlled homologation of a boronic ester. This process relies on the reactivity of α-lithioethyl tri-isopropylbenzoate, which inserts into carbon-boron bonds with exceptionally high fidelity and stereocontrol; each chain-extension step generates a new boronic ester, which is immediately ready for further homologation. We used this method to generate organic molecules that contain ten contiguous, stereochemically defined methyl groups. Several stereoisomers were synthesized and shown to adopt different shapes-helical or linear-depending on the stereochemistry of the methyl groups. This work should facilitate the rational design of molecules with predictable shapes, which could have an impact in areas of molecular sciences in which bespoke molecules are required.

### Radical asymmetric intramolecular α-cyclopropanation of aldehydes towards bicyclo [ 3.1.0 ] hexanes containing vicinal all-carbon quaternary stereocenters [^727680d8]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chiral bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes bearing one or more all-carbon quaternary stereocenters are significant structural motifs occurring in a large number of natural and unnatural compounds with important biological activities (Fig. 1 a) –. In particular, such skeletons have also been widely applied as highly useful chiral building blocks in organic synthesis because of unique chemical reactivity for fragmentation and rearrangement –. Various approaches to access these structurally unique scaffolds have been developed –, and most of them are based on the asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation of olefins with metallocarbenes as the C1 component –. Despite these significant achievements in the field of metallocarbene chemistry, reactive prefunctionalized reagents, such as diazos, sulfonyl hydrazones, and ylides, have been mostly used as the metallocarbene precursors as the C1 component in this system –. On the other hand, it is well-known that the efficient construction of chiral all-carbon quaternary stereocenter generally represents a significant and highly important task, but is among the most challenging objectives in organic synthesis due to the inherently unfavorable steric hindrance and relatively small steric differences for efficient enantiocontrol –. Noteworthy is that the efficient formation of bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane scaffolds containing two sterically congested vicinal all-carbon quaternary stereocenters with conventional metallocarbene strategies remains a formidable challenge –. To circumvent the aforementioned challenges, the invention of a catalytic enantioselective intramolecular cyclopropanation method capable of constructing structurally diverse bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane skeletons containing vicinal all-carbon quaternary stereocenters, preferably by using readily available and simple methylene group as C1 source, is highly desirable and will be of great synthetic importance.

### Ligand-controlled regiodivergent aminocarbonylation of cyclobutanols toward 1, 1-and 1, 2-substituted cyclobutanecarboxamides [^f8aece08]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In summary, we have developed a ligand-controlled regiodivergent aminocarbonylation of cyclobutanols. Ligand modulation allows for the straightforward production of a variety of desired 1,1- or 1,2-substituted cyclobutanecarboxamides with excellent regioselectivity. The protocol demonstrates wide substrate scope, high regio- and stereoselectivity, as well as outstanding performance in scale-up reactions. In addition, the rapid installation of cyclobutane offers significant advantages for pharmaceutical production and modifications. Further investigation of this procedure for preparing cyclobutene-related medicals and natural products are proceeding in our group.

### C-F bond activation enables synthesis of aryl difluoromethyl bicyclopentanes as benzophenone-type bioisosteres [^ab721beb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The replacement of a pharmaceutical core with a corresponding bioisostere scaffold has emerged as a useful strategy for modulating bioavailability and metabolic stability in the drug discovery process –. Consequently, the design of new bioisosteres has been adopted as a creative and effective manner to increase the potential for developing lead compounds and creating new drugs. Over the last few decades, one tactic that has been explored to improve metabolic stability while maintaining bioactivity is the substitution of the ketone functional group with a difluoromethylene moiety. In addition, sp 3 -hybridized small-ring cage hydrocarbons, such as bicyclo- [1.1.1]pentane (BCP), have been recognized as an attractive bioisostere for benzene rings, due to their ability to improve pharmacokinetic properties –. While each of these bioisosteres has been extensively studied as a sole functional group isostere in drug development, their merger for the synthesis of difluoromethyl BCP arene as a new surrogate of the benzoyl group and the subsequent evaluation of their pharmacokinetic properties remain largely underexplored (Fig. 1b),. Limited precedents have been reported for the synthesis of difluoromethyl BCPs, primarily relying on the use of activated precursor difluoroalkyl bromide,. For instance, the Dell’Amico group disclosed a single example of aryl difluoromethyl bicycloalkane synthesis using aryl difluoromethyl bromide as a coupling partner. However, these current methods lack generalizability across different substrate classes and have limited application to late-stage functionalization. This is because the corresponding alkyl/aryl difluoromethyl bromides are not widely accessible or cost-effective yet, which prevents their practical use by end users –. The benzophenone core is a crucial scaffold that occurs in numerous pharmaceuticals and natural products (Fig. 1a),–. Incorporating the ADB moiety as a new bioisostere would create significant opportunities to access a unique chemical space for benzophenone-type drug design. As such, new reaction designs for the rapid installation of the ADB from readily available starting materials (e.g. trifluoromethylaromatics), would be of considerable value in developing pharmaceuticals.

### Asymmetric intramolecular α-cyclopropanation of aldehydes using a donor / acceptor carbene mimetic [^7f829c38]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Enantioselective α-alkylation of carbonyl is considered as one of the most important processes for asymmetric synthesis. Common alkylation agents, that is, alkyl halides, are notorious substrates for both Lewis acids and organocatalysts. Recently, olefins emerged as a benign alkylating species via photo/radical mechanisms. However, examples of enantioselective alkylation of aldehydes/ketones are scarce and direct asymmetric dialkylation remains elusive. Here we report an intramolecular α-cyclopropanation reaction of olefinic aldehydes to form chiral cyclopropane aldehydes. We demonstrate that an α-iodo aldehyde can function as a donor/acceptor carbene equivalent, which engages in a formal [2+1] annulation with a tethered double bond. Privileged bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-type scaffolds are prepared in good optical purity using a chiral amine. The synthetic utility of the products is demonstrated by versatile transformations of the bridgehead formyl functionality. We expect the concept of using α-iodo iminium as a donor/acceptor carbene surrogate will find wide applications in chemical reaction development.

### A reagent to access methyl sulfones [^a3e5c246]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A chemical reagent to access methyl sulfones has been developed. Its reaction with various bis-nucleophiles leads to the rapid formation of previously unknown heteroaromatic methyl sulfones. Analogous strategy can also be used to construct alkyl-, CHF 2 -, CF 3 - and even bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane-containing derivatives. These compounds have been demonstrated to have a high potential for use in medicinal chemistry and coordination chemistry.

### Selective nitrogen insertion into aryl alkanes [^40dfc95f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Reaction mechanism study

To investigate the reaction mechanism, some control experiments have been designed (Fig. 4). Firstly, the source of hydrogen atoms in the product was investigated. Interestingly, when deuterated starting material (55-D 1) or deuterated water was used, the non-deuterated product could be isolated with a good yield (Fig. 4a, 1 and 2). Importantly, if NaBD 4 was employed, the deuterated product (D% = 95%) could be isolated with a 90% yield (Fig. 4a, 3). These data could well demonstrate that the new hydrogen atom in the product originated from the reductant. Further kinetic isotope studies afforded a KIE value of 5.3:1, which supports the idea that C-H bond breaking is the selectivity-determining step (Fig. 4b). Moreover, a crossover experiment using a mixture of 57 and 55 as starting materials afforded 30 and 35 as products without the generation of 58 and 31 (Fig. 4c). These results imply that the reaction mechanism of C sp 2 -C sp 3 bond cleavage and nitrogen insertion is an intramolecular reaction. To further investigate the effect of different substituents, competition experiments involving various phenyl alkanes were designed (Fig. 4d). Firstly, the reaction using an equal mixture of pentylbenzene and cyclohexylbenzene yielded 23% N-cyclohexyl-N-methylaniline with trace amounts of N-methyl-N-pentylaniline, suggesting that tertiary C-H bonds are more favorable than secondary C-H bonds in the present reaction. Secondly, the reaction using an equal mixture of isopropyl benzene and 1-isopropyl-4-methoxybenzene afforded 92% of N-isopropyl-4-methoxy-N-methylaniline with trace N-isopropyl-N-methylaniline, demonstrating that the presence of electron-donating substituents in the aromatic ring could enhance the reaction. Then, TEMPO was used to trap the radical intermediate in the reaction system. However, the data illustrated that TEMPO did not affect the reaction, which afforded 83% of 3 and recovered 87% TEMPO (Fig. 4e). This data suggested that the present transformation does not proceed through a radical reaction process. Based on the above studies, the possible reaction mechanisum has been proposed (Fig. 4f). First, carbocation 62 could be generated through the oxidation reaction between starting material 1 and DDQ or a nitrogen radical, which is produced from the reaction of DDQ and TsONHMe (Please see the Supplementary Figs 46 – 48 for more details),. Then, the reaction of the animation reagent and 62 could afford the key intermediate 63,. The following rearrangement could produce the imine intermediate 64. Then, further reduction could afford compound 3 as the final product.

### Novel chlorine-containing curcumin analogue CAK06 promotes neuroprotection and rapid antidepressant through nrf2-induced anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [^42f84f82]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Results and Discussion

Chemistry

The synthetic route for the preparation of the target compounds (CA1–CA8, and CAK01-CAK07) is shown in Fig. 1. Commercially available 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde was used as the starting material. An aldol condensation reaction was carried out with different piperidone alkylates to generate the target compounds CAK01–CAK04. Similarly, 3-chloro-4-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde, purchased from a commercial source, underwent aldol condensation with various piperidone alkylates to produce target compounds CAK05–CAK07. The syntheses of compounds CA1–CA8 can be referred to in our group's previous studies.

SAR studies for the cytoprotection of curcumin analogs

Numerous studies have revealed that MCACs exhibit higher stability and bioavailability, and that the phenolic hydroxyl group is essential for scavenging activity. The instability of CU can be traced back to the β-diketone portion of its structure, where both the β-diketone moiety and the two methoxy groups on the benzene ring are not only responsible for the molecule's pharmacological activity but are also important sites for structural modification. Our group previously synthesized a series of compounds by substituting the β-diketone side chain of CU with piperidone. Among these compounds, CA6 and CA7, which have a 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl group as the distal ring, were studied. CA7, with an N -isopropyl side chain, demonstrated stronger cytotoxicity. Compound CA8 was prepared by methoxylating the methyl group of the side chain on the bicyclic ring based on the structure of CA7. Cytotoxicity evaluations showed that CA8 was the most cytotoxic, while CA6 and CA7 had lower toxicity to cells, which may be attributed to their common structure—the 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl group.
