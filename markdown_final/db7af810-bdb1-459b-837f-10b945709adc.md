## Question

Causes of low neutrophils

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of low neutrophils (neutropenia), organized by mechanism and with practical implications for evaluation and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition and severity thresholds for neutropenia. Then, I should categorize etiologies by pathophysiology: decreased production, increased destruction, and altered distribution. Next, I will examine congenital versus acquired causes, including drugs, infections, autoimmune, hematologic malignancies, and nutritional deficiencies. After that, I should consider special entities like benign ethnic neutropenia and immune checkpoint inhibitor–related neutropenia. Finally, I will outline a pragmatic diagnostic approach and briefly note management principles that flow from the etiology, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and key reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and severity cutoffs so I don't anchor on an incorrect threshold. Neutropenia is generally defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1500/μL, with mild 1000–1500, moderate 500–999, and severe less than 500/μL; profound neutropenia is often defined as less than 100/μL in oncology contexts, and agranulocytosis refers to ANC less than 200/μL, which carries very high infection risk and mandates urgent action [^111NDrP5] [^112AFUL1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms before I organize them. The pathophysiology of neutropenia falls into three broad buckets: decreased marrow production, increased peripheral destruction or accelerated apoptosis, and altered distribution or margination; I should keep these buckets explicit because they guide both the differential and the urgency of evaluation, especially when the marrow storage pool is absent or severely reduced [^111Q1zfB] [^111ACMY7].

> I will now examine decreased production causes, starting with congenital bone marrow failure syndromes. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) reflects arrested myelopoiesis and is linked to mutations such as ELANE, HAX1, GFI1, G6PC3, VPS45, JAGN1, CSF3R, SRP54, CLPB, and WAS. G-CSF responsiveness and leukemogenic risk vary by genotype, and clonal evolution with CSF3R mutations is common in leukemic transformation, so I need to ensure genetic testing is considered early in persistent cases [^116Jmxmd] [^111fH5k6] [^114Wg4N3]. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and GATA2 deficiency also cause marrow failure with neutropenia and carry malignancy risk, reinforcing the need for longitudinal hematology follow-up and consideration of transplant in selected patients [^114Wg4N3] [^1161KPyr].

> Wait, let me verify the role of nutritional and metabolic causes in decreased production. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency impair DNA synthesis and can cause neutropenia, often alongside anemia and thrombocytopenia. Alcohol use and copper deficiency can also suppress myelopoiesis, so I should check for these when the CBC shows multilineage cytopenias or suggestive history [^1124dLtp] [^111ACMY7].

> Next, I should review acquired marrow suppression. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is a leading cause via direct myelotoxicity. Risk is regimen- and dose-intensity–dependent, and guidelines recommend G-CSF primary prophylaxis when the risk of febrile neutropenia is 20% or higher, which I should confirm against regimen-specific risk tables before deciding on prophylaxis [^112EXTsm] [^114E2tcc]. Radiation, benzene, and other toxins can similarly injure the marrow, and myelophthisis from metastatic cancer or marrow infiltration reduces production capacity, so I need to consider marrow imaging and biopsy when the smear or counts suggest infiltration or dysplasia [^111ACMY7] [^113wyn6Q].

> Let me consider increased destruction or accelerated apoptosis next. Drug-induced immune neutropenia spans idiosyncratic agranulocytosis and immune-mediated mechanisms; classic culprits include antithyroids, sulfonamides, and antipsychotics like clozapine, which requires structured ANC monitoring and interruption rules due to early high risk of severe neutropenia, so I should double-check medication exposures meticulously [^114q7AhA] [^112eXUxR]. β-lactam antibiotics, particularly when given intravenously for two or more weeks, can cause neutropenia via direct toxicity or immune mechanisms; if suspected, I should stop the agent and consider cautious rechallenge with a different side chain if absolutely necessary, with close monitoring [^113jGpmQ].

> But wait, what if the mechanism is viral rather than drug-related? Viral infections such as HIV, hepatitis viruses, EBV, CMV, and parvovirus B19 can suppress neutrophil production or trigger immune destruction; in infants with CMV, I should also consider autoimmune neutropenia as a concurrent process, since overlap has been described and can alter management [^113aBFHH] [^114jdM4M]. Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia and Felty syndrome represent clonal or autoimmune T-cell–mediated neutrophil destruction; serologies and flow cytometry can help distinguish these entities when neutropenia is chronic and unexplained [^114T5g3F].

> I need to check distribution and margination effects too. Hypersplenism and primary splenic neutropenia increase neutrophil sequestration without reducing total-body neutrophil mass; in such cases, the infection risk may be lower than the ANC suggests, so I should avoid overtreatment if there is no evidence of impaired production or destruction [^111ACMY7]. Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN), associated with the Duffy-null ACKR1 genotype, reflects altered neutrophil kinetics and is not associated with increased infection risk; importantly, patients with BEN are not at higher risk of clozapine-induced neutropenia, which affects monitoring thresholds, so I should confirm ancestry and consider genotyping when appropriate [^112JJnDa] [^112sAixa] [^112eXUxR] [^114q7AhA].

> Hold on, I should verify special iatrogenic immune etiologies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause severe, sometimes late-onset immune-related neutropenia; median onset is around 10.5 weeks, and management typically requires corticosteroids plus G-CSF, with permanent discontinuation of the ICI, so I must differentiate this from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in combined regimens [^111BkD9h] [^113YUf8f] [^112YiTwo]. Rituximab-associated late-onset neutropenia occurs weeks to months after exposure and is often self-limited; observation or a short G-CSF course is reasonable if prolonged or severe [^114Uu6Ka].

> Let me reconsider the overall categorization to ensure I haven't missed a major bucket. Congenital causes include SCN and related syndromes, cyclic neutropenia, and metabolic or ribosomopathies. Acquired causes include drugs, infections, autoimmune and LGL disease, hematologic malignancies, and nutritional deficiencies. Distribution-only causes include hypersplenism and BEN. This triad of production, destruction, and distribution remains a reliable scaffold for the differential and for prioritizing tests such as marrow exam, genetic panels, viral serologies, and autoimmunity screens [^111Q1zfB] [^116Jmxmd] [^111ACMY7].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic diagnostic approach. First, confirm the ANC on a repeat CBC with differential and examine a peripheral smear for dysplasia, blasts, or abnormal lymphocytes. Second, take a careful history of drugs, infections, family and ethnic background, and prior counts. Third, tailor labs to suspected mechanisms, including antineutrophil antibodies, viral testing, and targeted genetic panels when congenital disease is suspected. Fourth, consider bone marrow evaluation for unexplained severe, chronic, or multilineage cytopenias to distinguish marrow failure, infiltration, or dysplasia [^111Q1zfB] [^1124dLtp] [^113BcyeP].

> I should double-check management implications that flow from etiology. For febrile neutropenia, immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated, with risk stratification guiding setting of care; adding G-CSF shortens neutropenia duration and hospital stay but does not reduce mortality, so I should align its use with severity, duration, and clinical trajectory rather than use it reflexively [^114LGxCs] [^1164es3o]. For congenital neutropenia, chronic G-CSF reduces infection risk but requires surveillance for clonal evolution; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers curative potential in selected patients, particularly those with malignant transformation or unresponsive disease, so I need to involve transplant early when indicated [^114Wg4N3] [^112ch2Wg].

> In summary, low neutrophils arise from impaired production, accelerated destruction, or altered distribution. A careful synthesis of history, smear, and mechanism-focused testing distinguishes benign from serious disease and directs therapy from observation to urgent hematology referral, G-CSF, or transplant, with vigilance for infection risk that escalates as the ANC falls below 500/μL and especially below 100/μL [^111Q1zfB] [^112AFUL1] [^115eJq1A].

Low neutrophils (neutropenia) result from **impaired production** (marrow failure, chemotherapy, radiation, congenital disorders), **increased destruction** (autoimmune neutropenia, drug-induced immune neutropenia, viral infections), and **altered distribution** (splenic sequestration, benign ethnic neutropenia) [^111Q1zfB] [^111ACMY7]. Common causes include **chemotherapy**, **autoimmune disease**, **viral infections** (HIV, hepatitis, EBV, CMV), **medications** (antibiotics, antithyroids, antipsychotics), and **nutritional deficiencies** (B12, folate, copper) [^114uSzXg] [^113aBFHH] [^113jGpmQ] [^114q7AhA] [^112gi4vA]. Evaluation should include CBC with differential, peripheral smear, medication review, autoimmune and viral testing, and marrow assessment if severe or persistent [^111Q1zfB] [^111NDrP5]. Management targets the cause, with G-CSF for severe or chronic neutropenia and antibiotics for febrile neutropenia [^112ch2Wg] [^114osdpF].

## Classification of neutropenia

Neutropenia is classified by **severity** as follows:

| **Severity** | **Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)** |
|-|-|
| Mild | 1,000–1,500 cells/μL |
| Moderate | 500–999 cells/μL |
| Severe | < 500 cells/μL |

## Causes of neutropenia

Neutropenia arises from **three main mechanisms**: impaired production, increased destruction, and altered distribution [^114T5g3F].

---

### Impaired production

Impaired production results from **bone marrow failure syndromes** such as aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and severe congenital neutropenia [^113wyn6Q] [^111fH5k6]. It also follows **chemotherapy and radiation**, which suppress marrow, and from **congenital disorders** like cyclic neutropenia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and GATA2 deficiency [^114uSzXg] [^116Jmxmd]. Nutritional deficiencies — including vitamin B12, folate, and copper deficiency — also impair production [^114uSzXg].

---

### Increased destruction

Increased destruction includes **autoimmune neutropenia**, in which antibodies destroy neutrophils [^115J85E3], and **drug-induced immune neutropenia** due to agents such as antibiotics, antithyroids, and antipsychotics [^113jGpmQ] [^114q7AhA]. Viral infections — including HIV, hepatitis viruses, EBV, and CMV — can also cause immune-mediated neutrophil destruction [^113j6knz] [^114jdM4M].

---

### Altered distribution

Altered distribution includes **splenic sequestration**, in which enlarged spleens trap neutrophils, and **benign ethnic neutropenia**, a benign condition with lower baseline counts in some populations [^112JJnDa].

---

## Common causes of neutropenia

- **Chemotherapy**: Frequent cause of neutropenia in cancer patients [^112EXTsm].
- **Autoimmune diseases**: Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Felty syndrome [^111NzhxS] [^114T5g3F].
- **Viral infections**: HIV, hepatitis viruses, EBV, CMV [^notfound].
- **Medications**: Antibiotics (e.g. beta-lactams), antithyroid drugs, antipsychotics (e.g. clozapine) [^113jGpmQ] [^114q7AhA].
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin B12, folate, copper deficiency [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evaluation

Evaluation of neutropenia includes:

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**: Confirms neutropenia and severity [^111NDrP5].
- **Peripheral blood smear**: Identifies abnormal cells or infections [^111NDrP5].
- **Medication review**: Identify potential drug-induced neutropenia [^111NDrP5].
- **Autoimmune and viral testing**: ANA, anti-neutrophil antibodies, HIV, hepatitis serologies [^113aBFHH].
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: For severe, chronic, or unexplained cases [^111Q1zfB].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **cause and severity**:

- **Treat underlying cause**: Stop offending drugs, treat infections, correct nutritional deficiencies [^114uSzXg].
- **Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)**: For severe congenital neutropenia, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, or chronic autoimmune neutropenia [^112ch2Wg].
- **Antibiotic prophylaxis**: For high-risk patients with severe neutropenia [^1151HC1b].
- **Supportive care**: Infection prevention, hygiene, and patient education [^111B2Csn].

---

Low neutrophils result from impaired production, increased destruction, or altered distribution; **common causes** include chemotherapy, autoimmune disease, viral infections, medications, and nutritional deficiencies. Evaluation includes CBC, smear, medication review, and targeted testing, with management focused on the cause, G-CSF, and infection prevention.

### Colony-stimulating factors for chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia [^1164es3o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Febrile neutropenia is a frequent adverse event experienced by people with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy, and is a potentially life-threatening situation. The current treatment is supportive care plus antibiotics. Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), such as granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), are cytokines that stimulate and accelerate the production of one or more cell lines in the bone marrow. Clinical trials have addressed the question of whether the addition of a CSF to antibiotics could improve outcomes in individuals diagnosed with febrile neutropenia. However, the results of these trials are conflicting.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding G-CSF or GM-CSF to standard treatment (antibiotics) when treating chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in individuals diagnosed with cancer.

Search Methods

We conducted the search in March 2014 and covered the major electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and SCI. We contacted experts in hematology and oncology and also scanned the citations from the relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared CSF plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in adults and children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We performed meta-analysis of the selected studies using Review Manager 5 software.

Main Results

Fourteen RCTs (15 comparisons) including a total of 1553 participants addressing the role of CSF plus antibiotics in febrile neutropenia were included. Overall mortality was not improved by the use of CSF plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.16) P = 0.19; 13 RCTs; 1335 participants; low quality evidence). A similar finding was seen for infection-related mortality (HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.20) P = 0.23; 10 RCTs; 897 participants; low quality evidence). Individuals who received CSF plus antibiotics were less likely to be hospitalized for more than 10 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.65 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.95) P = 0.03; 8 RCTs; 1221 participants; low quality evidence) and had more number of participants with a more faster neutrophil recovery (RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.81) P = 0.004; 5 RCTs; 794 participants; moderate quality evidence) than those treated with antibiotics alone. Similarly, participants receiving CSF plus antibiotics had shorter duration of neutropenia (standardized mean difference (SMD) -1.70 (95% CI -2.65 to -0.76) P = 0.0004; 9 RCTs; 1135 participants; moderate quality evidence), faster recovery from fever (SMD -0.49 (95% CI -0.90 to -0.09) P value = 0.02; 9 RCTs; 966 participants; moderate quality evidence) and shorter duration of antibiotics use (SMD -1.50 (95% CI -2.83 to -0.18) P = 0.03; 3 RCTs; 457 participants; low quality evidence) compared with participants receiving antibiotics alone. We found no significant difference in the incidence of deep venous thromboembolism (RR 1.68 (95% CI 0.72 to 3.93) P = 0.23; 4 RCTs; 389 participants; low quality evidence) in individuals treated with CSF plus antibiotics compared with those treated with antibiotics alone. We found higher incidence of bone or joint pain or flu-like symptoms (RR 1.59 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.42) P = 0.03; 6 RCTs; 622 participants; low quality evidence) in individuals treated with CSF plus antibiotics compared with those treated with antibiotics alone. Overall, the methodological quality of studies was moderate to low across different outcomes. The main reasons to downgrade the quality of evidence were inconsistency across the included studies and imprecision of results.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of a CSF plus antibiotics in individuals with chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia had no effect on overall mortality, but reduced the amount of time participants spent in hospital and improved their ability to achieve neutrophil recovery. It was not clear whether CSF plus antibiotics had an effect on infection-related mortality. Participants receiving CSFs had shorter duration of neutropenia, faster recovery from fever and shorter duration of antibiotics use.

### Neutropenic fever [^116pKz2X]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Fever is a common presenting complaint among adult or pediatric patients in the emergency department setting. Although fever in healthy individuals does not necessarily indicate severe illness, fever in patients with neutropenia may herald a life-threatening infection. Therefore, prompt recognition of patients with neutropenic fever is imperative. Serious bacterial illness is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for neutropenic patients. Neutropenic fever should trigger the initiation of a rapid work-up and the administration of empiric systemic antibiotic therapy to attenuate or avoid the progression along the spectrum of sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock syndrome, and death.

### Congenital neutropenia in the era of genomics: classification, diagnosis, and natural history [^114RV9PY]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

This review focuses on the classification, diagnosis and natural history of congenital neutropenia (CN). CN encompasses a number of genetic disorders with chronic neutropenia and, for some, affecting other organ systems, such as the pancreas, central nervous system, heart, bone and skin. To date, 24 distinct genes have been associated with CN. The number of genes involved makes gene screening difficult. This can be solved by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of targeted gene panels. One of the major complications of CN is spontaneous leukaemia, which is preceded by clonal somatic evolution, and can be screened by a targeted NGS panel focused on somatic events.

### Diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making for the neutropenic patient [^111Q1zfB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Determining the cause of a low neutrophil count in a pediatric or adult patient is essential for the hematologist's clinical decision-making. Fundamental to this diagnostic process is establishing the presence or lack of a mature neutrophil storage pool, as absence places the patient at higher risk for infection and the need for supportive care measures. Many diagnostic tests, eg, a peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy, remain important tools, but greater understanding of the diversity of neutropenic disorders has added new emphasis on evaluating for immune disorders and genetic testing. In this article, a structure is provided to assess patients based on the mechanism of neutropenia and to prioritize testing based on patient age and hypothesized pathophysiology. Common medical quandaries including fever management, need for growth factor support, risk of malignant transformation, and curative options in congenital neutropenia are reviewed to guide medical decision-making in neutropenic patients.

### Congenital neutropenia syndromes [^1167cm79]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Congenital neutropenia syndromes comprise a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders. Hereditary conditions associated with low neutrophil counts are persistent and need to be differentiated from neutropenia secondary to autoimmune processes or other pathologic conditions, such as myelodysplasia or leukemia. Clinically, congenital neutropenia is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections. Recently, several novel genetic defects were described in patients with congenital neutropenia, shedding light on the pathophysiology of these rare diseases.

### Patient factors and their impact on neutropenic events: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112babP9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study has demonstrated that there are many patient-related factors that have influence on NEs. By determining the magnitude of risk of advanced age and co-morbidity, we have enhanced current guidance. However, further work is urgently needed in developing a comprehensive risk model to guide better patient management.

### Influence of neutropenia on mortality of critically ill cancer patients: results of a meta-analysis on individual data [^113PYFwi]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cancer is a leading cause of death in North America and Europe, and cancer patients are at high risk for life-threatening complications as a result of infection, toxicity of intensive treatments or targeted therapies, warranting admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Despite evidence that ICU mortality rates have declined significantly over the last two decades, and although the number and extent of comorbidities, pre-existing performance status along with organ failure have been demonstrated to be the main prognostic factors in this setting, intensivists may be reluctant to admit specific cancer patient populations such as neutropenic patients.

Although meaningful survival has been described in neutropenic patients, the prognostic impact of neutropenia remains controversial. Neutropenia remains a common side effect of cancer chemotherapy and, although transient, may lead to immune dysfunction. Clinical consequences of neutropenia are well known and include occurrence of sepsis or acute respiratory failure, worsening of respiratory status during neutropenia recovery and need for specific management. In contrast to critically ill cancer patients, neutropenia was found to be an independent risk factor of poor outcome in the general ICU population. The lack of prognostic impact in critically ill cancer patients may thus reflect an absence of statistical power or the influence of coexistent mechanisms of immune deficiency in these patients. In a previous systematic review performed on aggregated data, neutropenia was associated with an increase in relative risk of death of 10% in critically ill cancer patients. With regards to the limited number of studies reporting an adjusted impact of neutropenia, however, this preliminary study failed to demonstrate an independent impact of neutropenia on outcome.

The aim of this study was to assess influence of neutropenia on outcome of critically ill cancer patients by a meta-analysis of individual data. Secondary objectives were to assess influence of neutropenia on outcome of critically ill patients in prespecified subgroups (according to underlying tumor, period of admission, need for mechanical ventilation and use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)).

### Neutropenic sepsis is associated with distinct clinical and biological characteristics: a cohort study of severe sepsis [^115NdzNg]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of severe sepsis is increasing among hospitalized patients in the developed world, while therapeutic options beyond supportive care remain limited. Currently, sepsis is the leading cause of death in non-cardiac intensive care units (ICUs). The host response to systemic infection is heterogeneous, influenced by clinical and molecular factors, resulting in variability in the pathogenic processes of sepsis and its outcomes. Immunocompromise caused by cancer, immunodeficiency, or immunosuppressing therapy is increasingly common in ICUs and is a strong contributor to sepsis risk. Furthermore, immunocompromised states are associated with lower sepsis survival, with neutropenia being a particularly high-risk condition for critically ill patients with sepsis. As the neutrophil is believed to have a central role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and related organ dysfunction, understanding whether neutropenic patients with sepsis demonstrate distinct clinical or molecular characteristics is an important yet unanswered question.

In this single-center prospective cohort study of critically ill subjects with severe sepsis, we sought to determine if neutropenia is associated with distinct clinical and biological factors compared to patients without neutropenia, as heterogeneity in host response to infection is likely a strong determinant of sepsis risk, mortality, and potentially response to experimental therapy. To accomplish this objective, we examined clinical characteristics, outcomes, and plasma biomarker profiles among neutropenic and non-neutropenic subjects with severe sepsis. We selected plasma biomarkers, measured at ICU admission, known to be associated with sepsis outcomes, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), angiopoietin-2 (ANG2), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA). IL-6 and IL-8 are inflammatory markers most strongly associated with severity of sepsis and death. Plasma G-CSF partially regulates IL-8 and IL-6 production and is an important stimulating factor for granulocyte production. ANG2 is a marker of activated endothelium, results in increased vascular permeability, and is associated with sepsis severity, shock, organ dysfunction, and death. Plasma interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA) is an inhibitory anti-inflammatory cytokine that antagonizes the proinflammatory effects of IL-1 alpha and beta at the IL-1 receptor and has been associated with septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure. By measuring these select plasma proteins, we aimed to characterize the relative contributions of inflammatory/anti-inflammatory signaling and endothelial permeability to neutropenic sepsis. If neutropenic sepsis is associated with distinct clinical or biological variables, this knowledge should inform future tests of emerging precision medicine options in this population.

### Management of chemotherapy-associated febrile neutropenia [^114ZANrB]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Is colony-stimulating therapy needed?

Again, local guidelines should set out the indications for using G-CSF during treatment of neutropenia.

Uncomplicated, short-duration neutropenia should not need routine G-CSF support, even if the patient is febrile. However, many local policies advocate the treatment if the patient is clinically septic and/or hypotensive, expected to have neutropenia of long duration (as with certain chemotherapeutic regimens for haematological diseases), or has organ dysfunction. It is not good practice to wait and see if the patient struggles to recover from the neutropenic event; it is far better to identify those patients at greater risk and intervene early, even given the current absence of randomised data showing that this approach improves survival.

### How we evaluate and treat neutropenia in adults [^1124dLtp]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Isolated neutropenia is a common clinical problem seen by primary care physicians and hematologists. The evaluation of neutropenia is dictated by the acuity of the clinical presentation and the duration, age, and clinical status of the patient. In this review, we provide a practical approach to the evaluation of the adult patient with neutropenia, with the major focus on the evaluation of neutropenia in the outpatient setting.

### Indomethacin-associated neutropenia with subsequent Gram-negative sepsis in a preterm infant. cause or coincidence? [^111csJwG]. Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

A preterm male infant with a patent ductus arteriosus developed neutropenia during treatment with indomethacin. Afterward, the mother described her own history of indomethacin-associated neutropenia. During the recovery from the neutropenia, the infant became septic with bacteremia caused by Enterobacter cloacae. Although indomethacin-related neutropenia has been described in adults, no case in a neonate has been reported. If neutropenia occurs after indomethacin therapy in a neonate, a familial history of indomethacin-associated neutropenia should be sought and the increased risk of infection should be considered.

### Human' knockouts' of CSF3 display severe congenital neutropenia [^117BNuf4]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3) is a key factor in neutrophil production and function, and recombinant forms have been used clinically for decades to treat congenital and acquired neutropenia. Although biallelic inactivation of its receptor CSF3R is a well-established cause of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), no corresponding Mendelian disease has been ascribed to date to CSF3. Here, we describe three patients from two families each segregating a different biallelic inactivating variant in CSF3 with SCN. Complete deficiency of CSF3 as a result of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) could be demonstrated on RT-PCR using skin fibroblasts-derived RNA. The phenotype observed in this cohort mirrors that documented in mouse and zebrafish models of CSF3 deficiency. Our results suggest that CSF3 deficiency in humans causes a novel autosomal recessive form of SCN.

### Congenital cytomegalovirus and autoimmune neutropenia: cause or coincidence? [^114jdM4M]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital cytomegalovirus (CCMV) accounts for high rates of infant morbidity and mortality. Neutropenia is a common finding in CCMV infection, of which the age of presentation overlaps with autoimmune neutropenia (AIN). AIN represents one of the most common forms of chronic neutropenia in childhood.

Methods

A literature search exploring biologic associations between CCMV and AIN was conducted: PubMed (MEDLINE), Ovid and Web of Science. We further describe 2 cases of concurrent CCMV and AIN. Both cases were confirmed with the indirect granulocyte immunofluorescence test and alternative etiologies for neutropenia excluded.

Results

Our 2 patients represent confirmed cases of AIN in infants with CCMV. One patient demonstrated neutropenia while undergoing treatment with Valganciclovir, while the other was never treated. With interruption of Valganciclovir in infant A, neutrophil counts (ANC) did not improve and upon resumption of treatment ANC remained static.

Conclusions

Further studies examining a possible biologic link between CCMV and AIN are advocated for. We encourage clinicians to actively consider AIN in the differential diagnosis of all infants with CCMV presenting with neutropenia.

### Paediatric autoimmune neutropaenia [^115J85E3]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Neutropaenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 1500cells/µL and is often divided into mild (ANC: 1000 to 1500cells/µL), moderate (ANC: 500 to 1000cells/µL) and severe (ANC: > 500cells/µL) neutropaenia. Autoimmune neutropaenia is arguably one of the most clinically relevant forms of neutropaenia and is defined by an ANC of < 500cells/µL alongside the confirmed presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies. It is a rare subset of neutropaenia boasting an incidence of just 1 in 100000 infants and is thought to be caused as a result of a 'surveillance escape event' of the immune system. This case report identifies key issues in the diagnosis and monitoring of paediatric patients with recurrent neutropaenia and reviews current literature relating to its management in hospital and community settings.

### A practical approach to neutrophil disorders [^116Kjkt6]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

This review discusses disorders of altered neutrophil number and function and provide a basic framework for patient evaluation and management. The sections begin with neutropenia, neutrophilia and neutrophil dysfunction with a general screening approach to differentiate common, more benign syndromes from rare, often more serious disorders. Also included is a detailed discussion of some specific primary neutrophil syndromes at the end of each section. Focus is placed on specific disorders that are clinically common or particularly instructive.

### Neutropenia in the age of genetic testing: advances and challenges [^113BcyeP]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Identification of genetic causes of neutropenia informs precision medicine approaches to medical management and treatment. Accurate diagnosis of genetic neutropenia disorders informs treatment options, enables risk stratification, cancer surveillance, and attention to associated medical complications. The rapidly expanding genetic testing options for the evaluation of neutropenia have led to exciting advances but also new challenges. This review provides a practical guide to germline genetic testing for neutropenia.

### Idiosyncratic drug-induced agranulocytosis: possible mechanisms and management [^111wvpNT]. American Journal of Hematology (2009). Low credibility.

The incidence of drug-induced neutropenia has not changed in the western hemisphere over the last 30 years. Yet, the drug panorama has changed considerably. This implies that host factors may play an intriguing role for this idiosyncratic reaction. The knowledge as to mechanisms for the reaction has advanced with emerging understanding of neutropoiesis and immune regulation. Nonetheless, it is still remarkably difficult to pinpoint why and how a drug causes this unexpected, severe adverse event in a patient. Patient characteristics, e.g. genetics, appear to be keys for better understanding, predictions and prevention. Am. J. Hematol. 2009. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

### Impaired myelopoiesis in congenital neutropenia: insights into clonal and malignant hematopoiesis [^114Wg4N3]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

A common feature of both congenital and acquired forms of bone marrow failure is an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Indeed, the development of MDS or AML is now the major cause of mortality in patients with congenital neutropenia. Thus, there is a pressing clinical need to develop better strategies to prevent, diagnose early, and treat MDS/AML in patients with congenital neutropenia and other bone marrow failure syndromes. Here, we discuss recent data characterizing clonal hematopoiesis and progression to myeloid malignancy in congenital neutropenia, focusing on severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. We summarize recent studies showing excellent outcomes after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for many (but not all) patients with congenital neutropenia, including patients with SCN with active myeloid malignancy who underwent transplantation. Finally, we discuss how these new data inform the current clinical management of patients with congenital neutropenia.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117DZkZh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in neutropenia — no recommendation for high-risk neutropenia; low-risk patients have very small infection risk. In patients with high-risk neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 100 cells/mm3), ≥ 7 days' duration following chemotherapy), we make no recommendation for or against screening for or treatment of ASB (knowledge gap). For patients with high-risk neutropenia managed with current standards of care, it is unclear how frequently ASB occurs and how often it progresses to symptomatic UTI. Patients with low-risk neutropenia (> 100 cells/mm3, ≤ 7 days, clinically stable) have only a very small risk of infection.

### The duffy-null genotype and risk of infection [^112sAixa]. Human Molecular Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have indicated that the Duffy-null genotype causes an altered neutrophil morphology that leads to neutrophils egressing from circulating blood into tissues and thus causing neutropenia. This mechanism is thought to be clinically benign because the production and functioning of neutrophils is not reduced and so their ability to fight infection remains unchanged. It has therefore been assumed that the Duffy-null genotype does not lead to increased rates of infection despite its association with reduced neutrophil counts. However, there have only been a few studies assessing infection outcomes in small clinical cohorts (< 50 participants) of clinically diagnosed individuals with benign ethnic neutropenia, and none to date for the Duffy-null genotype.

Disparities in access to health care and treatment outcomes, including mortality, between individuals of African and European ancestries living in Europe and the United States are well documented and unrecognized benign neutropenia could add substantially to this disparity. For example, individuals of African ancestry have been shown to have poorer clinical outcomes and access to medications for which neutropenia is a barrier. Thus, establishing that the neutropenia because of the Duffy-null genotype is benign has important clinical implications across the world for many treatments such as chemotherapy, immunosuppressant therapy, organ transplantation and antipsychotics such as clozapine. To address this knowledge gap, the aim of this study is to establish whether individuals with the Duffy-null genotype have increased rates of infection in two population-based samples from different countries and age ranges; the UK Biobank and the iPSYCH Danish case-cohort study.

### Clozapine (Clozaril) [^114q7AhA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Severe Neutropenia

CLOZARIL has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/μL) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of CLOZARIL-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of CLOZARIL treatment. The mechanism by which CLOZARIL causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose dependent.

Consider a hematology consultation before initiating CLOZARIL treatment or during treatment.

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications

Prior to initiating CLOZARIL treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. CLOZARIL initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/μL. Throughout CLOZARIL treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during CLOZARIL treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia

Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing CLOZARIL-induced neutropenia.

### Isolated neutropenia as a rare but serious adverse event secondary to immune checkpoint inhibition [^112YiTwo]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

With rapid advances in the field of immuno-oncology and frequent use of newer ICI for multiple indications, we speculate that the potential for encountering unique irAEs secondary to ICI will rise. Our case adds to the growing body of evidence alluding to the unique immune adverse effect profiles of ICI. Evidence from our review establishes that ICI related neutropenia, although rare, tends to be severe, with a majority being grade-4. These immune-mediated neutropenias can lead to significant morbidity and mortality arising from infectious complications. Permanent ICI discontinuation needs to be strongly considered in almost all patients. Hence ICI related neutropenia as an irAE requires early identification with prompt interventions using immune suppression and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors to perhaps mitigate duration and thus prevent potentially fatal outcomes.

### Primary splenic neutropenia… [^111ACMY7]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Neutropenia can result from various causes, which include inhibition of granulopoiesis in the bone marrow, arrest of maturation and excessive destruction of neutrophils. It is also a common associated finding in other blood dyscrasias and in some infections and infectious diseases. Neutropenia that arises from depression of bone marrow often is associated with corresponding reduction of other elements formed in the marrow, for example, erythrocytes and platelets. This reduction occurs in the various types of aplastic anemia; in anemia secondary to roentgen and radium irradiation, to exposure to benzene and to the administration of various chemicals, such as derivatives of the benzene ring, arsphenamine, sulfonamide compounds and gold compounds, and in anemia in which the etiologic factor is unknown.

The myelophthisic anemias that accompany myeloma, osteosclerosis, Hodgkin's disease, involvement of the marrow by metastatic carcinoma or tuberculosis, leukopenic forms of leukemia and Gaucher's disease often are associated with neutropenia.

### Patient factors and their impact on neutropenic events: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112EXTsm]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Neutropenia is a well-recognised complication of chemotherapy, associated with an increased risk of infection, febrile neutropenia (FN), and as a consequence, can lead to mortality. Interventions to prevent neutropenic events (NEs) such as FN can reduce incidence and associated complications. Inventions include chemotherapy dose reductions and delays, prescribing prophylactic antibiotics and more commonly prescribing primary prophylaxis with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). This latter strategy is favoured to maintain dose intensity. Guidelines are available that recommend the use of CSFs when a risk of FN is 20% or greater. However, the start time and duration of treatment remain at the discretion of the patient's clinician.

In clinical practice, decisions on the best strategy to prevent NEs in patients treated with chemotherapy are challenging. With a diverse treatment population varying in weight, ethnicity, age, and co-morbidity, judgement has to be made on appropriate treatments and management strategies. Toxicity information from clinical trials is used to guide whether CSF prophylaxis is indicated. However, data on neutropenic complications from clinical studies may not be representative of the wider population and this has caused uncertainty in using toxicity information as a guide.

Internationally recognised guidelines reflect this doubt, advising that individual patient factors such as age, and line of treatment should additionally be considered alongside toxicity information to guide management decisions. Yet, inconsistencies exist in the reported studies for associations with factors such as increasing age and neutropenic events, where one study showed an increase in neutropenia risk and another reported a reduced risk. Additionally, there is no quantification of risk associated between factors and neutropenic events within guidelines, which is essential for clinical decision-making.

The aim of this review was to therefore investigate factors that have demonstrated influence on neutropenic episodes and synthesise their significance. There is already a recognition of the importance of the chemotherapy regimen and an additional understanding of other risk factors would enable clinicians to appropriately prescribe preventative measures.

5.1 Severe Neutropenia

VERSACLOZ has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/μL) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of VERSACLOZ-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of VERSACLOZ treatment. The mechanism by which VERSACLOZ causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose dependent.

Consider a hematology consultation before initiating VERSACLOZ treatment or during

treatment.

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications

Prior to initiating VERSACLOZ treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. VERSACLOZ initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/μL. Throughout VERSACLOZ treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during VERSACLOZ treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia

Patients with with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing VERSACLOZ-induced neutropenia.

### A review of β-lactam-associated neutropenia and implications for cross-reactivity [^113jGpmQ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the incidence, management, and current understanding of the pathophysiology of β-lactam-induced neutropenia and to critically evaluate the practicality and safety of direct substitution to an alternative β-lactam in the setting of this reaction.

Data Sources

A literature analysis using the PubMed and Ovid search engines (July 1968 to October 2020) was performed using the search terms neutropenia, leukopenia, β-lactam, nonchemotherapy, agranulocytosis, and G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The included English-language studies evaluated the incidence, mechanism, and/or management of β-lactam-induced neutropenia in pediatric or adult patients.

Data Synthesis

Drug-induced neutropenia is a well-documented adverse reaction of β-lactam antibiotics, with an incidence of approximately 10% following at least 2 weeks of intravenous therapy. However, multiple gaps in knowledge remain in the mechanism of pathophysiology and optimal management of this reaction. Both direct toxic and immune-mediated mechanisms have been implicated. Although the cornerstone of management includes cessation of the offending agent, controversy exists on the appropriateness of direct substitution or future use of an alternative β-lactam.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Given the frequency of use and superiority of β-lactams over alternative therapy for several infectious disease states, practical recommendations are needed on the management and safe use of β-lactams following β-lactam-induced neutropenia.

Conclusion

Future use of β-lactams with differing R1 side chains, particularly those from a separate class, should not be deemed contraindicated following β-lactam-induced neutropenia and may be considered when indicated, with close laboratory monitoring.

### Congenital neutropenia and rare functional phagocyte disorders in children [^1161KPyr]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Both profound neutropenia and functional phagocyte disorders render patients susceptible to recurrent, unusual, and/or life-threatening infections. Many disorders also have nonhematologic manifestations and a substantial risk of leukemogenesis. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion and interrogation of the complete blood count with differential/bone marrow examination coupled with immunologic and genetic analyses. Treatment of the quantitative neutrophil disorders depends on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, whereas management of functional phagocyte disease is reliant on antimicrobials and/or targeted therapies. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant remains the only curative option for most disorders but is not used on a routine basis.

### Management of chemotherapy-associated febrile neutropenia [^117RVbyC]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

What should be assessed initially?

The initial assessment is clinical, beginning with the patient's vital signs, including the consciousness level, respiration, circulation and temperature.

Any chemotherapy patient who is clinically septic should be regarded as a medical emergency. If the assessment is taking place in primary care, it is essential for the GP to be aware that the patient is undergoing chemotherapy, and to have a low threshold for referral to hospital. To optimise communication at this stage, many chemotherapy services give patients an information sheet, outlining details of their chemotherapy regimen, advice on the signs of febrile neutropenia and guidance on when and where patients who may need treatment should be referred.

### The pathology of bone marrow failure [^113wyn6Q]. Histopathology (2010). Low credibility.

An important indication for bone marrow investigation is the presence of bone marrow failure, which manifests itself as (pan)cytopenia. The causes of cytopenia are varied and differ considerably between childhood and adulthood. In the paediatric age group inherited bone marrow failure syndromes are important causes of bone marrow failure, but they play only a minor role in later life. This review gives a comprehensive overview of bone marrow failure disorders in children and adults. We classified the causes of bone marrow failure according to the main presenting haematological abnormality, i.e. anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia. The following red cell disorders are discussed: red cell aplasia, sideroblastic anaemia, congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia, haemolytic anaemia, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, iron deficiency anaemia, anaemia of chronic disease and megaloblastic anaemia. The neutropenias occur in the context of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), severe congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, immune-related neutropenia and non-immune neutropenia. In addition, the following causes of thrombocytopenia are discussed: congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenia with absent radii, immune-related thrombocytopenia and non-immune thrombocytopenia. Finally, we pay attention to the following pancytopenic disorders: Fanconi anaemia, dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

### Congenital and acquired neutropenia [^114T5g3F]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2004). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the pathogenesis of congenital and acquired neutropenia is rapidly evolving. New ground-breaking observations have identified the genes responsible for many of the congenital neutropenia syndromes and are also providing new insights into normal neutrophil commitment and differentiation. Acquired neutropenia remains a poorly understood syndrome, although new insights into its pathogenesis are also emerging, especially with regard to subsets of immune neutropenia. In Section I, Dr. Marshall Horwitz reviews the current understanding of the genetic basis, molecular pathology, and approaches to treatment of congenital neutropenia and cyclic hematopoiesis. Mutations in the ELA2 gene, which encodes for neutrophil elastase, cause cyclic hematopoiesis. ELA2 mutations are also the most common cause of congenital neutropenia, where their presence may equate with a more severe clinical course and higher frequency of leukemic progression. Emerging evidence indicates interrelatedness with Hermansky Pudlak syndrome and other disorders of neutrophil and platelet granules. In Section II, Dr. Nancy Berliner presents an overview of the clinical approach to the evaluation and treatment of acquired neutropenia. This includes a review of the pathogenesis of primary and secondary immune neutropenia, drug-induced neutropenia, and non-immune chronic idiopathic neutropenia of adults. Studies used to evaluate patients for potential immune neutropenia are reviewed. Management issues, especially the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), are discussed. In Section III, Dr. Thomas Loughran, Jr., reviews the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia. Possible mechanisms of neutropenia are discussed. In particular, discussion focuses on the relationship between LGL leukemia, rheumatoid disease, and Felty's syndrome, and the complex interplay of defects in neutrophil production, distribution, destruction, and apoptosis that underly the development of neutropenia in those syndromes.

### Cellular stress pathways in pediatric bone marrow failure syndromes: many roads lead to neutropenia [^113s3aFp]. Pediatric Research (2014). Low credibility.

The inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, like severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), provide unique insights into normal and impaired myelopoiesis. The inherited neutropenias are heterogeneous in both clinical presentation and genetic associations, and their causative mechanisms are not well established. SCN, for example, is a genetically heterogeneous syndrome associated with mutations of ELANE, HAX1, GFI1, WAS, G6PC3, or CSF3R. The genetic diversity in SCN, along with congenital neutropenias associated with other genetically defined bone marrow failure syndromes (e.g. SDS), suggests that various pathways may be involved in their pathogenesis. Alternatively, all may lead to a final common pathway of enhanced apoptosis. The pursuit for a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive inherited neutropenias remains at the forefront of pediatric translational and basic science investigation. Advances in our understanding of these disorders have greatly increased over the last 10 years concomitant with identification of their genetic lesions. Emerging themes include induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), defective ribosome assembly, and p53-dependent apoptosis. Additionally, defects in metabolism, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, and mislocalization have been found. When perturbed, each of these lead to an intracellular stress that triggers apoptosis in the vulnerable granulocytic precursor.

### Discerning clinicopathological features of congenital neutropenia syndromes: an approach to diagnostically challenging differential diagnoses [^116Jmxmd]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

The congenital neutropenia syndromes are rare haematological conditions defined by impaired myeloid precursor differentiation or function. Patients are prone to severe infections with high mortality rates in early life. While some patients benefit from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment, they may still face an increased risk of bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukaemia. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for improved outcomes; however, diagnosis depends on familiarity with a heterogeneous group of rare disorders that remain incompletely characterised. The clinical and pathological overlap between reactive conditions, primary and congenital neutropenias, bone marrow failure, and myelodysplastic syndromes further clouds diagnostic clarity. We review the diagnostically useful clinicopathological and morphological features of reactive causes of neutropenia and the most common primary neutropenia disorders: constitutional/benign ethnic neutropenia, chronic idiopathic neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, severe congenital neutropenia (due to mutations in ELANE, GFI1, HAX1, G6PC3, VPS45, JAGN1, CSF3R, SRP54, CLPB and WAS), GATA2 deficiency, Warts, hypogammaglobulinaemia, infections and myelokathexis syndrome, Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome, the lysosomal storage disorders with neutropenia: Chediak-Higashi, Hermansky-Pudlak, and Griscelli syndromes, Cohen, and Barth syndromes. We also detail characteristic cytogenetic and molecular factors at diagnosis and in progression to myelodysplastic syndrome/leukaemia.

### Why is my patient neutropenic? [^112gi4vA]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Neutropenia is a common reason for hematology consultations in the inpatient and outpatient settings and is defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/μL. Neutropenia varies in severity, with more profound neutropenia being associated with higher rates of infections and infection-related deaths. The causes for neutropenia are diverse and include congenital and acquired conditions (ie, autoimmune, drugs, infection, and malignancy). This article outlines the most common causes of neutropenia and discusses differential diagnoses, treatment modalities, and the mechanisms by which neutropenia occurs.

### Incidental neutropenia: an emergency medicine focused approach [^111NDrP5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500 cells/microL and may be discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic, afebrile patient.

Objective

This narrative review provides an approach to the afebrile emergency department patient with incidental neutropenia.

Discussion

Neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL, with mild neutropenia defined as an ANC ≥ 1000 to < 1500 cells/microL, moderate ≥ 500 to < 1000 cells/microL, severe < 500 cells/microL, and agranulocytosis < 200 cells/microL. Incidental or isolated neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL discovered on laboratory testing unrelated to the patient's chief complaint (e.g., chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, etc.) and not associated with fever or infectious signs and symptoms. There are a variety of etiologies, with inherited forms, dose-dependent drug-induced neutropenia, and infections the most common causes. Testing includes complete blood count with differential and peripheral smear. Management is based on the patient's hemodynamic status, presence of fever, severity of neutropenia, and the peripheral smear. Patients who are critically ill, febrile, have severe neutropenia, or have a concerning peripheral smear (schistocytes, atypical lymphocytes) should undergo hematology consultation. Those with critical illness or fever with neutropenia should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics. Patients who are afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and non-toxic appearing with mild or moderate neutropenia can likely be discharged for repeat testing in one to two weeks.

Conclusion

Understanding the approach to incidental neutropenia can improve patient care. Critically ill or febrile patients should be admitted, but select patients may be discharged.

### New monogenic disorders identify more pathways to neutropenia: from the clinic to next-generation sequencing [^114ZVGru]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Neutrophils are the most common type of leukocyte in human circulating blood and constitute one of the chief mediators for innate immunity. Defined as a reduction from a normal distribution of values, neutropenia results from a number of congenital and acquired conditions. Neutropenia may be insignificant, temporary, or associated with a chronic condition with or without a vulnerability to life-threatening infections. As an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, neutropenia may be associated with transformation to myeloid malignancy. Recognition of an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome may be delayed into adulthood. The list of monogenic neutropenia disorders is growing, heterogeneous, and bewildering. Furthermore, greater knowledge of immune-mediated and drug-related causes makes the diagnosis and management of neutropenia challenging. Recognition of syndromic presentations and especially the introduction of next-generation sequencing are improving the accuracy and expediency of diagnosis as well as their clinical management. Furthermore, identification of monogenic neutropenia disorders is shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of granulopoiesis and myeloid malignancies.

### Granulocyte transfusions for treating infections in people with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction [^113kq1HR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite modern antimicrobials and supportive therapy bacterial and fungal infections are still major complications in people with prolonged disease-related or treatment-related neutropenia. Transfusions of granulocytes have a long history of usage in clinical practice to support and treat severe infection in high-risk groups of patients with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction. However, there is considerable current variability in therapeutic granulocyte transfusion practice, and uncertainty about the beneficial effect of transfusions given as an adjunct to antibiotics on mortality. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of granulocyte transfusions compared to no granulocyte transfusions as adjuncts to antimicrobials for treating infections in people with neutropenia or disorders of neutrophil function aimed at reducing mortality and other adverse outcomes related to infection.

Search Methods

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 2). MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980) and ongoing trial databases to 11 February 2016.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing people with neutropenia or disorders of neutrophil dysfunction receiving granulocyte transfusions to treat infection with a control group receiving no granulocyte transfusions. Neonates are the subject of another Cochrane review and were excluded from this review. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, language or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We identified 10 trials that met the inclusion criteria with a total of 587 participants. We also identified another ongoing trial. These trials were conducted between 1975 and 2015. None of the studies included people with neutrophil dysfunction. The studies differed in the type of infections they included. Six studies included both children and adults, however data were not reported separately for children and adults. The two newest studies gave granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to donors; both were stopped early due to lack of recruitment. Three studies re-randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was unable to be performed. Overall the quality of the evidence was very low to low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to many of the studies being at high risk of bias, and many of the outcomes being imprecise. There may be no difference in all-cause mortality over 30 days between participants receiving therapeutic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (six studies; 321 participants; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.04; very low-quality evidence). There were no differences between the granulocyte dose subgroups (< 1 x 10(10) per day versus ≥ 1 x 10(10) per day) (test for subgroup differences P = 0.39). There was a difference in all-cause mortality between the studies based on the age of the study (published before 2000 versus published 2000 or later) (test for subgroup differences P = 0.03). There was no difference in all-cause mortality between participants receiving granulocyte transfusions and those that did not in the newest study (one study; 111 participants; RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.73, low-quality evidence). There may be a reduction in all-cause mortality in participants receiving granulocyte transfusions compared to those that did not in studies published before the year 2000 (five studies; 210 participants; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.85; low-quality evidence). There may be no difference in clinical reversal of concurrent infection between participants receiving therapeutic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (five studies; 286 participants; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19; low-quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is a difference in pulmonary serious adverse events (1 study; 24 participants; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.88; very low-quality evidence). None of the studies reported number of days on therapeutic antibiotics, number of adverse events requiring discontinuation of treatment, or quality of life. Six studies reported their funding sources and all were funded by governments or charities.

Authors' Conclusions

In people who are neutropenic due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy or a haematopoietic stem cell transplant, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether granulocyte transfusions affect all-cause mortality. To be able to detect a decrease in all-cause mortality from 35% to 30% would require a study containing at least 2748 participants (80% power, 5% significance). There is low-grade evidence that therapeutic granulocyte transfusions may not increase the number of participants with clinical resolution of an infection.

NCCN B-cell lymphomas — rituximab-related neutropenia includes late-onset neutropenia (weeks to months after last exposure) that occurs in up to 20% of patients; it can be severe, but patients usually do not present with infections and can be initially observed for spontaneous recovery. A short course of G-CSF is indicated for prolonged neutropenia, and IVIG has been anecdotally successful in patients with neutropenia that is refractory to G-CSF.

### Early discontinuation of antibiotics for febrile neutropenia versus continuation until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer [^115K8gf3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

People with cancer with febrile neutropenia are at risk of severe infections and mortality and are thus treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. However, the recommended duration of antibiotic therapy differs across guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the safety of protocol-guided discontinuation of antibiotics regardless of neutrophil count, compared to continuation of antibiotics until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer with fever and neutropenia, in terms of mortality and morbidity. To assess the emergence of resistant bacteria in people with cancer treated with short courses of antibiotic therapy compared with people with cancer treated until resolution of neutropenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS up to 1 October 2018. We searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished trials. We reviewed the references of all identified studies for additional trials and handsearched conference proceedings of international infectious diseases and oncology and haematology conferences.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a short antibiotic therapy course in which discontinuation of antibiotics was guided by protocols regardless of the neutrophil count to a long course in which antibiotics were continued until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer with febrile neutropenia. The primary outcome was 30-day or end of follow-up all-cause mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed all studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias for all included trials. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) whenever possible. For dichotomous outcomes with zero events in both arms of the trials, we conducted meta-analysis of risk differences (RDs) as well. For continuous outcomes, we extracted means with standard deviations (SD) from the studies and computed mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. If no substantial clinical heterogeneity was found, trials were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs comprising a total of 662 distinct febrile neutropenia episodes. The studies included adults and children, and had variable design and criteria for discontinuation of antibiotics in both study arms. All included studies but two were performed before the year 2000. All studies included people with cancer with fever of unknown origin and excluded people with microbiological documented infections. We found no significant difference between the short-antibiotic therapy arm and the long-antibiotic therapy arm for all-cause mortality (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.62; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.05; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to low due to imprecision and high risk of selection bias. The number of fever days was significantly lower for people in the short-antibiotic treatment arm compared to the long-antibiotic treatment arm (mean difference -0.64, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.32; I² = 30%). In all studies, total antibiotic days were fewer in the intervention arm by three to seven days compared to the long antibiotic therapy. We found no significant differences in the rates of clinical failure (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.77; very low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for clinical failure due to variable and inconsistent definitions of clinical failure across studies, possible selection bias, and wide confidence intervals. There was no significant difference in the incidence of bacteraemia occurring after randomisation (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.66; very low-certainty evidence), while the incidence of any documented infections was significantly higher in the short-antibiotic therapy arm (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.57). There was no significant difference in the incidence of invasive fungal infections (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.31) and development of antibiotic resistance (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.61). The data on hospital stay were too sparse to permit any meaningful conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

We could make no strong conclusions on the safety of antibiotic discontinuation before neutropenia resolution among people with cancer with febrile neutropenia based on the existing evidence and its low certainty. Results of microbiological outcomes favouring long antibiotic therapy may be misleading due to lower culture positivity rates under antibiotic therapy and not true differences in infection rates. Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are required that address this issue in the era of rising antibiotic resistance.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America 2002 guidelines for the use of antimicrobial agents in patients with cancer and neutropenia: salient features and comments [^1151HC1b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Infection remains the most common complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Bacterial infections predominate initially. Invasive fungal infections occur in patients with prolonged neutropenia. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended only for patients at high risk. Initial empirical therapy is based on local epidemiology and drug-susceptibility patterns. Patients at low risk can be treated as outpatients. Other patients need hospital-based, parenteral therapy. Several options are available, including combination regimens or monotherapy. Initial antimicrobial coverage against Pseudomonas species is necessary. Subsequent management depends on the nature of the febrile episode. If defervescence occurs within 3–5 days and no pathogen has been identified, the initial regimen or a suitable oral regimen can be used to complete a 7- to 10-day course. If the etiology has been established, therapy can be adjusted for optimal coverage (activity against gram-negative organisms must be maintained). If fever persists for longer than 3–5 days, assessment for a fungal infection, a resistant organism, or a new infectious focus should be conducted and empirical antifungal therapy instituted.

SCN is a heterogeneous disease that can serve as a model for the failure of myelopoiesis, and dissection of its pathogenesis has yielded important insights into the normal process of myeloid development.

### How I manage children with neutropenia [^113j6knz]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Neutropenia, usually defined as a blood neutrophil count < 1.5 × 10 9 /l, is a common medical problem for children and adults. There are many causes for neutropenia, and at each stage in life the clinical pattern of causes and consequences differs significantly. I recommend utilizing the age of the child and clinical observations for the preliminary diagnosis and primary management. In premature infants, neutropenia is quite common and contributes to the risk of sepsis with necrotizing enterocolitis. At birth and for the first few months of life, neutropenia is often attributable to isoimmune or alloimmune mechanisms and predisposes to the risk of severe bacterial infections. Thereafter when a child is discovered to have neutropenia, often associated with relatively minor symptoms, it is usually attributed to autoimmune disorder or viral infection. The congenital neutropenia syndromes are usually recognized when there are recurrent infections, the neutropenia is severe and there are congenital anomalies suggesting a genetic disorder. This review focuses on the key clinical finding and laboratory tests for diagnosis with commentaries on treatment, particularly the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to treat childhood neutropenia.

### A molecular classification of congenital neutropenia syndromes [^116SuK3j]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Current knowledge on the molecular pathogenesis of severe congenital neutropenia indicates that the clinical diagnosis includes a heterogeneous group of disorders following different patterns of inheritance. Similarly, multifaceted syndromes associated with neutropenia can be classified molecularly, which in turn allows for a better understanding of the basis of the neutropenia. Many of the neutropenia disorders can be treated with G-CSF (filgrastim) to increase the neutrophil count, thereby reducing infection morbidity and mortality. In some instances hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative treatment currently available. This review describes and classifies, on a molecular basis, both primary congenital neutropenia and multifaceted syndromes associated with neutropenia.

### Understanding chronic neutropenia: life is short [^111z3tgT]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic neutropenia are extensive, varying from haematopoietic stem cell disorders resulting in defective neutrophil production, to accelerated apoptosis of neutrophil progenitors or circulating mature neutrophils. While the knowledge concerning genetic defects associated with congenital neutropenia or bone marrow failure is increasing rapidly, the functional role and consequences of these genetic alterations is often not well understood. In addition, there is a large group of diseases, including primary immunodeficiencies and metabolic diseases, in which chronic neutropenia is one of the symptoms, while there is no clear bone marrow pathology or haematopoietic stem cell dysfunction. Altogether, these disease entities illustrate the complexity of normal neutrophil development, the functional role of the (bone marrow) microenvironment and the increased propensity to undergo apoptosis, which is typical for neutrophils. The large variety of disorders associated with chronic neutropenia makes classification almost impossible and possibly not desirable, based on the clinical phenotypes. However, a better understanding of the regulation of normal myeloid differentiation and neutrophil development is of great importance in the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained chronic neutropenia. In this review we propose insights in the pathophysiology of chronic neutropenia in the context of the functional role of key players during normal neutrophil development, neutrophil release and neutrophil survival.

### Granulocyte transfusions for preventing infections in patients with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction [^1154FFvD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Since the late 1990s there has been increasing demand for donated granulocyte transfusions to treat or prevent severe infections in patients who lack their own functional granulocytes. Other than in neonates, no systematic reviews have been performed for over 10 years relating to the efficacy of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of granulocyte transfusions compared with a control population not receiving this intervention for preventing mortality due to infection or due to any other cause in patients with neutropenia or disorders of neutrophil function.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 3, 2008, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other specialised databases up to October 2008. We also searched reference lists of articles and contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients receiving granulocyte transfusions to prevent the development of infection with a control group receiving no granulocyte transfusions. Neonates have been the subject of a recent review and were excluded. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, but this review focuses on mortality, mortality due to infection and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed potentially relevant studies for inclusion. Data were extracted by two review authors and the methodological quality was examined. Data were analysed using random and fixed effects models.

Main Results

Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. Allocation in all trials was random, with the control arm receiving no prophylactic therapy, except one trial in which the control group received specific prophylactic antibiotics. One study reported biological randomisation based upon the availability of suitably matched, related donors rather than strict randomisation. All trials were conducted over twenty years ago with one exception, a study from 2006 in which donors were pre-medicated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) resulting in significantly higher mean doses of granulocytes collected for transfusion. Different policies otherwise applied for the schedule for transfusion, method of granulocyte procurement and criteria for defining infection. Combining the results showed a relative risk (RR) for mortality of 0.94 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.71 to 1.25). Exclusion of the two trials which reported transfusion of an average number of granulocytes below 1 x 10(10) indicated a summary RR for mortality and mortality due to infection of 0.89 (CI 0.64 to 1.24) and 0.36 (0.14 to 0.96) respectively.

Implications For Clinical Practice

The controlled trials that have been identified raise the possibility that prophylactic granulocyte transfusions at a dose of at least 1 x 10(10) may reduce the risk of mortality from infection. Overall mortality was not affected. However, the majority of studies were performed decades ago, and standards of supportive care have advanced considerably. These earlier trials were also based on transfusing lower yields of collected granulocytes than currently recommended. It is difficult to recommend prophylactic granulocyte transfusions outside the setting of ongoing controlled trials, given the resource and cost implications.

Implications For Research

Larger trials are needed to establish the validity of the potential benefits raised by this review, in view of the methodological limitations, the small sample sizes and the heterogeneous definitions of infection that were encountered in the included studies.

### Severe congenital neutropenia [^111fH5k6]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Congenital neutropenia (CN) is a genetically heterogeneous bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by a maturation arrest of myelopoiesis at the level of the promyelocyte/myelocyte stage with peripheral blood absolute neutrophil counts below 0.5 x 10(9)/L. From early infancy patients who have CN suffer from bacterial infections. Leukemias occur in both the autosomal dominant and recessive subtypes of CN. The individual risk for each genetic subtype needs to be evaluated further, because the number of patients tested for the underlying genetic defect is still limited. Acquired G-CSFR (CSF3R) mutations are detected in approximately 80% of patients who had CN and who developed acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting that these mutations are involved in leukemogenesis.

### Understanding neutropenia secondary to intrinsic or iatrogenic immune dysregulation [^1173fsN6]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

As a key member of the innate and adaptive immune response, neutrophils provide insights into the hematopoietic and inflammatory manifestations of inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and the consequences of immunotherapy. The facile recognition of IEI presenting with neutropenia provides an avenue for hematologists to facilitate early diagnosis and expedite biologically rationale care. Moreover, enhancing the understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving neutropenia in IEI-decreased bone marrow reserves, diminished egress from the bone marrow, and decreased survival-offers an opportunity to further dissect the pathophysiology driving neutropenia secondary to iatrogenic immune dysregulation, eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1113KxCD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Febrile neutropenia definitions and risk context — skin and soft tissue infection burden and MASCC-based risk groups are outlined. Neutropenia is defined as an ANC < 500 cells/μL, or a neutrophil count expected to decrease to < 500 cells/μL within 48 hours. More than 20% of patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia develop a clinically documented skin and soft tissue infection, often from hematogenous dissemination. Cancer patients with fever and neutropenia can be divided into low- and high-risk groups, and the MASCC scoring method differentiates these; high-risk patients have a MASCC score < 21, and disseminated or complex SSTIs are more likely among high-risk patients.

### Children with rare diseases of neutrophil granulocytes: from therapeutic orphans to pioneers of individualized medicine [^113ncrrJ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Neutrophil granulocytes are the most abundant immune cells in the blood yet the pathways orchestrating their differentiation and biological function remain incompletely understood. Studying (ultra-) rare patients with monogenetic defects of neutrophil granulocytes may open new horizons to understand basic principles of hematopoiesis and innate immunity. Here, recent insights into genetic factors controlling myelopoiesis and their more general role in biology will be presented in a clinical perspective. Advances in supportive care, first and foremost the use of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, has made a substantial difference for the quality of life and life expectancy of patients with congenital neutropenia (CN). Up to date, the only definitive cure can be provided by transplantation of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. The elucidation of the underlying molecular factors contributing to defective differentiation and function of neutrophil granulocytes nurtures new ideas of targeted individualized therapies.

### Management of chemotherapy-associated febrile neutropenia [^116Yv27o]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Should patients be transferred to intensive care?

If a patient with a neutropenic event is considered sufficiently ill to warrant intensive care, then the transfer is almost always appropriate. One exception might be the patient who is being treated in the palliative setting who has clear evidence of refractory disease with little possibility of effective alternative systemic therapy. However, just because a patient does not have a curable disease, intensive care should not be ruled out. Ideally, such difficult decisions will be rendered unnecessary through previous discussions with the patient about their end-of-life care and by swift, appropriate management of febrile neutropenia.

### Understanding the treatment options for neutropenia… [^114uSzXg]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Neutrophils are essential for fighting infection. Neutropenia, or low levels of neutrophils, is a common disorder usually caused by chemotherapy, adverse drug reactions or autoimmune disorders. Severe neutropenia, or agranulocytosis, is defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 500 per μL. Munshi and Montgomery used information obtained through a MEDLINE search for their review. Management and evaluation of neutropenia should depend on the severity of the neutropenia and on the presence of symptoms suggesting infection. Patients with severe neutropenia with fever or signs of infection and those with evidence of malignant disease should be hospitalized. The cause of neutropenia should be determined, potential sources of infection evaluated and antibiotic therapy started. The diagnostic evaluation includes history of prior infection, a review of prior blood counts and exploration for evidence of infection or rheumatologic conditions.

The types of neutropenia are listed in the accompanying table. Neutropenia is more likely to be acquired than congenital, with the most common cause being a drug reaction that causes direct marrow suppression or immune destruction of the neutrophil or myeloid precursors. Viral infection is another common cause of neutropenia, related to bone marrow suppression or peripheral destruction. Acute bacterial infections, notably salmonellosis, brucellosis, pertussis, tuberculosis and rickettsial infections, can cause neutropenia. Collagen vascular disease can feature neutropenia. Benign hematopoietic disease, including vitamin B 12 and folate deficiencies, can cause neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Malignant hematopoietic diseases such as leukemia and multiple myeloma may cause neutropenia by suppressing normal myelopoiesis. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication.

Treatment of neutropenia may be appropriate if the condition does not resolve spontaneously or after an intervention such as discontinuation of an offending drug. In neutropenia resulting from chemotherapy or radiation, cytokines such as granulocyte colony–stimulating factor can increase the neutrophil count although their use has not been shown to substantially decrease infection mortality. Therapy should be initiated in patients who are at increased risk of infection. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may be effective in patients with bone marrow disease.

Neutropenic fever is a life-threatening condition commonly associated with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, requiring rapid diagnosis and immediate treatment. Risk stratification tools, such as the MASCC and CISNE scores, help clinicians identify high-risk patients and tailor management strategies. Future efforts should focus on integrating technological advancements, enhancing patient-centered care, and developing novel therapies to reduce recurrence and improve outcomes.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^111NzhxS]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

2025 ACR guideline for SLE — leukopenia recommends that For asymptomatic neutropenia and/or lymphopenia (absolute counts < 1,000/mcL for either) attributed to SLE, we conditionally recommend against initiating immunosuppressive treatment (glucocorticoids, conventional or biologic immunosuppressants) in the absence of other lupus disease activity; neutropenia attributed to SLE is treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) only if it is severe and associated with infection; G-CSF should be used with caution as lupus flares have been reported after treatment, and lymphopenia, which is more common than neutropenia, is usually associated with overall lupus disease activity and generally does not require specific treatment.

### Fever in immunocompromised hosts [^112E6xv3]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Fever is one of the most common reasons for the emergency department presentation of immunocompromised patients. Their differential diagnosis can be broad and includes rare or unexpected pathogens. Certain infectious causes of fever portend true emergencies; if they are not managed appropriately, rapid progression and death may ensue. This article reviews the diagnosis and management of fevers in patients immunocompromised by human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS, solid-organ and hematopoietic transplants, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, and tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors. Prompt recognition of the type of immunosuppression and delineation of possible causes of fever are critical for management of these complex patients.

### Neutropenia and antibiotics: when, what, how and why? [^114kDxTB]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Our aim is to review recent literature on antibiotic use in patients with neutropenia.

Recent Findings

Prophylactic antibiotics are associated with risks and have limited mortality benefit. While early antibiotic use in febrile neutropenia (FN) is critical, early de-escalation or discontinuation may be safe in many patients.

Summary

With an increasing understanding of potential risks and benefits of use and improved risk assessment, paradigms of antibiotic use in neutropenic patients are changing.

### Neutropenia and leukemia development: genetic risk factors and prognosis [^111sAvvx]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2019). Medium credibility.

Neutropenia is known as a clinical consequence in various genetic disorders and other neutropenia-inducing mutations (NIM) nonmalignant diseases. Leukemia development is now a major concern about the mortality of patients with congenital neutropenia. We searched the PubMed database and Google Scholar engine using English-language article (1980–2019) using the terms 'Neutropenia', 'Leukemia', 'Mutation', and 'Polymorphism'. Patients with neutropenia have leukemia-related genetic abnormalities which are noticeable as mutations and chromosome abnormalities. The presence of mutations in patients with neutropenia can affect the biological function of neutrophils and increase the likelihood of leukemia progression, which can be important in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients. NIM can play an important role in leukemia development via enhancing intracellular signaling, apoptosis inhibition, and effects on transcription factors in patients with neutropenia. Therefore, the detection of genetic risk factors can be useful in prognosis, early diagnosis, and prevention of leukemia development.

### Ethnic benign neutropenia: a phenomenon finds an explanation [^112JJnDa]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Ethnic benign neutropenia (ENP) is the most common form of neutropenia (NP) worldwide, if an absolute blood neutrophil count (ANC) of < 1.5 G/L is used as definition. In 2009, ENP was associated with a gene variation in the ACKR1/DARC gene, the same variation that also confers the Duffy-null trait. In 2017, a novel mechanism for ENP was introduced, questioning if ENP is a true neutropenic state, when the body's total neutrophil count (TBNC) is concerned. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of ENP, asking (1) How well does the peripheral blood ANC predict the TBNC? (2) Can we improve methods for assessing TBNC? (3) Will estimates of TBNC predict infection propensity and reduce the need for further, costly workup?

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1172qasr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections in cancer patients with neutropenia — assessment recommendations emphasize episode classification, tissue diagnosis, risk stratification, and extent-of-infection workup. Determine whether the current presentation of fever and neutropenia is the patient's initial episode, persistent unexplained fever after 4–7 days, or a subsequent recurrent episode (strong, low). Aggressively determine the etiology by aspiration and/or biopsy of lesions and submit material for thorough cytological/histological assessments. Risk-stratify patients: high-risk are those with anticipated prolonged (> 7 days) and profound neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 100 cells/μL) or a Multinational Association for Supportive Care (MASCC) score of < 21; low-risk are those with anticipated brief (< 7 days) neutropenia and few comorbidities (strong, low) or a MASCC score of ≥ 21 (strong, moderate). Determine the extent of infection via thorough physical examination, blood cultures, chest radiograph, and additional imaging (including chest CT) as indicated by clinical signs and symptoms (strong, low).

### Neutropenia in the febrile child [^114Mn67G]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Fever in the pediatric population is a common chief complaint presenting to the emergency department and may be one of the first indications of a life-threatening infection, especially in patients with neutropenia. Given that pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia frequently present to emergency departments for emergent care, it is critical for emergency medicine physicians and pediatricians and family physicians working in the emergency department to know the key aspects of the clinical approach to these patients. This review of the clinical evaluation and treatment of the pediatric patient presenting with fever and confirmed or suspected neutropenia will provide health care providers with the necessary tools to effectively care for this patient population.

### Epidemiology of congenital neutropenia [^111f68y7]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic investigations of congenital neutropenia aim to determine several important indicators related to the disease, such as incidence at birth, prevalence, and outcome in the population, including the rate of severe infections, leukemia, and survival. Genetic diagnosis is an important criterion for classifying patients and reliably determining the epidemiologic indicators. Patient registries were developed in the 1990s. The prevalence today is probably more than 10 cases per million inhabitants. The rate of infection and leukemia risk can now be calculated. Risk factors for leukemia seem to depend on both the genetic background and cumulative dose of granulocyte colony stimulating factor.

### Granulocyte transfusions for preventing infections in people with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction [^112ZrGg5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite modern antimicrobials and supportive therapy, bacterial and fungal infections are still major complications in people with prolonged disease-related or therapy-related neutropenia. Since the late 1990s there has been increasing demand for donated granulocyte transfusions to treat or prevent severe infections in people who lack their own functional granulocytes. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions compared with a control population not receiving this intervention for preventing all-cause mortality, mortality due to infection, and evidence of infection due to infection or due to any other cause in people with neutropenia or disorders of neutrophil function.

Search Methods

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), theTransfusion Evidence Library (from 1980) and ongoing trial databases to April 20 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing people receiving granulocyte transfusions to prevent the development of infection with a control group receiving no granulocyte transfusions. Neonates are the subject of another Cochrane review and were excluded from this review. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, but this review focuses on mortality, mortality due to infection and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Twelve trials met the inclusion criteria. One trial is still ongoing, leaving a total of 11 trials eligible involving 653 participants. These trials were conducted between 1978 and 2006 and enrolled participants from fairly comparable patient populations. None of the studies included people with neutrophil dysfunction. Ten studies included only adults, and two studies included children and adults. Ten of these studies contained separate data for each arm and were able to be critically appraised. One study re-randomised people and therefore quantitative analysis was unable to be performed. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low to low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to many of the studies being at high risk of bias, and many of the outcome estimates being imprecise. All-cause mortality was reported for nine studies (609 participants). There was no difference in all-cause mortality over 30 days between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (seven studies; 437 participants; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.36, very low-quality evidence). Mortality due to infection was reported for seven studies (398 participants). There was no difference in mortality due to infection over 30 days between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not (six studies; 286 participants; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44, very low-quality evidence). The number of people with localised or systemic bacterial or fungal infections was reported for nine studies (609 participants). There were differences between the granulocyte dose subgroups (test for subgroup differences P = 0.01). There was no difference in the number of people with infections over 30 days between people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions and those that did not in the low-dose granulocyte group (< 1.0 x 10(10) granulocytes per day) (four studies, 204 participants; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.20; very low-quality evidence). There was a decreased number of people with infections over 30 days in the people receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions in the intermediate-dose granulocyte group (1.0 x 10(10) to 4.0 x 10(10) granulocytes per day) (4 studies; 293 participants; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.63, low-quality evidence). There was a decreased number of participants with bacteraemia and fungaemia in the participants receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions (nine studies; 609 participants; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.65, low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants with localised bacterial or fungal infection in the participants receiving prophylactic granulocyte transfusions (six studies; 296 participants; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14; very low-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were only reported for participants receiving granulocyte transfusions and donors of granulocyte transfusions.

Authors' Conclusions

In people who are neutropenic due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy or a haematopoietic stem cell transplant, there is low-grade evidence that prophylactic granulocyte transfusions decrease the risk of bacteraemia or fungaemia. There is low-grade evidence that the effect of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions may be dose-dependent, a dose of at least 10 x 10(10) per day being more effective at decreasing the risk of infection. There is insufficient evidence to determine any difference in mortality rates due to infection, all-cause mortality, or serious adverse events.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to risk assessment (general principles), IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to consider regarding patients with anticipated prolonged (> 7 days duration) and profound neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count ≤ 100/mcL following cytotoxic chemotherapy) and/or significant medical comorbid conditions (including hypotension, pneumonia, new-onset abdominal pain, or neurologic changes) as high-risk patients. Admit such patients initially to the hospital for empirical therapy.

### Sepsis in immunocompromised patients without human immunodeficiency virus [^112nHp6x]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis remains among the most common complications from infectious diseases worldwide. The morbidity and mortality rates associated with sepsis range from 20% to 50%. The advances in care for patients with an immunocompromised status have been remarkable over the last 2 decades, but sepsis continues to be a major cause of death in this population Immunocompromised patients who are recipients of a solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant are living longer with a better quality of life. However, some of these patients need lifelong treatment with immunosuppressive medications to maintain their transplant status. A consequence of the need for this permanent immunosuppression is the high risk of opportunistic, community, and hospital-acquired infections, all of which can lead to sepsis. In addition, the detection of serious infections may be more challenging owing to patients' lower ability to mount the clinical symptoms that usually accompany sepsis. This article provides an update on the current knowledge of sepsis in immunocompromised patients without human immunodeficiency virus. It reviews the most pertinent causes of sepsis in this population, and addresses the specific diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in neutropenia and solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

### Outcomes for patients with severe chronic neutropenia treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [^112ch2Wg]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe chronic neutropenia (SCN), defined as blood neutrophils < 0.5 × 109/L for > 3 months, is an uncommon hematological condition associated with recurrent and severe bacterial infections. After short-term clinical trials showed the benefits of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment for SCN, SCNIR (Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry) opened to determine the long-term benefits and safety of this treatment. This report summarizes findings from more than 16 000 patient-years of prospective observations for patients with congenital and acquired SCN. We observed that adverse outcomes depend on the underlying etiology. Myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occur infrequently and largely in patients with congenital neutropenias. Having cyclic or chronic autoimmune/ idiopathic neutropenia portends a favorable prognosis. A few patients with idiopathic neutropenia evolve to develop lymphoid malignancies, but they do not appear to be at increased risk of myeloid malignancies, even with very long-term G-CSF therapy. Progression to systemic autoimmune diseases, bone marrow (BM) failure, aplastic anemia, or nonmyeloid malignancies are not expected consequences of SCN or treatment with G-CSF.

### Management of chemotherapy-associated febrile neutropenia [^114YgN6B]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Febrile neutropenia is a common and serious complication of chemotherapy, and hence it is important to have locally agreed protocols that are well publicised across primary and secondary care, and subject to regular review. Regular audit, in-depth discussion of deaths and serious morbidity associated with febrile neutropenia, and active liaison with health-care professionals in the primary and secondary care services are important to ensure that all patients with possible febrile neutropenia are assessed and treated appropriately, consistently, safely and rapidly.

### Genetics and pathophysiology of severe congenital neutropenia syndromes unrelated to neutrophil elastase [^1171KAi3]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Considerable progress has been made in recent years in understanding of the genetic basis for congenital neutropenia syndromes. With the advent of high-throughput genomic analyzing technologies, the underlying genetic causes of other congenital neutropenia syndromes are expected to be resolved in the near future. This knowledge will provide the foundation for genotype-phenotype correlations for infection susceptibility, response to therapy, and risk of malignant transformation, enabling optimal care for individual patients depending on their molecular pathophysiology. It is hoped that these investigations will enable the development of tailored molecular therapies to specifically correct the aberrant signaling cascades.
