## Question

How do you treat atrial flutter causing chest pain in the hospital?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat atrial flutter causing chest pain in the hospital. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic assessment and stability. Then, I should verify the ECG diagnosis and exclude mimics. Next, I will consider anticoagulation strategy based on duration and risk. After that, I will choose between rate control, rhythm control, and urgent synchronized cardioversion depending on stability and ischemia. Finally, I need to address precipitating causes, monitoring, and disposition planning, including ablation candidacy and follow-up anticoagulation.

> Let me first confirm the priority: assess hemodynamic stability and the presence of active ischemia, because chest pain with atrial flutter may reflect rate-related ischemia or instability that mandates urgent synchronized cardioversion rather than pharmacologic therapy. I should not delay electrical cardioversion if there is hypotension, shock, ongoing ischemia, or inadequate rate control despite therapy, and I need to ensure continuous ECG, IV access, oxygen, and sedation readiness if cardioversion is required [^112whkuL] [^1145UBy9] [^113HE5im].

> Wait, let me verify the rhythm diagnosis before committing to therapy. I should obtain a 12-lead ECG to confirm typical atrial flutter with sawtooth flutter waves and 2:1 or 3:1 AV block, and I need to check for pre-excitation or wide-complex tachycardia that would alter management. If the mechanism is uncertain, adenosine can be diagnostic to unmask flutter while rarely converting it, and I should continuously monitor during administration to distinguish transient block from true termination [^111xTC1n] [^111xstQ6].

> Next, I should review anticoagulation needs because thromboembolic risk around cardioversion mirrors atrial fibrillation. If the flutter is less than 48 hours and the patient is low risk, I can proceed without prolonged pre-cardioversion anticoagulation, but if it is 48 hours or longer, or if the duration is unknown, I should anticoagulate for 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after cardioversion or use a TEE-guided strategy if urgent cardioversion is needed. I need to calculate stroke risk using CHA₂DS₂-VASc and initiate anticoagulation accordingly, recognizing that atrial flutter carries nontrivial thromboembolic risk even without documented AF [^112AkTaH] [^115zyyay] [^114aeVia].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about rate versus rhythm control. In hemodynamically stable patients without ongoing ischemia, I should start with IV rate control using a beta-blocker or a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, while avoiding these in decompensated HFrEF. If beta-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, IV amiodarone is a reasonable alternative, and I should titrate to a target resting heart rate less than 100–110 bpm while monitoring for hypotension and bradycardia [^1177QBn3] [^112zjBxN] [^117YRA56].

> I will now examine rhythm-control options when symptoms persist despite rate control or when a rhythm strategy is preferred. Pharmacologic cardioversion with IV ibutilide or in-hospital oral dofetilide is effective for typical flutter, and synchronized direct-current cardioversion is highly effective and often first-line in the ED when a prompt return to sinus rhythm is desired. I should confirm electrolytes and QT interval before ibutilide, and I must ensure appropriate pericardioversion anticoagulation if flutter duration is 48 hours or unknown [^114EAuza] [^112AkTaH] [^1163tiwB].

> But wait, what if the patient is unstable or has rate-related ischemia despite initial therapy? In that case, I should proceed to immediate synchronized cardioversion without delay, using 200 J biphasic as a reasonable starting energy for flutter and escalating if needed, with appropriate sedation and airway support. I need to ensure pads are positioned correctly and that I am not attempting cardioversion on rhythms that break or recur spontaneously, where pacing or repeated shocks would be inappropriate [^1145UBy9] [^113HE5im] [^114EK5gJ].

> Let me consider special situations. If the patient has an implanted pacemaker or ICD, rapid atrial pacing can terminate flutter and is a useful alternative when available. If flutter is drug-induced, particularly after flecainide or propafenone, I should recognize the risk of 1:1 conduction and favor rhythm control or cautious rate control with close monitoring. And if flutter is refractory or recurrent, I should discuss early catheter ablation given its high acute success and low complication rate for typical flutter [^111gmQL9] [^113n9PNH] [^112V5HeA].

> I should double-check for precipitating factors and complications. I need to check electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, thyroid status, and screen for infection or hypoxia, and I should evaluate for ischemia with troponins and serial ECGs when chest pain is present, because atrial flutter can unmask or precipitate coronary ischemia. If ischemia is suspected, I should manage per ACS protocols alongside arrhythmia therapy [^115TCGPH] [^114JU1hu].

> Next, I should review disposition and follow-up. If the patient converts and remains stable, I can discharge with appropriate anticoagulation, rate-control medication, and clear return precautions, ensuring anticoagulation is continued for at least 4 weeks after cardioversion if flutter duration was 48 hours or unknown. If flutter persists or recurs, I should arrange cardiology follow-up and consider referral for ablation, and I need to ensure INR follow-up if warfarin is used and plan for outpatient rhythm monitoring to detect silent AF [^114srEj8] [^112NKrMi] [^112ARwGv].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: stabilize and exclude instability, confirm flutter on ECG, stratify thromboembolic risk and anticoagulate appropriately, choose rate control for stable patients and rhythm control or urgent cardioversion for unstable patients or those with ongoing ischemia, address precipitating causes, and plan disposition with ablation candidacy and anticoagulation follow-up. I should verify each step against guidelines and adjust for patient-specific factors to minimize complications and recurrence [^112whkuL] [^115zyyay] [^114EK5gJ].

Treat atrial flutter with chest pain by **immediate ECG and hemodynamic assessment** to confirm flutter and exclude ACS [^114JU1hu] [^114sCFVm]. If unstable (hypotension, ischemia, or heart failure), perform **urgent synchronized cardioversion** at 200 J biphasic [^1145UBy9] [^113HE5im]. If stable, use **IV beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** for rate control [^1177QBn3] [^112zjBxN], and consider IV ibutilide or oral dofetilide for pharmacologic cardioversion [^114EAuza] [^112Mgcn2]. Anticoagulate per AF risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc) [^115zyyay] [^115c2SSn]; if flutter > 48 hours or unknown duration, anticoagulate 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after cardioversion [^112AkTaH] [^114srEj8]. Monitor for thromboembolism, ischemia, and recurrence, and arrange cardiology follow-up; catheter ablation is first-line for recurrent or drug-refractory flutter [^112WVp53] [^112NKrMi].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnosis

- **12-lead ECG**: Confirm atrial flutter (sawtooth flutter waves, regular atrial rate ~250–350 bpm, often 2:1 AV block) [^111xTC1n].

- **Hemodynamic assessment**: Evaluate for instability (hypotension, ischemia, heart failure, altered mental status) [^112whkuL].

- **Exclude ACS**: Obtain troponins and serial ECGs if chest pain suggests ischemia [^notfound].

---

## Acute management based on hemodynamic stability

### Hemodynamically unstable patients

In hemodynamically unstable patients, **immediate synchronized cardioversion** is indicated at 200 J biphasic, escalating if needed [^1145UBy9] [^113HE5hr]. Before cardioversion, initiate **intravenous heparin** unless contraindicated [^112AkTaH].

---

### Hemodynamically stable patients

#### Rate control

- **First-line agents**: IV beta-blockers (metoprolol, esmolol) or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) [^1177QBn3] [^112zjBxN].

- **Alternative**: IV amiodarone if beta-blockers/CCBs are contraindicated or ineffective, especially with systolic heart failure [^117YRA56] [^116WCfVD].

- **Target**: Resting heart rate < 100–110 bpm [^notfound].

---

#### Rhythm control

For rhythm control, **pharmacologic cardioversion** options include IV ibutilide or oral dofetilide (in-hospital) [^114EAuza] [^112Mgcn2]. Alternatively, **elective synchronized cardioversion** can be performed after appropriate anticoagulation [^1163tiwB] [^111QRVQg].

---

## Anticoagulation management

Anticoagulation should follow the **CHA₂DS₂-VASc risk score** used for AF [^115zyyay] [^115c2SSn]. If flutter duration is > 48 hours or unknown, anticoagulate for 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after cardioversion [^112AkTaH] [^114srEj8]. For urgent cardioversion, initiate heparin and consider transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to exclude thrombus [^112AkTaH].

---

## Monitoring and complications

Continuously monitor for **recurrence, ischemia, and thromboembolism**. Common complications include thromboembolism, ischemia, heart failure, and recurrence [^117H1FU9].

---

## Long-term management and follow-up

Arrange **cardiology follow-up** for ongoing management and rhythm surveillance. Catheter ablation is **first-line for recurrent or drug-refractory flutter** [^112WVp53] [^112NKrMi]. Continue anticoagulation based on CHA₂DS₂-VASc risk [^115zyyay] [^115c2SSn].

---

## Summary algorithm

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | ECG confirmation and hemodynamic assessment |
| 2 | Unstable: immediate synchronized cardioversion |
| 3 | Stable: rate control with beta-blockers or CCBs |
| 4 | Consider rhythm control with ibutilide/dofetilide or elective cardioversion |
| 5 | Anticoagulation per CHA₂DS₂-VASc and duration of flutter |
| 6 | Monitor for complications and arrange follow-up |

---

Effective care for atrial flutter with chest pain hinges on **rapid stabilization**, accurate rhythm diagnosis, and guideline-directed rate or rhythm control with appropriate anticoagulation, followed by definitive therapy such as ablation for recurrence.

### Atrial fibrillation: common questions and answers about diagnosis and treatment [^115TCGPH]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. It is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults in the primary care setting, and its prevalence increases with age. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults older than 50 years for atrial fibrillation. Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings and should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography or other recording device. The initial evaluation should include transthoracic echocardiography; serum electrolyte levels; complete blood count; and thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests. Stroke risk should be assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by preventing atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral or systemic emboli. Hemodynamically unstable patients, including those with decompensated heart failure, should be evaluated and treated emergently. Most hemodynamically stable patients should be treated initially with rate control and anticoagulation. Rhythm control, using medications or procedures, should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or in some patients based on risk factors and shared decision-making. Electrical cardioversion may be appropriate as first-line rhythm control. Conversion to sinus rhythm with catheter ablation may be considered in patients who are unable or unwilling to take rate or rhythm control medications long-term or if medications have been ineffective.

### Outcomes for emergency department patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter treated in Canadian hospitals [^113nzocA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Recent-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter are the most common arrhythmias managed in the emergency department (ED). We evaluate the management and 30-day outcomes for recent-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter patients in Canadian EDs, where cardioversion is commonly practiced.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study in 6 academic hospital EDs and enrolled patients who had atrial fibrillation and flutter onset within 48 hours. Patients were followed for 30 days by health records review and telephone. Adverse events included death, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, subsequent admission, or ED electrocardioversion.

Results

We enrolled 1,091 patients with mean age 63.9 years, atrial fibrillation 84.7%, atrial flutter 15.3%, hospital admission 9.0%, and converted to sinus rhythm 80.1%. Although 10.5% of recent-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter patients had adverse events within 30 days, there were no related deaths and 1 stroke (0.1%). Adjusted odds ratios for factors associated with adverse event were hours from onset (1.03/hour; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.05), history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (2.09; 95% CI 1.01 to 4.36), and pulmonary congestion on chest radiograph (7.37; 95% CI 2.40 to 22.64). Patients who left the ED in sinus rhythm were much less likely to experience an adverse event (P < .001).

Conclusion

Although most recent-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter patients were treated aggressively in the ED, there were few 30-day serious outcomes. Physicians underprescribed oral anticoagulants. Potential risk factors for adverse events include longer duration from arrhythmia onset, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, pulmonary congestion on chest radiograph, and not being in sinus rhythm at discharge. An ED strategy of sinus rhythm restoration and discharge in most patients is effective and safe.

Key points
- Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia.
- Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. What it is Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way. When a person has AFib, the normal beating in the upper chambers of the heart is irregular, and blood doesn't flow as well as it should from the atria to the lower chambers of the heart. AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. Symptoms Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. Others may experience one or more of the following symptoms:

- Irregular heartbeat.
- Heart palpitations.
- Lightheadedness.
- Extreme fatigue.
- Shortness of breath.
- Chest pain.

How is AFib related to stroke. AFib increases a person's risk for stroke. When standard stroke risk factors were accounted for, AFib was associated with an approximately fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke. AFib causes about 1 in 7 strokes. Strokes caused by complications from AFib tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. Strokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or by fatty deposits called plaque in the blood vessel lining. Treatment and recovery Treatment for AFib can include:

- Medicines to control the heart's rhythm and rate.
- Blood-thinning medicine to prevent blood clots from forming and reduce stroke risk.
- Surgery.
- Medicine and healthy lifestyle changes to manage AFib risk factors. What are the consequences of AFib. More than 454, 000 hospitalizations with AFib as the primary diagnosis happen each year in the US. The condition contributes to about 158, 000 deaths each year.

The death rate from AFib as the primary or a contributing cause of death has been rising for more than two decades. Circulation. 2022; 145: e153–e639.

### Diagnosis and management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^117H1FU9]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrial flutter:

- **Definition**: Atrial flutter is a supraventricular arrhythmia characterized by rapid, regular atrial contractions, primarily confined to the right atrium.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of atrial flutter involves the formation of a reentrant circuit, often around the tricuspid valve or along the right atrial wall. This circuit results in a rapid and regular atrial rhythm. Abnormal intraatrial conduction, slow conduction paths, and areas of low voltage in the atria can contribute to the initiation and maintenance of these reentrant circuits.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter in Europe is estimated at 1.5 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for atrial flutter include advancing age (particularly prevalent in the elderly population) and underlying cardiac conditions such as hypertension, HF, and congenital heart disease. Additional risk factors include pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, and the use of specific medications, such as class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs.
- **Disease course**: The clinical features of atrial flutter often include palpitations, dyspnea, and chest discomfort. However, the diagnosis is often confirmed through a 12-lead ECG or an electrophysiology study and mapping. Complications can include stroke, HF, thromboembolism, and progression to AF.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of atrial flutter can be influenced by several factors. The presence of underlying heart disease can complicate the condition and lead to poorer outcomes. There is a risk of progression to AF.

Atrial fibrillation remains a common and challenging problem following cardiac surgery. The American College of Chest Physicians, through the Health and Science Policy Committee, established a panel to develop a set of clinical practice guidelines for the management or prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation or flutter in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. The panel based its guidelines on a systematic review of the literature that included a computerized search of PubMed and CENTRAL, the Cochrane Collaboration database, as well as a search of selected journals and references in key articles. Studies were eligible for review if they were controlled trials. Paired reviewers assessed the quality of each eligible study and extracted relevant data. The resulting data were assembled into evidence tables organized by key management questions. The panel derived recommendations that were based on this review of evidence and were formulated according to the ACCP protocol for grading evidence and strength of recommendations.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common and complex cardiac arrhythmias. Using currently available evidence, leading medical societies have established recommendations for the optimal management of atrial fibrillation. These guidelines have recently been updated by 4 consensus groups: the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and a task force of 3 societies from the United States: the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. The present review focused on the similarities and differences among these recently updated guidelines. Key revisions included updated information on newer treatments for rhythm control, treatment options to reduce atrial fibrillation complications, and updated anticoagulant management for thromboprophylaxis.

### Introduction: American College of Chest Physicians guidelines for the prevention and management of postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery [^1179wpXb]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are arrhythmias that commonly occur following cardiac surgery. The precipitating events are not always obvious, although predisposing factors including age have been defined. Postoperative AF and AFL add significantly to both the cost and morbidity of cardiac surgery. This guideline report, which was created under the auspices of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), critically reviews evidence-based literature defining optimal treatment and prophylaxis for postoperative AF. Specific issues addressed include the following: (1) controlling the ventricular response rate in the patient with postoperative AF and AFL; (2) preventing thromboembolism in the setting of AF and AFL including the appropriate role of anticoagulation therapy; (3) pharmacologic approaches to converting AF or AFL to normal sinus rhythm, and maintaining normal sinus rhythm postoperatively; and (4) pharmacologic and surgical prophylaxis against postoperative AF and AFL. The resulting clinical practice guidelines represent the best-supported treatments, based on a rational scientific approach formulated from randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews. The panel convened by the Health and Sciences Policy Committee of the ACCP reviewed the currently available evidence to provide a basis for making specific recommendations for patient care.

Atrial fibrillation/flutter cardioversion — biphasic energy settings and sedation: Randomized trials and a network meta-analysis involving > 3000 AF patients found that 200-J shocks achieved greater than 90% cumulative cardioversion success across all 3 biphasic platforms currently available in the United States, and subsequent clinical studies observed no association between starting biphasic shock energies of up to 360 J with new energy-associated elevations in cardiac-specific enzymes, postcardioversion arrhythmias, cardiac dysfunction, or other sequelae. Notably, low-energy monophasic shocks were significantly more likely to provoke VF when cardioverting AF, and AF when cardioverting atrial flutter than a 200-J or greater setting, and a higher starting energy was also found to be more efficient than "starting low, titrating higher" approaches. Considering efficacy, safety, efficiency, simplicity, and consistency with other professional guidelines, evidence supports a starting energy of 200 J; regardless of energy setting, appropriate sedation for cardioversion is advisable in awake patients, given shock is a painful procedure.

### DC cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in the emergency department: improving specialist protocols for the generalist [^1162FfKZ]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

DCCV is a safe and effective treatment for recent-onset AF or flutter and when performed in the ED, it can provide an excellent treatment option for patients as well as reducing unnecessary hospital admissions and healthcare costs. However, appropriate periprocedural anticoagulation is absolutely essential to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes, chiefly thromboembolic stroke.

We should champion the high number of these procedures carried out in the ED setting, a pressured environment with multiple competing challenges. However, local protocols should reflect best-practice guidance regarding decision-making around selecting rate versus rhythm control strategies, appropriate use of medication and eligibility for anticoagulation as per individualised thrombotic risk (the CHADsVASc score).

### Part 9: adult advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^112whkuL]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid ventricular response — synopsis: Treating AF/flutter with rapid ventricular rates depends on hemodynamic stability, and unstable patients and those with rate-related ischemia often need urgent electrical cardioversion. Stable patients can be treated pharmacologically to achieve rate or rhythm control. Conversion of AF/flutter greater than 48 hours in nonanticoagulated patients risks thromboembolic events. For acute AF/flutter assessed as less than 48 hours, decision making is more nuanced, requiring expert consultation unless emergent cardioversion is needed. Pre-excited AF/flutter (Wolff–Parkinson–White) is covered under Wide-Complex Tachycardias.

### Variation in management of recent-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter among academic hospital emergency departments [^111v5GAm]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Although recent-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter are common arrhythmias managed in the emergency department (ED), there is insufficient evidence to help physicians choose between 2 competing treatment strategies, rate control and rhythm control. We seek to evaluate variation in ED management practices for recent-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter patients at multiple Canadian sites and to determine whether hospital site was an independent predictor of attempted cardioversion.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional survey by health records review on an observational cohort of all eligible adult recent-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter cases, with onset of symptoms less than 48 hours, treated at 8 academic hospital EDs during a 12-month period, and evaluated the variation in practice among sites for important management strategies.

Results

Among the 1,068 study patients, 88.3% had atrial fibrillation and 11.7% had atrial flutter. The proportion of cases managed with rhythm control was 59.4% (interhospital range 42% to 85%) and, among these, electrocardioversion was attempted first for 44.2% (range 7% to 69%). There was variation in most management strategies, including use of rate control drugs 54.9% (range 37% to 65%), choice of procainamide as rhythm control drug 62.1% (range 15% to 89%), referral to cardiology in the ED 30.7% (range 16% to 64%), use of heparin 13.7% (range 1% to 29%), and outpatient cardiology referral 43.0% (range 30% to 65%). Adverse events were relatively uncommon and transient for patients undergoing attempts at pharmacologic (13.0%) or electrocardioversion (12.1%). Overall, 83.3% of patients were discharged home from the ED (range 73% to 90%). After controlling for 12 covariates, multivariate logistic regression found that factors independently associated with attempted cardioversion were age (odds ratio [OR] 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95 to 0.98), history of electrocardioversion (OR 2.73; 95% CI 1.56 to 4.80), associated heart failure (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.95), and hospital site (ORs ranged from 0.38 to 3.05).

Conclusion

We demonstrated a high degree of variation in management approaches for recent-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter patients treated in academic hospital EDs. Individual hospital site, age, previous cardioversion, and associated heart failure were independent predictors for the use of rhythm control.

### DC cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in the emergency department: improving specialist protocols for the generalist [^115pJWCc]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia, with a prevalence in the general population of approximately 1%. It accounts for at least 3% of National Health Service (NHS) expenditure, with a steadily increasing 10% of all UK emergency admissions related to AF or atrial flutter.

NHS England provides guidance for AF as an 'ambulatory care sensitive condition', that is, a condition where appropriate management in the acute setting can reduce the need for hospital admission. Indeed, many patients presenting with AF or flutter with symptoms or uncontrolled ventricular rate can be safely treated in the ED with a synchronised direct current (DC) cardioversion, an electric shock therapy which, if successful, restores a normal sinus heart rhythm and allows discharge home from the ED. This treatment has been shown to be safeand effective, and should be encouraged, where local services allow.

A key consideration at the time of DC cardioversion is the need to anticoagulate to reduce the risk of subsequent stroke. Although it has long been established that a new-onset AF or atrial flutter within 48 hours is likely safe to cardiovert, new data have raised questions about the role of postprocedural anticoagulationand this is reflected in the latest European and British guidelines — with the decision to anticoagulate based on the patient's individualised thromboembolic risk, using the 'CHADsVASc' risk score. Within our own institution, we sought to assess and improve the proportion of ED cardioversions which adhered to this updated guidance to improve compliance with best practice and maximise patient safety.

### Management of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^112R42iw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Although atrial fibrillation remains the most common cardiac arrhythmia, the treatment and disposition remain varied. An accept-able standard of practice requires an evidence-based approach. This approach has revealed that half of the patients who present with acute atrial fibrillation will convert to sinus rhythm without intervention. In the hemodynamically stable subset, ascertaining the on-set of atrial fibrillation within 48 hours is critical because this period dictates when and if anticoagulation should be instituted and if and where electrical or chemical cardioversion needs be performed. The hemodynamically unstable patient, however, requires emergent cardioversion, irrespective of the chronicity of atrial fibrillation. An evidence-based approach may serve to optimize treatment and obviate the need for unnecessary hospital admissions.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common persistent arrythmia worldwide and a significant contributor to poor quality of life. Currently, there are an estimated 37 million individuals with AF globally. Projections to the year 2050 indicate a 60% absolute increase in AF prevalence. Given the huge burden of disease, measures to prevent and optimally treat AF are of great importance. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the benefit of rhythm control in those with AF. Direct current cardioversion is an elective procedure commonly used to terminate arrhythmias and plays an important role in rhythm control for AF.

Rhythm control for AF

Initial trials comparing rate and rhythm control for AF showed no difference in outcomes, and perhaps increased hospitalisations with rhythm control. Despite this, recent trials have shown benefit to rhythm control in select populations. In those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and persistent ventricular dysfunction despite medical therapy, mortality reduction is seen with catheter ablation. Moreover, in younger patients with early AF, there may be small improvements in cardiovascular endpoints with rhythm control. Clearly, a tailored approach to AF management is needed. Therapeutic strategies are dependent on patient preference, symptoms, the presence of structural heart disease and risks associated with interventions.

In those whom rhythm control is felt to be appropriate, electrical cardioversion offers a promising means of restoring sinus rhythm. The limitation of electrical cardioversion is that initial restoration of sinus rhythm does not ensure maintenance of sinus rhythm. Patients generally also require longer term antiarrhythmic therapy and lifestyle modification. Early success of cardioversion for AF was low, around 75%. Over the past decades, numerous techniques have been implemented to improve restoration of sinus rhythm. With these methods, sinus rhythm is achieved in over 90% of cases.

### Tachycardia due to atrial flutter with rapid 1: 1 conduction following treatment of atrial fibrillation with flecainide [^113n9PNH]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Flecainide can "organise" atrial fibrillation into atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction, leading to cardiovascular compromise. The treatment of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department is often complex and depends on several factors, including time of onset of atrial fibrillation and previously known cardiac disease. Current guidelines include flecainide as a possible treatment for chemical cardioversion and maintaining sinus rhythm in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.1 2 An important, under-recognised complication of flecainide is the transformation of rhythm from atrial fibrillation to atrial flutter. We present four such cases.

Atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid ventricular response — electrical therapies: In adult patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rates, immediate electrical cardioversion should be performed to restore sinus rhythm (1 C-LD). Urgent direct-current cardioversion of new onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rates in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is recommended for adult patients with hemodynamic compromise, ongoing ischemia, or inadequate rate control (1 C-LD). For synchronized cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults using any currently US-approved biphasic wave form defibrillator, an initial energy setting of at least 200 J is reasonable and increment in the event of shock failure, depending on the biphasic defibrillator used (2a B-R). The usefulness of double synchronized cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults as an initial treatment strategy is uncertain (2b B-R). For synchronized cardioversion of atrial flutter in adults, an initial energy setting of 200 J may be reasonable and increment in the event of shock failure, depending on the biphasic defibrillator used (2b C-LD). The usefulness of double synchronized cardioversion as a rescue treatment for shock-refractory atrial fibrillation in adults is uncertain (2b C-LD).

Atrial flutter — acute treatment recommendations: I A: Oral dofetilide or intravenous ibutilide is useful for acute pharmacological cardioversion in patients with atrial flutter. I B-R: Intravenous or oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are useful for acute rate control in patients with atrial flutter who are hemodynamically stable. I B-NR: Elective synchronized cardioversion is indicated in stable patients with well-tolerated atrial flutter when a rhythm-control strategy is pursued. I B-NR: Synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment of patients with atrial flutter who are hemodynamically unstable and do not respond to pharmacological therapies. I C-LD: Rapid atrial pacing is useful for acute treatment of atrial flutter in patients who have pacing wires in place as part of a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or for temporary atrial pacing after cardiac surgery. I B-NR: Acute antithrombotic therapy is recommended in patients with atrial flutter to align with recommended antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF. IIa B-R: Intravenous amiodarone can be useful for acute control of the ventricular rate (in the absence of preexcitation) in patients with atrial flutter and systolic heart failure, when beta blockers are contraindicated or ineffective.

### Role of electrophysiological study and ablation in the management of recurrent atrial flutter associated with haemodynamic compromise in a critically ill patient [^112kjaBA]. Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial flutter is a common arrhythmia. In the critical care setting, the arrhythmia may present in any patient, but it is most commonly seen in patients with impaired ventricular function, valvular disease, atrial dilatation or after cardiac surgery. We present a 68-year-old lady with recurrent poorly tolerated atrial flutter that was resistant to multiple pharmacological interventions and complicated by cardiogenic shock following direct current cardioversion. The flutter was successfully cured with radiofrequency ablation and was followed by an immediate improvement in her haemodynamic status. We review the management of acute atrial flutter and discuss the role of electrophysiologically guided ablation.

Atrial flutter — appendage flow and anticoagulation around cardioversion mirror atrial fibrillation patterns. LAA flow velocities are lower in patients with atrial flutter than are usually seen during sinus rhythm but higher than in AF. As in AF, atrial flutter is associated with low appendage emptying velocities following cardioversion with the potential for thromboembolism, and anticoagulation is similarly recommended.

Related arrhythmias — atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia — are described in the context of atrial fibrillation (AF), as AF may occur in isolation or in association with other arrhythmias, most commonly atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, and atrial flutter may arise during treatment with antiarrhythmic agents prescribed to prevent recurrent AF. Atrial flutter in the typical form is characterized by a saw-tooth pattern of regular atrial activation called flutter (f) waves on the ECG, particularly visible in leads II, III, aVF, and V1, and in the untreated state, the atrial rate in atrial flutter typically ranges from 240 to 320 beats per minute. Atrial flutter commonly occurs with 2:1 AV block, resulting in a regular or irregular ventricular rate of 120 to 160 beats per minute (most characteristically about 150 beats per minute), and atrial flutter may degenerate into AF and AF may convert to atrial flutter, with the ECG pattern fluctuating between atrial flutter and AF. Atrial flutter is usually readily distinguished from AF, but when atrial activity is prominent on the ECG in more than 1 lead, AF may be misdiagnosed as atrial flutter, and focal atrial tachycardias, AV reentrant tachycardias, and AV nodal reentrant tachycardias may also trigger AF.

Clinical evaluation in atrial fibrillation (AF) — additional testing: One or several tests may be necessary, including a Six-minute walk test if the adequacy of rate control is in question; exercise testing if the adequacy of rate control is in question (permanent AF), to reproduce exercise-induced AF, and to exclude ischemia before treatment of selected patients with a type IC antiarrhythmic drug; Holter monitoring or event recording if diagnosis of the type of arrhythmia is in question and as a means of evaluating rate control; transesophageal echocardiography to identify LA thrombus (in the LA appendage) and to guide cardioversion; electrophysiological study to clarify the mechanism of wide-QRS-complex tachycardia, to identify a predisposing arrhythmia such as atrial flutter or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and to seek sites for curative ablation or AV conduction block/modification; and chest radiograph to evaluate lung parenchyma and pulmonary vasculature when clinical findings suggest an abnormality.

Atrial fibrillation in acute myocardial infarction — management directives and observed risks are as follows: For patients with AF and acute MI, administration of unfractionated heparin is recommended in a dose sufficient to prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time to 1.5 to 2.0 times the control value (Level of Evidence: C), intravenous administration of digitalis is reasonable in patients with acute MI and AF associated with severe LV dysfunction and HF (Level of Evidence: C), and the administration of class IC antiarrhythmic drugs is not recommended in the setting of acute MI (Level of Evidence: C). Urgent direct-current cardioversion is appropriate in acute MI patients presenting with AF and intractable ischemia or hemodynamic instability, and intravenous administration of a beta blocker is indicated for rate control in patients with acute MI. Anticoagulants are indicated in those with large anterior infarcts and in survivors of acute MI who develop persistent AF, and treatment with ACE inhibitors appears to reduce the incidence of AF in patients with LV dysfunction after acute MI; in a placebo-controlled trial, carvedilol reduced AF and/or atrial flutter (5.4% vs. 2.3%). Observational data show AF in acute MI occurred in 22% of Medicare beneficiaries 65 y or older, 21% in a LV dysfunction cohort, and 10.4% in a trial population; AF in acute MI was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (25.3% with AF vs. 16.0% without AF), 30-d mortality (29.3% vs. 19.1%), 1-yr mortality (48.3% vs. 32.7%), and a stroke rate of 3.1%.

Direct-current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter — recommendations: When a rapid ventricular response does not respond promptly to pharmacological measures in AF with ongoing myocardial ischemia, symptomatic hypotension, angina, or HF, immediate R-wave synchronized direct-current cardioversion is recommended (Level of Evidence: C). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended for AF with preexcitation when very rapid tachycardia or hemodynamic instability occurs (Level of Evidence: B). Cardioversion is recommended in patients without hemodynamic instability when AF symptoms are unacceptable, and in case of early relapse after cardioversion, repeated direct-current attempts may be made following administration of antiarrhythmic medication (Level of Evidence: C). As Class IIa, direct-current cardioversion can be useful to restore sinus rhythm as part of a long-term management strategy in AF (Level of Evidence: B), and patient preference is a reasonable consideration for infrequently repeated cardioversions in symptomatic or recurrent AF (Level of Evidence: C). As Class III, frequent repetition of direct-current cardioversion is not recommended when periods of sinus rhythm are relatively short after multiple procedures despite prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy (Level of Evidence: C), and electrical cardioversion is contraindicated in patients with digitalis toxicity or hypokalemia (Level of Evidence: C).

Recommendations for acute treatment of SVT of unknown mechanism — adenosine is recommended for acute treatment in patients with regular SVT (COR I; LOE B-R). In randomized trials adenosine effectively terminated atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia or atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia with success rates ranging from 78% to 96%; it should be administered via proximal IV as a rapid bolus infusion followed by a saline flush. Adenosine may also be useful diagnostically to unmask atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation, though termination of these atrial arrhythmias is uncommon, and continuous ECG recording during administration may help distinguish drug failure from successful termination with immediate arrhythmia reinstitution.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter — pericardioversion anticoagulation: Anticoagulation is recommended for 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after cardioversion for patients with AF of unknown duration or with AF for more than 48 h, and when acute AF produces hemodynamic instability, immediate cardioversion should not be delayed, but intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous injection of a low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated before cardioversion. Pooled data indicate that 98% of clinical thromboembolic events occur within 10 d, supporting administration of an anticoagulant for at least 4 wk after cardioversion and that continuation for a considerably longer period may be warranted even after apparently successful cardioversion. In a multicenter randomized study (n = 1222), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided and conventional strategies using anticoagulation 3 wk before and 4 wk after cardioversion showed comparably low risks of stroke (0.81% with the TEE approach and 0.50% with the conventional approach). For patients with atrial flutter undergoing cardioversion, anticoagulation should be considered with either strategy, and anticoagulation can be beneficial according to the recommendations as for patients with AF.
