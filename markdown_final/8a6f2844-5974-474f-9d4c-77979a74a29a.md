## Question

Clincal practice guideline constipation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a clinical practice guideline on constipation management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define constipation and classify subtypes. Then, I should verify the initial evaluation and when to escalate diagnostics. Next, I will review first-line lifestyle and fiber strategies, followed by pharmacologic therapy sequencing for chronic idiopathic constipation. After that, I need to address opioid-induced constipation specifically, then consider IBS-C pharmacotherapy. I will also examine outlet dysfunction and when to refer for biofeedback or surgery, and finally I should integrate special populations, monitoring, and evidence gaps with a concise algorithm summary anchored in high-credibility guidelines [^111P3AcW] [^113oBCdQ].

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't anchor on outdated criteria. Chronic constipation is generally defined by Rome IV as two or more of reduced stool frequency, straining, hard/lumpy stools, incomplete evacuation, anorectal blockage, or manual maneuvers, present for at least 3–6 months without diarrhea, and can be categorized as normal transit, slow transit, or outlet dysfunction; IBS-C overlaps with FC but requires abdominal pain with altered bowel habits, so I need to keep that distinction in mind during history-taking [^116HhvJX] [^116b1eng] [^113XfEs6].

> Wait, let me verify the initial evaluation steps before jumping to tests. A directed history and exam are strongly recommended to identify red flags, medication contributors, and comorbidities; objective symptom scales can help quantify severity and quality-of-life impact, though the evidence for their routine use is low and this remains conditional; colonoscopy is not indicated solely for constipation without alarm features or screening indications, so I should avoid over-ordering endoscopy in straightforward cases [^115uZLzd] [^111Fe1dg] [^112jPYpF].

> Hold on, I should verify the first-line nonpharmacologic approach and not overstate benefits. Dietary modification with adequate hydration and fiber supplementation is strongly recommended as initial therapy, but I need to remember the evidence quality is low; soluble fiber tends to be better tolerated and more effective than insoluble fiber in many patients, and increasing total fiber beyond about 25–30 g/day rarely adds benefit and may worsen bloating, so I should titrate carefully and reassess response [^116T7AVZ] [^116SwXcf].

> Next, I will examine pharmacologic therapy for chronic idiopathic constipation and I need to ensure I sequence agents correctly. Osmotic laxatives, particularly polyethylene glycol, are first-line and carry a strong recommendation with moderate certainty; stimulant laxatives such as bisacodyl or sodium picosulfate are appropriate for rescue or second-line use; secretagogues like linaclotide and plecanatide and the 5-HT4 agonist prucalopride have strong recommendations and can be considered when osmotic/stimulant therapy is inadequate; magnesium oxide is a reasonable option with renal safety in mind, and lactulose or senna can be considered when other options fail or are not tolerated, acknowledging lower certainty and dose-dependent bloating for lactulose [^114KtWKs] [^1118Zugc] [^112t69Kc] [^113oK2Mn] [^113fvra5] [^117LPZAm].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought fiber had a strong recommendation across the board, but I should double-check the certainty. The AGA–ACG guideline actually gives fiber a conditional recommendation due to low-quality evidence, so I should frame fiber as reasonable for mild constipation or in combination with PEG, while emphasizing that many patients with slow transit or outlet dysfunction will not respond adequately to fiber alone, which aligns with ASCRS guidance [^112t69Kc] [^116T7AVZ].

> I will now examine opioid-induced constipation because the pathophysiology and treatment hierarchy differ. For OIC, I should confirm that laxatives remain first-line with a strong recommendation; if laxatives fail, peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists such as naloxegol, methylnaltrexone, or naldemedine are appropriate next steps; I should also consider fixed-dose naloxone–oxycodone combinations to mitigate OIC risk, while avoiding bulk-forming agents like psyllium which can worsen symptoms in OIC; I need to ensure I'm not conflating general CIC guidance with OIC-specific recommendations [^111GTrT3] [^116XVtGi] [^111BqSBo] [^1111jDf4] [^111FeYzV].

> Let me consider IBS-C next and be precise about which agents have stronger evidence. Linaclotide has a strong recommendation with high certainty, while plecanatide, tenapanor, tegaserod, and lubiprostone carry conditional recommendations; polyethylene glycol can be used for stool form normalization, though evidence in IBS-C is lower; importantly, tegaserod is restricted to women under 65 without cardiovascular ischemic disease, so I should screen carefully before prescribing it [^115bzzt1] [^112nwPdJ].

> But wait, what if constipation persists despite optimized medical therapy; I should check for outlet dysfunction. Patients who fail dietary measures, fiber, and osmotic laxatives should be evaluated for pelvic floor dyssynergia with anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion or defecography; biofeedback is first-line for dyssynergia with strong recommendation and moderate certainty; botulinum toxin to the puborectalis may be considered in selected nonrelaxing puborectalis, and surgical repair of rectocele is reasonable only after addressing functional causes; colon transit should be measured before any surgical intervention for constipation [^111nWa5i] [^114xeRU3].

> I need to ensure I tailor management to special populations. In older adults, I should start low and go slow with laxatives, monitor electrolytes if using magnesium or lactulose, and prioritize safety; in pregnancy, osmotic agents like PEG are generally preferred; in pediatrics, routine intensive behavioral programs are not recommended, and fiber with osmotic laxatives are mainstays, with new GRADE-based pediatric guidance underway; in advanced cancer or palliative care, anticipate OIC, use comfort-focused regimens, and consider PAMORAs early when laxatives are insufficient [^111pkfZS] [^113hmPSv] [^112ePFC7] [^111BqSBo].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring and follow-up cadence. Reassess symptoms every 2–4 weeks initially, then every 3–6 months once stable; adjust therapy based on stool frequency, consistency, straining, and patient preference; durability of PEG response has been demonstrated up to 6 months, which supports maintenance strategies when effective; I should also watch for dose-limiting bloating with osmotics and cramping with stimulants and titrate accordingly [^114BDvZM] [^114KtWKs] [^113vVaBL].

> I should double-check evidence gaps so I don't overpromise. Many fiber and older laxative data are limited by heterogeneity and short-term follow-up; comparative effectiveness across pharmacologic classes is sparse; cost-effectiveness and long-term safety data, especially for newer agents, remain limited; these constraints reinforce the need for shared decision-making and individualized plans that incorporate patient values, access, and tolerability [^111Huq3A] [^112A94aZ].

> Let me summarize the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Start with a careful history and exam to exclude red flags and identify secondary causes; initiate dietary fiber and fluids with realistic expectations; if inadequate, begin PEG and titrate to effect; add stimulant laxatives for rescue; if still refractory, consider secretagogues or prucalopride based on CIC versus IBS-C phenotype; for OIC, ensure laxatives first, then PAMORAs; for suspected outlet dysfunction, refer for anorectal testing and biofeedback before any surgical consideration; throughout, monitor response, adverse effects, and quality of life, and adjust iteratively [^111P3AcW] [^113oBCdQ] [^112cUotn].

---

Constipation management should be **stepwise and individualized**, starting with lifestyle and fiber, then osmotic laxatives, and escalating to stimulants or prescription agents if needed [^114mxYru] [^114KtWKs]. For opioid-induced constipation, use **laxatives first-line** [^111GTrT3] and add peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists if refractory [^111BqSBo]. Evaluate for secondary causes and red flags; reserve diagnostic testing for refractory or alarm-feature cases [^115uZLzd] [^112jPYpF]. Patient education, hydration, and activity are essential; adjust therapy to response and tolerability [^116T7AVZ].

---

## Definition and classification

Chronic constipation is defined by **Rome IV** as the presence of two or more of the following for at least 3 months: fewer than three spontaneous bowel movements per week, straining, lumpy or hard stools, incomplete evacuation, sensation of anorectal blockage, or requiring manual maneuvers, with symptoms not associated with diarrhea and present for 3–6 months [^116HhvJX]. Subtypes include normal transit, slow transit, and outlet dysfunction constipation [^116b1eng].

---

## Initial evaluation

- **History and physical examination**: Strong recommendation to perform a directed history and physical examination to identify secondary causes, medications, and comorbidities [^115uZLzd].

- **Alarm features**: Rectal bleeding, weight loss, anemia, change in stool caliber, or family history of colorectal cancer warrant endoscopic evaluation [^115uZLzd].

- **Objective measures**: Use validated tools (e.g. Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom Questionnaire) to assess severity and quality of life impact [^111Fe1dg].

---

## Lifestyle and dietary modifications

First-line management includes **dietary fiber** (20–30 g/day) with adequate hydration; soluble fiber is preferred and should be titrated to minimize bloating [^116SwXcf]. Regular physical activity improves colonic motility and is encouraged when feasible [^notfound]. Address behavioral factors — such as ignoring the urge to defecate, inadequate time on the toilet, and poor toilet posture — to improve symptoms [^114ykTaq].

---

## Pharmacological management

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Osmotic laxatives | - Polyethylene glycol (PEG) <br/> - Magnesium oxide <br/> - Lactulose | First-line therapy; strong recommendation for PEG | Moderate |
| Stimulant laxatives | - Bisacodyl <br/> - Sodium picosulfate <br/> - Senna | Second-line or rescue therapy; conditional recommendation | Low |
| Secretagogues | - Linaclotide <br/> - Plecanatide <br/> - Lubiprostone | Strong recommendation for linaclotide and plecanatide; conditional for lubiprostone | Moderate |
| Serotonin type 4 agonist | Prucalopride | Strong recommendation | Moderate |
| Peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists | - Naloxegol <br/> - Methylnaltrexone <br/> - Naldemedine | For opioid-induced constipation refractory to laxatives; strong recommendation | Moderate |

---

## Special populations

- **Opioid-induced constipation (OIC)**: Laxatives are first-line; if inadequate, add peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists [^111GTrT3] [^111BqSBo].

- **Pediatric patients**: Emphasize dietary fiber, adequate hydration, and regular toileting routines; avoid routine intensive behavioral protocols [^1162s63N] [^113Af4hQ].

- **Elderly patients**: Use caution with stimulant laxatives; prefer osmotic agents and adjust doses to minimize electrolyte disturbances.

---

## Diagnostic testing

Reserve diagnostic testing for refractory cases or when **alarm features** are present. Anorectal physiology testing or dynamic imaging is indicated for suspected **outlet dysfunction** [^111nWa5i]. Colonic transit studies are recommended before surgical intervention [^111nWa5i]. Routine colonoscopy is **not indicated** in the absence of alarm symptoms or screening indications [^112jPYpF].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Patient education should explain the chronic nature of constipation, the importance of adherence, and potential side effects of medications. Follow-up should monitor response, adjust therapy, and reassess for secondary causes or complications [^111nWa5i].

---

## Evidence gaps and future research

Evidence gaps include limited long-term safety data for newer agents, a need for head-to-head comparisons, and evaluation of combination therapies. Cost-effectiveness analyses and patient-reported outcome measures require further development [^112A94aZ].

---

Constipation management should be **stepwise**, starting with lifestyle and fiber, then osmotic laxatives, and escalating to stimulants or prescription agents if needed. For OIC, use laxatives first-line and add PAMORAs if refractory. Evaluate for secondary causes and red flags, and reserve diagnostic testing for refractory or alarm-feature cases. Patient education, hydration, and activity are essential; adjust therapy to response and tolerability.

### Consensus recommendations for the management of constipation in patients with advanced, progressive illness [^114X5R2b]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

Constipation is a highly prevalent and distressing symptom in patients with advanced, progressive illnesses. Although opioids are one of the most common causes of constipation in patients with advanced, progressive illness, it is important to note that there are many other potential etiologies and combinations of causes that should be taken into consideration when making treatment decisions. Management approaches involve a combination of good assessment techniques, preventive regimens, appropriate pharmacological treatment of established constipation, and frequent monitoring. In this vulnerable patient population, maintenance of comfort and respect for individual preferences and sensitivities should be overriding considerations when making clinical decisions. This consensus document was developed by a multidisciplinary group of leading Canadian palliative care specialists in an effort to define best practices in palliative constipation management that will be relevant and useful to health care professionals. Although a wide range of options exists to help treat constipation and prevent its development or recurrence, there is a limited body of evidence evaluating pharmacological interventions. These recommendations are, therefore, based on the best of the available evidence, combined with expert opinion derived from experience in clinical practice. This underscores the need for further clinical evaluation of the available agents to create a robust, evidence-based foundation for treatment decisions in the management of constipation in patients with advanced, progressive illness.

### Opioid-induced constipation and bowel dysfunction: a clinical guideline [^114kGpbC]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To formulate timely evidence-based guidelines for the management of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction.

Setting

Constipation is a major untoward effect of opioids. Increasing prescription of opioids has correlated to increased incidence of opioid-induced constipation. However, the inhibitory effects of opioids are not confined to the colon, but also affect higher segments of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the coining of the term "opioid-induced bowel dysfunction".

Methods

A literature search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Predefined search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria were used to identify and categorize relevant papers. A series of statements were formulated and justified by a comment, then labeled with the degree of agreement and their level of evidence as judged by the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) system.

Results

From a list of 10,832 potentially relevant studies, 33 citations were identified for review. Screening the reference lists of the pertinent papers identified additional publications. Current definitions, prevalence, and mechanism of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction were reviewed, and a treatment algorithm and statements regarding patient management were developed to provide guidance on clinical best practice in the management of patients with opioid-induced constipation and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction.

Conclusions

In recent years, more insight has been gained in the pathophysiology of this "entity"; new treatment approaches have been developed, but guidelines on clinical best practice are still lacking. Current knowledge is insufficient regarding management of the opioid side effects on the upper gastrointestinal tract, but recommendations can be derived from what we know at present.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^112HgM9k]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation — recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional", with "we recommend" indicating strong and "we suggest" indicating conditional. For patients, under a strong recommendation "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", whereas under a conditional recommendation "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". For clinicians, a strong recommendation means "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while under a conditional recommendation "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients consistent with his or her values and preferences. Use shared decision making. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values and preferences". For policy makers, strong recommendations indicate "The recommendation can be adapted as policy or performance measure in most situations", whereas conditional recommendations state "Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess whether decision making is appropriate". Certainty of evidence definitions include "High" ("We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect".), "Moderate" ("We are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different".), and "Low" ("Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect".). For all recommendations, "the intervention is compared with 'not using the intervention' or the treatment is recommended or suggested 'over no drug treatment'. The comparator is not explicitly included in the recommendation statement to avoid redundancy".

### An appraisal of clinical practice guidelines for constipation: a right attitude towards to guidelines [^115cABvF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is a disorder defined by incomplete defecation, and/or infrequent bowel movements which associated with persistent difficult and/or painful defecation, fecal incontinence, and abdominal pain. It is a common clinical functional diseases. The worldwide constipation surveys show a wide range of prevalence rates between 1% and > 20% in western populations, although, a recent epidemiological reports found 16% general adult populations were constipation. Constipation may be found for up to 20% of community-dwelling elderly individuals. Moreover the incidence of functional constipation in childhood estimated 3%.

Because of its high disease burden, the treatment of constipation has become an important issue for clinicians and patients. During the last two decade there were more than 20 developed clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to manage the constipation. The main role of the CPGs is to give clear recommendations to help clinicians make appropriate clinical decision for specific clinical circumstance.

However, not all guidelines are developed with the same methodologically rigorous approaches, there is no research for evaluating the quality of CPGs on constipation so far. With the above in mind, the objectives of the present study was to systematically review guidelines using the appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation (AGREEII) instrument related to constipation.

### An appraisal of clinical practice guidelines for constipation: a right attitude towards to guidelines [^112rdYTz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are formally developed statements that assist users to provide proper health care for a kind of disease and play a significant contribution in healthcare system. This study report the methodological quality of CPGs on constipation.

Methods

The "Appraisal of Guidelines and Research and Evaluation" (AGREEII) instrument was developed to determine the quality of CPGs. A comprehensive search was developed using five databases and three guideline websites until/up to December, 2015. Four independent authors evaluated the methodological issues of the CPGs by the AGREEII instrument.

Results

We identified 22 relevant guidelines on constipation from 1234 citations. The overall agreement among evaluators was 0.84 using the intra-class correlation coefficient. The mean AGREEII scores for the domains "scope and purpose" (51.77) and "rigor of development" (56.73) were moderate; afterward, three domains "stakeholder involvement" (32.23), "editorial independence" (29.59) and "applicability" (29.14) were low scores. The "clarity and presentation" (23.73) had the lowest scores.

Conclusion

Although existing constipation guidelines may accurately reflect current clinical practices, many guidelines' methodological quality is low. Therefore, more emphasis and attentions should be taken to the development of high-quality guidelines.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^111Huq3A]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association–American College of Gastroenterology guideline — limitations, evidence gaps, and implementation — highlights heterogeneity and scope constraints. It notes "clinical trials did not uniformly evaluate interventions for patient important outcomes on efficacy, adverse effects, and tolerability", and "there was a paucity of data for the most commonly used treatments of CIC such as fiber, lactulose, senna, and docusate". There was "variability in the definition of inclusion criteria, efficacy, and tolerability outcomes", and "Most of the included studies followed the patients for the short term, and the safety and tolerance of these medications in the long term is not well studied". For comparisons, "we grouped individual drugs against placebo arms and did not aim to inform on the relative efficacy of pharmacological agents", and "Network meta-analysis is an appropriate statistical method to facilitate indirect comparison against a common comparator such as placebo or other active treatment". Scope is limited as "This guideline is limited to covering pharmacological interventions for the treatment of CIC in otherwise healthy adults and does not apply to pediatric populations or to individuals who are pregnant or with opioid-induced constipation or malignancy". Regarding economics and participation, "we did not perform formal cost-effectiveness analyses" and "There was no patient representative in the guideline development panel, which is a limitation for this study".

AGA guideline methods and outcomes for IBS-C pharmacotherapy: This guideline represents the official recommendations of the AGA and was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, with development fully funded by the AGA Institute. Members of the guideline and TR panels were selected on the basis of their clinical and methodological expertise after undergoing a vetting process that required disclosing all conflicts of interest; the TR panel consisted of 2 content experts and a guideline methodologist, and the multidisciplinary guideline panel included a family medicine practitioner, general gastroenterologist, gastroenterologist with expertise in IBS, and a guideline methodologist. A protocol was developed a priori using the PICO format to specify patient population, intervention, comparator, and outcome(s), focusing on adults (aged 18 years and older) with IBS using symptom-based diagnostic criteria. Only CRITICAL and IMPORTANT outcomes were summarized in evidence profiles, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) responder end point for IBS-C was considered a CRITICAL outcome.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the medical management of opioid-induced constipation [^112cUotn]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Opioid-induced constipation — guideline scope, exclusions, and methodology specify that this guideline focuses on the medical management of OIC and does not address psychological therapy, alternative medicine approaches, surgery, or devices, and the guideline and technical review are not able to directly address questions regarding the diagnostic evaluation of OIC. Additionally, combination opioid agonists/antagonists are not specifically addressed by the technical review or guideline recommendation statements, though these agents may result in less constipation than pure opioid agonists when used for management of chronic pain. The AGA process for developing clinical practice guidelines incorporates GRADE methodology and best practices as outlined by the Institute of Medicine, and optimal understanding of this guideline will be enhanced by reading applicable portions of the technical review.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation in adults: a scoping review [^1121x3He]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recurrent abdominal pain and the temporal relationship between pain and defecation are currently the only indicators in the Rome IV criteria to differentiate IBS-C (constipation with abdominal pain) from FC (constipation alone). However, abdominal pain was also reported by FC patients, the severity and frequency of abdominal pain can change over time in both IBS-C and FC patients. The substantial overlap of symptoms in FC and IBS-C is supportive of the notion that they are part of a spectrum rather than separate gastrointestinal motility disorders, which present challenges for healthcare professionals in accurately differentiating between FC and IBS-C and assessing treatment response in both clinical practice and trials. Distinguishing these two disorders from each other is crucial for tailored treatment approaches and the development of new drugs. Moreover, considering the low diagnostic sensitivity of Rome IV criteria for IBS (62.7%) and FC (32.2%), the uncertainty can impact clinical decision-making, treatment selection, and the evaluation of therapeutic responses in both clinical practice and clinical trials.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are important for guiding different stakeholders, including clinicians and patients by promoting evidence-based practices. However, CPGs may vary significantly due to a number of reasons such as populations, definitions, and interpretations of the evidence. Identifying consistency between current CPGs could highlight variations in suggested clinical practices and illuminate the future study direction. To date, no study has systematically evaluated the consistency of current CPGs in diagnosing IBS-C and FC. We scoping reviewed the consistency across guidelines, aiming to provide a foundation for future improvements and clearer definitions within the FC-IBS-C diagnostic spectrum.

Chronic constipation — epidemiology, risk factors, and classification are outlined as follows: Constipation is one of the most common GI disorders seen in ambulatory medicine clinics and is a common reason for referral to a colorectal surgeon. Constipation has a worldwide prevalence of 15% and is more frequently diagnosed in North America and Europe compared with Asia. Risk factors for constipation include age greater than 65 years, female sex, inactivity, low socioeconomic status, low-fiber diet, and non-White race. Constipation is characterized by dysfunctional colonic motility and/or outlet dysfunction, and primary constipation can be classified into 3 subtypes: constipation with normal transit, constipation with delayed transit time, and outlet dysfunction constipation. Constipation with normal transit time and irritable bowel syndrome with associated constipation (IBS-C) comprise a group of functional bowel disorders with several overlapping symptoms.

### Surgery for constipation: systematic review and practice recommendations: graded practice and future research recommendations [^1151eA4o]. Colorectal Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

This manuscript forms the final of seven that address the surgical management of chronic constipation (CC) in adults. The content coalesces results from the five systematic reviews that precede it and of the European Consensus process to derive graded practice recommendations (GPR).

Methods

Summary of review data, development of GPR and future research recommendations as outlined in detail in the 'introduction and methods' paper.

Results

The overall quality of data in the five reviews was poor with 113/156(72.4%) of included studies providing only level IV evidence and only four included level I RCTs. Coalescence of data from the five procedural classes revealed that few firm conclusions could be drawn regarding procedural choice or patient selection: no single procedure dominated in addressing dynamic structural abnormalities of the anorectum and pelvic floor with each having similar overall efficacy. Of one hundred 'prototype' GPRs developed by the clinical guideline group, 85/100 were deemed 'appropriate' based on the independent scoring of a panel of 18 European experts and use of RAND-UCLA consensus methodology. The remaining 15 were all deemed uncertain. Future research recommendations included some potential RCTs but also a strong emphasis on delivery of large multinational high-quality prospective cohort studies.

Conclusion

While the evidence base for surgery in CC is poor, the widespread European consensus for GPRs is encouraging. Professional bodies have the opportunity to build on this work by supporting the efforts of their membership to help convert the documented recommendations into clinical guidelines.

### Constipation in the primary care setting: current concepts and misconceptions [^114TjbLA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Constipation is prevalent in Western societies and is a common illness in clinical practice. A broader clinical definition, which encompasses difficult and infrequent defecation, has aligned medical concepts with that of patients and the general population. Unfortunately, there are widespread misconceptions concerning the origins and management of constipation within both the lay and medical communities that influence recommendations by health care practitioners. This review highlights and seeks to correct some of these misconceptions and provide treatment guidelines for the practicing physician.

Conclusion

This scoping review of CPGs for the diagnosis of IBS-C and FC provided valuable insights into the overlapping definitions, current limitations, regional variations, and future directions in this field. To improve the diagnostic criteria, a short-term strategy involves implementing more comprehensive assessments and considering regional and cultural differences in symptom definitions. In the long term, a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in multi-omics along with the use of machine learning techniques, can significantly contribute to the diagnosis and management of constipation.

Review of currently available guidelines, recommendations and algorithms

A number of groups have provided recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of constipation;, however, no standardized treatment guidelines have gained acceptance in general medical practice. Although the evidence for a number of interventions (including modifications to diet and lifestyle) is weak or contradictory, all the guidelines recommend that these be tried before pharmacological intervention. In general, where treatment pathways are recommended, the sequence is:

Exclude other pathologies and secondary causes.,
Begin treatment with dietary and lifestyle adjustments.,
Move to osmotic laxatives, stool softeners and bulk-forming agents – there is no consensus on the order in which these should be tried.
Move to stimulant laxatives, suppositories and/or enemas,– some guidelines recommend medical supervision at this stage.
Surgery should be used as a last resort or to treat identified disorders that require surgical correction.

Although prokinetic agents feature in the two sets of US guidelines (Grade A recommendation), these are now out of date. Tegaserod has now been limited to emergency use in the US and has not received licensing approval in the EU. Prucalopride has recently received EU approval for the treatment of chronic constipation in women in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief; this is not mentioned in the guidelines.

Once organic disorders and obstructions have been excluded, a functional bowel disorder is the most likely explanation for the constipation. Most patients with chronic constipation report minimal abdominal bloating or discomfort associated with their other symptoms of chronic constipation; however, in some patients, as symptoms often overlap, it may be difficult to distinguish chronic constipation and IBS-C. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Chronic Constipation Task Force defined IBS-C as clinically important abdominal discomfort associated with symptoms of constipation. National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for IBS indicate a positive diagnosis only if the person has abdominal pain/discomfort that is either relieved by defecation, or associated with altered bowel frequency or stool form, and at least two of the following: altered stool passage; abdominal bloating, distension, tension, or hardness, symptoms made worse by eating and passage of mucus.

Chronic constipation is prevalent in Western countries and is a complaint that is commonly seen in clinical practice. Only a relatively small percentage of constipated patients seek medical evaluation and most can be managed satisfactorily with first-line, conservative therapy. In patients with severe, refractory constipation, additional studies of colonic and anorectal function have clinical utility, as such patients are candidates for therapies not given to most constipated patients. This article reviews the modern principles and therapies used to manage chronic constipation of varying severities.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^112t69Kc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a common disorder associated with significant impairment in quality of life. This clinical practice guideline, jointly developed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology, aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CIC in adults.

Methods

The American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that conducted systematic reviews of the following agents: fiber, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, magnesium oxide, lactulose), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 agonist (prucalopride). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each intervention. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop clinical recommendations based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations.

Results

The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for the pharmacological management of CIC in adults. Based on available evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the use of polyethylene glycol, sodium picosulfate, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride for CIC in adults. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of fiber, lactulose, senna, magnesium oxide, and lubiprostone.

Discussion

This document provides a comprehensive outline of the various over-the-counter and prescription pharmacological agents available for the treatment of CIC. The guidelines are meant to provide a framework for approaching the management of CIC; clinical providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences as well as medication cost and availability. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to help guide future research opportunities and enhance the care of patients with chronic constipation.

### British dietetic association guidelines for the dietary management of chronic constipation in adults [^1158712i]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Current clinical guidelines for chronic constipation offer limited dietary recommendations. The aim of this project was to develop the first comprehensive evidence-based dietary guidelines for the management of chronic constipation in adults.

Methods

Four systematic reviews and meta-analyses were performed to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The findings generated from the meta-analyses were then used to develop guideline statements using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and a Delphi consensus survey among a multidisciplinary expert Guideline Steering Committee. Recommendation statements were produced for treatment response, stool output, gut symptoms, adverse events, and quality of life, and only based on the findings where ≥ 2 RCTs contributed to the meta-analysis. The strength of recommendation was assessed using the GRADE approach. Consensus voting among the Guideline Steering Committee was performed using a modified Delphi survey approach.

Results

The four systematic reviews included a total of 75 RCTs. Fifty-nine dietary recommendation statements were generated and accepted through the Delphi survey. For dietary supplements, 15 recommendation statements relate to fiber supplements, 20 relate to probiotics, two to synbiotics, five to magnesium oxide, two to senna, and three to kiwifruit supplements. For foods, three recommendation statements related to kiwifruits, two to prunes, and two to rye bread. For drinks, five recommendation statements related to high mineral-containing water. No recommendations were made for whole diet approaches due to lack of evidence. Twelve statements had a very low level of evidence, 39 had a low level of evidence, and eight had moderate evidence. Twenty-seven statements were strong recommendations, and 32 were qualified recommendations.

Conclusions

These are the first comprehensive evidence-based dietary guidelines for the management of constipation based upon a robust systematic review and GRADE processes. Recommendations were made for dietary supplements, foods, and drinks that have never been previously included in clinical guidelines, and can now be rapidly implemented into clinical practice, thereby improving clinical care and patient outcomes.

Chronic constipation — use of objective symptom and quality-of-life measures: Objective measures assessing the nature, severity, and impact of constipation on quality of life can be useful when evaluating patients with constipation. Strength of recommendation: conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence. Although the Rome criteria are often used to identify constipation and its subtypes, these do not assess disease severity, so instruments including the Constipation Assessment Scale, the Constipation Scoring System, the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom Questionnaire, the Knowles-Eccersley-Scott Symptom Score, the Garrigues Questionnaire, the Chinese Constipation Questionnaire, and the Constipation Severity Instrument are used. The Pelvic Floor Disorders Consortium recommended using the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom Questionnaire and the Constipation Severity Instrument when assessing patients with constipation.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline — plecanatide for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) — The AGA suggests using plecanatide in patients with IBS-C (Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty). Plecanatide is FDA-approved for the treatment of IBS-C and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) at a dosage of 3 mg once daily. In 2 large phase 3 trials over 12 weeks, 814 patients received plecanatide 3 mg and 818 received placebo; plecanatide achieved greater response by the FDA IBS-C end point (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.83–0.92), with 27.4% vs 16.9% meeting the FDA end point. Individual outcomes showed improvement in abdominal pain (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81–0.92; risk difference 10.1%) and CSBM (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79–0.91; risk difference 10.9%). Diarrhea was the most common adverse event, reported in 4.3% with plecanatide vs 1% with placebo, leading to discontinuation in 1.2% vs 0%; SAEs occurred in 0.8%, there were no diarrhea-related SAEs, and 1 death (drowning) was deemed unrelated to the study drug.

Table 5
The detail recommendations information of 2 highly guidelines

However, our evaluation has several limitations. First, AGREEII rarely suggest how guidelines should select topics. To be useful, guidelines should address the challenges that clinicians face in practice, but developers may exclude clinically important topics when available evidence does not meet minimum standards. Second, inclusion criteria have a language restriction (English and Chinese), language search bias might happen. Third, we used only the AGREEII instrument evaluated the CPGs other than instruments may bring some selection bias. AGREEII instrument have been introduced from 2010, frankly speaking, guidelines published before 2010 did not have access to AGREEII to comply with it. Unfortunately, there is no difference when we compare the six domains quality before and after 2010. We can find even if methodological requirements for CPGs are reported comply with these remains unsatisfactory. What's more, how to spread the CPGs preferable is essential for clinical practice. Through above specific methodological quality analysis, which can effectively promote the development of future constipation CPGs.

### Chronic constipation: an evidence-based review [^111rCUZ8]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic constipation is a common condition seen in family practice among the elderly and women. There is no consensus regarding its exact definition, and it may be interpreted differently by physicians and patients. Physicians prescribe various treatments, and patients often adopt different over-the-counter remedies. Chronic constipation is either caused by slow colonic transit or pelvic floor dysfunction, and treatment differs accordingly.

Methods

To update our knowledge of chronic constipation and its etiology and best-evidence treatment, information was synthesized from articles published in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Levels of evidence and recommendations were made according to the Strength of Recommendation taxonomy.

Results

The standard advice of increasing dietary fibers, fluids, and exercise for relieving chronic constipation will only benefit patients with true deficiency. Biofeedback works best for constipation caused by pelvic floor dysfunction. Pharmacological agents increase bulk or water content in the bowel lumen or aim to stimulate bowel movements. Novel classes of compounds have emerged for treating chronic constipation, with promising clinical trial data. Finally, the link between senna abuse and colon cancer remains unsupported.

Conclusions

Chronic constipation should be managed according to its etiology and guided by the best evidence-based treatment.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic constipation [^116T7AVZ]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Chronic constipation — dietary and fiber-based initial management: The initial management of patients with symptomatic constipation involves dietary modifications and ensuring adequate fluid intake and fiber supplementation. Strength of recommendation: strong based on low-quality evidence. Dietary modification and increasing water and fiber consumption are considered firstline treatments in the management of constipation and are typically recommended before investigations of pelvic floor function and colonic motility are performed. In a randomized trial of 72 patients, ingesting a combination of soluble and insoluble fiber resulted in similar increased bowel motility but was better tolerated than using psyllium alone. Daily dietary fiber supplementation with oat bran has been shown to allow discontinuation of laxatives in 59% to 80% of elderly patients with chronic idiopathic constipation. However, 80% of patients with slow colonic transit and 63% of patients with constipation because of outlet obstruction may not respond adequately to increased dietary fiber, whereas 85% of patients with an underlying pathologic finding may see symptomatic improvement. Compared with placebo, soluble fiber improved global constipation symptoms (86.5% vs 47.4%, p < 0.001), straining (55.6% vs 28.6%, p = 0.003), and mean number of stools per week (3.8 stools per week after therapy compared with 2.9 stools per week at baseline). In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of female patients (n = 54) assigned to psyllium husk or placebo for 4 weeks, improvements related to fiber use included straining (55.2% vs 8.0%, p < 0.001), less than 3 BMs per week (86.2% vs 32%, p = 0.027), pain with BMs (58.6% vs 28.0%, p = 0.024), and less feeling of incomplete defecation (65.5% vs 16.0%, p < 0.001).

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation – a European perspective [^114yh8BM]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although constipation can be a chronic and severe problem, it is largely treated empirically. Evidence for the efficacy of some of the older laxatives from well-designed trials is limited. Patients often report high levels of dissatisfaction with their treatment, which is attributed to a lack of efficacy or unpleasant side-effects. Management guidelines and recommendations are limited and are not sufficiently current to include treatments that became available more recently, such as prokinetic agents in Europe.

Purpose

We present an overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, current management and available guidelines for the treatment of chronic constipation, and include recent data on the efficacy and potential clinical use of the more newly available therapeutic agents. Based on published algorithms and guidelines on the management of chronic constipation, secondary pathologies and causes are first excluded and then diet, lifestyle, and, if available, behavioral measures adopted. If these fail, bulk-forming, osmotic, and stimulant laxatives can be used. If symptoms are not satisfactorily resolved, a prokinetic agent such as prucalopride can be prescribed. Biofeedback is recommended as a treatment for chronic constipation in patients with disordered defecation. Surgery should only be considered once all other treatment options have been exhausted.

### ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN 2024 protocol for paediatric functional constipation treatment guidelines (standard operating procedure) [^113hmPSv]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Functional constipation (FC) is an extremely common problem in children of all ages worldwide, with a pooled prevalence of 9.5%. Constipation is often associated with sporadic or occasional and/or infrequent painful defaecation, faecal incontinence and abdominal pain and therefore causes significant distress to children, young people and their families. In addition, FC has a significant impact on healthcare services.

In 2014, the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) published a joint evidence-based guideline on the treatment of childhood constipation. Since then, many new studies have been published. Additionally, the diagnostic criteria have been updated with the publication of the latest Rome-IV criteria for paediatric FC. The final area of significant development relates to the methodological advances within guideline development, most notably within the procedures of the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) approach to both appraising evidence and producing guidelines.

This protocol describes the prospectively designed and agreed standard operating procedures that will be followed to produce a GRADE international treatment guideline, seeking to include recommendations for all approaches, used in clinical practice today. The final guideline will additionally consider faecal impaction (FI) and refractory constipation (RC) as well as the surgical management of constipation. The final guideline will contain the official recommendations of the Guideline Development Group (GDG) on all treatment aspects.

The guideline will support health professionals, patients and their families. The methods used for technical review, GRADE analysis and decision-making will allow its dissemination. The prospective publishing of this document is part of that process of systematic guideline production.

Chronic constipation — colonoscopy indications and colorectal neoplasia yield are summarized as follows: A meta-analysis of 8 cross-sectional studies found that constipation alone, as a presenting symptom, was not associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. In a retrospective study of 985 patients who underwent colonoscopy as part of their evaluation for constipation, the polyp detection rate was 9.7%, and 9 patients (6.3%) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. In general, a colonoscopy should be recommended if patients meet guideline criteria for general screening or if patients present with concerning symptoms, such as hematochezia, weight loss, or change in bowel habits; have a strong family history of colorectal cancer; or have anemia and warrant further investigation.

Methods

The study was presented based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The checklist was attached in Supplementary File 1. The review protocol could be assessed in Supplementary File 2.

Search strategy

We comprehensively searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases from January 1, 2012 to July 18, 2024. We also browsed webpages of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), World Health Organization (WHO), World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO), the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), Chinese Society of Gastroenterology (CSGE). The search terms used, including "constipation", "irritable bowel syndrome", "guideline", "statement", "consensus", and "recommendation", along with their corresponding synonyms, were detailed in the Supplementary File 3.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria were: 1) The title included the terms "constipation/irritable bowel syndrome" and "guideline/statement/consensus/recommendation"; 2) The guidelines were developed by national authorities, international academic associations, or professional administration organizations; 3) Target population was adult (≥ 18 years old); 4) the latest updated CPG version from the same institution. The exclusion criterion: without diagnostic criteria. There was no restriction on language.

CPG selection

Firstly, two reviewers (JYL and WLT) independently screened the titles and abstracts after eliminating duplicates. After that the full texts were reviewed to identify relevant CPGs. Disagreement was resolved by discussing and consulting a third researcher (ZXB).

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation – a European perspective [^114xeRU3]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

As previously mentioned, guidelines and algorithms for the management and treatment of chronic constipation have not taken into account more recent therapeutic developments. Although a new set of Rome Foundation diagnostic algorithms covering the diagnosis and management of FGIDs including chronic constipationand refractory constipationhave been recently published, newer agents have not been included. According to these guidelines, patients with constipation that is refractory to a high-fiber diet and traditional laxatives should be referred for physiological testing, such as anorectal manometry, rectal balloon expulsion, and colon transit. Now, with the recent availability of prokinetic agents such as prucalopride, an additional therapeutic step can be added to these existing guidelines. Once idiopathic chronic constipation has been identified, and IBS and secondary constipation have been excluded, empirical treatment with osmotic and/or stimulant laxatives should be employed. Following this, if patients still experience continuous symptoms (e.g. bloating, abdominal discomfort and incomplete bowel movements), a prokinetic agent such as prucalopride could be considered (Fig. 2). If constipation symptoms are refractory to pharmacological treatment, patients should be referred for physiological testing as outlined in the published Rome algorithm for refractive constipation and difficult defecation (Fig. 3). Patients should only be referred for surgery following colon transit testing without, and then with, laxatives.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation in adults: a scoping review [^117NDFyv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

This review has several limitations. Considering the update frequency of CPGs, we only included CPGs from the last decade (2012–2024) in the article. As new evidence continues to emerge, the CPGs included at different periods can only make recommendations based on the evidence available at that time. Second, the review may be subject to publication bias, as CPGs that are more rigorously developed or updated may be more likely to be published and indexed in the databases searched. This review focused exclusively on CPGs, potentially overlooking valuable insights and evidence from primary research studies or systematic reviews that are not encapsulated in guideline documents. In addition, this review did not assess the methodological rigor of CPGs, which vary in quality and evidence strength. This review analyzed regional differences in diagnostic criteria descriptively, as the small sample size of included CPGs limited the feasibility of statistical testing. Future studies with a larger dataset could explore statistical comparisons to assess the significance of regional variations. This study may not include CPGs from private organizations or regional medical societies that have not been published in the searched databases, which could limit the diversity of perspectives or practical insights on IBS-C and FC diagnosis. In addition, only including the latest version of each guideline may introduce bias, as older versions could provide insights into evolving diagnostic practices and trends.

### MASCC recommendations on the management of constipation in patients with advanced cancer [^113Y2dpR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The Palliative Care Study Group of the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer formed a subgroup to develop evidence-based recommendations on the management of constipation in patients with advanced cancer.

Methods

These recommendations were developed in accordance with the MASCC Guidelines Policy. A search strategy for Medline was developed, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were explored for relevant reviews/trials respectively. The recommendations were categorised by the level of evidence and a "category of guideline" based on the level of evidence (i.e. "recommendation", "suggestion", or "no guideline possible").

Results

The group produced 15 recommendations, with varying levels of evidence and so varying categories of guideline. The recommendations relate to the assessment, the treatment, and the re-assessment of constipation.

Conclusions

These recommendations provide a framework for the management of constipation in advanced cancer, although every patient needs individualised management.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^117GDYUs]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of gut-brain interaction associated with significant disease burden. This American Gastroenterological Association guideline is intended to support practitioners in decisions about the use of medications for the pharmacological management of IBS-C and is an update of a prior technical review and guideline.

Methods

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess evidence and make recommendations. The technical review panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients and conducted an evidence review of the following agents: tenapanor, plecanatide, linaclotide, tegaserod, lubiprostone, polyethylene glycol laxatives, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and antispasmodics. The Guideline Panel reviewed the evidence and used the Evidence-to-Decision Framework to develop recommendations.

Conclusions

The panel agreed on 9 recommendations for the management of patients with IBS-C. The panel made a strong recommendation for linaclotide (high certainty) and conditional recommendations for tenapanor, plecanatide, tegaserod, and lubiprostone (moderate certainty), polyethylene glycol laxatives, tricyclic antidepressants, and antispasmodics (low certainty). The panel made a conditional recommendation against the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (low certainty).

### Clinical practice guidelines from the French national society of coloproctology in treating chronic constipation [^116iUvDq]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a common symptom that regularly affects the quality of life of adult patients. Its treatment is mainly based on dietary rules, laxative drugs, perineal rehabilitation and surgical treatment. The French National Society of Coloproctology offers clinical practice recommendations on the basis of the data in the current literature, including those on recently developed treatments. Most are noninvasive, and the main concepts include the following: stimulant laxatives are now considered safe drugs and can be more easily prescribed as a second-line treatment; biofeedback therapy remains the gold standard for the treatment of anorectal dyssynergia that is resistant to medical treatment; transanal irrigation is the second-line treatment of choice in patients with neurological diseases, but it may also be proposed for patients without neurological diseases; and although interferential therapy may be a new promising treatment, it needs further evaluation.

Results

CPG characteristics

The electronic and additional searches resulted in 1320 records. After screening the titles, abstracts and full texts, a total of 27 CPGs between 2012 to 2024 were included. The identification process was shown in Fig. 1. Table 1 details the characteristics of the 27 CPGs included in the review. Of the included CPGs, 14 for IBS-C diagnostic criteria, 9 for FC, and 4 for both IBS-C and FC (references of included CPGs were listed in Supplementary File 4). Included CPGs were from different continents, with 13 from Asia, 8 from Europe and 6 from America. 96.3% included CPGs provided guidance on both diagnosis and treatment/management, with one CPG focusing solely on diagnosis.

"-" indicates that the criterion is not mentioned in the guideline. The references of the 27 reviewed guidelines are listed in the supplementary file 4. IBS-C: constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome; FC: functional constipation

Application of diagnostic criteria

The Rome IV criteria were the most commonly applied by the included CPGs (59.3%), followed by Rome III criteria (22.2%). 7.4% CPGs applied pathophysiology classification criteria. They classified constipation into normal transit constipation, slow transit constipation and defecatory disorder based on colonic transit time test, anorectal manometry balloon expulsion test or barium/magnetic resonance defecography. Two CPGs (7.4%) applied both Rome III and IV as the diagnostic criteria. One IBS-C CPG from NICE used their own diagnostic criteria including abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, distension, tension or hardness, change in bowel habit, symptoms made worse by eating, passage of mucus. Details of the recommendations from each CPG could be found in Table 2.

### Consensus recommendations on initiating prescription therapies for opioid-induced constipation [^1163J2zK]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Strategies for the management of pain commonly involve the use of opioid analgesics coupled with appropriate vigilance in patient selection and monitoring 1. The analgesic efficacy of many opioids is attributable to actions exerted by these agents via µ‐opioid receptors in the central nervous system 2. Because µ‐opioid receptors are also expressed throughout body tissues including the gastrointestinal tract 2, opioid analgesics are often associated with various types of opioid bowel dysfunction (OBD) 3, 4. Opioid‐induced constipation (OIC) is the most prevalent OBD and is caused by opioid‐mediated reductions in small intestinal and colonic transit, increased fluid absorption, inhibition of gastrointestinal chloride secretion, and stimulation or decreased relaxation of the pyloric and internal anal sphincters 4, 5, 6, 7. The condition has been reported in up to 47% of opioid‐treated patients and may occur at a higher incidence in women and with increasing age; the greatest risk factor is a longer duration of opioid therapy 8. Furthermore, OIC imposes a substantial burden on quality of life (QOL), reduces work productivity, impairs effectiveness of pain management, and can lead to clinically significant physical sequelae such as those related to bowel obstruction and fecal impaction 9, 10.

Although the current Rome III diagnostic criteria provide a multifaceted definition of functional constipation 11, this condition is not opioid related, and a standardized OIC‐focused definition is needed 12. In 2014, a multidisciplinary consensus group proposed defining OIC as a change from baseline bowel habits upon initiation of opioids that is characterized by any of the following symptoms: (1) reduced bowel movement (BM) frequency; (2) development or worsening of straining to pass stool; (3) a sense of incomplete rectal evacuation; or (4) harder stool consistency 3. In a 2015 systematic review, outcomes including BM frequency, stool consistency, straining, and QOL were suggested for use in OIC clinical trials 12. However, the appropriateness of using these or other outcomes for assessing OIC in clinical practice has not been determined.

Lactulose — chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults who fail or are intolerant to over-the-counter (OTC) therapies: The panel suggests the use of lactulose over management without lactulose (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Two RCTs in elderly participants evaluated lactulose syrup, including a multicenter Netherlands study with 103 participants using an initial dose of 15 mL of 50% lactulose daily for 3 weeks, with dose reduced by half after 3 consecutive days with defecation, doubled if no defecation occurred for more than 48 hours, then reduced back to 15 mL after 3 consecutive days; a U.S. study included 55 participants who received 30 mL daily at bedtime for 12 weeks. Lactulose is approved by the FDA for constipation at 10–20 g (15–30 mL or 1–2 packets) daily and may be increased to 40 g (60 mL or 2–4 packets) daily if needed. Bloating and flatulence are dose-dependent and common side effects, which may limit its use in clinical practice.

### Recognizing and defining occasional constipation: expert consensus recommendations [^113PDBZJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Constipation is a common problem, affects 15% of the population, and is often self-diagnosed and self-managed. Over the past 3 decades, there have been significant advances in our understanding and management of chronic constipation, with the emerging recognition that occasional constipation (OC) is another subtype that falls outside current classifications. The purpose of this review was to describe the process of developing and proposing a new definition for OC based on expert consensus and taking into consideration the multifactorial nature of the problem such as alterations in bowel habit that include stool frequency and difficulty with stool passage, perception of the sufferer, duration of symptoms, and potential responsiveness to treatment. Leading gastroenterologists from 5 countries met virtually on multiple occasions through an online digital platform to discuss the problem of OC and recommended a practical, user-friendly definition: "OC can be defined as intermittent or occasional symptomatic alteration(s) in bowel habit. This includes a bothersome reduction in the frequency of bowel movements and/or difficulty with passage of stools but without alarming features. Bowel symptoms may last for a few days or a few weeks, and episodes may require modification of lifestyle, dietary habits and/or use of over-the-counter laxatives or bulking agents to restore a satisfactory bowel habit". Prospective studies are required to validate this definition and determine OC prevalence in the community. This review highlights current knowledge gaps and could provide impetus for future research to facilitate an improved understanding of OC and development of evidence-based management guidelines.
