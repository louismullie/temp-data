## Question

Quetiapine fumarate PO dosing is it used for dementia sindowners

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether quetiapine fumarate taken orally is used for dementia-related "sundowning" and what the appropriate dosing would be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "sundowning" represents clinically and whether it changes the treatment framework. Then, I should verify quetiapine's regulatory status and boxed warnings in dementia, followed by an appraisal of efficacy data for agitation and related BPSD. Next, I will review guideline recommendations, consider if any evidence-based dosing paradigms exist when quetiapine is used off-label, lay out safety monitoring and discontinuation rules, and finally compare better-supported alternatives and nonpharmacologic strategies before concluding with a practical synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and clinical target. "Sundowning" refers to late afternoon or evening exacerbations of confusion, agitation, restlessness, or behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia and is considered part of the broader behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia rather than a discrete diagnosis, which means management follows BPSD principles emphasizing nonpharmacologic interventions first while reserving medications for severe, dangerous, or highly distressing symptoms refractory to environmental and caregiving modifications [^115fpye1] [^117DZFDW].

> I need to check the regulatory status for quetiapine in this population. Quetiapine carries a boxed warning for increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis and is not approved for this indication; labels explicitly advise against use for dementia-related psychosis due to higher risks of death and cerebrovascular events, and meta-analyses corroborate increased mortality with atypical antipsychotics in dementia, so at face value one might call it "contraindicated", but wait, let me verify the labeling language more precisely because it is technically "not approved" with a boxed warning rather than a formal contraindication, which still translates into a very high risk threshold for any off-label consideration [^113ZYVxF] [^113Zv52s] [^115gZhha].

> Next, I should review the efficacy signal for quetiapine in dementia agitation to see if there is any justification for use in sundowning specifically. The CATIE-AD trial showed quetiapine at a mean dose of roughly 56.5 mg/day did not outperform placebo on global effectiveness and was inferior to risperidone and olanzapine for time to discontinuation for lack of efficacy, with tolerability favoring placebo, and European guidance synthesizing randomized trials concludes quetiapine's benefits are inconsistent at best, with no dedicated randomized evidence for sundowning per se and generally modest or absent effect sizes compared with other atypicals, which aligns with broader off-label reviews showing small benefits for some atypicals but not a compelling signal for quetiapine in dementia agitation [^114PoC9D] [^116uyFQF] [^116jgK9C] [^116F3g2v].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without aligning with current guidelines. Authoritative guidance recommends antipsychotics only when symptoms are severe, dangerous, or cause marked distress and after nonpharmacologic strategies have failed, with explicit advice to avoid routine antipsychotic use and to reassess frequently with plans to taper and discontinue as soon as clinically feasible, while when medication is unavoidable, risperidone has comparatively stronger short-term evidence and brexpiprazole now has an FDA-supported role for agitation in Alzheimer's disease, so quetiapine is not a preferred agent in this context and any use should be last-resort and time-limited with shared decision-making about risks [^113PJYw6] [^112kzRYg] [^116jgK9C] [^1148tZwJ].

> Now, regarding dosing, I should confirm whether there is any evidence-based quetiapine regimen for sundowning; hmm, wait a minute, there are no trials targeting sundowning specifically, and trials in Alzheimer's agitation used flexible oral doses commonly clustering around 25–200 mg/day with a mean near 50–60 mg/day, so if quetiapine is used off-label as a last resort, a conservative bedtime start at 25 mg with slow 25 mg increments every 3–7 days toward 50–100 mg/day makes pharmacologic and geriatric sense given the short half-life of about 6 hours and modest absorption increase with food, and I should double-check that pushing beyond 100 mg adds benefit; actually, data do not show improved outcomes at higher doses and tolerability worsens, so I would plan a 4–12 week time-limited trial with an a priori taper strategy if there is no clear benefit by week 4 [^114PoC9D] [^116uyFQF] [^1175oEd7] [^117MKpYe].

> I need to ensure safety monitoring is explicit and disciplined. Before and during treatment, I will measure orthostatic vitals, gait and fall risk, sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, cerebrovascular risk factors, and metabolic parameters, avoid long-acting injectables in dementia, use quantitative agitation or BPSD scales to gauge response, and discontinue if there is no clinically meaningful response after about 4 weeks or if harms emerge, bearing in mind the class mortality signal and rare but serious interactions, for example reported intracerebral hemorrhages in older adults when combined with warfarin, which warrants heightened vigilance and medication review [^114VRDJN] [^1137QfpY] [^117MKpYe] [^115gZhha] [^112ZmqWS].

> But wait, what if we can avoid antipsychotics altogether by targeting sundowning mechanisms. Let me reconsider first-line measures such as consistent routines, optimizing lighting and daytime activity, minimizing evening overstimulation, attending to pain, sleep hygiene, and caregiver strategies, because these interventions have the strongest benefit-risk profile and should be optimized before any pharmacotherapy in sundowning-type BPSD presentations to reduce evening agitation without medication harms [^115fpye1] [^117DZFDW].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic alternatives with better evidentiary footing if symptoms remain severe after nonpharmacologic optimization. Risperidone has the most consistent short-term efficacy signal for agitation at low doses with the same boxed warning considerations, and brexpiprazole now has supportive recommendations for Alzheimer's agitation; for serotonergic options, older guidance allowed trazodone or SSRIs in selected patients with mild agitation or antipsychotic sensitivity, yet I should double-check recent consensus because I see a conflict: one Canadian 2025 guideline supports citalopram for moderate agitation, whereas another advises avoiding trazodone and several antidepressants for agitation in dementia, so any SSRI use should be individualized, ECG-informed for QTc with citalopram, and anchored in shared decision-making about goals and risks, with close monitoring of cognition and falls [^117HxWTY] [^1148tZwJ] [^113bDGT1] [^112jaRFX] [^112PQqXL] [^112jEBM3].

> I will now examine timing considerations specific to sundowning. Given quetiapine's approximately 6-hour half-life and evening symptom peak, if it is used off-label as a last resort, an initial bedtime dose may cover nocturnal agitation, but hold on, I should verify whether earlier evening dosing might better intercept the late-afternoon rise in symptoms; practically, either late afternoon or early evening administration can be trialed with careful observation and documentation of temporal symptom patterns and adverse effects, while still adhering to the lowest effective dose and shortest possible duration principle [^1175oEd7].

> Final synthesis: Quetiapine has no FDA-approved role for dementia-related sundowning and carries a boxed warning for increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, with inconsistent efficacy for agitation and inferior effectiveness versus some comparators, so it should generally be avoided in this context; if, despite optimized nonpharmacologic efforts, symptoms remain severe or dangerous and alternatives are ineffective or contraindicated, an off-label, time-limited trial may begin at 25 mg PO in the evening with slow 25 mg increments toward 50–100 mg/day, with explicit 4-week stop rules for nonresponse, meticulous safety monitoring, and early tapering, while preferred options in many cases include nonpharmacologic strategies as first-line and, when medication is unavoidable, agents with stronger support such as risperidone or brexpiprazole used at low doses and short durations within a structured reassessment and discontinuation plan [^113ZYVxF] [^114PoC9D] [^113PJYw6] [^1148tZwJ] [^117MKpYe].

---

Quetiapine fumarate PO is **not recommended for routine management** [^116e5BYn] of dementia-related sundowning due to limited efficacy and significant risks, including increased mortality and cerebrovascular events [^115gZhha] [^113ZYVxF]. It should **only be considered when nonpharmacologic measures have failed** [^112kzRYg] and symptoms are severe or dangerous [^111YgjJr], using the lowest effective dose (typically 12.5–25 mg PO qHS) [^1154hXnz] with close monitoring and a plan to taper within 4 months if effective [^1113WtHS]. Nonpharmacologic interventions remain first-line [^111XXFqk] [^117DZFDW], and risperidone or brexpiprazole are preferred if antipsychotics are necessary [^117HxWTY] [^1148tZwJ].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Efficacy**: Evidence for quetiapine in dementia-related agitation is limited and mixed; some studies show no significant benefit over placebo [^114PoC9D], while others report modest improvements [^114DcgFB] [^115yZEmg].

- **Safety**: Quetiapine carries significant risks in elderly dementia patients, including increased mortality [^115gZhha], cerebrovascular events [^113ZYVxF], sedation, orthostatic hypotension, falls, metabolic disturbances, and cognitive worsening [^114DcgFB] [^117BhJ9t].

- **Guidelines**: Major guidelines (APA, AAFP, EAN) [^117HxWTY] recommend antipsychotics only when symptoms are severe, dangerous, or cause significant distress [^111YgjJr], and after nonpharmacologic interventions have failed [^112kzRYg].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

- **Initial dose**: 12.5–25 mg PO at bedtime (qHS) [^1154hXnz], titrated cautiously based on response and tolerability [^117DZFDW].

- **Maximum dose**: Generally not exceeding 100 mg/day in elderly dementia patients due to increased risk of adverse effects.

- **Duration**: Short-term use only, with regular reassessment [^113PJYw6]. If effective, attempt tapering within 4 months [^1113WtHS]; discontinue if no response after 4 weeks [^117MKpYe].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

Monitoring should include regular assessment [^1137QfpY] for **sedation, orthostatic hypotension, falls, metabolic disturbances, cognitive decline, and extrapyramidal symptoms**. Discontinuation is indicated if **no clinically significant response** is observed after 4 weeks [^117MKpYe] or if **significant adverse effects** occur, with tapering to stop therapy [^1117pew8].

---

## Alternative pharmacological options

- **Risperidone**: Preferred first-line antipsychotic [^117HxWTY] for severe agitation or psychosis in dementia, with stronger evidence of efficacy [^116jgK9C].

- **Brexpiprazole**: Recently recommended for agitation in Alzheimer's disease [^1148tZwJ].

- **Citalopram**: Considered for moderate agitation or psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease [^112jaRFX].

---

## Nonpharmacological interventions

Nonpharmacologic interventions are **first-line** [^112kzRYg], including environmental modifications (consistent routines, adequate lighting, minimizing noise and stimulation) and behavioral strategies (caregiver education, structured activities, addressing unmet needs) [^117DZFDW]. Sleep hygiene measures include maintaining regular sleep–wake cycles, avoiding caffeine and other stimulants, and using evening relaxation techniques [^115fpye1].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Quetiapine fumarate PO is **not recommended for routine management** of dementia-related sundowning due to limited efficacy and significant risks [^116e5BYn]. Reserve its use for cases where nonpharmacologic interventions have failed and symptoms are severe or dangerous [^111YgjJr], employing the **lowest effective dose** with close monitoring and a plan to taper within 4 months if effective [^1113WtHS]. Nonpharmacologic interventions remain first-line [^112kzRYg], and risperidone or brexpiprazole are preferred if an antipsychotic is necessary [^117HxWTY] [^1148tZwJ].

### Behavioral disorders in dementia: Appropriate nondrug interventions and antipsychotic use [^117DZFDW]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia pose management challenges for caregivers and clinicians. First-line nonpharmacologic treatments include eliminating physical and emotional stressors, modifying the patient's environment, and establishing daily routines. Family members and caregivers benefit from education about dementia symptoms and reminders that the behaviors are normal and unintentional. Cognitive and emotion-oriented interventions, sensory stimulation interventions, behavior management techniques, and other psychosocial interventions are modestly effective.

In refractory cases, physicians may choose to prescribe off-label antipsychotics. Aripiprazole has the most consistent evidence of symptom improvement; however, this improvement is small. Olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone have inconsistent evidence of benefit. Physicians should use the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible duration to minimize adverse effects, most notably an increased mortality risk. Other adverse effects include anticholinergic and antidopaminergic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, postural hypotension, metabolic syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia, and sedation. Patients should be monitored for these effects while receiving treatment; however, laboratory monitoring may be limited to patients receiving long-term therapy.

Research question 4.1: Should patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior be treated with modern (atypical) antipsychotics compared to no pharmacological treatment?

- **PICO question**:
	- **Population**: Patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior.
	- **Intervention**: Treatment with aripiprazole, zotepine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or clozapine.
	- **Comparator**: No pharmacological treatment.
	- **Outcome**:
		1. Mortality (Important)
		2. Agitation/Aggression (Critical)
		3. Global cognitive function (Important)
		4. Serious adverse events (Critical)
		5. Caregiver burden (Important)

- **Summary of evidence**:
	- A total of 4,058 references were screened, and seven references were included. Two references reported on different outcomes from the same study. All studies included were RCTs focusing on risperidone (0.25 to 2 mg), quetiapine (25 to 200 mg), or olanzapine (2.5 to 15 mg). Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity in populations, length of interventions, and outcome measures. There were no differences in mortality between interventions and across studies (relative risk point estimates 0.85–2.08; not significant) or serious adverse events (relative risk point estimates 0.89–1.9; not significant in all but one study). However, there were very few events for the two outcomes, possibly due to the relatively low number of patients and the short length of included trials (6–36 weeks; four studies ≤ 12 weeks). For both global cognitive function and other outcomes, further detailed analysis is necessary.

### Effectiveness of atypical antipsychotic drugs in patients with Alzheimer's disease [^114PoC9D]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs are widely used to treat psychosis, aggression, and agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but their benefits are uncertain and concerns about safety have emerged. We evaluated the effectiveness of atypical antipsychotic drugs in outpatients with Alzheimer's disease.

- **Methods**: In this 42-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 421 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease and psychosis, aggression, or agitation were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (mean dose, 5.5 mg per day), quetiapine (mean dose, 56.5 mg per day), risperidone (mean dose, 1.0 mg per day), or placebo. Doses were adjusted as needed, and patients were followed for up to 36 weeks. The main outcomes were the time from initial treatment to the discontinuation of treatment for any reason and the number of patients with at least minimal improvement on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 12 weeks.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences among treatments regarding the time to the discontinuation of treatment for any reason: olanzapine (median, 8.1 weeks), quetiapine (median, 5.3 weeks), risperidone (median, 7.4 weeks), and placebo (median, 8.0 weeks) (P = 0.52). The median time to the discontinuation of treatment due to a lack of efficacy favored olanzapine (22.1 weeks) and risperidone (26.7 weeks) as compared with quetiapine (9.1 weeks) and placebo (9.0 weeks) (P = 0.002). The time to the discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events or intolerability favored placebo. Overall, 24% of patients who received treatment…

Regarding the medical management for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, particularly concerning antipsychotics, choice of agent, and dosage, the EAN 2020 guidelines recommend considering atypical antipsychotics. Risperidone is suggested as the first-line option over haloperidol when pharmacological treatment of agitation or aggressive behavior is required in patients with dementia and agitation/aggressive behavior.

### Real-world treatment patterns and characteristics among patients with agitation and dementia in the United States: Findings from a large, observational, retrospective chart review [^115C8tdx]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Low credibility.

The most common antipsychotic treatments initiated on the index date for the treatment of agitation related to dementia/Alzheimer's disease were quetiapine (35.2%), risperidone (20.0%), and olanzapine (13.0%).

- **Antipsychotic treatment**: Received for agitation related to dementia/Alzheimer's disease among patients with agitation and dementia initiated on an antipsychotic in residential care and community-based settings on the index date. Antipsychotic agents received on the index date were statistically different between residential care and community-based settings at the 5% level. Other antipsychotic agents initiated on the index date included paliperidone (0.7%), olanzapine and fluoxetine (0.7%), aripiprazole lauroxil (0.6%), asenapine (0.4%), brexpiprazole (0.4%), chlorpromazine (0.4%), cariprazine (0.2%), loxapine (0.1%), and pimozide (0.1%). The index treatment was unknown for one patient (0.1%).

Antipsychotic discontinuation rates overall were significantly higher among patients with dementia and agitation in the residential care setting versus the community-based setting (log rank, p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in antipsychotic discontinuation rates at 30, 60, and 90 days.

- **Antipsychotic discontinuation rate**: Among patients with agitation and dementia initiated on an antipsychotic, the most frequent reasons for discontinuation of the treatment initiated on the index date among patients (n = 16) in the residential care setting were insufficient.

### Psychosis as a treatment target in dementia: A roadmap for designing interventions [^1172gCJD]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

The course of psychosis and resulting behavioral disturbances is an important consideration. The frequency and severity of these symptoms change over time, with some patients even experiencing resolution of their psychotic symptoms within several months. Therefore, treatment discontinuation should be considered within a specific time frame after remission of symptoms. A recent Cochrane review demonstrated that in most studies, treatment discontinuation was not associated with significant behavioral worsening. Nevertheless, some patient subgroups, for example, those with more severe behavioral symptoms at baseline, specific types of psychotic symptoms, or those who have responded well to antipsychotic medications, may benefit from continued treatment.

To examine the effect of pharmacological interventions specifically in dementia-related psychosis (DRP), future clinical trials should be designed for more homogeneous patient populations. This includes patients with specific types of dementia and psychotic symptoms while excluding patients with behavioral disorders in the absence of psychosis. As previously discussed, the mechanisms underlying psychosis subtypes may differ by dementia type and severity. Additionally, disruptive behavioral symptoms of dementia, such as agitation or aggression, may appear in the absence of psychosis. Inclusion of patients with these symptoms, but without psychosis, in clinical trials may affect the results. A deeper understanding of the biology underlying specific psychosis subtypes will enable optimal patient selection in future studies.

### Multiple intracerebral hemorrhages in an elderly patient after adding quetiapine to a stable warfarin regimen [^112ZmqWS]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The efficacy of antipsychotics in patients with dementia exhibiting psychiatric symptoms has been overshadowed by safety concerns in recent years. Evidence suggests that the long-term use of antipsychotics in older adults is associated with a greater risk of cerebrovascular adverse events than accrues with short-term use (less than 30 days) [J Clin Psychiatry. 2010;71(6):689–98]. Here, we present an elderly male patient with dementia who developed multiple intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) 3 days after the addition of quetiapine to his stable warfarin regimen. To our knowledge, this is the second case of possible interaction between quetiapine and warfarin. We suggest mechanisms that may account for the patient's clinical presentation and highlight that combining treatment with quetiapine and warfarin may cause serious complications in patients with risk factors for ICH.

### Use of quetiapine in elderly patients [^1164jMMg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Behavioral problems associated with psychosis in the elderly have a significant negative impact on patients' quality of life and can lead to placement in a nursing home. Because of their decreased propensity to produce extrapyramidal symptoms, atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine hold promise in the treatment of these vulnerable patients. Quetiapine may, in theory, be particularly advantageous in this regard because of its lack of anticholinergic activity and its relatively loose binding to dopamine receptors. This article reviews the somewhat limited number of clinical studies on the use of quetiapine in treating older patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, including those with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, and patients with Parkinson's disease and drug-induced psychosis.

### Antipsychotics and dementia in Canada: A retrospective cross-sectional study of four health sectors [^112pZoEj]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic medications are not recommended for the management of symptoms of dementia, particularly among persons with no behavioral or psychological symptoms. We examine patterns of antipsychotic medication use among persons with dementia across health sectors in Canada, focusing on factors related to use among those without behavioral or psychotic symptoms.

- **Methods**: Using a retrospective cross-sectional design, this study examines antipsychotic use among adults aged 65 or older with dementia in home care (HC), complex continuing care (CCC), long-term care (LTC), and among alternate level care patients in acute hospitals (ALC). Utilizing clinical data from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014, the prevalence of antipsychotic medication use was estimated by the presence of behavioral and psychotic symptoms. Logistic regression was employed to identify sector-specific factors associated with antipsychotic use in the absence of behavioral and psychotic symptoms.

- **Results**: The total prevalence of antipsychotic use among older adults with dementia was 19% in HC, 42% in ALC, 35% in CCC, and 37% in LTC. This prevalence ranged from 39% (HC) to 70% (ALC) for those with both behavioral and psychotic symptoms, and from 12% (HC) to 32% (ALC) among those with no symptoms. The regression models identified several variables related to antipsychotic use in the absence of behavioral or psychotic symptoms, such as bipolar disorder (OR = 5.63 in CCC; OR = 5.52 in LTC), anxious complaints (OR = 1.54 in LTC to 2.01 in CCC), and wandering (OR = 1.83 in ALC).

### A European Academy of Neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^114DcgFB]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Aggression or agitation may occur during the course of dementia without obvious reasons or when patients experience stress, such as changes in the environment during hospitalization, resulting from a physical condition or as side effects of drug treatment. Several meta-analyses have indicated that the efficacy of antipsychotics for treating agitation/aggression in dementia patients is modest and is associated with increased mortality and a higher risk of cerebrovascular accidents [50, 51, 52]. In 2007, European regulatory agencies and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued warnings about the use of atypical antipsychotics in dementia patients. This was extended by the European Medicines Agency in 2008 and by the FDA in 2009 to include a warning on the use of all antipsychotics. This decision was partly based on several large observational studies and meta-analyses showing increased mortality associated with treatment [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59], which has been confirmed in subsequent studies [2, 60].

Antipsychotics, however, may be considered as first-line pharmacological treatment for agitation/aggression under certain conditions, such as when all non-pharmacological measures have been inadequate or in cases of severe self-harm or harm to others [61]. This includes the use of risperidone, haloperidol, and aripiprazole. Antipsychotics provide modest short-term benefits for treating aggression/agitation in dementia [50, 51, 52].

### Treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in dementia: An individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials [^111mYyMc]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

There are approximately 57 million people living with dementia, and this number is projected to increase to nearly 158 million cases by 2050. Throughout the course of dementia, individuals often exhibit changed behaviors associated with cognitive decline, commonly referred to as behaviors and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), or sometimes described as neuropsychiatric symptoms or responsive behaviors. These include manifestations such as psychosis, aggression, agitation, anxiety, depression, changes in sleep or appetite, and apathy. BPSD are prevalent among people with dementia, with estimates reaching 32% in community-dwelling populations and up to 90% in hospitalized patients and nursing home residents.

Antipsychotics are often used to manage BPSD in people living with dementia, with the prevalence reaching up to 37.5%. These symptoms vary widely between individuals, and evidence suggests that antipsychotics offer only modest benefits in treating psychosis and agitation in this population. Meanwhile, these medications can increase the risk of adverse events, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, and mortality in older people. In light of these risks, antipsychotics should only be initiated for severe symptoms or cases in which non-pharmacological approaches prove ineffective. Therefore, identifying treatment modifiers, which are patient-specific characteristics that define subgroups more likely to experience different benefits or risks from medication, can facilitate more targeted and effective treatment strategies. Additionally, exploring predictors of therape

In regard to the medical management of dementia, particularly concerning the management of agitation, the APA 2016 guidelines recommend discussing the potential tapering of antipsychotics with the patient (if clinically feasible) and with the patient's surrogate decision-maker (when relevant), incorporating input from family or others involved with the patient in the event of a positive response to treatment. The guidelines advise eliciting preferences and concerns and reviewing the initial goals, observed benefits, side effects of antipsychotic treatment, potential risks of continued exposure to antipsychotics, and past experiences with antipsychotic medication trials and tapering attempts.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline on the use of antipsychotics to treat agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia [^111VDr7x]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of dementia, specifically concerning the management of agitation, the APA 2016 guidelines recommend assessing symptoms at least monthly during the tapering process. Additionally, symptoms should be monitored for at least four months after medication discontinuation to identify signs of recurrence. This allows for a reassessment of the benefits and risks associated with antipsychotic treatment.

### Does behavioral improvement with haloperidol or trazodone treatment depend on psychosis or mood symptoms in patients with dementia [^112jEBM3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2001). High credibility.

Several previous studies have examined the effects of pharmacological interventions for agitated behavior in patients with dementia. However, the choice of medication in clinical practice continues to be directed largely by local pharmacotherapy culture rather than empirical treatment guidelines. In this study, we examined the relationship between behavioral improvement and co-occurring delusions and mood symptoms in patients with dementia who were treated with haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication, or trazodone, a serotonergic antidepressant.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 9-week treatment trial.
- **Setting**: Inpatient geropsychiatry unit.
- **Participants**: Twenty-eight patients with dementia and agitated or aggressive behaviors.
- **Intervention**: Haloperidol 1 to 5 mg/day or trazodone 50 to 250 mg/day.
- **Measurements**:
	- Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)
	- Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D)
	- Delusional thoughts subscale and hallucinations subscale of the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD).

CMAI scores improved in each treatment group over the 9 weeks of treatment (P < .001 in each group). Within the haloperidol treatment group, CMAI improvement was not associated with baseline delusional thoughts score or with change in delusional thoughts score over the course of treatment. Within the trazodone treatment group, CMAI improvement was associated with baseline score on total Ham-D (r = -0.60, P = 0.02), Ham-D items measuring subjective mood symptoms (r = -0.50, P = 0.07), and Ham-D items measuring neurovegetative symptoms.

### Effect of peer comparison letters for high-volume primary care prescribers of quetiapine in older and disabled adults: A randomized clinical trial [^112J2iQa]. JAMA Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

Antipsychotic agents, such as quetiapine fumarate, are frequently overprescribed for indications not supported by clinical evidence, potentially causing harm.

- **Objective**: To investigate if peer comparison letters targeting high-volume primary care prescribers of quetiapine meaningfully reduce their prescribing.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This randomized clinical trial (intent to treat) was conducted from 2015 to 2017 with prescribers and their patients nationwide in the Medicare program. It targeted the 5055 highest-volume primary care prescribers of quetiapine in 2013 and 2014, representing approximately 5% of all primary care prescribers of quetiapine.

- **Interventions**: Prescribers were randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive a placebo letter or three peer comparison letters. These letters stated that their quetiapine prescribing was high relative to their peers and was under review by Medicare.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the total quetiapine days supplied by prescribers from the intervention start to nine months. Secondary outcomes included quetiapine receipt from all prescribers by baseline patients, quetiapine receipt by patients with low-value or guideline-concordant indications for therapy, mortality, and hospital use. In exploratory analyses, the study followed outcomes to two years.

- **Results**: Of the 5055 prescribers, 231 (4.6%) were general practitioners, 2428 (48.0%) were in family medicine, and 2396 (47.4%) were in internal medicine; 4155 (82.2%) were male. All were included in the analyses. Over nine months, the treatment arm supplied 11.1% fewer quetiapine days.

### The effect of quetiapine in psychotic Parkinsonian patients with and without dementia. An open-labeled study utilizing a structured interview [^115w16P8]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

We studied the effect of quetiapine in drug-induced psychosis (DIP) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with dementia (PDDEM) and without dementia (PDNODEM) in a 6-month open study.

Thirty-five consecutive PD patients with DIP (19 of them demented [DSM-IV criteria]) were examined. Assessment included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), UPDRS (motor part), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGIS), and Hamilton test (for depression). Quetiapine was administered in a flexible dose ranging from 25–600 mg daily. Out of the 35 patients included in the study, 24 completed treatment with quetiapine (14 demented and 10 without dementia). Treatment was discontinued in 11 patients (5 demented).

Intention to treat patient (ITT) analysis did not show a significant quetiapine effect (BPRS), although approximately 30% reported good outcomes according to family assessments (CGIS). Among the patients who completed the study (n = 24), the BPRS results improved almost significantly (p = 0.06) in the PDNODEM group (n = 10), whereas no change was observed in the PDDEM group. According to the CGIS, a good improvement was noted in 50% of the PDDEM group (7/14) and 40% of the PDNODEM group (4/10). Motor features of PD patients worsened mildly (p = 0.05) in the PDDEM group.

In this open trial, quetiapine was not beneficial in the ITT group according to the BPRS, although families reported improvements in about 30% of patients (CGIS). Among patients who completed the study, quetiapine was more effective in the PDNODEM group. A double-blind study with quetiapine is required.

### Expert opinions on pharmacological symptomatic treatment of behavioral symptoms in frontotemporal dementia: A survey of the Neuropsychiatric International Consortium on Frontotemporal Dementia (NIC-FTD) [^115HFnqM]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Results per targeted behavioral symptom

Each suggested treatment option targeted one or more behavioral symptoms. A total of 118 out of 202 suggestions (58.4%), made collectively by our 48 respondents, most frequently mentioned disinhibition as a therapeutic target. Disinhibition was most frequently suggested to be treated with atypical antipsychotics (55/118, 46.6%). Specific medications suggested to treat disinhibition were quetiapine (24/118, 20.3%), risperidone (15/118, 12.7%), and trazodone (13/118, 11.0%).

Compulsive or perseverative behaviors were targeted by 94 out of 202 suggestions (46.5%), most frequently by SSRIs (44/94, 72.5%). Specific medications suggested to treat this symptom were sertraline (14/94, 14.9%), trazodone (13/94, 13.8%), and quetiapine, citalopram, or escitalopram (each 10/94, 10.6%).

Positive psychotic symptoms (PPSs) were targeted by 69 out of 202 suggested medications (34.2%), most frequently by atypical antipsychotics (60/69, 87.0%). Specific medications suggested to treat PPSs were quetiapine (22/69, 31.9%), risperidone (20/69, 29.0%), and olanzapine (13/69, 18.8%).

Apathy was targeted by 40 out of 202 suggestions (19.8%), most frequently by SSRIs (29/40, 72.5%). Specific medications suggested to treat apathy were sertraline (10/40, 25.0%), escitalopram (9/40, 22.5%), and venlafaxine (6/40, 15.0%).

Hyperorality was targeted by 32 out of 202 suggested medications (15.8%), most frequently by SSRIs (15/32, 46.9%). Specific medications suggested to treat hyperorality were trazodone (9/32, 28.1%), sertraline (4/32, 12.5%), and escitalopram (4/32, 12.5%).

### Safety of pharmacologic interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117BhJ9t]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we demonstrated potential harms associated with pharmacologic interventions intended to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms in persons with dementia. Our findings suggest that changing prescribing trends towards pharmacologic interventions other than antipsychotics may not be appropriate given the risk for harm. Rather, we should advocate for increased use of nonpharmacologic interventions given their demonstrated efficacy.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline on the use of antipsychotics to treat agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia [^116S73zn]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, more specifically with respect to antipsychotics, tapering, and discontinuation, the APA 2016 guidelines recommend assessing symptoms at least monthly during the tapering process and for at least four months after medication discontinuation. This allows for the identification of recurrence signs and triggers a reassessment of the benefits and risks of antipsychotic treatment.

### Psychosis as a treatment target in dementia: A roadmap for designing interventions [^112wqr6w]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Most of the evidence for the use of atypical antipsychotics shows heterogeneity based on numerous factors such as study population (institutionalized versus non-institutionalized or mixed patient populations), type of dementia (any dementia, probable AD, dementia with parkinsonism), or type of behavioral abnormality (psychosis versus psychosis and/or other behavioral abnormalities — agitation or aggression, or merely behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia such as agitation). These differences are also reflected in the primary outcome measures used to quantify improvement in most of the studies.

In some studies, the improvement in behavioral outcomes observed at follow-up was attributed to the beneficial effect of antipsychotic medications over placebo. However, in other studies, a significant improvement was observed in both groups, with no differences between the active treatment and the placebo groups. These results may suggest that treatment of behavioral symptoms in dementia may be prone to a significant placebo effect, potentially resulting from non-specific benefits such as enrollment in a clinical trial, the natural course of illness, and symptomatic decline over time. A significant placebo effect has been recognized in patients with antidepressants and agitation who have been randomized to citalopram or placebo. The most significant improvement was recorded in patients who were most symptomatic at baseline, suggesting that a placebo effect may also result from regression towards the mean.

Regarding the medical management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, especially in relation to antipsychotics, the 2016 APA guidelines recommend discussing the potential tapering of antipsychotics with the patient, if clinically feasible. If relevant, this discussion should also involve the patient's surrogate decision-maker, with input from family or others involved with the patient, in cases where there has been a positive response to treatment. It is essential to elicit their preferences and concerns, and to review the initial goals, observed benefits, side effects of antipsychotic treatment, potential risks of continued exposure to antipsychotics, and any past experiences with antipsychotic medication trials and tapering attempts.

### Advances in management of neuropsychiatric syndromes in neurodegenerative diseases [^112XHLSM]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

There is limited evidence to support the use of typical antipsychotics to manage aggression and agitation in clinically acute settings. The efficacy of these agents is modest. Haloperidol is useful in the treatment of aggression with agitation, but not general agitation behaviors such as wandering or verbal agitation. Typical antipsychotics are not recommended for the non-emergent treatment of agitation in dementia. Even in acute situations, the use of typical antipsychotics in neurodegenerative diseases poses risks.

Atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of side effects such as parkinsonism, acute dystonic reactions, and tardive dyskinesia. Atypicals, including risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole, are alternatives for managing severe agitation, aggression, and psychosis associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where there is a risk of harm to the patient and/or others. Risperidone has the best evidence for short-term efficacy (6–12 weeks) in patients with agitation. A meta-analysis of four large placebo-controlled clinical trials supported risperidone's efficacy in managing agitation and aggression even in severely impaired AD patients. In AD patients with psychosis or agitation who had responded to risperidone therapy for 4–8 months, discontinuation of risperidone was associated with an increased risk of relapse. Risperidone may be considered an option for short-term intervention in cases of acute, treatment-resistant agitation in AD and may be useful in the long-term management of agitation where the agitation syndrome has become chronic.

### Quetiapine for psychosis in Parkinson's disease versus dementia with Lewy bodies [^112Re1DZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Most clinicians perceive psychosis in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) as more difficult to treat than psychosis in Parkinson's disease, yet there are no reports comparing the antipsychotic response between the two disorders.

- **Method**: All charts of Parkinson's disease and DLB patients at our Movement Disorders Center, Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island, Pawtucket, administered quetiapine for psychosis, were reviewed. Demographic data, including type and severity of psychosis, before and after Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-motor scores, motor worsening, and treatment response (recorded as poor/none, partial, or total), were obtained. The chi-square test was used to assess differences in the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine between Parkinson's disease and DLB patients.

- **Results**: Eighty-seven Parkinson's disease and 11 DLB patients with psychosis were analyzed. No significant difference in mean age, levodopa dose, quetiapine dose, duration of quetiapine use, or baseline UPDRS-motor score was noted between Parkinson's disease and DLB patients. Eighty percent (70/87) of Parkinson's disease patients and 90% (10/11) of DLB patients experienced partial to complete resolution of psychosis using quetiapine (p = .40). Motor worsening was noted at one point in 32% (28/87) of Parkinson's disease and 27% (3/11) of DLB patients over the duration of quetiapine use (p = .74).

- **Conclusion**: Long-term quetiapine use was generally well tolerated in this geriatric Parkinson's disease and DLB population. Mild motor worsening occurred in some patients. No significant difference in long-term efficacy was observed.

### Efficacy and comparative effectiveness of atypical antipsychotic medications for off-label uses in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116F3g2v]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic medications are commonly used for off-label conditions such as agitation in dementia, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

- **Objective**: To perform a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotic medications for use in conditions lacking approval for labeling and marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration.

- **Data sources and study selection**: Relevant studies published in the English language were identified by searches of six databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Cochrane DARE, and CENTRAL) from inception through May 2011. Controlled trials comparing an atypical antipsychotic medication (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, asenapine, iloperidone, or paliperidone) with placebo, another atypical antipsychotic medication, or other pharmacotherapy for adult off-label conditions were included. Observational studies with sample sizes of greater than 1000 patients were included to assess adverse events.

- **Data extraction**: Independent article review and study quality assessment by two investigators.

- **Data synthesis**: Of 12228 citations identified, 162 contributed data to the efficacy review. Among 14 placebo-controlled trials of elderly patients with dementia reporting a total global outcome score that includes symptoms such as psychosis, mood alterations, and aggression, small but statistically significant effect sizes ranging from 0.12 to 0.20 were observed for aripiprazole, olanzapine, and risperidone. For generalized anxiety disorder, a pooled analysis of three trials showed that quetiapine was effective.

### Evidence-based treatment and monitoring strategies for dementia-related psychosis [^112EXJKF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics play a limited role in the management of dementia-related psychosis (DRP). Major adverse outcomes are associated with most antipsychotics in patients with dementia, and guidelines recommend that these drugs not be prescribed for long durations. When treating symptoms of DRP, clinicians should follow guidelines, such as using medication only if the patient or others are in distress or danger and starting with low doses. Novel antipsychotics or alternative agents may offer superior efficacy and safety.

### Risk of death with atypical antipsychotic drug treatment for dementia: Meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^115gZhha]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic medications are widely used to treat delusions, aggression, and agitation in people with Alzheimer disease and other forms of dementia. However, concerns have arisen about the increased risk for cerebrovascular adverse events, rapid cognitive decline, and mortality associated with their use.

- **Objective**: To assess the evidence for increased mortality from atypical antipsychotic drug treatment in individuals with dementia.

- **Data sources**: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2005, Issue 1), meetings presentations (1997–2004), and information from the sponsors using terms related to atypical antipsychotic drugs (aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone), dementia, Alzheimer disease, and clinical trial.

- **Study selection**: Published and unpublished randomized placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials of atypical antipsychotic drugs marketed in the United States for treating patients with Alzheimer disease or other forms of dementia were selected by consensus of the authors.

- **Data extraction**: Trials, baseline characteristics, outcomes, all-cause dropouts, and deaths were extracted by one reviewer; treatment exposure was obtained or estimated. Data were checked by a second reviewer for accuracy.

- **Data synthesis**: Fifteen trials (9 unpublished), typically 10 to 12 weeks in duration, including 16 contrasts of atypical antipsychotic drugs with placebo met criteria (aripiprazole [n = 3], olanzapine [n = 5], quetiapine [n = 3], risperidone [n = 5]). In total, 3353 patients were randomized to the study drug, while 1757 were randomized to the placebo group.

### Efficacy of quetiapine for delirium prevention in hospitalized older medical patients: A randomized double-blind controlled trial [^1154hXnz]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Second, the dosage and administration of the intervention drug might influence the results. In this study, we administered only 12.5 mg of quetiapine once daily, which is the initial starting dosage for older patients. Those with strong significant precipitating factors such as sepsis or deoxygenation possibly needed a higher dosage of quetiapine to prevent delirium. Moreover, once-daily administration at bedtime may not be an adequate treatment due to the short half-life of quetiapine, which is typically 6 h.

In addition, unlike surgical or critically ill patient groups who have significant precipitating factors for delirium, our population had various medical conditions with different disease severities, which could affect delirium incidences. We did not assess or collect data about the severity of diseases, although our report on primary diagnoses showed quite similar results between the two groups. Previous comorbidities were also collected and showed no difference at baseline. In subgroup analyses, patients with longer hospitalization might have worse medical conditions; however, the results remained nonsignificant.

Finally, we did not have data on cognition. We did not collect data on cognitive testing at baseline because of unreliable interpretation in acutely ill patients. Those with previously diagnosed dementia were excluded at the beginning. Nevertheless, cognition had a great impact on delirium outcome. Older patients with cognitive impairment or dementia had a higher rate of delirium during hospital admission, which could possibly affect our outcomes.

### Withdrawal versus continuation of long-term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia [^1145kX8T]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Antipsychotic agents are often used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in people with dementia, although there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of their long-term use for this indication and concern that they may cause harm, including higher mortality. When behavioral strategies have failed and treatment with antipsychotic drugs is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw them have been recommended in guidelines. Physicians, nurses, and families of older people with dementia may be reluctant to stop antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia and NPS in primary care or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older participants with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on participants' behavior and assess safety.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries, and grey literature sources up to 11 January 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized, controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to the continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia who had been treated with an antipsychotic drug for at least three months.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures…

### Seroquel [^1175oEd7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Quetiapine activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are dose-proportional within the proposed clinical dose range, and quetiapine accumulation is predictable upon multiple dosing. Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal half-life of about 6 hours within the proposed clinical dose range. Steady-state concentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

At steady state, the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound in children and adolescents (10–17 years of age) were similar to adults. However, when adjusted for dose and weight, AUC and Cmax of the parent compound were 41% and 39% lower, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. For the active metabolite, norquetiapine, AUC and Cmax were 45% and 31% higher, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. When adjusted for dose and weight, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite, norquetiapine, was similar between children and adolescents and adults.

Quetiapine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours. The tablet formulation is 100% bioavailable relative to the solution. The bioavailability of quetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with Cmax and AUC values increased by 25% and 15%, respectively.

### Advances in management of neuropsychiatric syndromes in neurodegenerative diseases [^115yZEmg]. Current psychiatry reports (2019). Low credibility.

Studies with quetiapine have provided mixed results. Ballard et al. found no treatment benefit in reducing agitation compared to placebo, while Zhong et al. showed improvement of agitation in patients given 200 mg of quetiapine daily.

Olanzapine has been used for the treatment of psychosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has anticholinergic effects and may decrease cognition while increasing the risk of anticholinergic delirium symptoms. Olanzapine use in the treatment of delusions and hallucinations in Parkinson's disease (PD) has resulted in exacerbation of parkinsonism.

Brexpiprazole, a novel compound structurally similar to aripiprazole — its mechanism of action includes reduced partial agonism for D2 and 5-HT1A receptors and enhanced antagonism for 5-HT2A and α1-adrenoreceptors — is being tested for agitation associated with AD.

Data supporting the use of anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers are strongest for carbamazepine. Its use is limited by the risk of side effects such as dizziness, sedation, ataxia, and confusion, as well as the more rare but significant adverse effects of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion with hyponatremia, cardiac issues, and hepatotoxicity. Patients should be informed of the black box warnings for aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and rare but sometimes fatal dermatologic adverse reactions.

The evidence for valproate as a treatment for agitation is mixed, with a meta-analysis of pooled results concluding that valproate is ineffective in reducing agitation in dementia and is associated with unacceptable rates of adverse events, notably sedation. There is a risk that valproate may worsen agitation compared to placebo.

### Antipsychotics and dementia in Canada: A retrospective cross-sectional study of four health sectors [^113VFk1T]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic medications are not recommended for managing symptoms of dementia, particularly among persons with no behavioral or psychological symptoms. We examine patterns of antipsychotic medication use among persons with dementia across health sectors in Canada, focusing on factors related to use among those without behavioral or psychotic symptoms.

- **Methods**: Using a retrospective cross-sectional design, this study examines antipsychotic use among adults aged 65 or older with dementia in home care (HC), complex continuing care (CCC), long-term care (LTC), and among alternate level care patients in acute hospitals (ALC). Using clinical data from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014, the prevalence of antipsychotic medication use was estimated by the presence of behavioral and psychotic symptoms. Logistic regression was used to identify sector-specific factors associated with antipsychotic use in the absence of behavioral and psychotic symptoms.

- **Results**: The total prevalence of antipsychotic use among older adults with dementia was 26% in HC, 54% in ALC, 41% in CCC, and 48% in LTC. This prevalence ranged from 38% (HC) to 73% (ALC) for those with both behavioral and psychotic symptoms, and from 15% (HC) to 31% (ALC) among those with no symptoms. The regression models identified several variables related to antipsychotic use in the absence of behavior or psychotic symptoms, such as bipolar disorder (OR = 6.63 in CCC; OR = 5.52 in LTC), anxious complaints (OR = 1.54 in LTC to 2.01 in CCC), and wandering (OR = 1.83 in ALC).

The study concludes that certain factors, like bipolar disorder, anxious complaints, and wandering, contribute to the use of antipsychotic medications in the absence of behavioral or psychotic symptoms among dementia patients.

### Psychosis as a treatment target in dementia: A roadmap for designing interventions [^115g9EZj]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

In this study, we summarize the most relevant evidence from clinical trials examining the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic medications on ameliorating psychotic symptoms in patients with dementia.

- **Randomized controlled trials: Aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine**:
	- **BEHAVE-AD**: Behavioral Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease
	- **BPRS**: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
	- **CGI-I**: Clinical Global Impression – Improvement scale
	- **NPI**: Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Questionnaire
	- **NPI-NH**: Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Questionnaire Nursing Home version

In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black box warning regarding safety concerns associated with the treatment of dementia patients using atypical antipsychotic medications. The use of these medications in dementia is linked with an increased risk of side effects such as cerebrovascular events, extrapyramidal symptoms, hypotension, sedation, anticholinergic effects, and mortality.

These concerns have led to a reduction in the usage of these medications for dementia in the US, although reports about the extent of the decline are inconsistent. Despite this, atypical antipsychotic medications still comprised 9% of the drugs prescribed to dementia patients in 2008. Typical antipsychotic medications present at least as much risk for morbidity and mortality as atypical antipsychotics, prompting the FDA to extend its warning to include haloperidol, one of the most widely used antipsychotics.

Disinhibition was primarily addressed using atypical antipsychotics, such as quetiapine. This outcome is particularly noteworthy as it contradicts current literature recommendations. However, it aligns with clinical practice in psychiatry when compared to manic episodes in bipolar disorder. While treatments for compulsive and perseverative behaviors varied, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) emerged as the most common choice, representing about half the recommendations. This aligns with literature indicating efficacy of SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants. In the context of similar symptoms in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), this practice is consistent with psychiatric norms, where SSRIs constitute the primary treatment aside from nonpharmacological interventions.

- **PPS (hallucinations and delusions)**: Atypical antipsychotics were suggested almost universally, although PPSs are not extensively discussed in literature. This finding underscores its clinical importance, as it mirrors typical psychiatric approaches to psychotic decompensation akin to schizophrenia.

- **Apathy**: Recommendations largely included SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). This diverges from literature, which, despite its variability, does not advocate for SSRIs or SNRIs specifically.

### Economic outcomes associated with diagnosed behavioral symptoms among patients with dementia in the United States: A health care claims database analysis [^114yxYEd]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, no medication has been approved by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration for managing behavioral symptoms in patients with dementia. In clinical practice, the symptoms are frequently managed with antipsychotics, antidepressants, and antiepileptics. Benzodiazepines are also over-utilized despite their demonstrated risk for harm and poor efficacy.

Real-world evidence regarding the economic burden of behavioral symptoms in patients is needed to estimate the value of novel treatments for patients with dementia. Claims data sources provide rich information on clinical and treatment-related characteristics, healthcare utilization, and costs. Few studies have examined the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs associated with behavioral symptoms, given the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of such symptoms among patients with dementia. Therefore, in this study, we leverage one of the largest sources of claims data to fill this gap in the literature. This study aims to characterize the prevalence of diagnosed behavioral symptoms among commercially insured older adults with dementia in the U.S. and to assess the association of these symptoms with HCRU and related costs.

### Quetiapine oral solution in Alzheimer's disease: efficacy and dosage insights from a real-world retrospective study [^116HJJSb]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are distressing for patients with dementia, often accelerating functional decline and nursing home placement. Medications such as quetiapine are used to alleviate NPS, but their side effects require cautious use. Liquid formulations such as quetiapine oral suspension suit specific populations; however, real-world data on their use in patients with dementia are limited.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this retrospective, naturalistic study was to provide preliminary data on the effects of treatment with quetiapine oral suspension on behavioral and psychiatric disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD) outpatients in Taiwan.

- **Methods**: Between January 2022 and June 2023, data were collected from outpatients with a diagnosis of probable AD who received treatment with Qting® (quetiapine oral solution 25mg/ml). Primary outcome measures were changes in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score and its sub-items from baseline to the endpoint.

- **Results**: We recruited 66 AD patients with a mean age of 72.1 ± 7.6 years, most of whom were female (69.7%). Twenty-three patients had data on neuropsychological tests and NPI scores before and after quetiapine treatment. There was no significant change in global cognitive function from baseline to the endpoint. A significant reduction in NPI total score after quetiapine treatment was noted, while the effect on NPI sub-items was limited. The average maintenance dose was 1.5 ± 0.6ml.

- **Conclusions**: We demonstrated our clinical experience with the use of quetiapine oral solution in AD patients with NPS. Our results indicate a significant reduction in NPI total score, suggesting potential benefits for managing neuropsychiatric symptoms in this population.

### Validation of random forest machine learning models to predict dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms in real-world data [^1122Kib4]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Low credibility.

The plot showing the importance of variables for psychotic symptoms highlights the role of risperidone and quetiapine in their pharmacological treatment. It was expected that risperidone would be the drug contributing the most predictive value to the psychotic symptom model, as it is the only one with official approval from the European Drug Agency. The gap between recommendations and reality is evidenced by the role of quetiapine, which is the second most important medication, even though its indication for dementia is off-label. Additionally, the level of sedation achieved by the medications used had a high explanatory capacity, and medication changes contributed considerably to the predictive value of the psychotic symptom model. NPS affect almost all individuals with dementia (97%) over the course of the disease, and although they fluctuate, they rarely disappear, making the level of sedation particularly important. Families seldom have access to specialized clinics to deal with such fluctuations, and family caregivers often manage them by adjusting doses through trial and error. When this approach fails, families turn to the most accessible doctor to change the drug prescribed because they cannot cope with the stress. This explains the significance in the model of variables indicating the number of antipsychotic treatments and changes from antidepressant to antipsychotic drugs. As described in the literature, antidepressant drugs also play a relevant role in managing agitation. Not only trazodone, but also sertraline, paroxetine, and mirtaza

### Psychosis as a treatment target in dementia: A roadmap for designing interventions [^112yrMfY]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

The need for pharmacological interventions to treat all psychotic symptoms in dementia is a matter of debate. Currently, antipsychotic medications in patients with dementia are recommended only in cases in which there is a substantial risk for harm to self or others, and after all non-pharmacological measures have failed. This approach is justifiable in cases of minor hallucinations in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), to which patients are usually insightful and which rarely lead to patient suffering or behavioral changes. Nevertheless, early treatment of minor psychotic symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been suggested by some authors to attenuate psychiatric deterioration.

Despite the modest effect of pharmacological interventions and the increased risk for side effects, morbidity, and mortality, psychoactive medications are commonly used for the treatment of patients with dementia and psychosis, especially if clinical presentations are accompanied by additional behavioral disturbances such as agitation or aggression. For example, between 37.5–60% of patients with dementia in residential care facilities are prescribed antipsychotic medications, not only for genuine psychotic symptoms but also to control agitation, aggression, or severe sleep disturbances. Notably, typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol and thioridazine, or atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, clozapine, and ziprasidone are used, with atypical agents being the preferred pharmacological treatment option.

### Use of atypical antipsychotic drugs in patients with dementia [^114SEhkV]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Increasingly, atypical antipsychotic drugs are prescribed for elderly patients with symptoms of psychosis and behavioral disturbances. These symptoms often occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or Parkinson's disease. As the average age of Americans increases, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease will rise accordingly. Although nonpharmacologic treatments for behavioral disturbances should be tried first, medications often are needed to enable the patient to be adequately cared for.

Guidelines recommend using risperidone and olanzapine to treat psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's dementia. Quetiapine and clozapine are recommended for treatment of psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease. Additional research is needed for a recently approved agent, ziprasidone. To minimize side effects, these medications should be started at low dosages that are increased incrementally. Drug interactions, especially those involving the cytochrome P450 system, must be considered. Clozapine's potentially lethal side effects limit its use in the primary care setting. Informed use of atypical antipsychotic drugs allows family physicians to greatly improve quality of life in elderly patients with dementia and behavior disturbances.

### Scales to assess efficacy and safety of pharmacologic agents in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [^113Nd3rp]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Advances in the assessment of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) have been employed in large-scale clinical trials of new antipsychotic medications such as risperidone. These scales can be used to assess drug efficacy and to compare different treatment regimens. We review three valid and reliable scales: the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) associated with the treatment of BPSD have also been assessed using a number of rating instruments. The design of the most comprehensive of these, the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), is exhaustive, and it successfully quantifies EPS and distinguishes toxic from nontoxic medications. This publication serves as an aid to researchers and clinicians in their interpretation of qualitative and quantitative data from trials evaluating antipsychotic agents in the treatment of BPSD.

### Efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in elderly patients with dementia [^114WpPZr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy in patients with dementia aims to improve distressing behavioral and psychological signs of dementia after nonpharmacologic interventions fail, without causing unacceptable side effects or exacerbating underlying cognitive impairment. This review evaluates data on risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.

- **Risperidone**: Three published placebo-controlled trials, including a 12-week study in patients with Alzheimer's disease, demonstrate dose-related improvements in psychosis and agitation. However, the study reported a significantly higher frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in patients receiving the highest doses.

- **Olanzapine**: One abstract describing a placebo-controlled trial and a published placebo-controlled trial indicate that olanzapine shows greater improvement than placebo in agitation/aggression and psychosis at doses of 5 and 10 mg/day, though not at 15 mg/day. Side effects, including gait disturbance and sedation, occurred at all doses.

- **Quetiapine**: A 52-week open-label trial, with a median dose of 138 mg/day in elderly patients with psychosis, suggested good tolerability and apparent behavioral benefits. EPS improved or remained unchanged in most patients.

- **Aripiprazole**: Limited data, including one abstract describing a placebo-controlled trial, provides inconclusive evidence on the relief of psychosis in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease-related dementia; however, it appears to have good tolerability over the short term.

In summary, the available evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotics are efficacious in addressing some symptoms of dementia in the elderly population, although side effects and limited data for some medications should be considered.

### Assessment and management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [^115fpye1]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia include agitation, depression, apathy, repetitive questioning, psychosis, aggression, sleep problems, wandering, and a variety of inappropriate behaviors. One or more of these symptoms will affect nearly all people with dementia over the course of their illness. These symptoms are among the most complex, stressful, and costly aspects of care and lead to a myriad of poor patient health outcomes, healthcare problems, and income loss for family caregivers. The causes include neurobiologically related disease factors, unmet needs, caregiver factors, environmental triggers, and interactions of individual, caregiver, and environmental factors.

The complexity of these symptoms means that there is no "one-size-fits-all solution", and approaches tailored to the patient and the caregiver are needed. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be used first line, although several exceptions are discussed. Non-pharmacologic approaches with the strongest evidence base involve family caregiver interventions. Regarding pharmacologic treatments, antipsychotics have the strongest evidence base, although the risk-to-benefit ratio is a concern.

An approach to integrating non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments is described. Finally, the paradigm shift needed to fully institute tailored treatments for people and families dealing with these symptoms in the community is discussed.

### Antipsychotics and dementia in Canada: A retrospective cross-sectional study of four health sectors [^11745wR3]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia are associated with functional decline and an elevated risk of institutionalization. Various approaches have been recommended for managing such symptoms, including non-pharmacological interventions and the administration of low doses of risperidone over limited periods. However, concerns exist regarding the off-label use of antipsychotic medications, particularly among older adults not experiencing behavioral or psychological symptoms. Off-label use of antipsychotic medications, depending on type and dose, is associated with an increased risk of falls, heart disease, pneumonia, diabetes, cognitive decline, and mortality among persons with dementia.

Government, industry, and professional recommendations generally do not support the use of antipsychotics in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms, except in cases of psychosis and severe aggression. However, such recommendations and warnings have had minimal impact on patterns of antipsychotic use among older adults across various jurisdictions. Quality indicators of potentially inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications are routinely reported, particularly for nursing homes. Publicly reporting such indicators has been found to reduce the use of antipsychotic medications among older adults with dementia.

Patterns of antipsychotic medication use among persons with dementia vary across care settings and jurisdictions. This issue is most commonly understood in the context of residential care settings rather than community or outpatient settings.

### Behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia: the role of atypical antipsychotics [^114oF9iT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Although cognitive dysfunction is the hallmark of dementia, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), such as psychosis, aggression, sleep disturbance, agitation, and mood disorders, develop in most elderly patients at some stage. These symptoms pose major difficulties in the day-to-day care of patients and are likely to impair the quality of life of both the patient and caregiver. Patients exhibiting BPSD should be assessed in a detailed clinical interview to establish symptoms causing distress to the patient and/or caregiver.

Several mood and behavior scales with good psychometric properties are available for patient evaluation. Initial intervention should focus on nonpharmacologic measures, and the quality of patient care should be optimized with potential physical, environmental, social, and psychiatric triggers being addressed where possible. Caregiver education, support, and behavioral training can also be effective in alleviating BPSD. However, pharmacologic intervention is necessary in many cases and includes the use of antidepressants for mood disorders, anticonvulsants for nonpsychotic agitation, and antipsychotics for aggression, agitation, and psychotic symptoms.

Conventional antipsychotics have shown modest benefit over placebo in the treatment of psychosis and agitation in dementia patients; however, they are associated with treatment-emergent side effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine are at least as effective as conventional antipsychotics and are better tolerated.

### A European Academy of Neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^111561ds]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The authors conclude that there should be a weak recommendation for discontinuation in patients currently treated with antipsychotics. Discontinuation of antipsychotics may be considered in patients for whom there is no obvious indication and in patients in whom there is suspicion of side effects, such as rapid cognitive decline, sedation, falls, or extrapyramidal symptoms.

- **Justification for recommendations**: The identified studies did not show a significant positive or detrimental effect of discontinuation of antipsychotics. Observational studies have clearly demonstrated that treatment is associated with increased mortality in patients with dementia [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59].

- **Supplemental considerations for treatment of agitation/aggression with antipsychotics in dementia**: We believe that treatment with antipsychotics may be relevant in selected patients with agitation and/or aggression. With the recommendations in this guideline, we wish to indicate that in those patients where antipsychotics are indicated, atypical antipsychotics will often be the first-line treatment. Most medical specialties may get involved in the decision to start or stop antipsychotic treatment. A detailed neuropsychiatric assessment, including medical and drug history, must be performed before initiating antipsychotic treatment.

	- In particular, factors such as infection, dehydration, pain, pulmonary or cardiac disease, environmental factors such as changes in living conditions, and other stressors should be identified and treated adequately by non-pharmacological approaches.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^116AyhpX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

At day 21, when a CGI-I score of three (minimal improvement) is recorded for risperidone and quetiapine only (decision squares shaded red), an extension of up to 21 days may be initiated with a further "intermediate decision point" at day 28 or 29. For all other drugs, a score of three is considered an unsuccessful trial. For risperidone and quetiapine, after an extension, CGI-I scores of three or more at day 42 mean that the trial has been unsuccessful and the patient should be switched.

Clinicians should monitor for drug side effects as per their usual practice. Any pathway drug may be stopped at any time if it cannot be tolerated, moving to the next appropriate drug. The algorithm specifies that a third antipsychotic may be tried with whichever of aripiprazole or quetiapine was not initially selected in Step 2, if full trials of the first two antipsychotics could not be tolerated. The drugs outlined earlier for PRN use, trazodone, and in certain circumstances, lorazepam, may be administered alongside the main pathway drugs where appropriate, using the same doses and regimens described for the clean-up phase.

- **Exiting the pathway**: At exit, all assessments undertaken at baseline, along with the CGI-I score (relative to baseline), should be repeated. The ECG and blood tests should also be repeated at or within five days of the time of exit.

### Impact of the Food and Drug Administration's antipsychotic black box warning on psychotropic drug prescribing in elderly patients with dementia in outpatient and office-based settings [^116f5G2G]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2012). Low credibility.

Most patients with dementia also suffer from behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, for which there is no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether the Food and Drug Administration's black box warning in April 2005 has led to a decline in prescriptions of atypical antipsychotics for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, as well as whether prescriptions for other psychotropic drugs, including antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antiepileptics, as substitutes, have increased.

- **Methods**: Data on outpatient visits by elderly dementia patients were obtained from two large national surveys from 2003 to 2008. Any psychotropic drug mentions were identified, and percentage utilization statistics were calculated.

- **Results**: The percentage of visits mentioning an atypical antipsychotic decreased from 12.5% prewarning to 11.5% postwarning. Postwarning, 34.4% of patients were taking none of the study medications, as opposed to 26.1% prewarning.

- **Conclusions**: After the warning, there was a small decline in the use of atypical antipsychotics and no evidence of substitution of other psychotropic medications.

The APA 2016 guidelines advise that when managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, especially concerning antipsychotics, clinicians should evaluate the potential risks and benefits of these medications. This evaluation is crucial to determine whether tapering and discontinuation are warranted in patients with dementia who are experiencing clinically significant side effects.
