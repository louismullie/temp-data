## Question

Elevated lymphocytes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating elevated lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and defining the absolute lymphocyte count. Then, I should verify the clinical context and morphology on smear. Next, I will consider age-specific thresholds and the differential diagnosis, distinguishing reactive from clonal causes. After that, I need to outline targeted diagnostic testing, including flow cytometry and molecular studies. Finally, I will synthesize management principles, including when to treat, observe, or refer, and close with special scenarios and a concise algorithm anchored in guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and quantify it precisely, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with lymphocytosis rather than a relative shift or instrument artifact. I should double-check the CBC with differential and calculate the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) as lymphocyte percentage multiplied by total WBC, since adult lymphocytosis is typically defined as ALC greater than about 4.0–4.5 × 10^9/L, with many hematologists considering ALC ≥ 5.0 × 10^9/L a practical threshold for further evaluation, and some data suggesting that ALC around 7 × 10^9/L is an optimal trigger for morphology review and deeper workup [^114QKP5w] [^117ViRXT].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical context before jumping to conclusions, because reactive lymphocytosis is common and often self-limited. I need to check for recent infections (especially viral illnesses such as EBV, influenza, RSV, COVID-19), medication exposures, stress or exercise, smoking, and autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, and I should correlate with symptoms such as fever, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, or organomegaly, since these features shift pretest probabilities toward reactive versus clonal processes [^114QKP5w] [^113Y9xBJ].

> Next, I should review the peripheral smear carefully, because morphology is pivotal to distinguish reactive from clonal lymphocytosis. Reactive lymphocytes are typically pleomorphic with varying sizes and shapes, whereas a monomorphic population suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder; I must also look for atypical or activated forms, which can be misclassified by automated counters as monocytes, and I should confirm any suspicious blasts or abnormal cells manually before proceeding to marrow evaluation [^111xbocB] [^1149A7L4].

> Hold on, I should verify age-specific considerations, since what is abnormal in younger adults may be physiologic in older individuals. Let me consider that age-specific reference intervals for lymphocytes decline with age, so applying a fixed adult range can mislabel healthy older adults as lymphopenic or, conversely, miss disease in younger patients; this means I need to interpret counts in the context of age-adjusted norms and clinical phenotype rather than a single universal cutoff [^11199VgT].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis systematically. Reactive causes include viral infections (EBV, influenza, RSV, COVID-19), pertussis, immune responses to vaccination, stress/exercise, smoking, and autoimmune or inflammatory states; clonal causes include chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other mature B-cell neoplasms, T-cell disorders, and rarely acute lymphoblastic leukemia, where the presence of lymphoblasts mandates bone marrow evaluation and appropriate ancillary testing [^114QKP5w] [^111xbocB].

> Let me think about when to escalate testing, because I should avoid overtesting low-risk phenotypes while not missing malignancy. If the ALC is ≥ 5.0 × 10^9/L, persists on repeat testing, or the smear shows monomorphic lymphocytes, I should order flow cytometry to define the immunophenotype; if flow suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder or blasts are present, I should proceed to bone marrow aspiration/biopsy with cytogenetics and molecular studies per CAP/ASH and iwCLL guidance, and I should consider serum immunoglobulins, β-2-microglobulin, and infectious serologies as part of baseline CLL evaluation [^111xbocB] [^116eypb9].

> But wait, what if the lymphocytosis is extreme, for example ALC > 100 × 10^9/L in suspected CLL; does that alone mandate therapy? I should confirm that in CLL, ALC alone is not an indication for treatment in the absence of leukostasis, which is rare, so I must base treatment decisions on iwCLL/ESMO criteria such as symptomatic disease, progressive marrow failure, autoimmune cytopenias, or bulky lymphadenopathy rather than the height of the ALC alone [^114cbHm9] [^115xQUT8].

> Next, I should review management principles. For confirmed reactive lymphocytosis, I will treat the underlying cause and observe, expecting resolution as the precipitant abates; for asymptomatic CLL or other indolent lymphoproliferative disorders, observation with interval CBCs and clinical reassessment is appropriate; for symptomatic or progressive disease, I should initiate disease-specific therapy per guideline-directed algorithms and refer to hematology-oncology for management and supportive care planning [^114QKP5w] [^114cbHm9].

> I need to ensure I address special scenarios. In suspected infectious mononucleosis, I should confirm with heterophile testing or EBV serologies and counsel on supportive care and activity restrictions rather than empiric antibiotics; in COVID-19, lymphopenia rather than lymphocytosis is the hallmark, and dynamic lymphocyte trajectories correlate with severity, so I should not overcall COVID-19 in the presence of isolated lymphocytosis; in medication-associated changes, I should review agents like saxagliptin, which can modestly lower ALC, and interpret counts in that context [^112Dm9gC] [^111cj9Ak].

> Let me reconsider the practical thresholds to solidify the algorithm. ALC ≥ 5.0 × 10^9/L prompts evaluation, ALC around 7 × 10^9/L is a strong trigger for smear review and flow cytometry, and ALC > 100 × 10^9/L in CLL still requires symptoms or indications before therapy; I should double-check persistence on repeat CBC to avoid reacting to a transient reactive spike, and I should integrate smear morphology and clinical context at each step to avoid misclassification [^117ViRXT] [^114cbHm9] [^114QKP5w].

> In summary, I should confirm the ALC, contextualize by age and clinical setting, scrutinize the smear for pleomorphic versus monomorphic lymphocytes, and pursue flow cytometry and marrow studies when indicated; management hinges on treating reactive causes, observing indolent clonal disease, and initiating guideline-based therapy only when clinical criteria are met, ensuring that I do not over- or under-treat based on the absolute lymphocyte count alone [^111xbocB] [^114cbHm9].

Elevated lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) are defined as an **absolute lymphocyte count > 4,000/µL in adults** [^114QKP5w] and reflect increased lymphocyte production or release. The most common causes are **viral infections** (notably EBV, CMV, HIV, influenza, COVID-19) [^115fUqpM] [^112Dm9gC], bacterial infections such as pertussis, and immune activation from autoimmune or inflammatory conditions [^115fUqpM] [^113Y9xBJ]. Persistent lymphocytosis (> 3 months), atypical morphology, or unexplained symptoms warrant evaluation with a peripheral smear, flow cytometry, and, if indicated, bone marrow studies to exclude chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or other lymphoproliferative disorders [^111xbocB]. Management is cause-specific: treat infections or inflammation, and manage hematologic malignancies per guidelines; prognosis depends on the underlying etiology and response to therapy [^115udjr2].

---

## Definition and normal ranges

Lymphocytosis is defined as an **absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) > 4,000/µL in adults** [^111GV4eC]; normal ranges vary by age, with higher counts in children and adolescents [^notfound].

---

## Causes of elevated lymphocytes

Lymphocytosis is broadly categorized as **reactive (benign)** or **clonal (malignant)** [^111xbocB]:

---

### Reactive lymphocytosis

Reactive lymphocytosis arises from immune activation — most often due to infection, autoimmunity, or stress — and is characterized by **polyclonal lymphocyte expansion** [^notfound]:

- **Viral infections**: EBV, CMV, HIV, influenza, COVID-19 [^117UzcYC].
- **Bacterial infections**: Pertussis, tuberculosis, brucellosis.
- **Autoimmune diseases**: SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis.
- **Stress responses**: Exercise, trauma, acute illness [^114QKP5w].

---

### Clonal lymphocytosis

Clonal lymphocytosis reflects **malignant proliferation** of a single lymphoid lineage and includes:

- **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)**: Most common adult leukemia with lymphocytosis [^115xQUT8].
- **Other lymphoproliferative disorders**: Hairy cell leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, large granular lymphocyte leukemia [^notfound].
- **Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)**: Less common, typically presents with lymphoblasts [^111xbocB].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

The clinical significance of lymphocytosis depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Reactive lymphocytosis**: Usually self-limited, resolving with treatment of the underlying cause.
- **Clonal lymphocytosis**: May indicate hematologic malignancy requiring further evaluation and management [^114JtQ6Z].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach is essential to distinguish reactive from clonal causes [^111xbocB]:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | CBC with differential | Confirm lymphocytosis and assess other hematologic abnormalities [^114QKP5w] |
| 2 | Peripheral blood smear | Evaluate lymphocyte morphology (e.g. atypical lymphocytes, smudge cells) [^117ViRXT] |
| 3 | Flow cytometry | Immunophenotyping to detect clonal lymphocyte populations [^111xbocB] |
| 4 | Molecular testing | Detect specific genetic mutations (e.g. BCR-ABL, JAK2) [^notfound] |
| 5 | Bone marrow biopsy | Indicated if clonal lymphocytosis or unexplained cytopenias are present [^notfound] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **cause**:

- **Reactive lymphocytosis**: Treat the underlying infection, autoimmune disease, or inflammatory condition [^notfound].
- **Clonal lymphocytosis**: Management follows disease-specific guidelines (e.g. CLL, ALL, lymphomas) [^114cbHm9].
- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up with CBC and clinical assessment to track response and detect progression [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **etiology**: reactive lymphocytosis generally has an excellent outlook with resolution after treatment of the underlying cause, whereas clonal lymphocytosis carries a prognosis that depends on the specific malignancy, disease stage, and response to therapy [^notfound].

---

Elevated lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) reflect increased lymphocyte production or release, most often from infection, autoimmunity, or stress; persistent or atypical cases require **targeted testing** to exclude malignancy, and management is cause-specific with prognosis determined by the underlying etiology.

## References

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^111xbocB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

### Predictive significance of absolute lymphocyte count and morphology in adults with a new onset peripheral blood lymphocytosis [^117ViRXT]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

Lymphocytosis is commonly encountered in the haematology laboratory. Evaluation of blood films is an important screening tool for differentiating between reactive and malignant processes. The optimal lymphocyte number to trigger morphological evaluation of the smear has not been well defined in the literature. Likewise, the significance of lymphocyte morphology has not been well studied and there are no consensus guidelines or follow-up recommendations available. We attempt to evaluate the significance of lymphocyte morphology and to define the best possible cut-off value of absolute lymphocyte count for morphology review.

Methods

71 adult patients with newly detected lymphocytosis of 5.0×10(9)/L or more were categorised to either a reactive process or a lymphoproliferative disorder. We performed statistical analysis and morphology review to compare the difference in age, gender, lymphocyte count and morphological features between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine an optimal lymphocyte number to trigger morphology review.

Results

Lymphoproliferative disorders are associated with advanced age and higher lymphocyte count. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of lymphocyte morphology as a screening test were 0.9, 0.59, 0.60, 0.58 and 0.71, respectively. The optimal cut-off of lymphocyte number for morphology review was found to be close to 7×10(9)/L.

Conclusions

We found a moderate interobserver agreement for the morphological assessment. 'Reactive' morphology was very predictive of a reactive process, but 'malignant' morphology was a poor predictor of a lymphoproliferative disorder.

### The development of marked elevation in white blood cell count does not predict inferior outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^112AU33K]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2002). Low credibility.

Although elevation of the white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) appears to predict shortened survival, its significance later in the course of the disease remains unclear. We reviewed all cases of CLL seen in our center between 1980 and 1999 to evaluate the frequency and clinical significance of WBC elevation > 100 x 10(9)/L. CLL was confirmed according to standard diagnostic criteria and data was collected from diagnosis, occurrence of WBC > 100 x 10(9)/L, and last follow-up. 235 consecutive patients with CLL were identified; 94 were excluded. 141 included patients had a median age of 61 years and median WBC 19.7 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis. Median follow-up for all patients was 56 months, and median survival was 104 months. 41 patients (29%) had ≥ 1 episode of WBC > 100 x 10(9)1/L, occurring at a median of 38 months from diagnosis. Compared to controls matched for modified Rai stage, development of a WBC > 100 x 10(9)/L did not predict inferior survival (median 107 vs. 101 months, p = 0.72). We conclude that the occurrence of a WBC count > 100 x 10(9)/L in patients with CLL does not shorten the survival, and patients require therapy only if other indications for treatment are present.

### Influenza colloidal gold method and blood routine tests combination for rapid diagnosis of influenza: a decision tree-based analysis [^1149A7L4]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Significantly elevated monocyte levels may represent atypical lymphocytes. In influenza patients, the immune response of lymphocytes induces T-lymphocyte activation, with the resultant production of atypical lymphocytes, which are larger and have large nuclei and loose chromatin. Instruments used for hematological analysis tend to recognize these atypical lymphocytes as monocytes, which results in a false increase in monocyte percentage. In future research, the manual verification of routine blood test results from patients with significant monocyte percentage elevation can be used to determine whether these additional monocytes are atypical lymphocytes. However, significant monocyte count elevation may suggest the presence of non-influenza infections, and in such circumstances, testing for other respiratory pathogens can be performed.

In China's primary care system, people with flu-like symptoms are routinely given blood routine examinations when they go to the clinic. Further pathogenic microorganisms tests depend on whether the primary care institution is equipped with relevant technology, as well as the patient's willingness, payment method, and suggestion from the clinician. Patients attending primary care facilities often seek to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR), which generally results within 4–6 h, is ideal for influenza detection in primary care. However, the technology and conditions to carry out RT-PCR are usually not available in primary health care facilities. Some secondary and tertiary general hospitals in China can carry out RT-PCR detection. But due to the relatively complex technology, the actual detection efficiency is low, and the results need to be waited for 3–10 days. The CDC in some areas can offer free nucleic acid testing for influenza viruses, with a wait of 7–14 days for results. These conditions affected the timeliness of diagnosis, which could increase the likelihood of blind treatment with antibiotics. This phenomenon may be prevalent in primary care systems in the most underdeveloped regions of the world.

### Lymphopenia in cancer patients and its effects on response to immunotherapy: an opportunity for combination with cytokines? [^116ZBYMJ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Quantitative lymphocyte alterations are frequent in patients with cancer, and strongly impact prognosis and survival. The development of cancers in immunosuppressed patients has demonstrated the contribution of different T cell populations, including CD4 + cells, in the control of cancer occurrence. Whereas absolute numbers of neutrophils, platelets and red blood cells are routinely monitored in clinic following treatments, because of possible short-term complications, absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), their subpopulations or diversity (phenotype, TCR) are rarely analyzed and never used to choose therapy or as prognostic criteria. The recent identification of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi) as powerful therapeutic agents has revitalized immunotherapy of cancer in a broader group of diseases than anticipated. The status of the immune system is now recognized as an important biomarker for response to these novel treatments. Blood ALC values, along with tumor infiltration by CD8 + T cells, and ICPi and ICPi-ligand expression, are likely to be a potential marker of sensitivity to anti-ICPi therapy. In this article, we review the current knowledge on the incidence and significance of lymphopenia in cancer patients, and discuss therapeutic strategies to restore lymphocyte numbers.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^111cLhuZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Study

We searched 3 major databases — MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) — for clinical studies published December 1, 2019, through March 28, 2020. To broadly identify studies detailing lymphocyte and leukocyte testing among patients with COVID-19, we used the following search criteria: "(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-NCoV OR HCov-19 OR novel coronavirus) AND (laboratory OR WBC OR lymphocyte)". We prioritized studies that measured lymphocyte and leukocyte counts among patients who had severe or critical cases versus those with mild cases. Severe cases were defined as significant respiratory distress (acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission) caused by COVID-19.

Our meta-analysis included articles about studies and clinical trials that met the following 4 inclusion criteria: 1) involved adult, human patients; 2) written in English; 3) reported lymphocyte and leukocyte counts for patients; and 4) compared patients with severe versus mild illness. Our meta-analysis excluded articles about studies with the following 9 characteristics: 1) involved nonhuman subjects; 2) written in a language other than English; 3) were not a clinical trial, such as a review paper or letter; 4) were out of the scope of the study question detailed above; 5) did not provide raw data to perform quantitative meta-analysis; 6) involved pediatric patients; 7) did not have the full article available; 8) were duplicates; and 9) were ongoing or not completed.

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis [^114QKP5w]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated white blood cell count has many potential etiologies, including malignant and nonmalignant causes. It is important to use age- and pregnancy-specific normal ranges for the white blood cell count. A repeat complete blood count with peripheral smear may provide helpful information, such as types and maturity of white blood cells, uniformity of white blood cells, and toxic granulations. The leukocyte differential may show eosinophilia in parasitic or allergic conditions, or it may reveal lymphocytosis in childhood viral illnesses. Leukocytosis is a common sign of infection, particularly bacterial, and should prompt physicians to identify other signs and symptoms of infection. The peripheral white blood cell count can double within hours after certain stimuli because of the large bone marrow storage and intravascularly marginated pools of neutrophils. Stressors capable of causing an acute leukocytosis include surgery, exercise, trauma, and emotional stress. Other nonmalignant etiologies of leukocytosis include certain medications, asplenia, smoking, obesity, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Symptoms suggestive of a hematologic malignancy include fever, weight loss, bruising, or fatigue. If malignancy cannot be excluded or another more likely cause is not suspected, referral to a hematologist/oncologist is indicated.

### Clinical significance of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profiles in patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection [^113Bg66c]. Microbes and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

This study characterizes the alterations in peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokine levels in patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and evaluates their clinical relevance. We collected clinical data from 215 RSV-positive inpatients. Patients were stratified into distinct groups according to different criteria; within-group comparisons were performed. In the RSV-infected group, absolute counts of all peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were significantly lower than in controls and showed a negative correlation with disease severity. Conversely, all measured cytokines were markedly elevated in the infected group and positively correlated with the severity of RSV infection. Within the infected group, elderly patients (≥ 65 years) showed significantly different lymphocyte-subset counts and cytokine profiles compared with non-elderly patients. Similarly, individuals with high-risk diseases exhibited significant differences in these parameters relative to those without such diseases. RSV infection induces abnormalities in peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokine levels. The magnitude of these immune changes is linked to disease severity, patient age, and selected comorbidities, suggesting their potential utility as adjunct biomarkers for clinical assessment.

### Laboratory clues to immunodeficiency; missed chances for early diagnosis? [^114GHXNU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Primary immunodeficiency is seen in an estimated one in 1200 people, and secondary immunodeficiency is increasingly common, particularly with the use of immunosuppresion, cancer therapies and the newer biological therapies such as rituximab. Delays in the diagnosis of immunodeficiency predictably lead to preventable organ damage. Examples of abnormal pathology tests that suggest immunodeficiency from all laboratory specialities are given, where vigilant interpretation of abnormal results may prompt earlier diagnosis. If immunodeficiency is suspected, suggested directed testing could include measuring immunoglobulins, a lymphocyte count and T-cell and B-cell subsets.

### T-cell subset counts in peripheral blood can Be used as discriminatory biomarkers for diagnosis and severity prediction of coronavirus disease 2019 [^113jKKbx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

This study evaluated the significance of lymphocyte subset detection in peripheral blood in the diagnosis and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our results revealed that CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer cells were significantly decreased in patients with COVID-19. These patients had a relatively slight decrease in CD4+ T cells but a severe decrease in CD8+ T cells. The significantly elevated CD4/CD8 ratio was observed in COVID-19 patients. T-cell subset counts were related to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19, suggesting that the counts of CD8+ T and CD4+ T cells can be used as diagnostic markers of COVID-19 and predictors of disease severity.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^111Ge6pq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pooled data across early studies validate a significant correlation between elevated leukocyte count and decreased lymphocyte count among patients with severe cases of COVID-19 compared with those with mild cases. Why lymphopenia is associated with severe illness remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that this association could result from direct lymphocyte infection, destruction of lymphatic tissue, inflammation leading to lymphocyte apoptosis, or inhibition of lymphocytes by metabolic disorders such as lactic acidosis. Lymphopenia as a marker of severity does not seem to be specific to COVID-19; it has been used to prognosticate other viral pneumonias such as influenza. Neutrophilia may be more specific to severe disease than leukocytosis, but neutrophil count was not uniformly reported across the studies included in our analysis.

Despite our findings regarding clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19, our study had several limitations. First, our literature search found an expected paucity of data surrounding this topic because published characterizations of patients with COVID-19 remain minimal. More COVID-19 data from other nations and patient populations will aid in the comparison and validation of our clinical findings. Second, we noted significant heterogeneity in both the leukocyte and lymphocyte analyses. This phenomenon probably resulted from the small sample size, limited and early data, and skewed representation of the patient population. Third, the definitions of severe cases were somewhat inconsistent across these studies, varying from acute hypoxic respiratory failure to requiring mechanical ventilation. This variability could further compound the heterogeneity found across these studies. Last, only a minority of the manuscripts reported the proportion of patients with lymphopenia, and variable cutoffs based on the articles' reference ranges made it difficult to ascertain a cutoff for severe disease.

With the rising cases of COVID-19 and limited resources, being able to prioritize patients with severe disease is crucial. Some therapeutic agents are being investigated; however, supplies are often low and procurement may be delayed. The sooner patients with severe disease can be identified, the sooner the process of obtaining therapy can be initiated.

### Elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in non-affective psychotic adolescent inpatients: evidence for early association between inflammation and psychosis [^113mhU6P]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

Accumulating data suggest an association between inflammation and schizophrenia and related psychosis. While several studies have established this immune-psychosis association in adult schizophrenia patients, there is very limited data associating inflammation with acute psychosis in children and adolescents. The ratio between neutrophils and lymphocyte, computed from routine blood counts, has been shown to correlate with traditional markers of inflammation, and is therefore considered a proxy-marker for inflammation. Here we report elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and total leukocyte count in psychotic adolescent inpatients (n = 81, mean age 14.7 years, 52% males) compared to non-psychotic adolescent inpatient (n = 285, mean age 15.9 years, 58% males), in a population of adolescent inpatients with no affective symptomatology. The elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio remained significant after controlling for confounders such as age, BMI, smoking and antipsychotic medication. In a subset of psychotic adolescent inpatients (n = 20, mean duration between blood test 157 days), we found significant decrease in neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio at clinical remission compared with the acute psychotic state. The results suggest that psychosis is associated with peripheral markers of inflammation early in the course of psychiatric pathology, and that inflammation may represent a state that accompanies psychosis and decreases during clinical remission.

### Failure to normalize lymphopenia following trauma is associated with increased mortality, independent of the leukocytosis pattern [^111GV4eC]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from the trauma registry of Rhode Island's only Level 1 trauma center over the 5 year period of September 2003 to September 2008. Patients were included if they were moderately or severely injured, as denoted by an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of ≥ 15, aged 18 years or older, and they survived at least 3 days. Only patients with at least 2 complete blood counts over the 4 days to include all components (white cell count, lymphocyte count and neutrophil count) were included. Further, patients were excluded if they had non-survivable injuries as denoted by an ISS = 75. Patients with minimal injuries often do not display an exaggerated immune response, hence the exclusion of patients with ISS < 15. Clinical information obtained included age, gender, mechanism of trauma. Degree of injury was assessed by extracting the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Trauma & Injury Severity Score (TRISS). Outcomes data included mortality at 21 days, total length of stay, of those who died within the 21 days - then time to death, and, of the survivors, time to healthy discharge.

The data for the Complete Blood Count (CBC) was obtained from the labs that were drawn as standard of care. Blood tests that were ordered by the trauma team were analyzed in standard fashion in the clinical laboratories of Rhode Island Hospital. Every Complete Blood Cell count (CBC) that was obtained for the first 4 days (96 hours from admission) on these patients was extracted from the medical record. This was further broken into the components of neutrophil count (percentage and absolute number) and lymphocyte count (percentage and absolute count). Since this was clinical data obtained during the normal course of patient care, the ranges for normal leukocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes are those established by our clinical laboratory at Rhode Island Hospital. Specifically, normal white cell count = 4.0–11.0 × 10 9 /L, and leukocytosis was defined as any value above 11.0 × 10 9 /L. A normal neutrophil count = 1.5–7.5 × 10 9 /L, and an elevated neutrophil count was defined as any value above 7.5 × 10 9 /L; normal lymphocyte count = 1.0–4.0 × 10 9 /L and lymphopenia was defined as any value below 1.0 × 10 9 /L.

### Peripheral blood smear demonstration of lymphocyte changes in severe COVID-19 [^1164JWcH]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

During the incubation period of COVID-19, adaptive immunity plays a crucial role in eliminating the virus. In immunocompromised patients, because of medical comorbidities, an effective antiviral immunity cannot be mounted, leading to a hyperinflammatory state that culminates into ARDS. This case illustrates the morphological evolution of lymphocyte activation seen in a patient with COVID-19. During viral infection, B-lymphocytes are activated to become lymphoplasmacytoid lymphocytes and immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells which have a distinctive morphology. – There is emerging evidence that, in addition to elevated inflammatory markers and lymphopenia, elevated lymphoplasmacytoid lymphocytes, which correlate with antibody secreting and CD38 + antigen secreting B-lymphocytes, may predict clinical severity in COVID-19.

### Quantitative peripheral blood perturbations of γ δ T cells in human disease and their clinical implications [^115zDoQz]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Human γδ T cells, which play innate and adaptive, protective as well as destructive, roles in the immune response, were discovered in 1986, but the clinical significance of alterations of the levels of these cells in the peripheral blood in human diseases has not been comprehensively reviewed. Here, we review patterns of easily measurable changes of this subset of T cells in peripheral blood from relevant publications in PubMed and their correlations with specific disease categories, specific diagnoses within disease categories, and prognostic outcomes. These collective data suggest that enumeration of γδ T cells and their subsets in the peripheral blood of patients could be a useful tool to evaluate diagnosis and prognosis in the clinical setting.

### Hematological findings and complications of COVID-19 [^113f1NYB]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 is a systemic infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis. Lymphopenia may be considered as a cardinal laboratory finding, with prognostic potential. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and peak platelet/lymphocyte ratio may also have prognostic value in determining severe cases. During the disease course, longitudinal evaluation of lymphocyte count dynamics and inflammatory indices, including LDH, CRP and IL-6 may help to identify cases with dismal prognosis and prompt intervention in order to improve outcomes. Biomarkers, such high serum procalcitonin and ferritin have also emerged as poor prognostic factors. Furthermore, blood hypercoagulability is common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Elevated D-Dimer levels are consistently reported, whereas their gradual increase during disease course is particularly associated with disease worsening. Other coagulation abnormalities such as PT and aPTT prolongation, fibrin degradation products increase, with severe thrombocytopenia lead to life-threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which necessitates continuous vigilance and prompt intervention. So, COVID-19 infected patients, whether hospitalized or ambulatory, are at high risk for venous thromboembolism, and an early and prolonged pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is highly recommended. Last but not least, the need for assuring blood donations during the pandemic is also highlighted.

### Association between the C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte index and metabolic syndrome: evidence from the 2003–2010 national health and nutrition examination survey [^114WxLpS]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

MetS is associated with various risk factors and plays a crucial role in disease progression. There is mounting evidence illustrating an association between MetS and inflammation, nutritional status, and immune function. MetS causes modifications in cell signaling pathways, resulting in elevated inflammatory markers, lipid peroxides, and free radicals. The use of CRP as an inflammatory biomarker is becoming more common in the assessment of cardiovascular risk, with CRP elevation linked to key MetS risk factors, such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and abdominal adiposity. A previous study showed that CRP was significantly elevated in patients with MetS, highlighting the inflammatory state of the body and underscoring the importance of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of MetS, which is consistent with the findings of the present study.

T lymphocytes, which are crucial players in the adaptive immune response, intricately contribute to inflammation in patients with obesity. Individuals with obesity and those with MetS exhibit elevated T lymphocyte counts, disrupting the delicate balance between pro-inflammation and anti-inflammation. Some studies have associated heightened lymphocyte counts with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus due to insulin resistance. Although some studies have suggested compromised lymphocyte function, evidenced by increased apoptosis or decreased immune response capacity, conflicting findings have emerged. The present study confirmed that individuals with MetS had significantly higher peripheral blood lymphocyte counts than healthy controls, supporting their role in MetS pathogenesis. This finding is consistent with emerging evidence illustrating the crucial role of the immune system in MetS development and highlighting the complex relationship between immune dysregulation and metabolic disturbances.

### Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte to monocyte ratio and platelet to lymphocyte ratio to predict the severity of COVID-19 [^116vXSE6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In this study, we aimed to investigate and compare the prognostic impacts of C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil (NEU)-to-lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) biomarkers in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as to explore the most useful diagnostic biomarkers and optimal cutoff values in COVID-19 patients.

Methods

A total of 233 patients were admitted to Emergency Department (ED) of Pamukkale University Hospital during two months (March-April 2020) and underwent Sars CoV-2 PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), complete blood count (CBC), and CRP tests in sequence due to complaints of COVID-19. The laboratory results and demographic findings were collected from the public health management system retrospectively. The patients with positive Sars CoV-2 PCR test along with hospitalization data were also recorded.

Results

The CRP (p = 0.0001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.038), PLR (p = 0.0001) and NLR (p = 0.001) remained significantly higher in the patients with positive Sars CoV-2 PCR test result. By contrast, eosinophil (p = 0.0001), lymphocyte (p = 0.0001), platelet levels (p = 0.0001) were calculated as significantly higher in negative Sars CoV-2 patients.

Conclusion

In the light of the obtained results, the CRP, LDH, PLR and NLR levels remained significantly higher in COVID-19 positive patients, while eosinophil, lymphocyte, and platelet levels were significantly elevated in COVID-19 negative patients.

### Increases in absolute lymphocytes and circulating CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are associated with positive clinical outcome of melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab [^111ZgUcn]. Clinical Cancer Research (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate changes of peripheral blood biomarkers and their impact on clinical outcome following treatment with ipilimumab in advanced melanoma patients.

Experimental Design

Changes in blood counts and the frequency of circulating immune cell populations analyzed by flow cytometry were investigated in 82 patients to compare baseline values with different time-points after starting ipilimumab. Endpoints were overall survival (OS) and best clinical response. Statistical calculations were done by Wilcoxon-matched pairs tests, Fisher exact test, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression analysis.

Results

Increases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) 2 to 8 weeks (P = 0.003) and in percentages of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells 8 to 14 weeks (P = 0.001 and P = 0.02) after the first dose of ipilimumab were correlated with improved survival. These associations did not meet significance criteria, when conservatively adjusted for multiple testing, but were additionally correlated with clinical responses (all P < 0.05). However, validation is required. Increases in all three factors were observed in 36% of patients, who had a favorable outcome and survival probabilities of 93.3% and 63.8% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. A partial or complete response was observed in 71% of these patients compared with only 8% in patients with decreases in ≥ 1 of the 3 factors, respectively. Changes of regulatory T cells or myeloid-derived suppressor cells were not associated with OS.

Conclusions

Increases of ALC observed 2 to 8 weeks after initiation of ipilimumab and delayed increases in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells reflect changes associated with positive outcome. These changes represent surrogate marker candidates and warrant further validation. Clin Cancer Res; 22(19); 4848–58. ©2016 AACR.

### Influenza colloidal gold method and blood routine tests combination for rapid diagnosis of influenza: a decision tree-based analysis [^115MukLb]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In this study, the proportion of patients who underwent routine blood tests, colloidal gold tests, and chest X-rays was 94%, 82%, and 16%, respectively. This shows that, at the early stages of the disease, routine blood tests and influenza colloidal gold tests are commonly used. In this study, influenza patients with a positive nucleic acid test result had a lower WBC count and neutrophil percentage than the patients with a negative nucleic acid test result, whose lymphocyte and monocyte percentage were higher, and these differences are statistically significant (P < 0.05). A WBC count < 9.075 × 10 9 /L emerged as an important cutoff point. Among patients with a positive nucleic acid test result, 10% of patients had elevated WBC count and 28% had an elevated neutrophil count. It is plausible that some of the influenza patients included in this study had a concomitant bacterial infection.

The decision tree model in our study found that the monocyte percentage range is relevant to rapid influenza diagnosis. Patients with a monocyte percentage within 10.95–12.55% were more likely to have influenza, whereas the PPV of this parameter decreased at a monocyte percentage > 12.55%. This finding can be explained given the growing understanding of the immune function of monocytes. Monocytes are critical regulators of the innate systemic inflammatory response, and their levels tend to be elevated in severe infections. Aegerter et al.reported that monocytes play an important role in influenza. Alveolar macrophages originate from monocytes and have antibacterial effects. Moreover, influenza viruses enter the cytoplasm through receptor-mediated endocytosis and promote monocytes/macrophages to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 1 [IL-1], IL-4, IL-6, interferon-gamma, etc.) and to induce immune responses and phagocytosis in lymphocytes, while removing damaged or senescent cells. Therefore, monocytes play an important role in antiviral immunity.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116kZkpy]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

CD4 count monitoring — The CD4 count is the most important laboratory indicator of immune function in people with HIV, and low pretreatment CD4 count is the strongest predictor of disease progression and mortality according to findings from clinical trials and cohort studies. CD4 counts are highly variable; a significant change (2 standard deviations) between two tests is approximately a 30% change in the absolute count, or an increase or decrease in CD4 percentage by three percentage points. Monitoring of lymphocyte subsets other than CD4 (e.g. CD8, CD19) is not recommended (BIII) because it has not been proven to be clinically useful and is more expensive than monitoring CD4 count alone.

Lymphocyte function testing — Tests that quantify lymphocyte function measure the ability of lymphocytes to (1) proliferate, (2) produce inflammatory mediators and cytokines or chemokines, (3) mount cytotoxic responses, and (4) regulate immune responses. Lymphocyte proliferative responses may be evaluated by either nonspecific mitogens or specific soluble and cell-bound antigens. In vitro proliferative responses to some soluble antigens, but not mitogens, have been shown to correlate with in vivo delayed hypersensitivity, although the role of lymphocyte proliferation as measured in vitro in the delayed-type hypersensitivity tissue reaction is unclear.

### Low eosinophil and low lymphocyte counts and the incidence of 12 cardiovascular diseases: a CALIBER cohort study [^114rdiXE]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Exposure

The main exposures were eosinophil and lymphocyte counts as recorded in primary care. If a patient had more than one measurement on a given day, the values were aggregated by taking the mean. We analysed eosinophil and lymphocyte counts as categorical variables in order to avoid presuming a particular shape for the association with cardiovascular diseases. There were no clinically obvious cutpoints or consistent definitions of 'normal' lymphocyte or eosinophil counts in the literature. In the absence of a clear rationale for choosing specific cutpoints, we chose to study quintiles; however, the number of decimal places varied between laboratories (units: cells×10 9 /L) and the absolute values of eosinophil counts were small relative to the precision of recording (see online supplementary figure S1). In order to avoid biasing the category allocation by precision, we manually adjusted the eosinophil category boundaries, so that the second decimal place was 5, thus ensuring that any values recorded to two decimal places would end up in the same category if they were recorded to only one decimal place. We derived quintile-based categories for lymphocyte counts by a similar method. All category intervals were closed at the lower bound and open at the upper bound, that is, '0.05 to 0.15' includes 0.05 but not 0.15.

Eosinophil and lymphocyte counts can be affected by many factors such as infections, autoimmune diseases, medication and haematological conditions. We sought to differentiate between a patient's long-term 'stable' leucocyte profile and results obtained when the patient had an 'acute' condition which may alter leucocyte counts. We used other information in the electronic health record to assess whether the patient was clinically 'acute' or 'stable' at the time of the blood test, adapting a set of criteria proposed by the eMERGE consortium(electronic Medical Records and Genomics) for studying genetic determinants of the stable leucocyte counts: in hospital on the date of blood test, vaccination in the previous 7 days, anaemia diagnosis within the previous 30 days, symptoms or diagnosis of infection within the previous 30 days, prior diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome, prior diagnosis of haemoglobinopathy, cancer chemotherapy or granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) within 6 months before index date, or the use of drugs affecting the immune system such as methotrexate or steroids within the previous 3 months. Patients with HIV, splenectomy or on dialysis were excluded from this study, as their leucocyte counts may be difficult to interpret.

Results

Patient characteristics

A total of 86 boys and 49 girls with IM(median age: 3 years old) were included as study participants. Diagnostic criteria were referred to for inclusion. A total of 62 boys and 38 girls who underwent physical examination during the same period were allocated to the healthy control group(median age: 3 years old). Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in age and gender distribution between the IM group and the healthy group (P < 0.05). These findings are summarized in Table 1.

IM diagnosis by peripheral blood lymphocyte testing

The peripheral blood samples of 86 males and 49 females with IM were analyzed by flow cytometry to assess the immunological changes. The proportions of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and anisotropic lymphocytes were significantly elevated in the IM group compared with the healthy group (P < 0.001 for all subsets). Specifically, the number of CD3 + and CD8 + T cells were significantly increased in the IM group (P < 0.001 for both subsets). The levels of CD4 + and CD16 + CD56 + T cells and CD19 + B cells were substantially decreased in the IM group (P < 0.001, P < 0.05, and P < 0.001 for each subset). The CD4+/CD8 + ratio of the IM group was 0.29 which was significantly lower than 1.83 of the control group (P < 0.001). All the lymphocyte subset changes were detailed in Table 2.

Factors that affect absolute CD4 count — basis, variability, and preferred parameter: The absolute CD4 count is a calculated value based on the total white blood cell (WBC) count and the percentages of total and CD4 T lymphocytes, and this absolute number may fluctuate or be influenced by factors affecting WBC count and lymphocyte percentages, such as use of bone marrow–suppressive medications, chronic corticosteroids, or acute infections; splenectomy or coinfection with human T-lymphotropic virus type I may cause misleadingly elevated CD4 counts, and in these settings CD4 percentage remains stable and may be a more appropriate parameter to assess a person's immune function.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^113Y3LSJ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

General immunologic screening — Simple, cost-effective tests include (1) an absolute lymphocyte count, (2) the absolute number of CD4+ T cells, and (3) the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Investigation of non-IgE and non–cell-mediated clinical immunologic disorders may require tests that indicate abnormal adaptive and innate immune reactions, and abnormal serum and urine proteins, including cryoglobulins, may be associated with several abnormal immune syndromes. The inflammatory consequences induced by immune functions may be detected by nonspecific tests, such as a complete blood cell count with differential, sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and other acute-phase reactants, and evaluation of complement activation with a decrease of C3 and C4 may indicate complement deficiency, drug reactions, or the presence of immune complexes, which often are associated with increases in serum cryoglobulins and C1q binding.

### The elevated preoperative platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts poor prognosis in breast cancer patients [^117CwsUA]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Previous studies have demonstrated an association between lower peripheral blood lymphocyte count and poor survival in different types of cancer.showed an improved survival in breast cancer patients with elevated lymphocyte counts compared with those with lower lymphocyte counts.

Furthermore, previous studies demonstrated that normalisation of an initial lymphocytopenia resulted in an improved clinical outcome in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. An elevated lymphocyte count has also significantly been associated with prolonged OS in patients with multiple myeloma and metastatic colorectal cancer.

A combined index using platelet and lymphocyte counts has been investigated as prognostic marker for different cancer entities. In advanced gastric cancer patients, demonstrated that an elevated PLR is associated with worse OS. A poor prognostic impact of an elevated PLR has also been demonstrated in ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, recent studies have shown a significant association between an elevated PLR and decreased OS after curative resection of colorectal cancer.

In breast cancer, found a correlation between an elevated PLR and the number of infiltrated lymph nodes. More recently, studied the impact of the PLR on OS in 437 breast cancer patients. The authors categorised the included patients according to PLR quartiles and found that patients in the highest PLR quartile had a significant higher 5-year mortality rate.

In breast cancer patients, elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, and serum IL-6 have also been associated with reduced survival. Furthermore, the measurement of the systemic inflammatory response using a selective combination of C-reactive protein and albumin (termed the modified Glasgow prognostic score) has been shown to have prognostic value in different cancer entities including breast cancer. Besides PLR, other pre-therapeutic indices of systemic inflammation such as NLR and the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio have been suggested to provide prognostic information in different cancer entities.

6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities

Adults:

Clinically significant abnormalities (irrespective of drug relationship) occurring during the clinical trials were reported as follows: with an incidence of greater than 1%: decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and blood glucose; elevated serum creatine phosphokinase, potassium, ALT, GGT, AST, BUN, creatinine, blood glucose, platelet count, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils; with an incidence of less than 1%: leukopenia, neutropenia, decreased sodium, potassium, platelet count, elevated monocytes, basophils, bicarbonate, serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, LDH, and phosphate. The majority of subjects with elevated serum creatinine also had abnormal values at baseline. When follow-up was provided, changes in laboratory tests appeared to be reversible.

In multiple-dose clinical trials involving more than 5000 patients, four patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-related liver enzyme abnormalities and one because of a renal function abnormality.

Pediatric Patients:

One, Three, and Five-Day Regimens

Laboratory data collected from comparative clinical trials employing two 3-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 3 days), or two 5-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 5 days) were similar for regimens of azithromycin and all comparators combined, with most clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring at incidences of 1 to 5%. Laboratory data for patients receiving 30 mg/kg as a single dose were collected in one single center trial. In that trial, an absolute neutrophil count between 500 to 1500 cells/mm3was observed in 10/64 patients receiving 30 mg/kg as a single dose, 9/62 patients receiving 30 mg/kg given over 3 days, and 8/63 comparator patients. No patient had an absolute neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3.

In multiple-dose clinical trials involving approximately 4700 pediatric patients, no patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-related laboratory abnormalities.

### Application of clinical and CT imaging features in the evaluation of disease progression in patients with COVID-19 [^117S3CF7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Lymphopenia is a prominent feature of critically ill COVID-19 patients owing to the targeted invasion of SARS-CoV viral particles, which disrupt the cytoplasmic components of lymphocytes, leading to their destruction. Results from deceased and severely ill patients indicate that the percentage of lymphocytes in the blood is negatively correlated with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Studies have shown that 10–12 days post-symptom onset, the lymphocyte percentage in patients with mild COVID-19 remains above 20%. In contrast, severe cases exhibited lymphocyte percentages < 20%. Patients who progress to severe and critical conditions often have comorbid diabetes, a significant decrease in PaO2, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels associated with myocardial enzyme spectrum abnormalities, and liver function changes with elevated AST and ALT levels. The results of this study are consistent with these findings. Elevated D-dimer levels in patients with severe COVID-19 suggest hyperfibrinolysis. Approximately 50% of COVID-19 patients exhibit elevated D-dimer levels, and the degree of elevation in fibrin degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer levels is significantly higher in severe and deceased patients than in mild and surviving patients. Comparing laboratory indices between survivors and deceased patients, deceased patients demonstrated consistently elevated D-dimer levels, which subsequently remained high. Although CRP levels should be elevated in COVID-19 patients due to excessive inflammatory responses and heightened immune reactions during the progressive stage, this study observed fewer cases with elevated CRP, potentially attributable to the limited number of cases and early hospitalization of some severely ill patients.

Key messages

- SIRS response following traumatic injury is associated with lymphocyte loss

- A persistently low lymphocyte level over the first 4 days following moderate and severe injury is associated with increased mortality and increased hospital length of stay

- The association between failure to normalize lymphocyte number with worsening outcomes is suggestive of a key role for lymphocytes in the response to traumatic injuries

- The lymphocyte profile, and the association with outcomes is independent of the rest of the leukocyte response to trauma

### Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin (Qtern) [^111qvmn7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Decrease in Lymphocyte Counts

Saxagliptin

A dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count has been observed with saxagliptin. In a pool of 5 placebo-controlled studies, a mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 100 cells/microL relative to placebo was observed. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count ≤ 750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, and 0.4% in the 2.5 mg, 5 mg saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively.

The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not known. The effect of saxagliptin on lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocyte abnormalities (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is unknown.

Increase in Hematocrit

Dapagliflozin

In a pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies with dapagliflozin, increases from baseline in mean hematocrit values were observed in dapagliflozin-treated patients starting at Week 1 and continuing up to Week 16, when the maximum mean difference from baseline was observed. At Week 24, the mean changes from baseline in hematocrit were -0.33% in the placebo group and 2.30% in the 10 mg dapagliflozin group. By Week 24, hematocrit values > 55% were reported in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients and 1.3% of 10 mg dapagliflozin-treated patients.

Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol

Patients treated with QTERN demonstrated a mean percent increase from baseline LDL-cholesterol (ranging from 2.1 to 6.9%).

Elevations in Creatine Kinase

An imbalance in the number of subjects who experienced serum creatine kinase (CK) elevations > 10x the upper limit of normal (a marker of muscle injury/necrosis) was observed in 5 subjects (1%) treated with QTERN. The elevations were transient. Rhabdomyolysis was reported for one of those subjects for which no obvious cause was identified.

Decrease in Serum Bicarbonate

In a study of concomitant therapy of 10 mg dapagliflozin with exenatide extended-release (on a background of metformin), four patients (1.7%) on concomitant therapy had a serum bicarbonate value of less than or equal to 13 mEq/L compared to one each (0.4%) in the dapagliflozin and exenatide-extended release treatment groups.

### Flow cytometry-based immune phenotyping of T and B lymphocytes in the evaluation of immunodeficiency and immune dysregulation [^112KeoRw]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

There are approximately 500 congenital disorders that impair immune cell development and/or function. Patients with these disorders may present with a wide range of symptoms, including increased susceptibility to infection, autoimmunity, autoinflammation, lymphoproliferation, and/or atopy. Flow cytometry-based immune phenotyping of T and B lymphocytes plays an essential role in the evaluation of patients with these presentations. In this review, we describe the clinical utility of flow cytometry as part of a comprehensive evaluation of immune function and how this testing may be used as a diagnostic tool to identify underlying aberrant immune pathways, monitor disease activity, and assess infection risk.

### Use of total lymphocyte count for monitoring response to antiretroviral therapy [^115xKTwb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The CD4 cell count has become a key laboratory measurement in the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. In ideal situations, HIV-infected persons are followed up longitudinally with serial CD4 cell counts to determine disease progression, risk for opportunistic infection, and the need for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention. However, the use of the CD4 cell count in resource-limited settings is often not possible because of lack of availability and high cost. Thus, other laboratory markers have been proposed as substitutes for the CD4 cell count. The data regarding the clinical utility of the total lymphocyte count (TLC) as a potential surrogate marker of immune function in patients with HIV disease are examined. The role of the TLC in the initiation of antiretroviral therapy and opportunistic infection prophylaxis, as well as the role of the TLC in monitoring the response to antiretroviral therapy, are also addressed.

### Platelet-to-lymphocyte percentage ratio index: a simple non-invasive index to monitor the endoscopic activity in Crohn's disease [^114DsQ9Z]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have reported that the platelet count was significantly elevated in patients with active-phase CD. It is believed that platelets act as an inflammatory amplifier under chronic inflammatory conditions, releasing various bioactive inflammatory particles and expressing a variety of inflammatory receptors. Therefore, an elevated platelet count indicates an inflammatory activation state. Meanwhile, it has also been found that an increase in whole-blood lymphocyte apoptosis, attributed to an imbalance in lymphocyte apoptosis factors, causes lymphocyte levels to decrease during the active period in paediatric IBD patients. In addition, a recent study of inflammatory bowel disease in children found reduced T-cell abundance and platelet aggregation in the intestinal epithelium of children with colitis. All of the above indicate that platelet count and lymphocyte percentage play an important role in the acute inflammatory course of CD.

As shown in previous studies, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio have emerged as well-known biomarkers of disease severity in IBDand other inflammatory diseasesand were recently proposed as prospective biomarkers of therapeutic effectiveness in ulcerative colitis. Both high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio levels can predict active endoscopic disease in ulcerative colitis, and lower levels of both baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio levels can predict positive therapeutic response to anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment in patients with ulcerative colitis. In this study, we found that PLpR better predicts ER in patients with CD than either the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio or the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio. Basically, the lymphocyte ratio parameter partly represents both neutrophils and lymphocytes, as these cells make up most white blood cells. To some extent, PLpR can be considered as the combination of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio. In summary, among the parameters derived from the CBC, PLpR performed better as an emerging inflammatory marker that can assess the activity of CD in patients.

### Using IL-2R / lymphocytes for predicting the clinical progression of patients with COVID-19 [^111QzYZU]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Effective laboratory markers for the estimation of disease severity and predicting the clinical progression of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is urgently needed. Laboratory tests, including blood routine, cytokine profiles and infection markers, were collected from 389 confirmed COVID-19 patients. The included patients were classified into mild (n = 168), severe (n = 169) and critical groups (n = 52). The leukocytes, neutrophils, infection biomarkers [such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and ferritin] and the concentrations of cytokines [interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α] were significantly increased, while lymphocytes were significantly decreased with increased severity of illness. The amount of IL-2R was positively correlated with the other cytokines and negatively correlated with lymphocyte number. The ratio of IL-2R to lymphocytes was found to be remarkably increased in severe and critical patients. IL-2R/lymphocytes were superior compared with other markers for the identification of COVID-19 with critical illness, not only from mild but also from severe illness. Moreover, the cytokine profiles and IL-2R/lymphocytes were significantly decreased in recovered patients, but further increased in disease-deteriorated patients, which might be correlated with the outcome of COVID-19. Lymphopenia and increased levels of cytokines were closely associated with disease severity. The IL-2R/lymphocyte was a prominent biomarker for early identification of severe COVID-19 and predicting the clinical progression of the disease.

### Investigation of association between clinically significant prostate cancer, obesity and platelet to-lymphocyte ratio and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [^1138EXmE]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Several blood markers of inflammation are elevated in prostate cancer (PCa) and have prognostic value. Little is known about the relationship between these markers, PCa, and other factors associated with chronic inflammation, such as smoking and obesity. We analyzed the interaction between neutrophil and platelet counts indexed to lymphocyte count (NLR and PLR, resp.) and clinically significant PCa (csPCa), accounting for the potential confounding factors of systemic inflammation.

Methods

NLR and PLR were evaluated in a multicenter prospective study in 443 patients. CsPCa was defined as a Gleason ≥ 4 + 3. Differences between patients with csPCa and non-csPCA were evaluated using the chi-square test, analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and in separate models, either body mass index or waist-to-hip ratio was used to characterize the relationship between inflammation and csPCa.

Results

None of the factors such as plateletcrit, NLR, and PLR were significantly different between patients with csPCa or non-significant PCa. After adjustment, there was no association between PLR, NLR, plateletcrit or platelet count and csPCa. In an exploratory analysis, there was no association between markers of inflammation and PSA levels > 10 ng/mL. When testing different NLR cutoffs to predict csPCa in ROC analysis, none reached a clinically meaningful value.

Conclusion

In contrast to previous studies, we found no significant association between easily available blood markers of inflammation and indices of PCa aggressiveness. Further research is required to determine whether inflammation promotes PCa. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03127631. Date of registration: April 25, 2017.

### Utility of serum cytokine testing to differentiate complicated common variable immunodeficiency in resource limited settings [^117GV5PG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig 3
Elevated serum sIL-2R and IL-10 levels were associated with lower immunoglobulin levels in patients with IEI and CVID. Association by Spearman correlation between cytokine level (x-axis: median, pg/mL in serum) and immunoglobulin level (y-axis: first or median, mg/dL in serum), as indicated. Bolded boxes denote significant associations of P < .05 (statistically adjusted for multiple testing). Spearman correlation coefficient (r) shown for negative (red) and positive (blue) correlations. Data are from all patients with IEI and any cytokine testing available (n = 201) (left) and all patients with CVID and any cytokine testing available (n = 75) (right).

Next, we evaluated the association between paired patient cytokines and lymphocyte subsets in blood (B-cell, NK-cell, T-cell, and regulatory T-cell flow cytometry panels as detailed in the Methods). In patients with IEI, higher sIL-2R and IL-10 levels correlated with lower naive T-cell subsets in blood (Spearman correlation coefficients shown in Fig 4). A correlation between higher IL-17 levels and lower NK cells was also observed. In patients with CVID, even stronger correlations emerged; higher sIL-2R and IL-10 levels correlated with both lower naive CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell subsets in blood (Spearman correlation coefficients shown in Fig 4). Additionally in CVID, higher sIL-2R levels correlated with fewer regulatory T cells in blood (r = −0.48; p = 0.002). Finally in CVID, a correlation between higher IL-6 levels and lower absolute CD8 + naive T cells was observed. There were no significant associations between T-cell lymphocyte subsets and any other cytokine level tested. Together, these data suggested a higher risk CVID-patient immunophenotype, defined by loss of naive T cells and regulatory T cells in blood, correlating with higher levels of sIL-2R and IL-10 in serum.

### Azithromycin (azithromycin dihydrate) [^113Ji2gM]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities

Adults

Clinically significant abnormalities (irrespective of drug relationship) occurring during the clinical trials were reported as follows: with an incidence of greater than 1%: decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and blood glucose; elevated serum creatine phosphokinase, potassium, ALT, GGT, AST, BUN, creatinine, blood glucose, platelet count, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils; with an incidence of less than 1%: leukopenia, neutropenia, decreased sodium, potassium, platelet count, elevated monocytes, basophils, bicarbonate, serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, LDH, and phosphate. The majority of subjects with elevated serum creatinine also had abnormal values at baseline. When follow-up was provided, changes in laboratory tests appeared to be reversible.

In multiple-dose clinical trials involving more than 5,000 patients, four patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-related liver enzyme abnormalities and one because of a renal function abnormality.

Pediatric Patients

One, Three, and Five Day Regimens

Laboratory data collected from comparative clinical trials employing two 3-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 3 days), or two 5-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 5 days) were similar for regimens of azithromycin and all comparators combined, with most clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring at incidences of 1 to 5%. Laboratory data for patients receiving 30 mg/kg as a single dose were collected in one single center trial. In that trial, an absolute neutrophil count between 500 to 1,500 cells/mm3was observed in 10/64 patients receiving 30 mg/kg as a single dose, 9/62 patients receiving 30 mg/kg given over 3 days, and 8/63 comparator patients. No patient had an absolute neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3.

In multiple-dose clinical trials involving approximately 4,700 pediatric patients, no patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-related laboratory abnormalities.

### PAN-immune inflammation value: a new biomarker for diagnosing appendicitis in children? [^116iokud]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Complete blood count (CBC) is easy to perform, cost-effective, and provides information on various cell types and morphological parameters (white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, monocyte count, platelet count, and mean platelet volume). For example, the diagnostic value of low-cost and routinely measured markers such as mean platelet volume (MPV) and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has been investigated. However, meta-analyses conducted in the pediatric population have shown that MPV does not significantly differ between children with acute appendicitis and healthy controls (WMD = -0.42, p = 0.19), and RDW similarly lacks discriminatory power (WMD = 0.23, p = 0.28). These findings indicate the limited clinical utility of MPV or RDW as standalone diagnostic tools. Additionally, combined ratios of these parameters are used as inflammation indices, assisting in the diagnosis, progression, and risk stratification of many diseases. The diagnostic value of CBC parameters is not limited to appendicitis alone; Growing evidence suggests that composite scores based on CBC can serve as prognostic biomarkers in cancer and inflammatory diseases. For example, parameters such as MPV and WBC (white blood cell count), when combined with machine learning models, have achieved an accuracy of 85% in COVID-19 diagnosis. Similarly, LYM (lymphocyte count) and PDW (platelet distribution width) have been used by automated algorithms to distinguish between influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections, achieving an accuracy of 98.4%. However, since many of these markers show non-specific elevations in infections, their use alone in diagnosing appendicitis is limited. In this context, several markers have been developed, including the recently introduced pan-immune-inflammation values (PIV), which encompasses levels of neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, and lymphocytes. By reflecting inflammatory and immune response dynamics that cannot be captured by a single biomarker, these markers may enhance diagnostic accuracy.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the recently developed PIV index, which includes levels of neutrophils, platelets, monocytes, and lymphocytes, can be used as a biomarker for diagnosing acute appendicitis in children and to compare the performance of PIV with other commonly used systemic inflammatory markers, such as the Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII), Systemic Inflammatory Response Index (SIRI), Neutrophil/Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), and Platelet/Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR).

### Predictive value of the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio in cancer patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^116oGpQj]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Cancer patients undergoing TAVR had a significantly higher PLR, which was associated with a worse overall survival.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Little is known about the prediction of adverse outcomes after TAVR in patients who have cancer. In this study, we derived the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), derived from a complete blood count with differential. Cancer patients undergoing TAVR had a significantly higher PLR than noncancer patients, and worse overall survival. An elevated PLR was associated with an increased risk of mortality, in both cancer and non-cancer patients. The highest mortality rate was observed in TAVR patients with a history of cancer and an elevated PLR.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The PLR, calculated from a differential complete blood cell count, might be a promising marker to assess the underlying inflammatory status of patients and to predict the benefits of undergoing the TAVR procedure both in cancer and noncancer patients. Additional studies are needed to further validate these findings.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, ESMO 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining serum β-2-microglobulin as an important prognostic marker (part of the CLL-International Prognostic Index) before initiating systemic therapy in patients with advanced or symptomatic stage disease.

### Diagnostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios in HLA-B27-associated acute anterior uveitis [^116bxJwK]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Access to HLA-B27 testing may be limited in certain healthcare settings due to factors such as cost, availability, and long turnaround times. In contrast, NLR and PLR are inexpensive, rapid, and easily obtained through routine blood tests, offering a practical alternative for preliminary evaluation in various clinical environments. Our findings demonstrate that NLR and PLR are significantly elevated in patients with active HLA-B27 AAU compared to healthy controls. A cut-off value of 2.11 for NLR and 133.61 for PLR was identified to differentiate patients from controls, both demonstrating good sensitivity and specificity.

The observed elevation in NLR and PLR suggests the presence of subclinical systemic inflammation in the early stages of active AAU, potentially preceding or coinciding with disease onset. The mean time from symptom onset to CBC testing in our cohort was 7.24 ± 5.02 days, which reflects the typical interval at which patients presented for evaluation and laboratory work-up.

The interplay between Th17-mediated inflammation, neutrophil activation, and systemic immune dysregulation provides a plausible explanation for the elevated NLR observed in our study. A key driver of this inflammation is the Th17 cell pathway, which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including HLA-B27-associated AAU. Th17 cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17, IL-6, and TNF-α, which actively promote neutrophil recruitment and activation. This mechanism is particularly relevant in HLA-B27-associated diseases, as increased IL-17 has been implicated in ankylosing spondylitis and associated uveitis. Elevated IL-17 levels contribute to systemic neutrophilia, leading to an increase in NLR. Additionally, IL-17 enhances neutrophil survival and prolongs their inflammatory activity, contributing to persistent inflammation even in the absence of overt infection.

### Exploring the prognostic impact of absolute lymphocyte count in patients treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors [^112QJrDt]. BJC Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

All-grade lymphopenia at 3 months from treatment initiation, whether new or persisting, is a significant negative prognostic marker for cancer patients on immunotherapy. Lymphopenia at baseline does not have the same prognostic implications. A history of RT is a significant risk factor for lymphopenia at baseline and at three months from treatment initiation. Prospective validation of these results is required among cancer patients on immunotherapy.

Comparison of ALC with NLR, PLR and other haematologic indices in this and other cohorts would be of benefit to establish the optimal prognostic biomarker.

In addition, it is unknown whether ALC during adjuvant immunotherapy is also prognostic of outcome, and this merits further investigation either prospectively or retrospectively. Clinicians should be vigilant for early signs of progression in those with a history of RT, and those with persisting or new lymphopenia at 3 months from treatment initiation.

### Failure to normalize lymphopenia following trauma is associated with increased mortality, independent of the leukocytosis pattern [^111Jrbh8]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Following trauma and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), the typical response is an elevation of the total complete blood count (CBC) and a reduction of the lymphocyte count. This leukocytosis typically returns to normal within 48 hours. The persistence of a leukocytosis following trauma is associated with adverse outcomes. Although lymphocyte anergy and dysfunction following trauma is associated with increased risk for infection and sepsis, there is a paucity of data regarding the impact of a persistence of a low lymphocyte count in trauma patients.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from trauma patients collected over the 5 years of September 2003 to September 2008. Patients were included if the injury severity score (ISS) was ≥ 15, and they survived at least 3 days. Demographic data, mechanism and injury severity score, mortality, and length of stay were collected from the medical record. Laboratory values for the first 4 hospital days were collected. Leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were extracted from the daily complete blood count (CBC). Patients were then grouped based on response (elevation/depression) of each component of the CBC, and their return, or failure thereof, to normal. Proportional hazards regression with time-varying covariates as well as Kaplan-Meier curves were used to predict risk of death, time to death and time to healthy discharge based on fluctuations of the individual components of the CBC.

Results

There were 2448 patients admitted over the 5 years included in the analysis. When adjusting for age, gender and ISS the relative risk of death was elevated with a persistent leukocytosis (2.501 (95% CI = 1.477–4.235)) or failure to normalize lymphopenia (1.639 (95% CI = 10.17–2.643)) within the first 4 days following admission. Similar results were seen when Kaplan-Meier curves were created. Persistent lymphopenia was associated with shortest time to death. Paradoxically in survivors persistent lymphopenia was associated with the shortest time to discharge.

Conclusions

Persistently abnormal CBC responses are associated with a higher mortality following trauma. This is the first report noting that a failure to normalize lymphopenia in severely injured patients is associated with significantly higher mortality.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

End Point and Follow‐Up

The primary and secondary end points of this study were cardiac and all‐cause death, respectively. All patients were followed up after discharge. Survival data were obtained by dedicated coordinators and investigators by 1 of the following methods: direct contact with patients and their physicians at the hospital; in an outpatient setting, by a telephone interview with the patient's families, or by mail. The duration of the follow‐up period was calculated from the day of admission until the end point.

Statistical Analysis

Data are presented as medians and interquartile ranges of 25% to 75% for continuous variables and as percentages for categorical variables. The Mann–Whitney U test or the Kruskal−Wallis rank sum test was used to compare the differences in continuous variables, with the results being presented as medians and interquartile ranges. The χ 2 test was used to compare the differences in categorical variables. The predictive values of NLR and PLR for the end point were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and the results are expressed in terms of the area under the curve and its 95% CI. Statistical trends among groups were evaluated with the Cochran−Armitage trend test. A multivariable logistic regression model was created to identify clinical characteristics associated with high NLR or PLR values, in which 19 clinically relevant factors were selected a priori, including patient demographics, comorbidities, medical history, and oral medications, and were simultaneously forced to enter the model. The prognostic value of the baseline characteristics and serial NLR and PLR measurements were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. A multivariate Cox model for the end points was adjusted for 8 characteristics — age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, hemoglobin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and NT‐proBNP level — which were speculated to be clinically important or were previously demonstrated to have prognostic significance. The NT‐proBNP level was log 10 transformed before its inclusion in the Cox model. The event‐free survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and differences in survival rates were compared among groups using the log‐rank test. The χ 2 test was performed to compare sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and predictive accuracy, which meant the proportion of all test results — both positive and negative — that were correct among the different criteria for prediction of outcome. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using MedCalc statistical software (version 20.026; MedCalc Software Ltd, Ostend, Belgium).

### Increased proportion of fas positive CD8 + cells in peripheral blood of patients with COPD [^1135s1xT]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by chronic inflammation in pulmonary tissue and is also associated with systemic effects. The objective of this study was determination of lymphocyte subpopulation and the expression of Fas receptor on lymphocytes derived from peripheral blood of patients with stable COPD (n = 18) and a control group: asymptomatic smokers (n = 12) and non-smokers (n = 12). Flow cytometry method with monoclonal antibodies was used for evaluation of lymphocyte subsets: CD4+ and CD8+ and the expression of Fas (CD95) on T lymphocytes. We found an elevated proportion of CD8+ cells in the blood of COPD patients. Proportion of Fas+ T lymphocytes was significantly higher in patients with COPD when compared with asymptomatic smokers and non-smokers (mean: 84.4% vs. 71.6% vs. 61.0% for Fas+/ CD4+ and 88.1% vs. 73.8% vs. 58.3% for Fas+/CD8+ lymphocytes). The proportion of Fas positive CD8+ cells significantly correlated with the degree of airway obstruction and hypoxemia. The significant correlations of Fas positive CD4+ and Fas positive CD8+ with smoking history expressed as pack years smoked were observed. Our observation of an elevated proportion of circulating lymphocytes bearing Fas receptor may play a role in induction of these cells' apoptosis and indicate the role of Fas/ FasL pathway in the changes in proportion of lymphocyte subpopulations in patients with COPD.

### Epstein-Barr in a patient presenting with right upper quadrant pain: a case report from the emergency department [^116ymMFA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and elevated cholestasis blood tests are usually associated with bacterial calculous cholecystitis. However, viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can also manifest with a similar clinical picture and is an important differential diagnosis.

Case Report

This case report discusses a young woman presenting to the emergency department with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The initial assessment revealed a positive Murphy's sign, elevated white blood count, and a cholestatic pattern on liver function tests, leading one to suspect bacterial calculous cholecystitis and initiating antibiotic therapy. However, clinical examination also revealed tonsillar exudates and differential white blood cell count revealed monocytosis and lymphocytosis rather than a high neutrophil count. The patient tested positive for EBV. Furthermore, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed gallbladder wall edema with no gallstones, leading one to conclude that the clinical manifestation and laboratory results were due to an EBV infection. Antibiotic therapy was ceased and the patient did not require surgical intervention. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Calculous bacterial cholecystitis usually entails antibiotic therapy and cholecystectomy. It is important to be aware of the differential diagnosis of EBV, as it usually does not require either of these and resolves spontaneously.

### Failure to normalize lymphopenia following trauma is associated with increased mortality, independent of the leukocytosis pattern [^111nQigZ]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Kaplan-Meier survival curve with respect to the pattern of the neutrophil fluctuations. There was no difference in survival comparing the 3 patterns, namely elevated-returned to normal, elevated-stayed elevated and never elevated. Group 1 = (green dashed line) Ever Neutrophilia = 1; Back to Normal = 1; 81.2% 21 day survival, Group 2 = (red dashed line) Ever Leukocytosis = 1; Back to Normal = 0; 81.8% 21 day survival, Group 3 = (blue dashed line) Ever Leukocytosis = 0; Back to Normal = 0; 74.7% 21 day survival.

Within the lymphocyte subdivisions, there were 792 patients (32.4%) in Group1 (lymphopenia - returned to normal), 817 patients (33.4%) in Group 2 (lymphopenia - persistent lymphopenia) and 839 patients (34.2%) in Group 3 - (never lymphopenic). With respect to the lymphocyte patterns, there was no difference in 21 day probability of survival between patients who displayed the expected pattern - Group 1, lymphocyte loss followed by recovery, and Group 3, patients who never exhibited a lymphocyte loss (83% versus 83.75%; p = 1.0). Patients in Group 2, who displayed lymphocyte loss, which did not recover within the first 4 days, had the lowest probability of survival at 21 days at 71.3% (p = 0.037) (Figure 3).

### Decreased total numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes with elevated percentages of CD4 + CD45RO + and CD4 + CD25 + of T-helper cells in non-segmental vitiligo [^115yn4dY]. The Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Vitiligo is a disorder involving progressive skin depigmentation caused by host mediated destruction of melanocytes. Its pathogenesis is known to correlate with elevated levels of activated skin-infiltrating T lymphocytes and is presumed to be autoimmune in nature. In the present study, we characterize the immunophenotype of peripheral blood T cells from vitiligo patients, with the objective of developing an investigative and diagnostic tool for the disease, using analysis of peripheral blood. Subjects for this investigation included 32 patients diagnosed with non-segmental vitiligo and 28 age-and gender-matched, normal, healthy control participants. Whole venous blood taken from each subject was analyzed using 2-color flow cytometry for immunologically-relevant lymphocyte subsets. When compared with healthy control subjects, peripheral blood from individuals with vitiligo was found to have lower total numbers of lymphocytes (p < 0.039). Vitiligo patients also had elevated percentages of memory (CD4+CD45RO+) T cells; (p < 0.05), but NK-T cells (CD3+CD16+CD56+) and naive T cells (CD4+CD45RA+) were present at lower total numbers and percentages than in healthy controls (p < 0.01 and 0.05 respectively). Blood from severely afflicted subjects exhibited elevated CD3+HLADR+ and CD4+CD45RO+ as well as lower percentages of NK-T cells (p < 0.05) when compared with mild cases. In conclusion, disease-associated, peripheral blood lymphocyte immunophenotypic profiles of vitiligo patients are consistent with the hypothesis of T cell activation as a major feature of the disorder. These include elevated memory and reduced naive T cell percentages and increased expression of the activation-associated surface antigen CD25. These changes presumably reflect increased antigen-mediated activation. Moreover, because a corollary effect is increased activation-induced cell death (AICD), lower overall lymphocyte counts observed in vitiligo-afflicted subjects is also expected.

### Diagnostic value of routine blood tests in differentiating between SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and RSV infections in hospitalized children: a retrospective study [^111NKEVJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections have similar modes of transmission and clinical symptoms. There is a need to identify simple diagnostic indicators to distinguish these three infections, particularly for community hospitals and low- and middle-income countries that lack nucleic acid detection kits. This study used clinical data to assess the diagnostic value of routine blood tests in differentiating between SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and RSV infections in children.

Methods

A total of 1420 children treated at the Hangzhou Children's Hospital between December 2022 and June 2023 were enrolled in this study, of whom 351 had SARS-CoV-2, 671 had influenza, and 398 had RSV. In addition, 243 healthy children were also collected. The blood test results of SARS-CoV-2 patients were compared to those of patients with influenza A and RSV and the healthy controls. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was employed to evaluate each blood parameter's diagnostic value.

Results

Children with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited notably elevated levels of white blood cell (WBC) count, platelet (PLT) count, neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) compared to influenza A patients (P < 0.05). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 patients exhibited a decrease in the mean platelet volume to platelet count ratio (MPV/PLT) and the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) when compared to other individuals (P < 0.05). These parameters had an AUC between 0.5 and 0.7. Compared to patients with RSV, SARS-CoV-2 patients had significantly higher MPV/PLT and significantly lower WBC, lymphocyte, PLT, LMR, and lymphocyte multiplied by platelet (LYM*PLT) values (P < 0.05). However, only LYM*PLT had an acceptable diagnostic value above 0.7 for all age groups. Compared to healthy children, children with COVID-19 exhibited elevated NLR and MPV/PLT levels, alongside decreased lymphocyte, PLT, LMR, and LYM*PLT values. (P < 0.05). The AUC of the LMR, LYM*PLT, and PLT were above 0.7 in all age groups, indicating promising diagnostic values.

Conclusions

The routine blood parameters among patients with COVID-19, influenza A, and RSV differ significantly early in the disease and could be used by clinicians to discriminate between the 3 types of infection.

### Alterations of routine blood tests in adult patients with soft tissue sarcomas: relationships to cytokine serum levels and prognostic significance [^115qQQqp]. Annals of Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

It has been reported that malignancy is often accompanied by hematological alterations and that such alterations may correlate with poor prognosis. It has also been demonstrated that several cytokines may be synthesized by many malignant tumors and that elevated serum levels of some cytokines are associated with changes in blood cell counts in cancer patients. However, so far little is known about the prognostic significance and mechanism of hematological changes in soft tissue sarcomas. The aim of the study was to evaluate the routine blood tests of disturbances in patients with malignant soft-tissue tumors prior to treatment and to correlate these results with selected cytokine serum levels, clinicopathological features of the tumors and patient survival.

Patients and Methods

145 patients (75 males, 70 females; mean age 49.97 ± 16.9 yrs) with histologically confirmed soft tissue sarcomas before treatment were enrolled into the study. In all these patients we evaluated routine blood tests (hemoglobin level HGB, white blood cell count WBC, platelet count PLT, white blood cell differential count-neutrocyte count NE, lymphocyte count LY, monocyte count MN, eosinophile count EO) and serum levels of 13 cytokines and soluble cytokine receptors (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFalpha, G-CSF, M-CSF, bFGF, VEGF, IL-1ra, sIL-2R. sIL-6R. TNF RI, TNF RII) — ELISA method. Peripheral blood samples from 50 healthy volunteers served as control. Statistical analysis was performed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Mann-Whitney U-tests, chi2 test (P < 0.05), where appropriate. For survival analysis the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test and multivariate Cox analysis were applied.

Results

Alterations of at least one of the standard blood tests were found in 43.4% of all cases. The most frequent alterations were: neutrophilia (28.3% of cases), leukocytosis (27.6%), decreased HGB (25.5%), monocytosis (19.3%) and thrombocytosis (14.5%); they correlated strongly with elevated serum levels of several cytokines and soluble cytokine receptors (particularly: sIL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, M-CSF, VEGF, TNF RI, TNF RII) (P < 0.001). Lymphocytopenia (LY < 1.0) found in 10.3% of patients correlated strongly with increased serum levels of IL-6, sIL-2R, TNF RI. In parallel, we found a significant difference in serum levels of 11 of 13 cytokines (IL-1ra. sIL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF RI, TNF RII, TNFalpha, M-CSF, bFGF, VEGF) (P < 0.001) in soft tissue sarcoma patients compared to healthy controls. Hematological alterations were significantly more frequent in patients with advanced tumors. In multivariate analysis we found no prognostic significance of any of the routine blood tests in soft tissue sarcoma patients.

Conclusion

The results of this study demonstrate that hematological alterations, which occur in over 40% of soft tissue sarcoma cases, are found more frequently in patients with advanced tumors. Strong correlations between the occurrence of hematological abnormalities and elevated serum levels of several cytokines and soluble cytokine receptors, suggest that the former may develop as a result of cytokine misbalance frequently detected in soft tissue sarcoma patients. However, the results of routine blood tests alone are no independent prognostic factor for survival of soft-tissue sarcoma patients.

### Enhanced trained immunity in peripheral monocytes in unstable angina with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [^114HE55g]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Upon admission to the inpatient department or visit to emergency department, patients underwent immediate laboratory tests, including high-sensitivity troponin I (hsTNI). Inflammation level was assessed by hsCRP measurement. Characteristics of the patients were listed in Table 1. The median hsCRP levels were 5.1 mg/L (Q1-Q3: 3.7–6.4 mg/L) among patients with hsCRP ≥ 3 mg/L, and 0.4 mg/L (Q1-Q3: 0.2–0.6 mg/L) among patients with hsCRP < 1 mg/L. There were no significant differences in current smoking, drinking, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), triglycerides, or hsTNI between the 2 groups. However, patients with hsCRP ≥ 3 mg/L exhibited elevated serum fasting glucose levels and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels (Table 1).

Table 1
The Characteristics of the Included Patients

Skewed circulating monocytes subsets in UA patients with hsCRP ≥ 3 mg/L

Previous investigations have emphasized the critical role of trained immunity in monocytes in CAD. After analyzing the blood routine test of each patient, we found a myeloid bias in patients with hsCRP levels ≥ 3 mg/L, as indicated by higher numbers of white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, and monocytes in contrast to those with hsCRP < 1 mg/L (Figure 2A). Lymphocyte, red blood cell, and platelet counts did not differ between groups (Figure 2A, Supplemental Figure 1A). Additionally, patients with hsCRP ≥ 3 mg/L had a higher monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (Supplemental Figure 1B). WBCs, neutrophils, monocytes, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio correlated positively with hsCRP levels (Supplemental Figures 1C to 1G).

Nonspecific screening tests for cellular immune competency — Summary Statement 148 states that simple, cost-effective tests include an absolute lymphocyte count, the absolute number of CD4+ T cells, and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio (B). For abnormality thresholds, an absolute lymphocyte count less than 1,200/mm3 suggests an abnormal immune response. Additional evaluative measures include number of total T cells measured by anti-CD3 surface markers; estimation of CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic populations by immunofluorescence staining with appropriate phenotypic cell markers; measurement of T-cell activation by IL-2 secretion or fluorescent anti-CD25 and/or anti–HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies; determination of CD45 RO+ CD29+ T-cell lymphocytes as an indication of memory cells; and measurement of CD4+, CD25+ Fox P3+ immunoregulatory T cells, and the latter cells may be increased after successful allergen immunotherapy.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^114JDbo8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly globally; as of March 29, 2020, ≈670,000 cases had been confirmed worldwide. COVID-19 is typically a pulmonary infection that can range from mild illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure; however, other symptoms such as myalgias and anorexia have been noted. Although many ongoing studies are investigating measurement of proinflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers as a way to prognosticate infection severity, we investigated use of 2 easily obtained predictors: lymphopenia and leukocytosis.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^113kX2cW]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Lymphocyte function testing — these assays detect the ability of lymphocytes to proliferate, produce inflammatory mediators and cytokines, mount cytotoxic responses, and regulate immune responses; proliferative responses are evaluated using nonspecific mitogens (phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen) or specific soluble and cell bound antigens, with nonspecific activation measuring both T and B cell function, specific antigenic challenge appearing to measure only T-cell function, and autologous or homologous serum identifying serum factors that interfere with or enhance proliferation. Cytokines and growth factors are described as glycoproteins acting via specific receptors, with 4 major families identified — interferons, colony-stimulating factors, TNFs, and ILs — and the IL family now numbering from IL-1 to IL-33; both immune and nonimmune cells produce chemokines and smaller proinflammatory proteins.

Laboratory Tests

Absolute Lymphocyte Counts

There was a dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count observed with ONGLYZA. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2200 cells/microL, mean decreases of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with ONGLYZA 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials. Similar effects were observed when ONGLYZA 5 mg was given in initial combination with metformin HCl compared to metformin HCl alone. There was no difference observed for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg relative to placebo. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count ≤ 750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.4% in the ONGLYZA 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In most patients, recurrence was not observed with repeated exposure to ONGLYZA although some patients had recurrent decreases upon rechallenge that led to discontinuation of ONGLYZA. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage.

In the SAVOR trial mean decreases of approximately 84 cells/microL with ONGLYZA relative to placebo was observed. The proportion of patients who experienced a decrease in lymphocyte counts to a count of ≤ 750 cells/microL was 1.6% (136/8280) and 1.0% (78/8212) on ONGLYZA and placebo, respectively.

The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not known. When clinically indicated, such as in settings of unusual or prolonged infection, lymphocyte count should be measured. The effect of ONGLYZA on lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocyte abnormalities (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is unknown.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ONGLYZA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis
Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions

### Immune profiles and DNA methylation alterations related with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer outcomes [^115FHhmM]. Clinical Epigenetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2021, the estimated number of bladder cancer deaths is projected to be 17,200, with an estimated number of new cases of 83,730 in the United States. Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer among men and twelfth most common among women, which may in part be due to smoking prevalence rates being higher in men than women as cigarette smoking accounts for half of all cases (47%) in the United States. Seventy-five percent of bladder cancers are diagnosed as low-grade non-muscle invasive tumors, NMIBC. Cystoscopy is used for diagnosis (biopsy) with transurethral excision of localized tumors as the primary treatment. Although transurethral excisions can successfully control the disease and mortality from bladder cancer among patients with localized tumors is low, 45% of NMIBC cases have recurrences within 12 months of surgery. In addition, frequent invasive follow-up via cystoscopy without prognostic markers leads to significant patient morbidity and comes with a considerable cost burden to the health care system, estimated at approximately $4 billion dollars annually in the United States. To control the patient and healthcare burdens associated with NMIBC, there is an imminent need for biomarkers to identify those at the highest risk of tumor recurrence.

Peripheral blood immune profiles have been associated with different outcomes in bladder cancer patients and may have clinical utility for NMIBC prognosis. For instance, in NMIBC, patients with elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) had poorer cancer-specific survival than patients with lower NLR. Thus, elevated NLR could be a potential predictor of overall survival and cancer-specific survival for this disease. Other studies have indicated that bladder cancer patients with increased lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio had poorer overall survival and cancer-specific survival. In addition, Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), a commonly used intravesical immunotherapy for NMIBC administered post-surgery, has been reported to reduce the proportion of natural killer T cells, memory CD4T, CD8T, and regulatory T cells in the peripheral blood of NMIBC patients. Together, circulating immune profiles might be promising markers for reducing adverse outcomes in NMIBC patients. Previous studies have relied on complete blood count differential (CBC) tests to determine immune profile variables. The CBC test relies on fresh blood samples and is incapable of providing proportions of specific lymphocyte subtypes.

### Complete blood count score model integrating reduced lymphocyte-monocyte ratio, elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and elevated platelet-lymphocyte ratio predicts inferior clinical outcomes in adult T-Lymphoblastic lymphoma [^111sFjHt]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) is a highly aggressive neoplasm of lymphoblasts of T-cell origin. Although promising improvements have been recently achieved, one third of patients experience relapse or refractory T-LBL. Therefore, optimal strategies for identifying high-risk patients are urgently needed.

Materials and Methods

In the present study, 75 newly diagnosed adult patients (aged ≥ 15 years) with T-LBL were identified and the predictive value of complete blood count (CBC) abnormalities, including lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) on clinical outcomes, was analyzed.

Results

Using the receiver operating characteristic curve to determine the best cutoff values based on survival, it was found that patients with T-LBL with LMR ≤ 2.8, NLR ≥ 3.3, and PLR ≥ 200 had both inferior progression-free survival (PFS) and inferior overall survival (OS), in which the differences were much more remarkable in the international prognostic index score 0–2 subgroup. In the multivariable analysis, NLR ≥ 3.3 together with age > 40 years and central nervous system (CNS) involvement were identified to be independently associated with shortened PFS, whereas PLR ≥ 200 and CNS involvement were identified to be independent risk factors for OS. LMR, NLR, and PLR were integrated to generate a "CBC score" model, which well separated adult patients with T-LBL into three risk groups, and the 3-year OS was 84%, 53%, and 30% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, respectively.

Conclusion

Overall, a "CBC score" model was initially promoted for stratification in adult patients with T-LBL using simple, widely available, and easy to interpret parameters in the largest adult T-LBL cohort to date.

Implications For Practice

Optimal strategies for identifying high-risk patients with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) are urgently needed. In the largest adult T-LBL cohort to date, simple, inexpensive, widely available parameters were applied and revealed that patients with lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) ≤ 2.8, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ≥ 3.3, and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) ≥ 200 had both inferior progression-free survival and inferior overall survival (OS), in which the differences were much more remarkable in the international prognostic index score 0–2 subgroup. LMR, NLR, and PLR were integrated to generate a "complete blood count score" model, in which the 3-year OS was 84%, 53%, and 30% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, respectively.

### Saxagliptin and metformin [^1168pdKM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Tests

Absolute Lymphocyte Counts

Saxagliptin

There was a dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count observed with saxagliptin. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2200 cells/microL, mean decreases of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with saxagliptin 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials. Similar effects were observed when saxagliptin 5 mg and metformin HCl were coadministered in treatment-naive patients compared to placebo and metformin HCl. There was no difference observed for saxagliptin 2.5 mg relative to placebo. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count ≤ 750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.4% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In most patients, recurrence was not observed with repeated exposure to saxagliptin although some patients had recurrent decreases upon rechallenge that led to discontinuation of saxagliptin. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage.

In the SAVOR trial mean decreases of approximately 84 cells/microL with saxagliptin relative to placebo was observed. The proportion of patients who experienced a decrease in lymphocyte counts to a count of ≤ 750 cells/microL was 1.6% (136/8280) and 1.0% (78/8212) on saxagliptin and placebo, respectively.

The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not known. When clinically indicated, such as in settings of unusual or prolonged infection, lymphocyte count should be measured. The effect of saxagliptin on lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocyte abnormalities (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is unknown.

Vitamin B Concentrations

Exhaled nitric oxide has been used as a means of indirectly measuring the underlying inflammation in asthma. The objectives of the study were to measure exhaled nitric oxide levels in asthma patients and healthy volunteers, to study peripheral blood lymphocyte cytokine expression, and to study the relationship between exhaled nitric oxide and intracellular cytokine expression. Exhaled nitric oxide was elevated in patients with moderate to severe asthma and with treatment decreased in the first week reaching to a near normal level by 4 weeks. Elevated exhaled nitric oxide was associated with decreased IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine expression by CD8 lymphocytes.

### Type I interferon receptor blockade with anifrolumab corrects innate and adaptive immune perturbations of SLE [^113iPF9H]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Absolute change in blood lymphocyte and neutrophil counts over time for all patients and those classified by IFNGS test status are shown in online supplementary figure S1. IFNGS test-high patients demonstrated lower counts of lymphocytes and neutrophils at baseline compared with IFNGS test-low patients. Following treatment with anifrolumab, these cells types increased only in IFN test-high patients across most time points in the study (online supplementary figure S1).

The MUSE study permitted OCS tapering following randomisation at the discretion of the investigators.OCS treatment can cause alterations in the numbers of some circulating immune cells, including lymphocytes and neutrophils, and it was therefore important to establish that the observed reversal of lymphopenia and neutropenia was not a consequence of OCS tapering. To this end, we examined changes in lymphocytes and neutrophils over time in placebo-treated patients. In figure 3E, F change in cell numbers over time for placebo-treated patients who tapered steroids, did not taper steroids or who were ineligible to taper (due to low steroid dose at baseline) is shown. No significant increases were observed.

Effect of anifrolumab treatment on SLE-associated serum proteins

Compared with placebo, anifrolumab treatment significantly suppressed the expression of 11 out of the 27 proteins elevated at baseline in patients with SLEDAI-2K scores ≥ 10 (figures 1 and 4). Multiple immune pathways are associated with these proteins, including T-cell-targeting chemokines IP10 and ITAC, B-cell-targeting chemokine CXCL13/BLC, B-cell activator TNFSF13B/BAFF, B-/T-cell activator CCL19/MIP-3β, endothelial cell markers (VCAM1 and ANGPT2), the MHC Class I protein B2M, the soluble cofactor for TLR9 signalling, progranulin and other lymphocyte-associated chemokines (MCP1 and MCP2). Three of those proteins were also positively associated with CLASI activity score at baseline, namely ITAC, CXCL13 and VCAM1. In addition, IgE and FCN3 were significantly higher at baseline in patients with CLASI ≥ 10, and they were suppressed by anifrolumab treatment. In total, anifrolumab treatment significantly suppressed the expression of five out of the seven serum proteins that were elevated at baseline in patients with CLASI ≥ 10 (figures 1 and 4).

### Delta neutrophil index as an early predictor of acute appendicitis and acute complicated appendicitis in adults [^1112uLUe]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring urgent surgical intervention in an emergency department (ED). Increasing time periods between symptom onset and surgical treatment is a risk factor for a ruptured appendix. Successful treatment depends on early diagnosis and prompt intervention.

Several blood tests are used to aid diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Approximately 80% of patients are known to have leukocytosis in acute appendicitis. However, an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count has a low predictive value because the WBC is also elevated in up to 70% of patients with other causes of right lower abdominal quadrant pain. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are common in acute appendicitis, but studies disagree on its sensitivity and specificity. A more recently suggested laboratory evaluation is the determination of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios. However, their sensitivity and specificity is not more sensitive or specific than that of the WBC or CRP.

Immature granulocytes are an indicator of increased myeloid cell production and are known to increase in infectious or inflammation conditions. The delta neutrophil index (DNI) measures the fraction of immature granulocytes in the circulation and has recently been introduced as a new inflammatory marker. The DNI is assessed by an automated blood cell analyzer, and tests required for the DNI can be performed simultaneously with the routine complete blood count (CBC) testing. Recent studies have examined its ability to predict infectious conditions. In this study, we investigated the usefulness of the DNI as an early predictor of acute appendicitis and acute complicated appendicitis in adults.

### Acute effects of exercise on the inflammatory state in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension [^114vr6c3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Exercise caused a general increase in leukocytes and lymphocytes

Overall, exercise provoked a significant, transient elevation of absolute numbers of leukocytes, lymphocytes in patients with IPAH as well as in healthy subjects (all p < 0.001; one-way rANOVA; Fig. 2a-b). Given that no difference occurred between patients and healthy subjects, two-way rANOVA revealed the number of leukocytes and lymphocytes significantly depended on relation to exercise (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005), but not on IPAH (p = 0.63 and p = 0.28). The general increase of lymphocytes in patients with IPAH and healthy was also found for T lymphocytes (both p < 0.01; one-way rANOVA), and by a non-significant trend for B lymphocytes, T helper lymphocytes and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Fig. 3a-b and e-f). Interestingly, exercise led to a relative reduction of B lymphocytes in healthy subjects but not in patients with IPAH (Fig. 3b-d). However, exercise did not influence the level of TCR-γδ lymphocytes, nor natural killer cells or natural killer T lymphocytes (data not shown).

### Association of lymphopenia with risk of mortality among adults in the US general population [^114Saihn]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

This study sought to (1) determine the associations among lymphocyte levels, other IH parameters (RDW and CRP level), and survival and (2) establish the extent to which the associated risk of these variables is additive. In this large cohort of adults, we found that lymphopenia was associated with mortality risk independently of traditional clinical risk factors and other IH variables (RDW and CRP level). Individuals with multiple IH abnormalities had a strikingly high risk of mortality among this generally low-risk population. The risk associated with this IH pattern is independent of (and thus additive to) traditional clinical risk factors. Together, these data suggest that IH risk may be viewed as a multidimensional entity and can be estimated using markers commonly available as part of routine clinical care.

### Guidelines for blood test monitoring of methotrexate toxicity in juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^111v8Jp8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the utility of the American College of Rheumatology guidelines for monitoring methotrexate (MTX)-related toxicity in a cohort of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Methods

Eighty-nine patients with JIA treated with MTX were monitored prospectively: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), complete blood count (CBC), and differential blood count were measured prior to starting MTX, and then monthly. Significantly abnormal blood tests (SABT) were prospectively defined as (1) significantly elevated liver enzymes (SELE) greater than twice the upper limit of normal; (2) granulocyte count < 1.5 109/l; (3) lymphocyte count < 0.9 109/l; or (4) hemoglobin decreased by > 2 g/l from previous level. Clinical interventions, current and cumulative MTX dose, duration of treatment, comorbidity, and concurrent medications at the time of the first SABT identification were recorded. Independent t tests and chi-squared tests were used for comparisons, and the probability of developing a SABT was calculated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

Results

Forty percent of patients had a SABT: 26% had hematological abnormalities and 14% had SELE. Ninety-five percent of patients with SABT had symptoms consistent with a viral infection when the SABT was drawn and MTX dose was withheld until results had normalized on repeat testing. SABT persisting beyond one month occurred in only 2 patients, and their abnormalities resolved by 6 months with no specific identified cause; they resumed MTX at a later time without recurrence of SABT. There were no differences between patients with and without SABT with respect to current or cumulative MTX dose, duration of treatment, and concurrent medications at the time of the SABT. The probability of developing a SABT was estimated to be 11% at 3 months, compared to 10% probability of having an abnormal blood test by chance alone.

Conclusion

Routine blood tests every 4 to 8 weeks in children with JIA are unnecessarily frequent.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^112Dm9gC]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

We identified 959 articles; among them, 318 were duplicates. We then screened the remaining 641 by title, abstract, or both. We assessed 59 articles as eligible (included patient-level clinical data) and identified 8 studies (included lymphocyte counts and stratification of illness severity) for the quantitative synthesis (Appendix Table). These studies described 1,289 cases of COVID-19, of which 592 (45.9%) were classified as severe.

We compared lymphocyte and leukocyte counts in patients with severe/critical versus mild cases of COIVD-19 (Appendix Figure). All laboratory data were captured at the time of patient admission. Overall, patients categorized as having severe illness tended to have lower lymphocyte counts (pooled MD −0.36, 95% CI −0.50 to −0.22; p < 0.00001) and higher leukocyte counts (pooled MD 1.32, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.02; p < 0.00001). Fan et al. reported an absolute lymphocyte count of > 1.0 × 10 9 cells/L for 39/58 (69.6%) patients in the nonsevere group and 2/9 (22.2%) patients in the severe group. Huang et al. reported an absolute lymphocyte count of < 1 × 10 9 cells/L in 15/28 (54%) patients in the nonsevere group and 11/13 (83%) in the severe group. Wan et al. reported an absolute lymphocyte count of < 1.0 × 10 9 cells/L for 36/95 (38%) patients in the nonsevere group and 32/40 (80%) in the severe group. Zhang et al. reported a decreased lymphocyte count for 28/82 (70.7%) patients in the nonsevere group and 46/56 (82.1%) in the severe group.

### An unusual case of reactive lymphocytosis mimicking acute leukemia [^1179NR9N]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute leukemia is based on a combination of clinical, hematological, morphological, cytogenetic, and immunophenotypic data. The authors report a case of reactive lymphocytosis with extremely elevated lymphocytic and lymphoblastic leukocytosis that mimicked acute lymphoblastic leukemia, not only morphologically, but also in immunophenotypic analysis. They could not determine any underlying disease marker other than infectious symptoms that were present for 20 days prior to presentation to their clinic. Although this case presented with extremely high lymphocytic leukocytosis, the patient had normal blood cell lineage, a moderate level of blastic cells in bone marrow, and normal physical findings. These findings convinced the authors to follow up the patient before beginning treatment.

### Lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy: benign or malignant? [^114JtQ6Z]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

The increasing use of immunophenotypic and molecular analysis in the routine evaluation of patients with lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, or other hematologic disorders has led to the identification of unexpected small clonal lymphoid populations. These clones, sometimes with disease-specific markers, such as the t(14;18), are especially challenging for the clinician because of their unknown biologic potential and uncertain clinical behavior. Study of these early lymphoid lesions is providing important clues to the process of lymphomagenesis, and may provide the rationale for preemptive therapy in the future. More and more, the hematologist/oncologist is consulted regarding otherwise healthy individuals with lymphadenopathy and/or lymphocytosis, and pathology reports that confound the referring internist or surgeon. The report does not name a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder, but is not completely "normal". Does the patient have a benign or malignant condition? How should they be evaluated? Is treatment indicated? These patients prove challenging for the consulting hematologist as well as the referring physician. In this review, we will focus on some of these scenarios and attempt to provide guidance for their management.

### Peripheral blood T-lymphocyte subsets are potential biomarkers of disease severity and clinical outcomes in patients with ulcerative colitis: a retrospective study [^116593Ng]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is considered an immune-mediated disease. The disorder of T-lymphocyte subsets plays an important role in the pathogenesis of UC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of peripheral blood T-lymphocyte subsets in assessing disease severity and predicting clinical outcomes in UC patients.

Methods

The retrospective case-control study was performed in 116 UC patients with active disease and 90 healthy controls (HC). The UC patients included were followed up for 180 days. Analyses of t-test, Spearman's correlation coefficient, multivariable Cox regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and cumulative survival analysis were done.

Results

The UC patients had lower proportions of CD4 + T cells (42.85% ± 9.77% vs 45.71% ± 7.94%, P = 0.021) and higher proportion of CD8 + T cells (27.88% ± 8.86% vs 25.00% ± 6.47%, P = 0.008) than HC. The severely active UC patients had higher proportion of CD3 + HLA-DR + T cells (8.83% ± 6.55% vs 2.80% ± 1.55%, P < 0.001; 8.83% ± 6.55% vs 4.06% ± 5.01%, P < 0.001) and CD8 + T cells (31.35% ± 8.49% vs 26.98% ± 7.98%, P = 0.029; 31.35% ± 8.49% vs 25.46% ± 9.15%, P = 0.003) than mild and moderate group, whereas lower proportion of CD4 + CD25 + T cells (2.86% ± 1.35% vs 3.46% ± 1.07%, P = 0.034) than mild group and CD4 + T cells (40.40% ± 9.36% vs 44.73% ± 10.39%, P = 0.049) than moderate group. The area under the curve (AUC) of CD3 + HLA-DR + T cells for assessing severely active UC was 0.885, with the cut-off value of 5.33%. The sensitivity was 76.32% and specificity was 89.74%. The combination of CD3 + HLA-DR + T cells and CRP had stronger assessment value with AUC of 0.929. The AUC of CD8 + T cells, CD4 + /CD8 + ratio and CD4 + CD25 + T cells for assessing disease severity was 0.677, 0.669 and 0.631 respectively. Within the 180 days follow-up, 24 patients (20.69%) had UC-related readmission or surgery, with higher proportion of CD3 + HLA-DR + T cells (10.66% ± 9.52% vs 3.88% ± 2.56%, P = 0.003) and CD8 + T cells (31.19% ± 10.59% vs 27.01% ± 8.20%, P = 0.039) than those without readmission and surgery. The proportion of CD3 + HLA-DR + T cells was the independent predictor of UC-related readmission or surgery (HR = 1.109, P = 0.002). The AUC of CD3 + HLA-DR + T cells for predicting readmission or surgery was 0.796 with the cut-off value of 5.38%. UC patients with CD3 + HLA-DR + T cells proportion > 5.38% had a shorter time to readmission or surgery (log-rank test, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The combination of CD3 + HLA-DR + T cells and CRP may be potential biomarker of disease severity in UC patients. The high proportion of CD3 + HLA-DR + T cells may be associated with an increased risk of readmission or surgery in UC patients.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^114nY7th]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Monocyte count increase

Four studies (126 cases/332 non‐cases) reported on monocyte increase (Figure 5). The cut‐off values for an increase in monocyte count varied from 0.00 cells/L to 0.8 cells/L. The median prevalence of COVID‐19 in the two single‐gate studies was 73%. Sensitivity ranged from 10% to 14%; Specificity ranged from 56% to 89%. Meta‐analysis yielded a sensitivity of 14% (95% CI 6% to 30%), 13% (95% CI 6% to 26%) and 12% (95% CI 7% to 20%) at fixed specificity of 67% (Q1), 73% (median) and 80% (Q3), respectively.

Lymphocyte count decrease

Thirteen studies (2752 cases/1066 non‐cases) reported on decrease in lymphocyte count (Figure 6). The cut‐off values for a decrease in lymphocyte count ranged from 8.0 × 10^9 cells/L to 1.1 × 10^9 cells/L. The median prevalence of COVID‐19 in the 11 single‐gate studies was 37% (27% to 65%), with sensitivity ranging from 0% to 81%, with one outlier of 0% (based on two COVID‐19 cases and specificity from 33% to 89%. Meta‐analysis yielded a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 81% to 100%), 64% (95% CI 28% to 89%) and 0% (95% CI 0% to 24%) at fixed specificity of 43% (Q1), 53% (median) and 71% (Q3), respectively.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^111TPB5H]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) detection assays and hepatic enzymes — clinical utility: Detection of EBV can be done from cultures of circulating lymphocytes or molecular amplification of EBV DNA in circulating lymphocytes, but these tests are not generally needed for diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis and are not available to most practitioners. Viral load monitoring by polymerase chain reaction has been used primarily to identify transplant recipients at high risk for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease but can be used to confirm acute IM. Hepatic transaminase levels are commonly elevated in IM, although usually only mildly, occurring in approximately 50% of cases, and the importance of these transient elevations in determining return to play remains unclear.

American Thoracic Society guideline — lymphocyte subset analysis: In patients with suspected interstitial lung disease (ILD) in whom BAL is performed, the guideline states "we suggest that lymphocyte subset analysis NOT be a routine component of BAL cellular analysis", further clarifying that lymphocyte subset analysis "should not be performed routinely, but rather could be performed if a lymphocytic disease is suspected or the initial BAL cellular findings identify a lymphocytosis", and noting it "is rarely helpful and potentially misleading in the absence of a clinically suspected lymphocytic disease or a lymphocytosis".

### Analysis of absolute lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19 [^116QEMG2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Symptoms of COVID-19 vary in severity and presentation. When admitting patients to the hospital, it is desirable to isolate patients with COVID-19 from those without the disease. However, reliably identifying patients with COVID-19 in the emergency department before hospital admission is often limited by the speed and availability of testing. Previous studies determined a low lymphocyte count is commonly found in patients with COVID-19. We sought to explore the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients presenting to the emergency department requiring subsequent hospitalization who were found to have COVID-19.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on 312 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency department. The absolute lymphocyte count for these patients was used to calculate sensitivities at various cut-off values. The relationships between absolute lymphocyte count and variables, including age, sex, need for intubation, and mortality, were also explored.

Results

Cut-off values for absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 1.1 K/uL to 2.0 K/uL, with sensitivities of 72% and 94%, respectively. Additionally, lower mean absolute lymphocyte counts were identified in males, patients who required intubation, and patients who died.

Conclusion

Knowing the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19 may help identify patients who are unlikely to have the disease. Additionally, absolute lymphocyte count can be used as a marker of disease severity in patients with COVID-19.

### Blood and bone marrow evaluation for eosinophilia [^114TJWY4]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Evaluation of peripheral blood and bone marrow for an indication of persistent eosinophilia can be a challenging task because there are many causes of eosinophilia and the morphologic differences between reactive and neoplastic causes are often subtle or lack specificity. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the differential diagnosis for eosinophilia, to recommend specific steps for the pathologist evaluating blood and bone marrow, and to emphasize 2 important causes of eosinophilia that require specific ancillary tests for diagnosis: myeloproliferative neoplasm with PDGFRA rearrangement and lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilic syndrome.

### Infectious lymphocytosis… [^115fUqpM]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Lymphocytic reactions in childhood afford difficulties in interpretation because a predominance of lymphocytes and a greater lability of the blood-forming mechanism constitute normal features of this period. A marked increase in lymphocytes is a well known accompaniment of certain infections, such as pertussis, and of postinfectious states, while leukopenia with a relative increase in lymphocytes characterizes the blood reaction in typhoid fever and influenza. A lymphocytic increase may occur, however, in infants and children when a specific etiologic agent or a well defined clinical condition cannot be demonstrated. Two types of conditions are encountered in young patients which are characterized by lymphocytosis and which are frequently confused with infectious mononucleosis, or even with leukemia. In one, transient, unexpected hyperleukocytosis with an absolute and a relative increase in lymphocytes occurs and is unassociated with recognizable symptoms or physical signs.

The second type, which is more frequently encountered, follows infections of the. SMITH CH. INFECTIOUS LYMPHOCYTOSIS. Am J Dis Child. 1941; 62: 231–261.
