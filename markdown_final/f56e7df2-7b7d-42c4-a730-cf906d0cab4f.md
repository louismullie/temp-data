## Question

estradiol only supplementation versus bi-est

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to compare estradiol-only supplementation versus Bi-Est. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what each preparation actually is, including composition, potency, and regulatory status. Then, I should verify how uterine status determines whether unopposed estrogen is acceptable. Next, I will review the quality and consistency of the evidence base for FDA-approved estradiol versus compounded Bi-Est, including safety signals from WHI and meta-analyses. After that, I need to compare risk profiles across endometrium, breast, thromboembolism, and cardiovascular outcomes, while double-checking areas with conflicting data. Finally, I will align conclusions with major guidelines and synthesize a practical clinical algorithm and counseling points, before issuing a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and pharmacology. Estradiol-only therapy uses 17β-estradiol, the principal intracellular estrogen with substantially higher receptor potency than estrone or estriol, and is available in multiple FDA-approved formulations (oral, transdermal patch, gel) with standardized dosing and manufacturing controls, whereas Bi-Est is a compounded blend, typically 80% estriol and 20% estradiol, marketed as "bioidentical" but not FDA-approved and reliant on pharmacy-level compounding variability [^111zJXXs] [^115kuLDK] [^113vr1dj].

> Hold on, I should verify a critical clinical determinant before discussing risks: uterine status governs whether unopposed estrogen is allowed. In women without a uterus, estradiol-only systemic therapy is appropriate and guideline-concordant for vasomotor symptoms, with WHI estrogen-alone data not showing increased invasive breast cancer during the intervention phase and long-term follow-up suggesting no excess all-cause mortality, supporting safety when appropriately selected and timed [^113vZrLa] [^1148X84h] [^111dq4zs]. In contrast, in women with an intact uterus, systemic estrogen must not be given without adequate endometrial protection, as unopposed estrogen substantially increases endometrial hyperplasia and cancer risk; major guidelines explicitly advise against estrogen-only HT in this setting, necessitating addition of a progestogen or a SERM partner for endometrial safety [^113JwhQc] [^114FhMrT].

> Next, I will examine whether Bi-Est changes this endometrial equation. Wait, let me verify an often-claimed misconception: because Bi-Est is mostly estriol, some infer lower endometrial risk. But estriol is a weak agonist requiring higher exposures, and Bi-Est still contains pharmacologically active estradiol; thus, the endometrium remains at risk if a uterus is present and no proven protective progestogen regimen is used, especially given the lack of adequate RCTs demonstrating endometrial protection with many nonoral progesterone regimens commonly paired with compounded estrogens [^113vr1dj] [^111pVQBk]. I should double-check: small studies of vaginal progesterone exist, but high-quality randomized data sufficient to endorse nonoral routes for endometrial protection in this context are lacking; therefore the earlier caution stands [^113vr1dj].

> I will now review the strength and consistency of the evidence base and oversight. FDA-approved estradiol therapies are supported by large randomized trials and long-term follow-up (e.g. WHI) with well-characterized risks and benefits and assured product quality, whereas Bi-Est lacks robust RCT data for efficacy or safety and is subject to dose variability and inconsistent absorption inherent to compounding, including documented inter-pharmacy deviations from labeled estradiol content in capsules and creams [^111Um91k] [^111dq4zs] [^1118NzTV] [^1121KrKa]. But wait, what if transdermal compounded routes mitigate risk? Comparative work suggests estrogen exposure from compounded transdermal creams is unpredictable relative to FDA-approved gels and patches, reinforcing the oversight and dosing uncertainty concerns with compounded products [^116zSM51].

> Let me consider breast risk carefully, because this is a common point of confusion. WHI estrogen-alone (in hysterectomized women) did not show an increased invasive breast cancer risk during the intervention and suggested a lower incidence versus placebo in extended analyses, while WHI combined estrogen-progestin increased breast cancer risk; yet, large epidemiologic meta-analyses indicate that with longer durations, even estrogen-alone can be associated with small absolute increases, although consistently less than with estrogen-progestin, so duration and regimen matter and the data are not identical across methodologies [^1148X84h] [^115ff5dP] [^1172ubhQ] [^114ykGim]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: these findings are not contradictory so much as context-dependent — randomized versus observational designs, timing of initiation, and duration drive risk estimates; the prudent approach remains lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with individualized reassessment [^1119rAyw].

> I need to check thromboembolic and cardiovascular considerations. Oral estrogens increase VTE risk, and early CHD risk is unfavorable with combined therapy, whereas timing data suggest neutral or possibly favorable CHD signals with estrogen-alone initiated near menopause; transdermal estradiol mitigates first-pass hepatic effects and is often preferred when VTE risk is a concern, although precise comparative risk quantification remains nuanced and patient-specific [^1119rAyw] [^1165rehT]. Hmm, wait a minute, could compounded transdermals offer the same advantage? Given exposure variability and lack of approval standards, that assumption is unsafe; FDA-approved transdermals are the evidence-based route when transdermal delivery is desired [^116zSM51].

> Next, I should review guideline positions on compounded "bioidentical" hormones. Major societies advise against routine use of compounded menopausal hormone therapy when FDA-approved options exist, emphasizing unsubstantiated claims, lack of efficacy and safety evidence, and risks of variable potency and purity; counseling should clarify that FDA-approved estradiol is already bioidentical, rendering compounded "Bi-Est" unnecessary for most patients [^114M88ap] [^113RKhcj] [^114zRpJy]. Let me reconsider exceptions: true compounding indications include documented excipient allergy or dose/formulation needs not available commercially, but Bi-Est itself does not meet such necessity when multiple FDA-approved estradiol products and estradiol-progesterone combinations exist [^114M88ap] [^116zSM51].

> I will now translate this into a practical clinical pathway. For women without a uterus, evidence-based care is systemic estradiol with an FDA-approved formulation, often transdermal to minimize VTE risk considerations, using the lowest effective dose with periodic reassessment; there is no therapeutic advantage to Bi-Est, and its lack of quality control is a liability rather than a feature [^1165rehT] [^1119rAyw]. For women with an intact uterus, I should confirm that unopposed estradiol (including within Bi-Est) is contraindicated; endometrial protection requires either an adequate progestogen (e.g., micronized progesterone) as in the FDA-approved E2/P4 combination capsule or a SERM pair such as conjugated estrogens plus bazedoxifene, each supported by clinical evaluations of endometrial safety and symptom control, unlike compounded blends lacking rigorous data [^114FhMrT] [^112oDMni] [^111L5a7g].

> But wait, what if a patient insists that "natural" Bi-Est is safer because of estriol? I should explain that "bioidentical" is a chemical descriptor shared by FDA-approved estradiol and micronized progesterone; safety claims for estriol-heavy blends are unproven, and any symptomatic benefit is likely driven by the estradiol fraction, while high estriol doses add uncertainty and do not eliminate endometrial risk in a woman with a uterus [^113PzFa1] [^111pVQBk]. I need to ensure we correct misinformation by emphasizing that compounded products bypass FDA safeguards and can show significant potency variability, which undermines therapeutic predictability and safety monitoring [^1121KrKa] [^1118NzTV].

> Final recommendation: Estradiol-only therapy using an FDA-approved product is the appropriate, evidence-based choice for vasomotor symptoms in women without a uterus; in women with a uterus, estradiol must be paired with proven endometrial protection via an FDA-approved progestogen-containing regimen or a tissue-selective estrogen complex, not with Bi-Est alone, given the lack of RCT evidence, dosing variability, and absence of regulatory oversight; major guidelines discourage routine use of compounded hormones when approved alternatives exist [^113JwhQc] [^114FhMrT] [^114M88ap] [^112oDMni]. If a patient requests a "bioidentical" approach, I should steer toward FDA-approved bioidentical estradiol and micronized progesterone combinations rather than compounded Bi-Est to prioritize safety, efficacy, and quality control, while reassessing risks and benefits over time using the lowest effective dose and appropriate surveillance [^113RKhcj] [^111dq4zs] [^1165rehT].

Estradiol-only therapy is appropriate for women without a uterus and the most effective option for **vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms** [^112WKKiD] [^1165rehT], with a **lower breast cancer risk** than combined therapy [^1148X84h] [^113gYZXi] [^113vZrLa]. Bi-Est (estradiol plus estriol) **is not FDA-approved** [^114M88ap], lacks robust evidence of added benefit [^113vr1dj], and may increase endometrial cancer risk if used without adequate progestogen in women with a uterus [^113JwhQc] [^114zRpJy]. In women with a uterus, estradiol must be paired with a progestogen [^113JwhQc] to prevent endometrial hyperplasia; estriol does not provide sufficient protection [^111pVQBk]. Estradiol-only therapy is preferred for symptom control and safety, while **Bi-Est should be avoided** due to insufficient evidence and regulatory concerns [^114M88ap].

---

## Pharmacological differences

### Estradiol-only therapy

- **Potency and receptor affinity**: Estradiol is the most potent endogenous estrogen [^115kuLDK], with high affinity for estrogen receptors, providing effective symptom relief [^111zJXXs].

- **Metabolism**: Estradiol is metabolized to estrone and estriol [^115kuLDK], but these metabolites have significantly lower estrogenic activity [^111zJXXs].

- **Clinical use**: Estradiol-only therapy is indicated for women without a uterus, as it does not require progestogen for endometrial protection [^113JwhQc].

---

### Bi-Est therapy

Composition typically includes **80% estriol and 20% estradiol**; estriol is a weaker estrogen with lower receptor affinity and rapid metabolism, resulting in limited bioavailability [^111pVQBk]. The **clinical rationale** cited by proponents [^114zRpJy] is that estriol provides additional benefits, such as reduced breast cancer risk and an improved safety profile; however, these claims lack robust scientific evidence [^114M88ap].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### Symptom relief

Estradiol-only therapy effectively alleviates **vasomotor symptoms** [^112WKKiD] and **vaginal atrophy** and helps prevent **osteoporosis** in postmenopausal women [^1165rehT]. In contrast, **Bi-Est therapy** has limited evidence of benefit [^114M88ap]; any symptom relief is primarily attributable to the estradiol component, as estriol's contribution is minimal due to its weak estrogenic activity [^111pVQBk].

---

### Endometrial protection

In women with a uterus, **estradiol-only therapy** requires a progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer [^113JwhQc] [^114M88ap]. Similarly, **Bi-Est therapy** requires a progestogen because estriol does not provide adequate endometrial protection [^113JwhQc] [^111pVQBk].

---

## Safety profiles

| **Attribute** | **Estradiol-only therapy** | **Bi-est therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Breast cancer risk | The WHI estrogen-alone trial demonstrated no significant increase in breast cancer risk with estrogen-alone therapy [^1148X84h] [^113vZrLa] | There is no robust evidence to suggest that Bi-Est therapy reduces breast cancer risk compared to estradiol-only therapy. The addition of estriol does not confer any proven protective effect [^114zRpJy] [^114M88ap] |
| Cardiovascular risk | Estradiol-only therapy has been associated with a neutral or slightly favorable cardiovascular risk profile, particularly when initiated in younger postmenopausal women [^1119rAyw] [^111dq4zs] | There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of Bi-Est therapy. The addition of estriol does not have established cardiovascular benefits [^114M88ap] |
| Endometrial cancer risk | Requires progestogen addition in women with a uterus to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer [^113JwhQc] | Similarly, Bi-Est therapy requires progestogen addition, as estriol does not provide adequate endometrial protection [^113JwhQc] [^111pVQBk] |

---

## Regulatory status and clinical guidelines

Estradiol-only therapy is **FDA-approved and recommended** for menopausal symptom management [^1165rehT], whereas **Bi-Est therapy** is **not FDA-approved** and is not routinely recommended due to insufficient evidence regarding its safety and efficacy [^114M88ap] [^114zRpJy].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Women without a uterus**: Estradiol-only therapy is appropriate and effective [^112WKKiD].

- **Women with a uterus**: Both estradiol-only and Bi-Est therapies require progestogen addition for endometrial protection [^113JwhQc].

- **Patient preferences**: Some patients may prefer Bi-Est therapy due to perceived naturalness or safety. However, clinicians should educate patients about the lack of evidence supporting these claims [^114M88ap] [^114zRpJy].

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Parameter** | **Estradiol-only therapy** | **Bi-est therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Composition | Estradiol only | Estradiol + Estriol |
| FDA approval | Yes [^1165rehT] | No [^114M88ap] |
| Clinical efficacy | Proven effective [^112WKKiD] | Limited evidence [^114M88ap] |
| Breast cancer risk | No significant increase [^1148X84h] | Insufficient evidence [^114M88ap] |
| Cardiovascular risk | Neutral or favorable [^1119rAyw] | Insufficient evidence [^113RKhcj] |
| Endometrial protection | Requires progestogen [^113JwhQc] | Requires progestogen [^113JwhQc] |
| Regulatory status | Approved [^1165rehT] | Not approved [^114M88ap] |
| Clinical guidelines | Recommended [^112WKKiD] | Not recommended [^114M88ap] |

---

Estradiol-only therapy is **FDA-approved and effective** [^1165rehT] [^112WKKiD] for menopausal symptom management, whereas Bi-Est therapy **lacks robust evidence** and regulatory approval [^114M88ap]. In women with a uterus, both require a progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer [^113JwhQc].

### Estrace [^113vZrLa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative risk [RR] 0.80).

Consistent with the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, but still increased risk, for estrogen-alone therapy after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon the duration of use and could last up to more than 10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to the risk with estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

### Update on medical and regulatory issues pertaining to compounded and FDA-approved drugs, including hormone therapy [^113vr1dj]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Various compounded bioidentical hormone therapy (CBHT) formulations containing estrogens, progesterone, or testosterone are marketed to women with menopausal symptoms in both nonsterile (e.g. lotions, creams, capsules, lozenges, transdermal patches, nasal or oral products, and suppositories) and sterile (e.g. injections and subdermal pellets) preparations. Some CBHT medications fall into product categories that the FDA considers "not appropriate for compounding under any circumstances", including extended-release, transdermal, and liposomal drugs.

The FDA has never approved testosterone for postmenopausal women, and its use in CBHT regimens is controversial. Estriol is found in many CBHT products, including Bi-Est (20% estradiol and 80% estriol) and Tri-Est (10% estradiol, 10% estrone, and 80% estriol). Although an estriol vaginal suppository is approved to treat vaginal atrophy in some countries, estriol is not in any FDA-approved drug for human use, and the FDA has warned compounders not to use estriol without filing a New Drug Application (NDA). However, a United States Pharmacopeia (USP) monograph exists for estriol, and Section 503A permits compounders to use active ingredients that have a USP monograph.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have proven that progesterone inhibits estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium. Administering progesterone orally or transdermally at a high enough dose to ensure sufficient bioavailability is challenging. Many CBHT regimens incorporate nonoral progesterone, yet no adequate RCTs have established any delivery method of progesterone besides oral as effective or capable of protecting the endometrium from estrogen.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^1172ubhQ]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Published findings on breast cancer risk associated with different types of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) are inconsistent, with limited information on long-term effects. We bring together the epidemiological evidence, both published and unpublished, on these associations and review the relevant randomized evidence.

- **Methods**: Principal analyses used individual participant data from all eligible prospective studies that had sought information on the type and timing of MHT use. The main analyses are of individuals with complete information on this. Studies were identified by searching many formal and informal sources regularly from Jan 1, 1992, to Jan 1, 2018. Users were included up to 5 years (mean 1.4 years) after last-reported MHT use. Logistic regression yielded adjusted risk ratios (RRs) comparing particular groups of MHT users versus never users.

- **Findings**: During prospective follow-up, 108,647 postmenopausal women developed breast cancer at a mean age of 65 years (SD 7); 55,575 (51%) had used MHT. Among women with complete information, mean MHT duration was 10 years (SD 6) in users and 7 years (SD 6) in past users. The mean age was 50 years (SD 5) at menopause and 50 years (SD 6) at starting MHT. Every MHT type, except vaginal estrogens, was associated with excess breast cancer risks, which increased steadily with duration of use and were greater for estrogen-progestogen than estrogen-only preparations. Among users, these excess risks were definite even during years 1–4 (estrogen-progestogen RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.52–1.69).

### Compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: Identifying use trends and knowledge gaps among US women [^113bCN3J]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Most Harris completers (63%) recalled consulting their physician about their menopausal symptoms and treatment options. Two-thirds of women who spoke with a physician had also discussed the issues with a family member or friend. Another 14% of completers stated that they had only talked to a family member or friend, while 23% never spoke with anyone about the topics.

Before starting hormone therapy (HT), only 22% of Rose completers considered themselves very familiar or extremely familiar with HT. Another 35% of Rose completers stated that they were somewhat familiar with HT. The rest were not very familiar (26%) or not at all familiar (18%) with HT. Among women who were somewhat to extremely familiar with HT before consulting a physician (n = 1,147), 42% stated that their information came from friends and family. Other sources of information included brochures at the physician's office (28%), the Internet (14%), television (11%), and print publications (6%); almost one quarter (21%) were not sure where they had obtained their information.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114FhMrT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, particularly the management of vasomotor symptoms, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a combination of conjugated equine estrogens and bazedoxifene. This combination should be considered where available and if not contraindicated, as an option for managing vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic postmenopausal patients with a uterus.

### Effects of estrogen plus progestin on health-related quality of life [^112Xe3jt]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and other clinical trials indicate that significant health risks are associated with combination hormone use. Less is known about the effect of hormone therapy on health-related quality of life.

- **Methods**: The WHI randomly assigned 16,608 postmenopausal women, aged 50 to 79 years (mean age, 63), with an intact uterus at baseline to estrogen plus progestin (0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate, in 8,506 women) or placebo (in 8,102 women). Quality-of-life measures were collected at baseline and at one year for all women and at three years in a subgroup of 1,511 women.

- **Results**: Randomization to estrogen plus progestin resulted in no significant effects on general health, vitality, mental health, depressive symptoms, or sexual satisfaction. The use of estrogen plus progestin was associated with a statistically significant but small and not clinically meaningful benefit in terms of sleep disturbance, physical functioning, and bodily pain after one year. The mean benefit regarding sleep disturbance was 0.4 points on a 20-point scale, 0.8 points on a 100-point scale for physical functioning, and 1.9 points on a 100-point scale for pain. At three years, there were no significant benefits in terms of any quality-of-life outcomes. Among women aged 50 to 54 with moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms at baseline, estrogen and progestin improved vasomotor symptoms and resulted in a small benefit in terms of sleep disturbance but no benefit in terms of the other quality-of-life measures.

### Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy: Scientific review [^111BBH5m]. JAMA (2002). Low credibility.

Although postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is widely used in the United States, new evidence about its benefits and harms requires reconsideration of its use for the primary prevention of chronic conditions.

- **Objective**: To assess the benefits and harms of HRT for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, thromboembolism, osteoporosis, cancer, dementia, and cholecystitis by reviewing the literature, conducting meta-analyses, and calculating outcome rates.

- **Data sources**: All relevant English-language studies were identified in MEDLINE (1966–2001), HealthSTAR (1975–2001), Cochrane Library databases, and reference lists of key articles. Recent results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) are included for reported outcomes.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: We used all published studies of HRT if they contained a comparison group of HRT nonusers and reported data relating to HRT use and clinical outcomes of interest. Studies were excluded if the population was selected according to prior events or the presence of conditions associated with higher risks for targeted outcomes.

- **Data synthesis**: Meta-analyses of observational studies indicated summary relative risks (RRs) for coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence and mortality that were significantly reduced among HRT users only, although risk for incidence was not reduced when only studies that controlled for socioeconomic status were included. The WHI reported increased CHD events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval).

### Effects of progestins in different hormone replacement therapy formulations on estrogen-induced lipid changes in postmenopausal women [^116UWnhs]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), used by many women to relieve the symptoms of menopause and for the prevention of osteoporosis, is available in an increasing number of formulations. Options include various combinations of estrogen and progestin, as well as different routes of administration. For women with a uterus, who require a progestin, a convenient and commonly used option is combining the estrogen and progestin in a single pill. Such formulations have the lipid-modifying effects of estrogen, altered according to the specific type and dose of progestin used.

The cardioprotective increases in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, associated with exogenous estrogen, may be blunted or even reversed with certain HRT regimens. Additionally, some progestins minimize the increase in triglycerides that occurs with exogenous estrogen, whereas others do not. Given the importance of lipid markers as risk factors for cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women, these lipid effects should be carefully considered when selecting an HRT regimen.

### Counseling postmenopausal women about bioidentical hormones: Ten discussion points for practicing physicians [^112hZnEa]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Bioidentical hormones are compounds that have exactly the same chemical and molecular structure as endogenous human hormones. In contrast, nonbioidentical, or synthetic, hormones are structurally dissimilar from endogenous hormones. Although available for years, bioidentical compounded hormone therapy (BCHT) has gained popularity in the United States only recently. This popularity has paralleled women's rising fears of conventional hormone therapy, especially since the publication of the Women's Health Initiative clinical trials.

Although BCHT offers advantages, it is not the panacea of hormone therapy. The claims that BCHT lowers the risk of breast cancer, coronary artery disease, stroke, or thromboembolism are not supported by scientific research. The goal of this review is to present an overview of the available research evidence on BCHT, dispel myths about the use of compounded hormones, and provide helpful tips to answer commonly asked questions about BCHT.

### Committee opinion no. 698: Hormone therapy in primary ovarian insufficiency [^11456jZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of primary ovarian insufficiency, particularly concerning hormone therapy, the ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend achieving replacement levels of estrogen as a first-line approach for hormone therapy, either orally or transdermally. It advises against obtaining serum estradiol level testing to monitor the effects of treatment.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^115fY4AG]. Menopause (2015). High credibility.

Although some individuals have a legitimate need for compounded hormone therapy (HT), the use of compounded HT greatly exceeds the scope of need. Determining the full extent to which these unregulated, largely untested compounded HT combinations are being used in the United States is difficult because sales are not tracked and some may be obtained without a prescription. However, compounded hormones are believed to make up a large and growing share of estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) for menopausal symptoms, suggesting an unmet need.

An investigational oral drug that combines 2 mg of solubilized 17β-estradiol with 200 mg of progesterone in a gelatin capsule (TX-001HR; TherapeuticsMD Inc, Boca Raton, FL) has been developed. The estradiol and progesterone ingredients used in the combination are plant-derived and chemically identical to human hormones of ovarian origin. Consistent with FDA guidelines that call for comparing the bioequivalence of any new product with the market standard, a randomized, open-label, three-period, three-sequence, two-treatment, partial-replicate, cross-over study was conducted to characterize the drug's pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in healthy postmenopausal women. The objective was to show that the bioavailability of the estradiol and progesterone compounds used in TX-001HR was equivalent to the bioavailability of the same doses of commercially available, separate formulations of oral estradiol and progesterone coadministered under fed conditions.

### Breast cancer after use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone: Analyses of data from 2 Women's Health Initiative randomized clinical trials [^1148X84h]. JAMA Oncology (2015). High credibility.

Use of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) continues in clinical practice, but reports are conflicting concerning the longer-term breast cancer effects of relatively short-term use. The objective of this study was to report the longer-term influence of menopausal HT on breast cancer incidence in the two Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trials.

A total of 27,347 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years were enrolled at 40 US centers from 1993 to 1998 and followed up for a median of 13 years through September 2010. A total of 16,608 women with a uterus were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg/d [estrogen]) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg/d [progestin]) (E+P) or placebo with a median intervention duration of 5.6 years. Additionally, 10,739 women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens alone (0.625 mg/d) or placebo with a median intervention duration of 7.2 years.

The main outcomes and measures were time-specific invasive breast cancer incidence rates and exploratory analyses of breast cancer characteristics by intervention and post-intervention phases in the two HT trials. In the E+P trial, hazard ratios (HRs) for the influence of combined HT on breast cancer were lower than 1 for two years (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47–1.08) and steadily increased throughout the intervention, becoming significantly increased for the entire intervention phase (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01–1.53). In the early post-intervention phase (within 2.75 years from intervention), there was a sharp decrease in breast cancer incidence.

### Delestrogen [^115kuLDK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. At the time of writing, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

- **Absorption**: Estrogens used in therapy are well absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. When applied for a local action, absorption is usually sufficient to cause systemic effects.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^114ykGim]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Cases continue to accrue in the prospective studies, but there is no good reason to expect that further follow-up would materially alter the main findings for users. To limit biases, the main analyses were restricted to prospective studies, allowing for early menopause, which decreases breast cancer risk and brings forward the age when menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is started. The studies also adjusted for various other potential confounding factors, as other correlates of breast cancer risk might also affect the type or timing of MHT use. Users were included up to no more than 5 years after their last reported MHT use. Among them, there were, on average, only 1.4 years between the last report about their MHT use and their index date. Some additional use must have occurred during that period, as must some discontinuation, but both have been allowed for, although relative risks (RRs) in users must still have been slightly weakened by discontinuation before the index date. With all these safeguards, the findings are trustworthy for the main patterns of use in the prospective studies.

The clinical relevance of the main findings lies in the magnitude of the absolute risks during and after MHT use for women who start MHT at ages 40–59 years. However, the public health relevance additionally depends on the numbers of women previously and currently exposed. Although use of either type of MHT for less than 1 year was associated with little subsequent risk, for women of average weight in developed countries, 5 years of use, starting at age 50 years, would cause an appreciable increase in the probability of developing breast cancer.

### Estradiol [^1127P875]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI enrolled 2,947 predominantly healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years. Among them, 45% were aged 65 to 69, 36% were 70 to 74, and 19% were 75 years and older. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of daily conjugated estrogens (CE) (0.625 mg) alone on the incidence of probable dementia, which was the primary outcome measure, compared to placebo.

After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95% CI, 0.83 to 2.66). The absolute risk was observed as 37 cases versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE-alone versus placebo. Probable dementia in this study included Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and mixed type (with features of both AD and VaD). Alzheimer's disease was the most common classification of probable dementia in both the treatment group and the placebo group. Since this ancillary study was conducted in women aged 65 to 79 years, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Committee opinion no. 698: Hormone therapy in primary ovarian insufficiency [^112FedeP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for amenorrhea, particularly in relation to primary ovarian insufficiency, the ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend achieving replacement levels of estrogen as a first-line approach for hormone therapy, either orally or transdermally. It is advised not to obtain serum estradiol level testing to monitor the effects of treatment.

### Prempro [^115ff5dP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80].

Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

Use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.

All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

### Bioidentical hormone therapy: a review [^111Xcbmc]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

The terms "natural" or "bioidentical" hormone therapy (NHT) describe hormone treatment using individually compounded recipes of certain steroids in various dosage forms, including dehydroepiandrosterone, pregnenolone, testosterone, progesterone, estrone, estradiol, and estriol. Based on the results of a person's salivary hormone levels, the final composition of the compounded dosage form is individualized to that specific person. Proponents claim that NHT is better tolerated than manufactured products. This paper intends to review the concept of NHT and to determine whether there is sufficient scientific evidence to support its use.

- **Design**: A literature search was performed in Medline using the following MeSH terms and keywords: drug combinations; progestational hormones; hormone replacement therapy; endometrium; estrogen replacement therapy; climacteric; menopause; estradiol; estrogens; progesterone; drug monitoring; and drug compounding. Other sources searched included Contents, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Lexis Nexis, Google, Medscape, MD Consult, and clinicaltrials.gov with these keywords.

- **Results**: There are a few observational studies and clinical trials comparing conventional hormone therapy with bioidentical hormone therapy. Studies generally lacked adequate design, including small sample sizes and comparison of inequivalent doses, to prove safety and efficacy. Little evidence was found to support individualized hormone dosing based on saliva hormone concentrations.

### Estradiol [^1165rehT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Estradiol transdermal system is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause and the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

- **Indications and usage**:
	- **Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause**:
		Estradiol transdermal system is an estrogen indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms resulting from menopause.
	- **Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis**:
		Estradiol transdermal system is used for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

- **Limitations of use**:
	- When prescribing solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, first consider the use of non-estrogen medications. Estrogen therapy should be considered only for women at significant risk of osteoporosis.

### Progestogens in hormonal replacement therapy: New molecules, risks, and benefits [^113ZxjFf]. Menopause (2002). Low credibility.

While the benefits of progestogen use in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are well recognized for endometrial protection, their risks and drawbacks have generated controversial articles. Several risks are attributed to progestogens as a class-effect. However, the progestogens used in HRT have varying pharmacological properties and do not induce the same side effects.

Natural progesterone (P) and some of its derivatives, such as the 19-norprogesterones (Nestorone, nomegestrol acetate, trimegestone), do not bind to the androgen receptor and, hence, do not exert androgenic side effects. Newly synthesized molecules, such as drospirenone or dienogest, have no androgenic effect but do have a partial antiandrogenic effect. Drospirenone derives from spironolactone and binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor.

When considering cardiovascular risk factors, some molecules with higher androgenic potency than others attenuate the beneficial effects of estrogens on the lipid profile as well as vasomotion. On the other hand, other progestogens devoid of androgenic properties do not exert these deleterious effects. Epidemiological data do not suggest any negative effect of the progestogens administered together with estrogens on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. However, recent results suggest that in women with established coronary heart disease, HRT may not protect against further heart attacks when the progestogen selected possesses androgenic properties.

The data related to the progestogen effect on breast tissue has been interpreted differently.

### ACOG committee opinion. Risk of breast cancer with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy [^114km4ep]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Recent articles have examined the association between the use of combination estrogen-progestin regimens for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the risk of breast cancer. The objective of this committee opinion is to critically evaluate the presented evidence. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that the addition of progestins to estrogens may increase the risk of breast cancer, this increased risk has not been proven. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend that HRT be considered as a treatment to relieve vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary tract atrophy, and to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and potentially cardiovascular disease. Postmenopausal women should be apprised of the understanding of the risks and benefits of HRT. When considering the use of HRT for longer than 5 years, the clinician and individual patient should weigh the benefits versus the potential side effects and risks for that particular patient.

### Compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy: ACOG clinical consensus no. 6 [^114M88ap]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Many compounding pharmacies use the phrase "bioidentical hormone" as a marketing term to imply that these preparations are natural and, thus, safer and more effective than U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved menopausal medications that use bioidentical or synthetic hormones or both. However, evidence to support marketing claims of safety and effectiveness is lacking. Compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy should not be prescribed routinely when FDA-approved formulations exist. Clinicians should counsel patients that FDA-approved menopausal hormone therapies are recommended for the management of menopausal symptoms over compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy. If a patient requests the use of compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy, clinicians should educate them on the lack of FDA approval of these preparations and their potential risks and benefits, including the risks specific to compounding. To truly understand the benefits and harms of compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy, high-quality placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up comparing custom-compounded products with FDA-approved menopausal hormone therapy are needed.

### Comparative estrogen exposure from compounded transdermal estradiol creams and Food and Drug Administration-approved transdermal estradiol gels and patches [^116zSM51]. Menopause (2023). Low credibility.

Estrogen therapy (ET) is considered the most effective treatment option for both vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause. In the wake of the Women's Health Initiative study, the use of ET initially decreased and then began to transition from oral to transdermal formulations, presumably because of a hypothesized lower risk of adverse outcomes. However, the risk difference between formulations has yet to be fully elucidated. Much of the risk (and benefit) associated with the use of ET is thought to be related to the amount and duration of estrogen exposure. Therefore, it may be prudent to focus on optimizing the amount of estrogen exposure to both achieve treatment goals and minimize risk.

Quantifying these risks and risk reductions according to dose and formulation has not been thoroughly explored, potentially because no convenient tool exists to facilitate the exploration. Whereas the amount of estrogen exposure resulting from Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved transdermal estrogen formulations is somewhat understood, almost nothing is known about estrogen exposure resulting from the use of compounded transdermal estrogen formulations.

Compounded transdermal estrogen formulations, generally included under the umbrella of compounded bioidentical hormones, are not approved by the FDA, and many organizations recommend against their use. A documented allergy to an active pharmaceutical ingredient or excipient or a clinical need for a dose unavailable in an FDA-approved formulation is the only widely accepted justification for their use.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^116woaHz]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

The FDA guidance for establishing the bioequivalence of oral estradiol calls for providing pharmacokinetic parameters for baseline-adjusted serum levels of total estrone, unconjugated estradiol, and unconjugated estrone. Total estrone consists of estrone, estrone sulfates, and estrone glucuronides. After estradiol is orally ingested, it is rapidly converted into estrone (primarily estrone sulfate) via first-pass metabolism. This reservoir of circulating estrone continuously undergoes reconversion into estradiol. Thus, total estrone levels are an important measure of estradiol bioavailability. In evaluating the bioequivalence of oral progesterone, the FDA requires pharmacokinetic parameters for baseline-adjusted serum levels of progesterone.

In this study, the primary pharmacokinetic endpoints were C max, AUC (0-t), and AUC (0-inf) for progesterone, unconjugated estradiol, and total and unconjugated estrone in plasma after treatment with TX-001HR versus the reference products. Secondary endpoints were t max, K el, t 1/2, and AUC % extrap obs. Pharmacokinetic parameters for the specified analytes were determined for each participant during each period by noncompartmental analyses using baseline-adjusted concentrations.

The SABE method for highly variable drugs was used to compare TX-001HR with the coadministered reference products in cases where the within-subject coefficient of variation for the reference product was 30% or more. A pharmacokinetic endpoint for an analyte was identified as bioequivalent when the 95% upper confidence bound on linear regression was met.

### Bioidentical estrogen for menopausal depressive symptoms: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WbWKS]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

Proponents of bioidentical estrogens claim that they are superior for treating menopausal symptoms, including depressive symptoms. Small trials examining the effects of bioidentical estrogens on depressive symptoms show conflicting results. We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness and safety of bioidentical estrogens for the treatment of depressive symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: We searched the scientific literature for randomized controlled trials of at least 4 weeks duration, comparing bioidentical estrogen with placebo for depressive symptoms in menopausal women. The main outcome measure was improvement in depressive symptoms on a validated scale.

- **Results**: We found 12 clinical trials that met inclusion criteria, two of which contained insufficient data for quantitative analysis. In the 10 studies (inclusive of 1208 subjects) for which complete data were available for inclusion in the meta-analysis, bioidentical estrogen had no clinically significant effect on depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.02; confidence interval [95% CI] -0.41 to +0.38). Pooled studies were highly heterogeneous, and numerous approaches to reducing heterogeneity were unsuccessful. Subgroup analyses showed no significant difference in effect for women treated with adjunctive progestogen, women treated with unopposed estrogen, perimenopausal, or postmenopausal and mixed populations. A possible benefit in perimenopausal women treated with unopposed estradiol may have been diluted by studies including older postmenopausal women.

### Committee opinion no. 532: Compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy [^1134fEjZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Although improvement in long-term health is no longer an indication for menopausal hormone therapy, evidence supporting fewer adverse events in younger women, combined with its high overall effectiveness, has reinforced its usefulness for short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms. Menopausal therapy has been provided not only by commercially available products but also by compounding, or the creation of an individualized preparation in response to a healthcare provider's prescription to create a medication tailored to the specialized needs of an individual patient.

The Women's Health Initiative findings, coupled with an increase in direct-to-consumer marketing and media promotion of compounded bioidentical hormonal preparations as safe and effective alternatives to conventional menopausal hormone therapy, have led to a recent increase in the popularity of compounded bioidentical hormones and an increase in questions about the use of these preparations. Not only is evidence lacking to support superiority claims of compounded bioidentical hormones over conventional menopausal hormone therapy, but these claims also pose additional risks of variable purity and potency and lack efficacy and safety data. The Committee on Gynecologic Practice of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine provide an overview of the major issues of concern surrounding compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy and provide recommendations for patient counseling.

### Changes in U.S. prescribing patterns of menopausal hormone therapy, 2001–2003 [^116Mvrqw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

In 2002, the combination estrogen-progestin hormone therapy (HT) treatment arm of the Women's Health Initiative was terminated early due to identified cardiovascular and cancer risks, while the estrogen-only therapy (ET) arm continued. We investigated hormone therapy prescription practice changes between 2001 and 2003 to explore the effects of the clinical trial results.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for the years 2001 through 2003. These nationally representative surveys sample medical encounters in nonfederally employed physician's offices and outpatient departments of nonfederal short-stay and general hospitals. The proportion and rate of visits with ET and HT prescriptions were calculated. Logistic regression was used to estimate change over time accounting for patient and provider characteristics.

- **Results**: Between 2001 and 2003, the number of visits with menopausal hormone prescriptions fell from 26.5 million to 16.9 million. Almost three-quarters of hormone visits were for ET prescriptions. The decrease in the rate of visits was slightly larger for HT prescription visits (44%) than for ET prescription visits (35%). The rate of decline was highest among women 50 years of age and over. After controlling for covariates, there was no significant difference in the decline by hormone type.

- **Conclusion**: These nationally representative data indicate substantial declines in menopausal hormone prescriptions coinciding with clinical trial results.

### Hormone-replacement therapy: current thinking [^111ZZbUb]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

For several decades, the role of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) has been debated. Early observational data on HRT showed many benefits, including a reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality. More recently, randomized trials, including the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studying mostly women many years after the onset of menopause, showed no such benefit and, indeed, an increased risk of CHD and breast cancer, which led to an abrupt decrease in the use of HRT.

Subsequent reanalyses of data from the WHI with age stratification, newer randomized and observational data, and several meta-analyses now consistently show reductions in CHD and mortality when HRT is initiated soon after menopause. HRT also significantly decreases the incidence of various symptoms of menopause and the risk of osteoporotic fractures, and improves quality of life.

In younger healthy women (aged 50–60 years), the risk-benefit balance is positive for using HRT, with risks considered rare. As no validated primary prevention strategies are available for younger women (< 60 years of age), other than lifestyle management, some consideration might be given to HRT as a prevention strategy, as treatment can reduce CHD and all-cause mortality. Although HRT should be primarily oestrogen-based, no particular HRT regimen can be advocated.

### Determination of estradiol and progesterone content in capsules and creams from compounding pharmacies [^1121KrKa]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

The variation in estradiol and progesterone levels observed in compounded hormone therapy (HT) formulations justifies concerns regarding risks as a result of variability, as outlined by NAMS, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the US FDA in their statements regarding compounded hormone use. These data support the need to develop a US FDA-approved bioidentical HT for women who prefer bioidentical hormones, including the up to 3 million women using unregulated, compounded HT annually in the United States.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^114EvEyq]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Spark et al. surveyed 366 Australian women who were taking compounded progesterone and found that 89% started using compounded progesterone because they viewed it as natural. Women's desire for EPT formulations that contain bioidentical hormones, coupled with the need for a formulation that has proven safety and efficacy, was the impetus behind the development of TX-001HR. The active ingredients in TX-001HR are chemically and biologically identical to endogenous estradiol and progesterone. If approved, the non–peanut oil-containing TX-001HR would be the first FDA-approved EPT option for postmenopausal women with a nut allergy who prefer oral progesterone to progestins. It would be a safer alternative to unregulated compounded EPT for symptomatic postmenopausal women with an intact uterus who prefer an oral HT regimen that combines estradiol with progesterone.

Healthy postmenopausal women (aged 40–65 years) with an intact uterus (N = 1,750) are being recruited for the phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled REPLENISH trial (NCT01942668), which aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TX-001HR. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of several doses of this novel estradiol/progesterone combination or to a placebo for one year. The primary endpoint is the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia at 12 months in the overall population and the improvement in climactic symptoms at 12 weeks in a subset of women experiencing more severe vasomotor symptoms. To our knowledge, REPLENISH is the first phase 3 randomized controlled trial of an oral estradiol-progesterone combination design.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^1164ZMnN]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Participant disposition and baseline characteristics - Healthy postmenopausal women (N = 66) were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment sequences described in "Methods". Women had a mean (SD) age of 49.5 (5.6) years (range, 40–64 years) and a mean (SD) body mass index of 24.8 (3.1) kg/m² (range, 18.7–29.9 kg/m²). The mean (SD) height was 150.6 (5.4) cm (range, 138.0–162.0 cm), and the mean (SD) weight was 56.1 (7.0) kg (range, 42.0–75.0 kg).

Overall, 94% of participants (62 of 66) completed all three study periods (Fig. 2). Four women did not report to the facility for period II and/or period III. Analyses for total estrone were conducted using data for 61 participants; data for one woman who had a predose estrone level higher than 5% of C max were excluded, in keeping with FDA guidance for bioequivalence studies.

### Use of bioidentical compounded hormones for menopausal concerns: cross-sectional survey in an academic menopause center [^112MBxyh]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

We aimed to assess the frequency of and experiences with the use of bioidentical compounded hormone therapy (BCH) by women seen at an academic women's health clinic and menopause center.

- **Methods**: Women seeking consultation for menopausal concerns from October 2005 to October 2006 were given a 19-item survey about their experiences with BCH and conventional hormone therapy (CHT).

- **Results**: Of 208 consecutive patients invited to take the survey, 184 consented and responded. Thirty-seven (20%) reported ever having used BCH, and 25 (14%) reported current use of BCH; 59% of BCH preparations used included androgens. Twenty-four of 31 BCH users (77%) believed BCH was safer than CHT. Menopausal symptoms leading to the use of hormones were similar between BCH and CHT users. Symptom relief with the use of both CHT and BCH was similar, but relief of sexual symptoms was reported significantly more frequently by BCH than CHT users (78% vs. 33%, p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Women lacked knowledge of safety concerns with BCH, reporting a belief that it was safer than CHT. Menopausal symptoms prompting BCH and CHT use were similar, but sexual symptoms were more frequently relieved by BCH, possibly because of the inclusion of androgens. Visits to health care providers for menopausal symptoms are ideal opportunities for physicians to educate women that in the absence of data to the contrary, BCH should be considered to have the same risks as CHT. Our findings of reported improvements in sexual symptoms among women using BCH merit further evaluation, with better identification of constituents in the products.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: A cross-sectional study [^117Nv9CG]. Menopause (2025). Low credibility.

- **Association between serum estradiol concentration and dose, age, and estradiol formulation**: Statistical modeling revealed a positive association between dose and estradiol concentration (Supplemental Table 4). For example, compared with women using two PE, the estradiol concentration was estimated to be on average 37.6% higher in women using four PE (95% CI 19.0%-58.9%, P < 0.001) and 98.3% higher in women using eight PE (95% CI 60.4%-145.2%, P < 0.001).

	- However, the predicted differences in estradiol concentration between each dose pairwise comparison revealed that, whilst the difference in estradiol concentration between women using on-label versus off-label doses was statistically significant, there was no evidence of a difference between adjacent dose categories (2 vs. 3 PE, 3 vs. 4 PE, 4 vs. 5 PE, 5 vs. 6 PE, and 6 vs. 8 PE) (Supplemental Table 5).

	- Serum estradiol levels were estimated to be 27.7% lower in older (≥ 50 years) versus younger women (95% CI 18.0%-36.3%, P < 0.001), and 25.7% lower in women using patches compared with women using gel (95% CI 18.4%-32.3%, P < 0.001). The predicted difference in estradiol concentration between women < 50 years versus women ≥ 50 years was 138.27 pmol/L (95% CI 77.84–198.71 pmol/L, P < 0.001), and between gel and patch users was 126.74 pmol/L (95% CI 85.01–168.48 pmol/L, P < 0.001) (Supplemental Tables 4 and 6).

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^112knr5z]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

This study aims to compare the pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability of a capsule combining 17β-estradiol and progesterone in a non–peanut oil–containing formulation with those of widely used and approved separate formulations of estradiol and progesterone coadministered to healthy postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: This was an open-label, balanced, randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, three-period, three-sequence, cross-over, partial-replicate, reference-scaled study. Postmenopausal women (aged 40–65 y) were randomly assigned to one of three dosing sequences of test and reference products (TRR, RTR, or RRT, where T is the test drug and R is the coadministered reference product), with each of the three periods separated by a 14-day washout. The primary pharmacokinetic endpoints were C max, AUC (0-t), and AUC (0-inf) for the test and reference products, assessed for bioequivalence using the scaled average bioequivalence or unscaled average bioequivalence method. Safety was assessed by clinical observation, participant-reported adverse events, and laboratory data, including blood levels of hormones.

- **Results**: Sixty-six women were randomly assigned, and 62 women (94.0%) completed all three study periods. All AUC and C max parameters met bioequivalence criteria for all analytes (estradiol, progesterone, and estrone) except C max for total estrone. The extent of estradiol and progesterone absorption was similar between the test product and the reference products. Four adverse events — all considered mild and unrelated to the study drugs — were reported.

### Estradiol [^1119rAyw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Coronary heart disease**: The WHI estrogen-alone substudy reported no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Subgroup analyses of women aged 50 to 59 years, who were less than 10 years since menopause, suggest a reduction (not statistically significant) of CHD events in those women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) alone compared to placebo (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years).

- **Estrogen plus progestin substudy**: The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk (not statistically significant) of CHD events in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, with a trend toward decreasing relative risk reported in years 2 through 5 [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

- **Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease**: In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study; HERS), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years.

### Compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: New recommendations from the 2020 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [^111DnFRy]. Menopause (2021). Low credibility.

Bioidentical hormones have the exact same chemical and molecular structure as hormones produced in the human body. These hormones are available as FDA-approved hormone formulations. However, nonapproved custom-compounded preparations are marketed as bioidentical, but their content is uncertain. The widespread use of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy, despite the lack of evidence to support its safety and efficacy, is concerning. This Practice Pearl highlights the 2020 recommendations from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine regarding the use of compounded bioidentical hormones.

### Breast effects of oral, combined 17β-estradiol, and progesterone capsules in menopausal women: A randomized controlled trial [^111L5a7g]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

The overall study sample size was determined based on the primary safety and efficacy endpoints as previously described. A post hoc power determination was made on the sample of women with mammogram data. With approximately 100 women in the placebo group and 300 women in an active treatment group, the study had an estimated power of 74% to detect a difference of a threefold increase (e.g. from 3% with placebo to 12% with an active dose) in the incidence of abnormal mammograms (BI-RADS 3 or 4).

Baseline and demographic characteristics were descriptively summarized by treatment group. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was calculated with the number of women in the safety population as the denominator (n = 1,835). Incidence of abnormal mammograms was calculated using the number of women with specific mammogram findings (e.g. BI-RAD 1/2 or 3/4) as the numerator and the number of women with available mammograms as the denominator. For women who had more than one follow-up mammogram, only the last one was included as the study-end mammogram. Analysis was performed using SAS v.9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Bioidentical hormone therapy: A review of the evidence [^113PzFa1]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) uses bioidentical hormones (BHs), which are derivatives of plant extracts chemically modified to be structurally indistinguishable from human endogenous hormones. BHTs are available commercially or can be compounded into different dosages for various routes of administration. Typically, compounded preparations of BHs may include estriol, estrone, estradiol, testosterone, micronized progesterone, and occasionally dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). It is generally accepted that estrogen-based hormone therapies share similar efficacies as well as risks.

Many FDA-approved and regulated, pharmaceutically manufactured, and branded conventional hormone therapies (CHTs) employ BHs. Since the publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial results publicizing an increased risk of stroke, venous thrombosis, breast cancer, and no beneficial effect on coronary heart disease (CHD), use of CHT has declined, and there has been increased interest in alternative approaches. This review of the literature related to compounded BHT and the practices of its advocates aims to determine if sufficient scientific evidence supports claims of greater efficacy and safety, along with any additional risks and uncertainties not generally associated with CHTs.

Compounded BHTs have been promoted by some as natural, safer, and in some cases more efficacious than conventional hormone therapies. However, there is a dearth of scientific evidence to support these claims. Compounded BHTs lack well-controlled studies examining route of administration, pharmacokinetics, safety, and associated critical factors.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^117Ub2SV]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

In the oestrogen-progestagen trials (appendix p 30), a total of 864 women developed breast cancer, including 757 in the WHI trial, and there was no apparent discrepancy with the prospective studies. Although the between-group difference in the duration of hormone treatment was only about 3.6 years at cancer diagnosis, there was an increase in risk about as great as in the WHI power calculations, albeit with broad 99% confidence limits (RR 1.26, 99% CI 1.06–1.51; Z = 3.4; p = 0.0007).

One limitation of all the available epidemiological evidence is that there is still not long enough follow-up after cessation of prolonged MHT use by women who had started some years of hormonal treatment around the time of menopause. If excess risks in past users are real and persist much longer than 15 years, there will be some additional hazard after age 70 years. Another limitation is that the collaboration sought information only on breast cancer incidence, not mortality, and incidence can depend on the sensitivity and frequency of mammographic screening. Breast cancer detection rates could have been reduced somewhat by the increase in breast density that is caused by hormonal treatment, or increased somewhat in populations where screening frequency is associated with MHT use, as in the US. The largest prospective study was, however, from the UK, where there is a nationwide mammographic screening programme. In that study, MHT use was not materially associated with screening uptake but was associated with an increase, not only in breast cancer incidence (of similar magnitude to that in all prospective studies but also in other risk factors).

### Compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy [^1135dTur]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Although improvement in long-term health is no longer an indication for menopausal hormone therapy, evidence supporting fewer adverse events in younger women, combined with its high overall effectiveness, has reinforced its usefulness for short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms. Menopausal therapy has been provided not only by commercially available products but also by compounding, or creation of an individualized preparation in response to a healthcare provider's prescription to create a medication tailored to the specialized needs of an individual patient.

The Women's Health Initiative findings, coupled with an increase in the direct-to-consumer marketing and media promotion of compounded bioidentical hormonal preparations as safe and effective alternatives to conventional menopausal hormone therapy, have led to a recent increase in the popularity of compounded bioidentical hormones as well as an increase in questions about the use of these preparations. Not only is evidence lacking to support superiority claims of compounded bioidentical hormones over conventional menopausal hormone therapy, but these claims also pose additional risks of variable purity and potency and lack efficacy and safety data.

The Committee on Gynecologic Practice of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine provide an overview of the major issues of concern surrounding compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy and provide recommendations for patient counseling.

### Breast effects of oral, combined 17β-estradiol, and progesterone capsules in menopausal women: A randomized controlled trial [^112oDMni]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

One limitation of the study is that analysis of breast density changes with E2/P4 was not a prespecified endpoint in the REPLENISH study. Increased breast density is often found in women using HT containing a progestin. Greater breast density may be associated with increased breast cancer risk, although it is unknown whether the elevated breast cancer risk by combined HT is mediated through hormone-induced breast density change. Another limitation of the study is the relatively short duration time for observations of breast changes. As a longer duration of combined hormone use is associated with higher breast cancer risk, our study is likely not sufficiently powered to observe long-term breast safety of TX-001HR, in addition to the low incidence of breast cancer in women of similar age. Nevertheless, this duration is typical in evaluating menopausal hormone medications, and the study suggests short-term breast safety of TX-001HR.

The REPLENISH trial demonstrated a significant reduction in the severity and frequency of VMS with the two highest doses of TX-001HR studied, with favorable safety profiles including endometrial protection, pharmacologically effective absorption, improved quality of life and sleep outcomes, and no adverse effects on cardiometabolic markers. The results reported here suggest that TX-001HR, an FDA-approved bioidentical combined HT, is potentially safe with no significant adverse impact on the breast after one year of use.

### Prescribing of FDA-approved and compounded hormone therapy differs by specialty [^111pVQBk]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Compounded estrogens (with or without progesterone), as opposed to FDA-approved versions, were proportionally more commonly prescribed by WPs than by GPs and OB/GYNs. Common compounded estrogen formulations may contain estradiol, estrone, or estriol, alone or in some combination. Estriol, a metabolite of estradiol and estrone, is a weak estrogen and has limited bioavailability because of its rapid conjugation after oral administration (up to 98% within 6 hours) and low relative binding affinities for estrogen receptors α and β.

Estriol is frequently compounded in combination with dosages of estradiol that are high enough to achieve biological effect alone; thus, any perceived efficacy may be due to the estradiol in the formulation. The high doses of estriol required to achieve any biological effect might increase the risk for side effects, thus increasing the risks of endometrial cancer and venous thromboembolism. Estriol is not FDA-approved and can only be compounded provided that a new drug application is filed for use in compounding. There is a United States Pharmacopeia monograph for estriol, which technically allows compounders to use it as an active ingredient in compounding. Although estriol and estrone are not FDA-approved and are therefore only available in CHT products, estradiol is available in multiple doses and FDA-approved formulations. Why compounded estradiol would be chosen instead of the FDA-approved version is unclear, although the unique dosing available with CHT may be an important reason.

### Use of menopausal hormone therapy beyond age 65 years and its effects on women's health outcomes by types, routes, and doses [^116prjPS]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

We classified hormone therapy (HT) by types, routes, and dose strengths, as applicable. The study included three types of estrogen: estradiol (E2), conjugated estrogen (CEE), and ethinyl estradiol (EE). Additionally, two types of progestogen were included: progesterone (natural) or progestin (synthetic). There were a total of nine different estrogen-progestogen combinations: E2 alone, E2+progesterone, E2+progestin, CEE alone, CEE+progesterone, CEE+progestin, EE+progestin, progesterone alone, and progestin alone. EE was never prescribed alone and was always combined only with progestin.

Routes and dose strengths were based solely on the estrogen component of the preparations. The routes included oral, transdermal, vaginal, and injectable. An average daily estrogen dose was developed based on DailyMed dosing instructions for each of 138 individual HT products, which accommodated intermittent regimens (e.g. 21 days on and 7 days off).

A "standard" dose for estrogen type and route was defined based on the literature and the distribution of daily estrogen doses as 0.625 mg, 1 mg, and 5 μg for oral CEE, E2, and EE, respectively, and 200 μg and 50 μg for nonoral CEE and E2, respectively. For each drug type, the average daily estrogen doses were categorized as high (greater than 1.45 times the standard), low (less than 0.45 times the standard), and medium (between the lower end of the high and the upper end of the low bounds). Each combination of estrogen-progestogen preparation, dose strength, and route was considered a separate covariate, totaling 40; 16 estrogen therapies (ET) and 24 estrogen-progestogen therapies (EPT) preparations.

### Committee opinion: number 262, December 2001. Risk of breast cancer with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy [^113GuvNb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Recent articles have examined the association between the use of combination estrogen-progestin regimens for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the risk of breast cancer. The objective of this Committee Opinion is to critically evaluate the presented evidence. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that adding progestin to estrogens may increase the risk of breast cancer, this increased risk has not been proved. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend that HRT be considered as a treatment to relieve vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary tract atrophy and to address the risks and benefits of HRT. When considering the use of HRT for longer than 5 years, the clinician and individual patient should weigh the benefits versus the potential side effects and risks for that particular patient.

### Bioidentical hormones for menopausal hormone therapy: Variation on a theme [^114XwCqg]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Progesterone creams and natural or bioidentical compounded estrogen preparations are being promoted to consumers as safe alternatives to conventional menopausal hormone therapy and as health-promoting tonics. No reliable data support these claims.

- **Safety**: Natural hormones, including estradiol, estriol, estrone, and progesterone, can be expected to have the same adverse event profile as conventional menopausal hormone regimens.

- **Salivary hormone tests**: Salivary tests may be used to persuade asymptomatic consumers to use hormones (or symptomatic patients to use higher doses than those needed to mitigate symptoms), a practice that can be expected to result in adverse events.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and long-term all-cause and cause-specific mortality: The Women's Health Initiative randomized trials [^111dq4zs]. JAMA (2017). High credibility.

Health outcomes from the Women's Health Initiative Estrogen Plus Progestin and Estrogen-Alone Trials have been reported, but previous publications have generally not focused on all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

The objective of this study was to examine total and cause-specific cumulative mortality, including during the intervention and extended postintervention follow-up, of the 2 Women's Health Initiative hormone therapy trials. This study involved an observational follow-up of US multiethnic postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years who were enrolled in 2 randomized clinical trials between 1993 and 1998 and followed up through December 31, 2014.

Interventions involved conjugated equine estrogens (CEE, 0.625 mg/d) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, 2.5 mg/d) (n = 8506) versus placebo (n = 8102) for a median of 5.6 years, or CEE alone (n = 5310) versus placebo (n = 5429) for a median of 7.2 years.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: All-cause mortality (primary outcome) and cause-specific mortality (cardiovascular disease mortality, cancer mortality, and other major causes of mortality) were assessed in the two trials pooled and in each trial individually, with prespecified analyses by 10-year age group based on age at time of randomization.

Among 27,347 women who were randomized (baseline mean [SD] age, 63.4 [7.2] years; 80.6% white), mortality follow-up was available for more than 98% of participants. During the cumulative 18-year follow-up, 7,489 deaths occurred, including 1,088 deaths during the intervention phase and 6,401 deaths during the postintervention follow-up. All-cause mortality was 27.1% in the hormone therapy group versus 27.6%.

### Progression of metabolic syndrome severity during the menopausal transition [^116Nau9g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The proportion of participants taking estrogen replacement therapy after menopause was high in this study, with higher use among white women (13.8%) versus black women (6.6%), raising the potential that this discrepancy in hormone replacement could account for the racial differences in metabolic syndrome (MetS) progression among postmenopausal women in the study. Oral administration of estrogen, but not transdermal or vaginal administration, suppresses fat oxidation, contributing to increased body fat. In contrast, transdermal estrogen administration did not change levels of body fat over time. While we lacked data regarding the route of estrogen administration during the study, visit four of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, completed in 1998, showed that more than 75% of estrogen replacement was oral. Topical or vaginal estrogen replacement, which is more common currently, was found to improve lean body mass without affecting fat mass. We didn't note differences in the rate of change in MetS severity by estrogen use, although we lacked data regarding dose and adherence to estrogen use, which may have further influenced any effect. Overall, however, hormone replacement did not appear to explain the racial differences in MetS severity.

The mechanisms behind the slower rate of MetS severity progression after menopause are unclear but could be related to changes in estrogen levels and the related action of adipocytes and hepatic function. Tepper et al. demonstrated that while there is an overall decline in estradiol levels between six years before and one year after the final menstrual period, when estradiol levels stabilize, the specific mechanisms need further investigation.

### Oestrogen replacement in postmenopausal women [^1116A9rU]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Menopausal symptoms can disrupt a woman's personal and social life. Vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats, are the most common and can be treated very effectively with oestrogen-based hormone therapy. The decision to use oestrogen therapy, often termed hormone therapy or hormone replacement therapy (HT), involves balancing the potential benefits against the potential risks. Most agree that short-term oestrogen therapy, using the lowest effective dose, is a reasonable option for recently menopausal women with moderate-to-severe symptoms who are in good cardiovascular health.

Whilst effective and safe in most instances, HT is not suitable for all women or for all menopause-related symptoms when alternatives are available. The role of HRT in chronic disease prevention is also discussed.

### Determination of estradiol and progesterone content in capsules and creams from compounding pharmacies [^1118NzTV]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

To analytically characterize the doses of estradiol and progesterone found in compounded combined forms of oral capsule and transdermal cream formulations, and determine the consistency of the hormone formulations within a batch, prescriptions for combined estradiol/progesterone capsules (0.5 and 100 mg, respectively) and creams (0.5 and 100 mg/g, respectively) were sent to 15 custom-compounding pharmacies. Estradiol and progesterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassays. Hormone levels were measured in two capsules and two creams from each pharmacy, with ten capsules from three pharmacies; and top, middle, and bottom layers of cream containers to assess consistency. The magnitude and sources of variation for the measurements were examined using analysis of variance models.

- **Results**: Thirteen pharmacies filled the prescriptions. Measured estradiol levels ranged from 0.365 to 0.551 mg for capsules and 0.433 to 0.55 mg/g for creams, and progesterone levels ranged from 90.8 to 135 mg for capsules and 93 to 118 mg/g for creams. Greater variations in estradiol levels were observed between pharmacies for estradiol in capsules than in creams; however, measured estradiol levels within pharmacies were more consistent in the capsules than in the creams. Similar results were obtained for progesterone levels.

The variations in estradiol and progesterone levels observed in compounded hormone therapy formulations justify concerns regarding risks as a result of variability, which have been outlined by The North American Menopause Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^117FRGfX]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Estrogens have been associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. Yet, emerging clinical and experimental evidence points to progestogens — endogenous progesterone or synthetic progesterone (progestin) — as the primary hormonal driver underlying seemingly estrogen-associated breast cancer risk. Estrogens may contribute to breast cancer risk indirectly by inducing the progesterone receptor and thus amplifying progesterone signaling. Large studies of hormonal contraceptives suggest that the small increase in breast cancer risk from hormonal contraceptives is mainly attributable to progestins, not estrogens. Estrogen-plus-progestin hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has consistently shown an increase in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women, whereas estrogen-alone HRT has little impact on breast cancer risk in naturally or surgically menopausal women. In particular, the long-term follow-up of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trials suggests a benefit of estrogen alone.

Recent data further indicate that endogenously elevated estrogen during assisted reproductive technology (ART) exhibits little adverse effect on, or potentially a reduction in, breast cancer risk and recurrence. Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that inhibition of progesterone signaling is a critical mechanism underlying the risk-reducing and therapeutic effects of antiestrogens. Estrogen HRT has shown an array of proven benefits, including ameliorating menopausal symptoms and improving bone health. Collective evidence thus suggests that estrogen HRT is likely to offer health benefits.

### Postmenopausal estrogen for treatment of hot flashes: Clinical applications [^1165Pbn9]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Use of postmenopausal estrogen has evolved since the initial results from the Women's Health Initiative were released in 2002. Professional organizations, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the US Preventive Services Task Force have issued new recommendations against using estrogen and progestin or progesterone for the prevention of chronic conditions. This article evaluates the state of evidence for postmenopausal estrogen use to guide management decisions in two clinical scenarios: initiating therapy in a perimenopausal woman with hot flashes and discontinuing estrogen use in a long-term user.

### Combined oral hormone replacement therapy formulations [^11162wAt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Today, clinicians are challenged to address a woman's contraceptive needs during her reproductive and perimenopausal years and then provide her with a menopausal therapeutic option. This option should offer optimal symptom relief, noncontraceptive health benefits, and a good tolerability profile. The benefits of hormone replacement therapy include control of vasomotor symptoms, reduction of vulvovaginal atrophy, and protection against osteoporosis. Research also points to emerging hormone replacement therapy benefits such as protection against cardiovascular disease, colon cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.

One of the primary considerations in the transition from oral contraceptive use to hormone replacement therapy is the tolerability profile of the progestin component of the hormone replacement therapy. Because progestin-related side effects are among the main reasons for discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy, the selection of a formulation that contains the same well-tolerated progestin as in the woman's oral contraceptive can be particularly important to successful use of hormone replacement therapy.

Currently, in the United States, continuous combined hormone replacement therapy is available in three formulations and one continuous estrogen/intermittent progestin formulation. Although direct comparative trials are lacking, available data suggest that the new, continuous 17beta-estradiol/intermittent norgestimate hormone replacement therapy formulation may offer advantages over regimens that contain older progestins with metabolic disadvantages.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^113gYZXi]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence suggest that if the associations are largely causal, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use in Western countries has already resulted in approximately 1 million breast cancers out of a total of about 20 million since 1990. For women of average weight in Western countries, five years of use of estrogen plus daily progestagen MHT, starting at age 50 years, would increase 20-year breast cancer risks at ages 50–69 years from 6.3% to 8.3%, an absolute increase of 2.0 per 100 women (one in every 50 users).

Similarly, five years of use of estrogen plus intermittent progestagen MHT would increase the 20-year risk from 6.3% to 7.7%, amounting to an absolute increase of 1.4 per 100 women (one in 70 users). On the other hand, five years of estrogen-only MHT would increase the 20-year risk from 6.3% to 6.8%, which is an absolute increase of 0.5 per 100 women (one in 200 users). The excess risk is greater in lean women, but in obese women, estrogen-only MHT is associated with little excess risk. For ten years of use, the 20-year increases in incidence would be about twice as great as for five years of use.

Most individual studies were too small to reliably assess the long-term breast cancer risk associated with just a few years of MHT use. Additionally, some epidemiological evidence remains unpublished, and studies completed before the 2000s necessarily had limited information about long-term effects of past use. A reliable assessment of the association between breast cancer risk and past use of MHT requires a review of the totality of the worldwide evidence, with careful control of potential sources of appreciable bias and confounding factors.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk [^114ceTJr]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Estrogen-based therapies have shown superior antidepressant effects compared to placebo when administered to perimenopausal women. The antidepressant effects of estrogen were observed even in the absence of concomitant vasomotor symptoms. However, older postmenopausal women showed little or no response to estrogen therapy for the alleviation of depressive symptoms. Taken together, these observations suggest that estrogen's antidepressant effect may have a 'critical window' or optimal timing, possibly during the menopausal transition (MT) and early postmenopausal years. Moreover, the potential benefits of E2 therapy for the improvement of mood symptoms may occur independently from changes or improvement in vasomotor symptoms.

As symptomatic midlife women may endorse a wide variety of physical and emotional complaints, physicians and other health professionals face the challenging task of disentangling the biological and psychosocial aspects attributable primarily to (a) the aging process per se, (b) the menopausal transition, or (c) the emergence of new onset depression.

### Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: Principal results from the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial [^111Um91k]. JAMA (2002). High credibility.

Despite decades of accumulated observational evidence, the balance of risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States.

The design involved the estrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial. The planned duration was 8.5 years, during which 16,608 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited by 40 US clinical centers from 1993 to 1998.

- **Interventions**: Participants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in one tablet (n = 8,506) or placebo (n = 8,102).

- **Main outcomes measures**: The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the two primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.

On May 31, 2002, following a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs. placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002.

### Estradiol [^111zJXXs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen. It is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone, and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. At the time of writing, two estrogen receptors have been identified, varying in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated concentrations of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to the estradiol transdermal system nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different methods have shown variability.
