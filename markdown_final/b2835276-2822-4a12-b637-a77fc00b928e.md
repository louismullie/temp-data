## Question

Midodrine in esrd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about midodrine use in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), specifically regarding dosing, dialysis considerations, efficacy, safety, and a practical decision framework for intradialytic hypotension and related scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled indication to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify FDA-labeled dosing guidance in renal impairment and dialysis modalities. Next, I will review the evidence for intradialytic hypotension, including magnitude of benefit and limitations. After that, I need to examine safety signals, especially supine hypertension and observational mortality associations. Then, I should integrate guideline positions and dialysis-specific nonpharmacologic strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and state a bottom-line recommendation with appropriate caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic foundation and labeled indication. Midodrine is a prodrug converted to desglymidodrine, an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that increases vascular resistance and blood pressure. It is FDA-approved for symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, not for intradialytic hypotension, so any use in dialysis hypotension is off-label and should be framed as such [^111dKZxR] [^113u8aJx].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing guidance in renal impairment before extrapolating to dialysis. The FDA labeling advises caution in renal impairment because desglymidodrine is renally cleared; it recommends starting at 2.5 mg and titrating cautiously, with explicit dose reduction for eGFR less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m² and for dialysis modalities including intermittent hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and continuous renal replacement therapy, where lower starting doses and careful titration are advised [^115M3kvq] [^114nWR4b] [^114JRSXV] [^115Kt3t8] [^117TfhJv] [^11211ict] [^115tK7VJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the specific dialysis dosing recommendations to avoid overgeneralization. For intermittent hemodialysis, a commonly cited approach is to start 2.5 mg if under 70 kg and 5 mg if over 70 kg, given 15–30 minutes pre-dialysis, with titration to effect; for peritoneal dialysis and CRRT, the FDA advises treating as eGFR less than 10 mL/min/1.73 m² and starting low with titration, acknowledging limited formal PK/PD data in these settings [^117TfhJv] [^115tK7VJ].

> Next, I should review the efficacy signal for intradialytic hypotension. A systematic review of small studies suggested mean improvements of about 12–13 mmHg in systolic and 6–7 mmHg in diastolic pressure with pre-dialysis midodrine, and several studies reported fewer symptomatic episodes. However, the evidence base is limited by small size, short duration, and methodological flaws, and contemporary guidelines characterize the benefit as modest and uncertain [^111iQ4JR] [^111bVGMN] [^115jQ7Po].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the UK Kidney Association guideline called the evidence "inconclusive", but I should double-check the exact wording. The 2025 UK guideline states evidence is "inconclusive", citing the 2004 meta-analysis and noting no consistent symptom reduction, which aligns with the earlier characterization of limited and biased studies; so my initial thought was correct, but I needed to verify the source and year to avoid misattribution [^115jQ7Po].

> I will now examine safety, because this is pivotal in ESRD. Supine hypertension is a consistent and dose-related risk; in dose–response studies, 22% on 10 mg and 45% on 20 mg had systolic pressures at or above 200 mmHg, often persisting beyond 6 hours, which is especially concerning in patients with limited nocturnal mobility; other alpha-1 effects include urinary retention and piloerection, and the last dose should be at least 3–4 hours before bedtime with head-up sleeping to mitigate risk [^114pkY4M] [^1171bJDk] [^111dKZxR].

> But wait, what if midodrine use is simply a marker of sicker patients rather than directly harmful? A large retrospective cohort in hemodialysis found midodrine prescription associated with higher all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and cardiovascular hospitalization; while confounding by indication is likely, these signals underscore the need for caution and for prioritizing nonpharmacologic strategies first [^1112zuaF] [^115jQ7Po].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. KDIGO and UK Kidney Association guidance emphasize nonpharmacologic measures as first-line for intradialytic hypotension and note that pharmacologic options like midodrine have limited evidence; midodrine may be considered selectively when nonpharmacologic strategies fail, but routine use is not endorsed [^111bVGMN] [^115jQ7Po].

> Let me consider nonpharmacologic foundations that should precede any midodrine trial. Accurate dry-weight assessment, salt restriction to limit interdialytic weight gain, slower or profiled ultrafiltration, lower dialysate temperature, avoidance of intra-dialytic meals, and review of antihypertensive timing are core measures; sodium modeling without UF modeling should be avoided, and individualized UF profiling can reduce hypotension burden [^111bVGMN] [^1147whTv] [^114NNzWY].

> I should confirm dialysis-specific pharmacokinetic considerations. Midodrine is partially removed by hemodialysis, so pre-dialysis dosing is reasonable. However, given the lack of robust PK data in dialysis, conservative starts with careful titration and close monitoring of standing and supine blood pressures are prudent, especially in patients with minimal residual renal function [^114pkY4M] [^115M3kvq].

> Now, I will synthesize a practical decision framework. First, optimize nonpharmacologic measures and reassess dry weight. If symptomatic intradialytic hypotension persists, consider a time-limited midodrine trial with pre-dialysis dosing, starting at 2.5–5 mg depending on body size and tolerance, titrating in small increments to effect while watching for supine hypertension. Discontinue if no meaningful symptom improvement after a short, predefined period, and always avoid late-evening dosing [^117TfhJv] [^11192smG] [^115jQ7Po].

> Hold on, I should verify contraindications and drug interactions before finalizing. Midodrine is contraindicated in severe organic heart disease, acute renal disease, urinary retention, pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, and in patients with persistent supine hypertension. It can interact with other alpha-agonists and may be antagonized by alpha-blockers, and caution is warranted with cardiac glycosides due to bradyarrhythmia risk, so a medication reconciliation is essential [^117AW5pP] [^11192smG].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure it is balanced. Midodrine can modestly raise blood pressure and reduce some hypotension episodes in dialysis, but benefits are inconsistent for symptoms, safety concerns are nontrivial, and observational data suggest worse outcomes. Therefore, midodrine should be reserved for selected, symptomatic patients after exhaustive nonpharmacologic optimization, with explicit stop criteria, vigilant monitoring of supine blood pressure, and shared decision-making about uncertain benefit [^111iQ4JR] [^115jQ7Po] [^1112zuaF] [^111bVGMN].

---

Midodrine is appropriate for ESRD patients with **symptomatic intradialytic hypotension** [^111bVGMN] when nonpharmacologic measures fail [^1138J2W7], but it requires **careful dosing and monitoring** due to supine hypertension and arrhythmias [^11192smG]. Start at 2.5–5 mg pre-dialysis [^117TfhJv], titrate to effect, and avoid doses within 4 hours of bedtime [^1171bJDk]; monitor BP closely and adjust dialysis prescription as needed [^114NNzWY]. Midodrine is not first-line for orthostatic hypotension in ESRD; prioritize fluid management, dialysate adjustments, and antihypertensive timing [^115jQ7Po] [^1147whTv].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in ESRD

- **Absorption**: Midodrine is rapidly absorbed orally, with peak plasma levels at 15–30 minutes and peak clinical effect at ~1 hour [^notfound].

- **Metabolism**: Hepatic metabolism to desglymidodrine, an active alpha-1 agonist [^notfound].

- **Excretion**: Desglymidodrine is renally cleared; accumulation is expected in ESRD, so lower starting doses are advised [^115M3kvq].

- **Dialysis removal**: Midodrine is removed by hemodialysis; dose after dialysis or consider supplemental dosing if hypotension recurs [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence for midodrine use in ESRD

Evidence supports midodrine for **intradialytic hypotension** [^114NNzWY], with small studies and meta-analyses showing modest increases in nadir and post-dialysis BP and reduced symptomatic episodes [^111iQ4JR] [^114NNzWY]. For **orthostatic hypotension**, evidence is limited in ESRD; midodrine is effective for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^113sJq7p], but data in dialysis patients are sparse, so use is individualized.

---

## Recommended dosing and administration in ESRD

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dose** | **Timing** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Intradialytic hypotension | 2.5–5 mg | 15–30 minutes before dialysis | Titrate to effect; monitor BP closely |
| Orthostatic hypotension | 2.5–5 mg | Three times daily during waking hours | Last dose ≥ 4 hours before bedtime |
| Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 10) | 2.5 mg | Titrate cautiously | Monitor for accumulation and supine hypertension |

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

- **Supine hypertension**: Common and potentially severe; monitor supine BP and avoid bedtime dosing [^1171bJDk].

- **Arrhythmias**: Use caution in patients with cardiac disease; monitor ECG if indicated [^111dKZxR].

- **Other effects**: Piloerection, pruritus, urinary retention, and headache may occur [^111dKZxR].

- **Drug interactions**: Avoid with other vasoconstrictors and use caution with cardiac glycosides [^11192smG].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

KDIGO suggests midodrine as a **pharmacologic option** for intradialytic hypotension when nonpharmacologic measures are insufficient [^111bVGMN]. UK Kidney Association notes **limited and inconclusive evidence** for midodrine in IDH; use cautiously and monitor closely [^115jQ7Po]. FDA labeling advises **lower starting doses** in renal impairment and close monitoring for supine hypertension [^115M3kvq].

---

## Alternative pharmacological options

- **Droxidopa**: Alpha-1 agonist for orthostatic hypotension; limited dialysis data [^111bVGMN].

- **Fludrocortisone**: Mineralocorticoid for orthostatic hypotension; monitor for fluid overload and hypertension [^116q9YPb].

- **Sertraline**: SSRI with alpha-1 activity; limited evidence for IDH [^111bVGMN].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **regular supine and standing BP** during dialysis and clinic visits [^1171bJDk]. Assess for symptoms of supine hypertension, arrhythmias, and urinary retention at each visit. Adjust the dialysis prescription — ultrafiltration rate, dialysate temperature, and sodium profiling — to reduce hypotension risk [^1138J2W7].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Indication**: Midodrine is appropriate for symptomatic intradialytic hypotension refractory to nonpharmacologic measures [^111bVGMN].

- **Dosing**: Start low (2.5–5 mg) and titrate cautiously, avoiding bedtime dosing [^1171bJDk].

- **Monitoring**: Close BP monitoring and regular assessment for adverse effects are essential [^1171bJDk].

- **Alternatives**: Consider droxidopa or fludrocortisone if midodrine is ineffective or poorly tolerated [^111bVGMN].

---

Midodrine can be used in ESRD for **intradialytic hypotension** when nonpharmacologic strategies fail, but requires cautious dosing, close monitoring, and awareness of adverse effects. It is not first-line for orthostatic hypotension in ESRD; prioritize fluid management, dialysate adjustments, and antihypertensive timing [^111bVGMN].

### Clinical case-based approach to understanding intradialytic hypotension [^1173U1Wp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The approach to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who develop intradialytic hypotension (IDH) encompasses an understanding of the pathophysiology, appropriate dialysis prescription modification, application of newer pharmacologic therapies, and development of strategies for prevention. Patients should have a "minimal data set" as part of their predialysis assessment. This information is critical to prescription modifications that may help decrease the risk for IDH. Individuals at "high risk" for IDH should be kept to a "safe zone" for dialysis ultrafiltration (≤ 3% of body weight). Specific maneuvers that may decrease the risk for IDH include adjustment of the dialysate sodium or calcium concentration and dialysate temperature. The first priority for patients developing IDH should be the stabilization of the blood pressure and improvement in the patient's symptomology. Pharmacologic intervention should be considered for patients who require repeat interventions for IDH. "At-risk" patients with a strong cardiac history should undergo an assessment of their cardiovascular status if IDH episodes occur. The use of pharmacologic therapy, ie, midodrine, alone or in combination with prescription modification, can be helpful in decreasing interventions required for IDH. Noncompliance and high interdialytic weight gain in the setting of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction can increase the risk of IDH. Assessment of antihypertensive medications should be performed on a regular basis to determine the correct dosing schedule for patients with hypertension who develop IDH. Coronary flow reserve may be compromised in patients with LVH, adding to the risk for perfusion injury with low blood pressure. Increasing the dialysate calcium concentration may decrease the incidence of arrhythmogenicity in certain patients. Patients with low body temperature may benefit most from cool dialysate. Unit personnel should be aware of the potential link between hypotension and the increased relative risk for death in ESRD patients. Clinical training sessions on IDH risk recognition and appropriate treatment should be implemented within the dialysis unit. Because repeated bouts of IDH can be disruptive to the smooth efficiency of unit operations, attention to prevention as well as acute intervention of IDH is important. Preventive strategies can be developed in each unit to decrease the number of future IDH events. Considering the importance of hypotension in overall patient survival, attention to identifying the percentage of patients in each unit who experience IDH and/or who present with low blood pressure (systolic < 110 mm Hg) should be tracked as a quality assurance initiative.

Medications to raise BP in intradialytic hypotension.

Nonmedication strategies for treating intradialytic hypotension, such as cardiovascular status optimization, UF rate minimization, and target-weight reassessment, should be prioritized. Medication options include midodrine, argi-nine-vasopressin, – sertraline, droxidopa, amezinium metilsulfate, fludrocortisone, and carnitine. In general, the evidence base for these strategies is relatively weak, with most studies being small and of short duration. The most widely used is midodrine, an oral vasoconstrictor, although efficacy data are limited, as is its availability outside the US (Table 3).

Vasoconstrictor selection in cirrhosis with HRS-AKI notes global use patterns and shock-specific choice: "Worldwide, terlipressin is the most widely used vasoconstrictor in cirrhosis for HRS in the absence of shock, followed by norepinephrine, with a small number of studies reporting on the use of midodrine and octreotide", and "Terlipressin was recently approved for use in the United States". Importantly, "in patients with AKI and shock, norepinephrine is the first drug of choice".

### Should there be an expanded role for palliative care in end-stage renal disease? [^116X7wb3]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In this review, we outline the rationale for expanding the role of palliative care in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), describe the components of a palliative care model, and identify potential barriers in implementation.

Recent Findings

Patients receiving chronic dialysis have reduced life expectancy and high rates of chronic pain, depression, cognitive impairment, and physical disability. Delivery of prognostic information and advance care planning are desired by patients, but occur infrequently. Furthermore, although hospice care is associated with improved symptom control and lower healthcare costs at the end of life, it is underutilized by the ESRD population, even among patients who withdraw from dialysis. A palliative care model incorporating communication of prognosis, advance care planning, symptom assessment and management, and timely hospice referral may improve quality of life and quality of dying. Resources and clinical practice guidelines are available to assist practitioners with incorporating palliative care into ESRD management.

Summary

There is a large unmet need to alleviate the physical, psychosocial, and existential suffering of patients with ESRD. More fully integrating palliative care into ESRD management by improving end-of-life care training, eliminating structural and financial barriers to hospice use, and identifying optimal methods to deliver palliative care are necessary if we are to successfully address the needs of an aging ESRD population.

### Analgesia in patients with ESRD: a review of available evidence [^113WXBcF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Moderate to severe pain frequently accompanies chronic diseases in general and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in particular. Several analgesic agents and associated metabolites show altered pharmacokinetics in the presence of reduced glomerular filtration rate. Drug-related side effects may exacerbate symptoms frequently observed in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD; eg, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and constipation) or those often attributed to hemodialysis therapy (eg, orthostatic hypotension and impaired cognition). Persons with advanced CKD and ESRD are at increased risk for adverse effects of analgesic agents because of enhanced drug sensitivity, comorbid conditions, and concurrent medication use. Dose adjustment and avoidance of certain analgesics may be required in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD. We review the available evidence on pharmacokinetics and adverse drug effects of various analgesic agents commonly used in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD. Determining an optimal approach to the control of pain in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD will require additional research.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^114NNzWY]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Regardless of the quality of dialysis prescription, intra-dialytic hypotension will still occur, in some patients more than others, for which prompt nursing intervention is essential. Common measures include leg raised positioning, ceasing ultrafiltration, and fluid administration (saline being as good as albumin and far cheaper). Measures for "simple" intra-dialytic hypotension should be coupled with assessment for underlying intercurrent illness (such as infection or cardiac arrhythmia) or less commonly a specific dialysis complication (such as air embolism or dialyser reaction). Frequent intervention should lead to re-assessment of target weight / ultrafiltration setting and a medication review - in some cases predialysis hypertension may be preferable to dialysis intolerance. Specific pharmacological measures are rarely used but the alfa-agonist Midodrine has reasonable supportive evidence: in meta-analysis the average improvement (increase) in systolic/diastolic post-dialysis blood pressure was 12.4/7.7mmHg.

Guideline 4.2 - Paediatric fluid considerations

In growing children we recommend clinical assessment of fluid status and target weight, and dietetic assessment, at least monthly. [1C]

We suggest supplementing clinical assessment with a validated objective measure of fluid status such as bioimpedance, on a monthly basis or more frequently during periods of rapid growth or illness. [2C]

We recommend regular assessment of ultrafiltration tolerance, using extended times to avoid excessive ultrafiltration rates. [1D]

Rationale

Assessment of target weight in children and adolescents is particularly challenging as it needs frequent adjustment in line with growth or periods of illness. This is particularly true for infants and adolescents during rapid phases of growth. Overestimation of target weight will result in chronic fluid overload leading to hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas chronic under-hydration is likely to detrimentally affect residual kidney function and lead to increased symptomatic hypotension both during and immediately post-dialysis. Hypotensive tendency is also multifactorial and cannot alone be relied on to ascertain a patient's target weight. It is therefore essential that target weight is adjusted at least on a monthly basis following clinical assessment, in conjunction with dietetic review.

### Perioperative pharmacologic management of patients with end stage renal disease [^116zVQqV]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of numerous medications used in the perioperative period are altered in patients with end-stage renal disease. Clearance of drugs, or their metabolites, that are normally excreted by the kidney is markedly reduced in ESRD. In addition, patients with ESRD may also have alterations in gastrointestinal absorption, volume of distribution, protein binding, and metabolic clearance of pharmacologic agents. Finally, drug removal may be augmented during dialysis. All of these factors contribute to the need for dose adjustment of medications, including analgesics, anesthetics, neuromuscular blockers, and antimicrobial agents, which may be used in the perioperative management of the ESRD patient.

### Midodrine hydrochloride [^1171bJDk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended dose of Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP is 10 mg, 3 times daily. Dosing should take place during the daytime hours when the patient needs to be upright, pursuing the activities of daily living. A suggested dosing schedule of approximately 4-hour intervals is as follows: shortly before, or upon arising in the morning, midday and late afternoon (not later than 6 P.M.). Doses may be given in 3-hour intervals, if required, to control symptoms, but not more frequently. Single doses as high as 20 mg have been given to patients, but severe and persistent systolic supine hypertension occurs at a high rate (about 45%) at this dose. In order to reduce the potential for supine hypertension during sleep, Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP should not be given after the evening meal or less than 4 hours before bedtime. Total daily doses greater than 30 mg have been tolerated by some patients, but their safety and usefulness have not been studied systematically or established. Because of the risk of supine hypertension, Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP should be continued only in patients who appear to attain symptomatic improvement during initial treatment.

The supine and standing blood pressure should be monitored regularly, and the administration of Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP should be stopped if supine blood pressure increases excessively.

Because desglymidodrine is excreted renally, dosing in patients with abnormal renal function should be cautious; although this has not been systematically studied, it is recommended that treatment of these patients be initiated using 2.5-mg doses.

Dosing in children has not been adequately studied.

Blood levels of midodrine and desglymidodrine were similar when comparing levels in patients 65 or older vs. younger than 65 and when comparing males vs. females, suggesting dose modifications for these groups are not necessary.

Theme 1: professional role challenges

Challenges in nephrology roles

The implementation of KSC in clinical practice presents significant challenges to healthcare professionals' roles and responsibilities. KSC establishes a coordinated care framework requiring proactive patient-provider communication, contrasting traditional renal care models relying on discrete clinical teams managing fragmented care. This paradigm transformation is essential for optimizing care delivery and ensuring patient comprehension of clinically viable treatment pathways. Nephrologists must navigate transformative adaptations to conventional care paradigms amidst evolving clinical demands. A nephrologist highlighted the patient's right to choose in decision-making, stating, " There are times when patients are not willing to make a decision, and as a patient, they have a right… because that's their life, and if they do not want to decide what they want to do with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) imminent, they can do that". This statement highlights a critical tension in KSC implementation: while promoting shared decision-making, the model must also respect varying patient engagement preferences, from deferral to refusal. Moreover, professional responsibilities are transforming in both scope and nature.

Another nephrologist also mentioned that they serve in informal or formal consulting roles in renal and/or palliative care clinics. " As consultants, our responsibilities could vary from advising other clinicians to co-managing patients with their primary nephrologists on a variety of issues including complex medical decision-making, advance care planning, and symptom management". While necessary, this evolution towards blurred professional boundaries and co-management in KSC highlights a key challenge for nephrology roles.

### Could metformin be used in patients with diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease? [^111xtg5n]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes is an important cause of end stage renal failure worldwide. As renal impairment progresses, managing hyperglycaemia can prove increasingly challenging, as many medications are contra-indicated in moderate to severe renal impairment. Whilst evidence for tight glycaemic control reducing progression to renal failure in patients with established renal disease is limited, poor glycaemic control is not desirable, and is likely to lead to progressive complications. Metformin is a first-line therapy in patients with Type 2 diabetes, as it appears to be effective in reducing diabetes related end points and mortality in overweight patients. Cessation of metformin in patients with progressive renal disease may not only lead to deterioration in glucose control, but also to loss of protection from cardiovascular disease in a cohort of patients at particularly high risk. We advocate the need for further study to determine the role of metformin in patients with severe renal disease (chronic kidney disease stage 4–5), as well as patients on dialysis, or pre-/peri-renal transplantation. We explore possible roles of metformin in these circumstances, and suggest potential key areas for further study.

### Monitoring of hemodialysis quality-of-care indicators: why is it important? [^113V45vh]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Intradialytic hypotension management

The percentage of dialysis sessions with intradialytic hypotension (IDH) remained low during the study period, around 12%. Mortality in patients with frequent IDH is significantly higher than in those without such events, but after adjustment for covariates, this association loses significance. Thus, IDH may represent a marker of comorbid conditions. Our in-center dialysis study failed to demonstrate a substantial improvement for this indicator, despite many measures systematically followed to improve hemodynamic instability, perhaps because it was already very low. The dry weight was assessed by clinical examination with the help of bioimpedance measurements, using the BCM. We checked in those patients with frequent IDH that sodium restriction and timing of antihypertensive agents were well respected. More than 90% of the patients during the study period were treated with isothermic dialysis, that was shown to improve hemodynamic instability, as well as dialysis at cooler dialysate temperatures. The percentage of patients on on-line post-dilution hemodiafiltration increased during the study. This convective technique was associated with a significant reduction of hypotensive episodes, predominantly related to decreased body temperature. In the EBPG guidelines on hemodynamic instability, convective techniques are a possible alternative to cool dialysis. If these treatment options have failed, other available therapies are suggested: midodrine (level 1 evidence), blood volume controlled ultrafiltration, use of a dialysate calcium of 1.5 mmol/l, prolongation of dialysis time or increase in dialysis frequency (level 2 evidences), L-carnitine supplementation, and/or bicarbonate dialysis (level 3 evidences).

The importance of quality-of-care indicators is well established. Some indicators, as defined by international guidelines, rely on a solid scientific basis with clear associations with outcomes (hemoglobin, albumin, dialysis dose, vascular access). Nevertheless, the clinical advantage of meeting multiple treatment targets simultaneously remains to be established. In addition cost/benefit evaluations of each indicator, and especially of strategies based on multiple quality-of-care indicators should be performed. In hemodialysis patients, the association between several indicators, such as phosphate, BP or BMI, and mortality is characterized by a J-shaped curve. In this context, which quality-of-care indicator should be prioritized may be a matter of debate. In addition, regarding several routinely measured parameters, such as 25OHvitaminD or β2-microglobulin, evidence for specific targets and guidelines are lacking, suggesting that locally determined targets may be useful before RCTs and evidence-based guidelines are available.

### A practical guide for the care of patients with end-stage renal disease near the end of life [^114qHU1X]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Most patients who rely on dialysis for treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) never receive a kidney transplant. Therefore, it is important for nephrology providers to feel comfortable discussing the role of dialysis near the end of life (EOL). Advance care planning (ACP) is an ongoing process of learning patient values and goals in an effort to outline preferences for current and future care. This review presents a framework for how to incorporate ACP in the care of dialysis patients throughout the kidney disease course and at the EOL. Early ACP is useful for all dialysis patients and should ideally begin in the absence of clinical setbacks. Check-in conversations can be used to continue longitudinal discussions with patients and identify opportunities for symptom management and support. Lastly, triggered ACP is useful to clarify care preferences for patients with worsening clinical status. Practical tools include prognostication models to identify patients at risk for decline; ACP documents to operationalize patient care preferences; and communication guidance for engaging in these important conversations. Interdisciplinary teams with expertise from social work, palliative care, and hospice can be helpful at various stages and are discussed here.

### Management of hepatorenal syndrome and associated outcomes: a systematic reviews [^111aV9v3]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a multiorgan condition of acute kidney injury, is seen in advanced liver disease. This study aims to evaluate the current treatment for HRS.

Methods

The authors searched PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar literature. After quality assessment, 31 studies were included in this review. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology and the population, intervention, comparison and outcome scheme were used. We included human-controlled trials that evaluate the current treatment for HRS. Two authors independently screened articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies.

Results

This study investigated the studies conducted on the effects of different treatments on follow-up of HRS patients. We gathered 440 articles, so 31 articles remained in our study. Of which 24 articles were conducted on terlipressin versus placebo or other treatments (midodrine/octreotide, norepinephrine, etc) that showed the higher rate of HRS reversal was detected for terlipressin in 17 studies (10 of them were significant), 2 studies achieved an insignificant lower rate of the model for end-stage liver disease score for terlipressin, 15 studies showed a decreased mortality rate in the terlipressin group (4 of them were significant).

Conclusion

This review showed that terlipressin has a significantly higher reversal rate of HRS than the other treatments. Even the results showed that terlipressin is more efficient than midodrine/octreotide and norepinephrine as a previous medication, in reverse HRS, increasing patient survival.

### Treatment of severe intradialytic hypotension with the addition of high dialysate calcium concentration to midodrine and / or cool dialysate [^114Px6Ei]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment of intradialytic hypotension (IDH) in the end-stage renal disease population has been a difficult task for nephrologists caring for these patients. The presence of multiple pathogenic factors contributes to hemodynamic instability and explains why therapies that modulate only a specific aspect of the problem are only partially effective. Cool dialysate (34.5 degrees C to 35.5 degrees C) and midodrine may provide hemodynamic stability through an increase in peripheral vascular resistance, whereas high dialysate calcium concentration (HDCa; 3.5 mEq/L) improves intradialytic blood pressure through preservation of cardiac output. Theoretically, the combination of these two types of therapies might further reduce the frequency and severity of hypotension during hemodialysis (HD). We undertook a study to evaluate the effect of HDCa added to midodrine and/or cool dialysate in the treatment of patients with severe IDH. Twenty-eight patients met the entry criteria, and 23 patients completed the prospective crossover study. Five patients dropped out of the study secondary to hypercalcemia. The addition of HDCa significantly improved post-HD mean arterial pressure (MAP; 95.6 ± 12.7 versus 90.8 ± 12.5 mm Hg; P = 0.002). The decreases in MAP from pre-HD to lowest intradialytic (16.3 ± 8.2 versus 20.6 ± 10.0 mm Hg; P = 0.009) and pre-HD to post-HD (2.0 ± 8.5 versus 8.15 ± 10.8 mm Hg; P = 0.002) were significantly reduced with HDCa compared with low dialysate calcium. However, there were no significant improvements in symptoms of or interventions for IDH. Thus, it appears that the addition of HDCa to midodrine and/or cool dialysate further improves blood pressure in patients with IDH. However, this therapy did not reduce symptoms or interventions required for IDH. In addition, hypercalcemia complicated this therapy in 22% of the patients.

### Impact of drugs on intradialytic hypotension: antihypertensives and vasoconstrictors [^112HQeG7]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a common complication of hemodialysis and is associated with numerous adverse outcomes including cardiovascular events, inadequate dialysis, loss of vascular access, and death. It is estimated that approximately 20%-30% of all dialysis sessions are affected by IDH. In seeking ways to reduce the occurrence of IDH, dialysis providers often turn to pharmacological approaches: withholding antihypertensive medications prior to hemodialysis or administering vasoconstrictor medications. This review will focus on what is known about the relation between antihypertensive medications and IDH, and summarize studies that have examined the efficacy of vasoconstrictor medications on IDH, including midodrine, arginine vasopressin, and droxidopa. However, there is currently scant evidence that any pharmacological approach is particularly effective in reducing IDH. Additional studies of potential treatments for IDH are needed, and should examine not only hemodynamic effects such as changes in nadir blood pressure during dialysis, but also on patient-centered and clinical outcomes such as symptoms of IDH, quality of life, and cardiovascular events.

### Midodrine in patients with cirrhosis and refractory or recurrent ascites: a randomized pilot study [^11592V8c]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Splanchnic arterial vasodilatation plays an important role in cirrhotic ascites. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long term administration of midodrine on systemic hemodynamics, renal function, and control of ascites in patients with cirrhosis and refractory or recurrent ascites.

Methods

Forty cirrhotic patients with refractory or recurrent ascites were prospectively studied after long term administration of midodrine plus standard medical therapy (n = 20) or standard medical therapy alone (n = 20) in a randomized controlled trial at a tertiary centre.

Results

A significant increase in urinary volume, urinary sodium excretion, mean arterial pressure, and decrease in plasma renin activity (p < 0.05) was noted after 1 month of midodrine administration. There was also a significant decrease in cardiac output and an increase in systemic vascular resistance after midodrine therapy at 3 months (p < 0.05). There was no change in glomerular filtration rate and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Midodrine plus standard medical therapy was significantly superior to standard medical therapy alone in the control of ascites (p = 0.013) at 3 months. The mortality rate in the standard medical therapy group was significantly higher than the midodrine group (p < 0.046). There was no significant difference in the frequency of various complications at the end of follow-up.

Conclusions

The results of this randomized pilot study suggest that midodrine plus standard medical therapy improves the systemic hemodynamics without any renal or hepatic dysfunction in these patients and is superior to standard medical therapy alone for the control of ascites.

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^113B113z]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Midodrine has previously been evaluated in a series of prospective trials for orthostatic hypotension. Jankovic et al. found a dose of 10 mg three times daily (TDS) increased standing systolic blood pressure by 22 mmHg versus placebo. Wright et al. conducted a dose response study and found that midodrine (10 mg and 20 mg) increased standing blood pressure compared with placebo.

Midodrine has also been studied in the setting of dialysis-induced hypotension, and administration of 2.5–10 mg prior to dialysis improved the symptoms of intradialytic hypotension and increased post-dialysis systolic blood pressure.

In the critical care environment, the authors have obtained an Investigational New Drug (IND) approval from the United States FDA (IND 113,330; date of receipt: September 12, 2011) to study its effects in patients who require low dose IV vasopressors following resuscitation. We then conducted an observational study on the use of oral midodrine to hasten weaning of IV vasopressors in a cohort of surgical ICU patients. In this prospective observational study, 20 patients who met surgical ICU discharge criteria except for persistent requirement for IV vasopressors (phenylephrine < 150 mcg/min or noradrenaline < 8 mcg/min) received oral midodrine (modal dose 20 mg, range 5–20 mg) TDS. Requirements for IV vasopressors were assessed following each of the first four doses of midodrine. The rates of decline of vasopressor requirement in the 12 h preceding midodrine, and from initiation of midodrine until 4 h post the fourth dose were calculated. 6 of 20 study patients were able to be weaned from vasopressors following the first dose of midodrine, increasing to 14 of 20 following the fourth dose. The rate of decline in vasopressor requirements increased from 0.62 mcg/min per hour to 2.20 mcg/min per hour (p = 0.012), meaning less IV vasopressor was required. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and total body fluid balance were not significantly different pre and post midodrine administration, suggesting that changes in hemodynamic status or fluid resuscitation were not responsible for the change in the rate of decline in vasopressor requirements.

Adult acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure — vasoconstrictor agents with albumin in the absence of liver transplantation are noted as follows: vasoconstrictor agents combined with albumin remain a common intervention, and patients receiving terlipressin are more likely to survive than those receiving placebo; however, the available evidence is insufficient to recommend it over other vasoconstrictors (norepinephrine or the combination of midodrine and octreotide).

### Midodrine for severe orthostatic hypotension [^115PzuNH]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

Midodrine (Bramox-Brancaster Pharma Limited) was authorised in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in March 2015 for "the treatment of severe orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction in adults when corrective factors have been ruled out and other forms of treatment are inadequate".(1) Previously, midodrine had only been available in the UK as an unlicensed product used on a named-patient basis. It is the first drug to be licensed in the UK for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension. Here we consider the evidence for midodrine in the treatment of severe orthostatic hypotension and how it fits with current management strategies.

### Midodrine in end-stage heart failure [^1158KLS4]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2023). High credibility.

It is estimated that 5% of patients with heart failure (HF) will progress to end-stage disease refractory to medical therapy and might require prolonged hospitalisation with inotropic support. We present the case of a patient with end-stage HF who was admitted with cardiogenic shock. During his hospitalisation, he required prolonged intravenous vasopressor therapy due to refractory hypotension. He did not qualify for heart transplantation or left ventricular-assist device strategies. Midodrine was started as a last resort attempt to wean off vasopressors. After 5 days of therapy, the patient was weaned entirely off vasopressors and was discharged home for hospice care. By the time of discharge, he was tolerating low-dose carvedilol along with midodrine. We propose midodrine as a reasonable alternative for patients with end-stage HF with reduced ejection fraction and refractory hypotension, who are dependent on intravenous vasoactive drugs and are not candidates for advanced HF therapies.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^111dKZxR]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Midodrine

Midodrine is a prodrug whose metabolite, desglymidodrine, is an α 1-adrenoreceptor agonist that increases vascular resistance and blood pressure. Typical dosing is between 2.5 and 15 mg once to three times daily during waking hours (an example schedule of three times daily would be dosing prior to getting out of bed, before lunch, and mid-afternoon). The dose is typically up-titrated to symptomatic relief. In multiple clinical trials, midodrine resulted in a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as modest improvements in orthostatic symptoms. Midodrine carries a risk of significant supine hypertension; so it is recommended that individuals not take midodrine within 5 h of bedtime. A high supine blood pressure seen shortly after midodrine administration should not cause the drug dose to be decreased or stopped, but managed by avoiding the supine posture. A meta-analysis of seven trials with midodrine (325 total subjects) found an increased incidence of supine hypertension and that the pooled risk ratio was 6.38; however, it is worth re-stressing that patients treated with midodrine should not rest or sleep in the supine position; rather, recumbency should always be assumed in the head-up position. Other side effects with midodrine include piloerection, scalp itching, and urinary retention. Caution should also be exercised in patients with congestive heart failure and chronic renal failure.

### Exaggerated blood pressure response to dynamic exercise despite chronic refractory hypotension: results of a human case study [^116KMqyD]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic refractory hypotension (inter-dialytic systolic blood pressure, SBP < 100 mmHg) in long-term dialysis patients is a rare but serious problem. Sustained hypotension between dialysis sessions occurs in 5–10% and is associated with poor outcomes, including increased mortality. These patients are often deemed unfit for surgery including renal transplant.

Proposed mechanisms focus on inadequate cardiovascular response because of autonomic dysfunction and reduced vascular response to vasopressors. These patients have high levels of circulating noradrenaline but reduced alpha-adrenoreceptor density, which is associated with a blunted pressor response. Reduced sympathetic nerve discharge due to the loss of renal afferent nerve endings is a major causative factor for persistent hypotension in anephric patients. Post-dialysis reduced plasma concentrations of chromogranin A (a protein co-released with cathecholamines) are seen compared to normotensive patients, consistent with blunted sympathetic response. Interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels have been shown to correlate with mean arterial pressure in hypotensive patients during haemodialysis suggesting an inflammatory role.

Current treatment strategies rely on intravascular volume monitoring, alterations in dialysate composition and vasoconstricting drugs. However, there is no definitive management presently. Midodrine and vasopressin therapy have been shown to be effective only in some patients. The most promising technologies are those capable of real-time monitoring of dialysis composition, ultrafiltration rate and temperature and adjust accordingly minute by minute. The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, bicarbonate and magnesium have all been shown to alter the risk of hypotension during dialysis. Sodium levels appear to have the most significant effect; dialysates with higher sodium concentrations may reduce rates of hypotension during dialysis. Ultrafiltration is associated with a rise in core body temperature secondary to complex autonomic mechanisms; the central response to this is vasodilation. Thus, cooling dialysate from 37 °C to 35° has been shown to maintain intra-dialytic blood pressure (BP) in a number of patients.

Although the proposed mechanisms above highlight the hyporesponsiveness of the efferent or afferent sympathetic receptors in causing refractory hypotension, it remains uncertain if stimulation of the skeletal chemosensitive or mechano-receptors through dynamic exercise could modulate haemodynamics in these patients. We present a case of severe chronic hypotension who underwent dynamic exercise testing before and after renal transplantation, with marked differences in blood pressure response to exercise.

### Evaluation of effect of cooled haemodialysis on cognition in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ECHECKED) feasibility randomised controlled trial results [^116mhBVB]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

These lessons will be applied in designing the definitive trial assessing the impact of low temperature dialysis on cognition. This will include using a language-neutral cognitive function battery, namely Cogstate, as the primary outcome measure which will allow inclusion of non-English speaking patients, as well as using translators. Cognitive assessment will be incorporated into dialysis visits to aid recruitment and retention of participants, recognising this will need to be performed pre-dialysis or within the first hour of dialysis as there is a transient intradialytic decline in cognitive function towards the later part of a HD session. Service users will be consulted in future study protocol design to ensure acceptability and accessibility, and increase representativeness of a future study population. Continuous BP monitoring during dialysis will be considered to assess the role of asymptomatic hypotension in CI in HD. We will also collect data on residual kidney function in the form of urine output and consider measuring protein-bound toxins to assess if they could be mediators of a potential observed effect of cooled haemodialysis on cognition in the future study. Data on parameters that can affect IDH (UF rate, UF profiling, sodium profiling and use of medications that affect BP such as midodrine, prior or during dialysis, will be collected. Parameters that are routinely measured - e.g. interdialytic weight gain, UF rate and volume, dialysate temperature, biochemical test results, etc. - will be downloaded from HD machines or electronic patient records (EPR). These, the integration of the trial system and the EPR and linkage with the national dialysis registry for outcome data will streamline the process of the future RCT.

Dopamine compared with midodrine/octreotide

Angeli et al evaluated the effects of midodrine (7.5 to 12.5 mg orally/three times per day) and octreotide (100–200 µg subcutaneous/three times per day) compared with dopamine (2–4 µg/kg/min) on HRS types 1 and 2 patients. Mortality at the month of the follow-up was lower in the midodrine/octreotide group. This study did not report MELD score, duration of therapy and HRS reversal.

Midodrine and octreotide

Pomier-Layrargues et al administered octreotide 50 µg/hour intravenous for 4 days on HRS types 1 and 2 patients and the placebo in the second group. The HRS reversal rate was 42.8% in the first vs 33.3% in the second group (p > 0.05). After 4 days of follow-up, mortality was 28.5% in the first group compared with 55.5% in the second group (p value not provided). MELD scores were not provided in this study.

Pentoxifylline and midodrine/octreotide

Stine et al studied the effects of pentoxifylline (PTX) (400 mg hree times per day) or placebo with midodrine and octreotide therapy over 14 days on HRS 1 patients. HRS recovery was about 16.6% in both groups (p = 1.000). Mortality after 6 months was 50.0% compared with 83.3% in the control patients (p = 0.221). The MELD scores in the treatment and control groups were 26.0 and 27.0, respectively (p = 0.042).

The molecular adsorbent recirculating system

Molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) is a modified dialysis method using an albumin-containing dialysate. Mitzner et al estimated the MARS group at 6–8 hours, 5.2 ± 3.6 treatments per HRS 1 patient daily. Significant reductions in bilirubin and creatinine levels, increases in sodium levels and prothrombin activity were seen in the MARS patients. Mortality was 100% on day 7 in the control, 62.5% on the end of the first week and 75.0% on day 30 in the MARS group (p < 0.01).

### Midodrine hydrochloride [^115M3kvq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Midodrine hydrochloride should be used cautiously in patients with urinary retention problems, as desglymidodrine acts on the alpha-adrenergic receptors of the bladder neck.

Midodrine hydrochloride should be used with caution in orthostatic hypotensive patients who are also diabetic, as well as those with a history of visual problems who are also taking fludrocortisone acetate, which is known to cause an increase in intraocular pressure and glaucoma.

Midodrine hydrochloride use has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Because desglymidodrine is eliminated via the kidneys, and higher blood levels would be expected in such patients, Midodrine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment, with a starting dose of 2.5 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Renal function should be assessed prior to initial use of Midodrine hydrochloride.

Midodrine hydrochloride use has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Midodrine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, as the liver has a role in the metabolism of midodrine.

Information for Patients: Patients should be told that certain agents in over-the-counter products, such as cold remedies and diet aids, can elevate blood pressure, and therefore, should be used cautiously with Midodrine hydrochloride, as they may enhance or potentiate the pressor effects of Midodrine hydrochloride (see Drug Interactions). Patients should also be made aware of the possibility of supine hypertension. They should be told to avoid taking their dose if they are to be supine for any length of time, i.e., they should take their last daily dose of Midodrine hydrochloride 3 to 4 hours before bedtime to minimize nighttime supine hypertension.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^116zS7hq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome–acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI) vasoconstrictor therapy — norepinephrine dosing and comparative efficacy are specified as follows: Norepinephrine is administered in a starting dose of 0.5 mg/h with dose increases every 4 hours by 0.5 mg/h to a maximum of 3 mg/h, targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 10 mm Hg or urine output > 50 mL/h for at least 4 hours; terlipressin was superior to norepinephrine. The combination of midodrine and octreotide works very slowly but reversal of HRS is possible; octreotide alone is ineffective and the combination is inferior to terlipressin in improving renal function or HRS reversal. Norepinephrine infusion outside the intensive care unit (ICU) was found to be safe in a small feasibility study, although ischemic complications, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory side effects may occur.

### Fludrocortisone is associated with a higher risk of all-cause hospitalizations compared with midodrine in patients with orthostatic hypotension [^112tWRCF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Retrospective Cohort

Potential cohort members entered the cohort at the earliest date when the following criteria were met: (1) a prescription filled for midodrine and/or fludrocortisone, identified using pharmacy files; (2) a coded healthcare encounter for OH (International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision, Clinical Modification: 458.0, 458.1, 458.9, 333.0); (3) age 40 years or older; (4) have at least 180 prior days of continuous enrollment in TennCare (baseline); and (5) have at least 1 or more prescriptions filled during this baseline period to assure access to medication benefits. Since OH affects mostly elderly individuals, we restricted the age group to 40 and older to avoid a younger group of patients, such as those with postural tachycardia syndrome, who are usually prescribed similar drugs. We excluded patients with baseline diagnoses for conditions that have the potential to produce acute and transient OH and patients with established serious life‐threatening diseases identified during baseline, including solid organ transplantation, end‐stage renal disease, and hemodialysis as previously described. 4 Since fludrocortisone is indicated as the partial replacement therapy for primary and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency in Addison's disease and for the treatment of salt‐losing adrenogenital syndrome, we also excluded patients with those conditions.

New episodes of either midodrine or fludrocortisone use began on the date of the earliest prescription for either of these medications without use of either of those drugs during the prior 180 days. Follow‐up began on that date (t 0) and continued through the earliest of the following dates: death, loss of enrollment, study outcome, end of the study, date of transplant of end‐stage renal disease/hemodialysis or the fill of a different OH medication. Patients initiating both OH drugs simultaneously were excluded from this assessment. Patients who left the cohort could subsequently re‐enter and contribute to new episodes of medication use if they fulfilled all selection criteria again.

### Vasodilator use in precapillary pulmonary hypertension with end stage kidney disease: a single center experience [^116y6ac8]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Pulmonary hypertension is commonly seen in end stage kidney disease and is most commonly due to elevated left heart pressures. There is limited data about vasodilator use during the management of Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension in the context of those who also have or later developed end stage kidney disease. The objective of this study was to determine safety and efficacy of vasodilator therapy in precapillary pulmonary hypertension requiring renal replacement therapy.

Design

This was a single-center retrospective case series. Patients were identified from our Pulmonary Hypertension Clinic using a historical roster from 2012 to 2020. Patients were included if they > 18 years of age, had Group 1 or Group 4 (precapillary) pulmonary hypertension on right heart catheterization, and also had end stage kidney disease requiring either intermittent hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

Results

18 patients were identified with invasively confirmed Group 1 or Group 4 pulmonary hypertension and end stage kidney disease on renal replacement therapy. Scleroderma was the most common etiology for renal failure. 17 patients were treated with vasodilator therapy. Fifteen patients had paired right heart catheterizations that showed a significant decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. Therapy was relatively well tolerated but hypotension was common and midodrine was often helpful. Two patients had successful renal transplantation after starting vasodilator therapy.

Conclusion

We found vasodilator therapy was reasonably well tolerated and associated with a drop in mean pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with end stage kidney disease on dialysis.

### Midodrine hydrochloride (midodrine HCl) [^115iP1gX]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended dose of midodrine hydrochloride tablets is 10 mg, 3 times daily. Dosing should take place during the daytime hours when the patient needs to be upright, pursuing the activities of daily living. A suggested dosing schedule of approximately 4-hour intervals is as follows: shortly before or upon arising in the morning, midday and late afternoon (not later than 6 P.M.). Doses may be given in 3-hour intervals, if required, to control symptoms, but not more frequently.

Single doses as high as 20 mg have been given to patients, but severe and persistent systolic supine hypertension occurs at a high rate (about 45%) at this dose. In order to reduce the potential for supine hypertension during sleep, midodrine hydrochloride tablets should not be given after the evening meal or less than 4 hours before bedtime. Total daily doses greater than 30 mg have been tolerated by some patients, but their safety and usefulness have not been studied systematically or established. Because of the risk of supine hypertension, midodrine hydrochloride tablets should be continued only in patients who appear to attain symptomatic improvement during initial treatment.

The supine and standing blood pressure should be monitored regularly and the administration of midodrine hydrochloride tablets should be stopped if supine blood pressure increases excessively.

Because desglymidodrine is excreted renally, dosing in patients with abnormal renal function should be cautious; although this has not been systematically studied, it is recommended that treatment of these patients be initiated using 2.5 mg doses.

Dosing in children has not been adequately studied.

Blood levels of midodrine and desglymidodrine were similar when comparing levels in patients 65 or older vs. younger than 65 and when comparing males vs. females, suggesting dose modifications for these groups are not necessary.

### Pharmacologic options available to treat symptomatic intradialytic hypotension [^1159vAZb]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment of symptomatic intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a difficult task for the practicing nephrologist. Minimizing patient factors that precipitate IDH as well as dialysis procedure-related components that lower blood pressure are the initial approaches to this problem. However, despite these maneuvers, hypotension often persists in a group of high-risk patients. Pharmacologic interventions are often used to reduce IDH. Unfortunately, many of the available therapies are marginally effective and/or poorly tolerated. A few therapies appear to be efficacious and well tolerated-carnitine, sertraline, and midodrine. This article reviews the various pharmacologic therapies used for IDH and makes recommendations for treatment of this difficult problem.

### Is there a role for proteomics in diabetic renal disease? [^113UaBfW]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The burden of DKD is expected to continue to increase in parallel with rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity, coupled with the decline in competing mortality from cardiovascular disease as a result of more effective therapies. Most patients with DKD do not undergo renal biopsy and diagnosis is generally based on clinical parameters, namely presence of diabetes, features of kidney disease including reduced renal excretory function and/or albuminuria, and absence of other kidney disease. However, this pragmatic clinical approach is associated with some uncertainties. Biopsy studies in people with diabetes have shown that approximately two-thirds of patients have superimposed DKD or non-DKD alone and are thereby potentially mismanaged. We know that only a small proportion of patients with diabetes will develop DKD; moreover, the natural history of the disease is evolving. For example, a considerable number of patients develop renal failure without progressing through micro- and macroalbuminuric stages, supporting the concept of non-albuminuric DKD; in addition, patients with microalbuminuria can regress to normoalbuminuria. Histological damage can, however, be present already at microalbuminuric stages.

DKD is a complex and multifactorial condition determined by genetic susceptibility and interaction with environmental factors including glycaemic control, blood pressure and other risk factors such as smoking and use of nephrotoxic medication. Therefore, the prediction of an individual's likelihood to develop DKD, to progress rapidly to ESRD and to respond to treatment can only be estimated based on features that are thought to play a universal role in the pathogenesis of DKD. It is unlikely that therapies which target all pathogenetic principles simultaneously will ever be available, and personalized approaches to DKD management are therefore warranted. However, we do not currently have the evidence base and the tools to describe individual patients' disease signature in a manner comparable to rapidly progressing forms of glomerulonephritis, vasculitis or in patients receiving renal transplants where immune diagnostics and molecular pathology inform patient management.

### Management of blood pressure in adults, children and young people on dialysis: UK kidney association clinical practice guideline [^115jQ7Po]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that dialysis patients may omit prescribed antihypertensives prior to haemodialysis sessions, either on advice of healthcare professionals or by their own decision. We were unable to find evidence to support this practice. However, it is reasonable to assume that, where a person takes one or more antihypertensive medications early in the morning on 4 days of the week and 6 or more hours later than this on the remaining 3 days, this may increase BP variability. Observational studies have established increased short- and long-term BP variability as independent predictors of all-cause and CV mortality and major adverse CV events in people on haemodialysis. Considering that the TIME study found that evening dosing of antihypertensive medication did not differ from morning dosing in terms of major CV outcomes in the general population, we suggest that clinicians discourage omission of antihypertensives prior to dialysis sessions and instead encourage consistent night-time dosing of antihypertensive medication in those patients for whom such medication is thought to be contributory to IDH. We acknowledge that the efficacy of this approach should be tested in a clinical trial.

We found limited evidence to support pharmacological approaches to management of IDH. Evidence to support the use of midodrine is inconclusive. A meta-analysis, published in 2004, included 10 studies with 117 participants and reported nadir BP 13.3/5.9 mmHg higher in those receiving midodrine, but no consistent benefit in terms of symptom reduction. All included studies had significant methodological flaws (e.g. none were of parallel group design) and were subjective to substantial risk of bias. A retrospective cohort study of 3083 patients, albeit not necessarily with confirmed IDH and subject to confounding by indication, found an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 1.37, 1.31 and 1.41 for all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalization and hospitalization for CV causes respectively for those prescribed midodrine vs. controls.

### Management of lipid abnormalities associated with end-stage renal disease [^1145kkn7]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

The management of lipid abnormalities in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) remains controversial. Large, well-designed studies investigating the effects of dyslipidemia on cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality and the role of cholesterol lowering drugs in reducing mortality in ESRD patients are lacking. While it seems reasonable to suspect that dyslipidemia and its treatment in ESRD patients will affect CV morbidity and mortality similar to that in the general population, recent studies have suggested that this may not be the case. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of lipid lowering drugs are altered in patients with ESRD and must be considered when treating this group of patients. This article reviews the major classes of drugs used to treat dyslipidemia, emphasizing their role in patients with ESRD.

### Midodrine appears to be safe and effective for dialysis-induced hypotension: a systematic review [^111iQ4JR]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Dialysis-induced hypotension is an important complication of haemodialysis. Midodrine is an oral alpha-1 agonist that has been used in several small studies to prevent intradialytic hypotension (IDH).

Methods

The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, ASN conference proceedings, and references of potentially relevant articles, and contacted industry (Shire Pharmaceuticals) for unpublished data. Observational studies, randomized controlled trials, crossover studies and pre- and post-intervention design studies with ≥ 5 haemodialysis patients were included. Study outcomes assessed were: hypotensive symptoms, changes in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure, dry weight and length of stay after treatment. Data were abstracted on: study design, patient characteristics, intradialytic changes in blood pressure, nadir blood pressure and symptom improvement with midodrine. Thirty-seven full text articles were retrieved and nine met the selection criteria, in addition to one unpublished study. Midodrine dosing regimens ranged from 2.5 to 10 mg of midodrine given 15–30 min before dialysis.

Results

Post-dialysis systolic blood pressure was higher by 12.4 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.5–17.7] and diastolic pressure was higher by 7.3 mmHg (95% CI 3.7–10.9) during midodrine treatment vs control. Likewise, the nadir systolic blood pressure was higher by 13.3 mmHg (95% CI 8.6–18.0), with a difference in nadir diastolic pressure of 5.9 mmHg (95% CI 2.7–9.1). Six of 10 studies report improvement in symptoms of IDH, and there were no reported serious adverse events ascribed to midodrine.

Conclusions

This systematic review would suggest that midodrine has a role in the therapy of haemodialysis patients experiencing IDH. This conclusion must be viewed with caution, however, given the quality and sample size of the studies included in this review.

### The impact of midodrine on outcomes in patients with intradialytic hypotension [^1112zuaF]. American Journal of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a frequent complication of hemodialysis, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Off-label use of the alpha-1 andrenergic receptor agonist midodrine to reduce the frequency and severity of IDH is common. However, limited data exist to support this practice. This study sought to examine real-world efficacy of midodrine with respect to relevant clinical and hemodynamic outcomes.

Methods

Here, we compared a variety of clinical and hemodynamic outcomes among adult patients who were prescribed midodrine (n = 1,046) and matched controls (n = 2,037), all of whom were receiving in-center hemodialysis treatment at dialysis facilities in the United States (July 2015 - September 2016). Mortality, all-cause hospitalization, cardiovascular hospitalization, and hemodynamic outcomes were considered from the month following the initiation of midodrine (or corresponding month for controls) until censoring for discontinuation of dialysis, transplant, loss to follow-up, or study end (September 30, 2016). Rate outcomes were compared using Poisson models and quantitative outcomes using linear mixed models; all models were adjusted for imbalanced patient characteristics.

Results

Compared to non-use, midodrine use was associated with higher rates of death (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.15–1.62), all-cause hospitalization (1.31, 1.19–1.43) and cardiovascular hospitalization (1.41, 1.17–1.71). During follow-up, midodrine use tended to be associated with lower pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure (SBP), lower nadir SBP, greater fall in SBP during dialysis, and a greater proportion of treatments affected by IDH.

Conclusion

Although residual confounding may have influenced the results, the associations observed here are not consistent with a potent beneficial effect of midodrine with respect to either clinical or hemodynamic outcomes.

### Midodrine hydrochloride (midodrine HCl) [^11192smG]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should be told that certain agents in over-the-counter products, such as cold remedies and diet aids, can elevate blood pressure and therefore, should be used cautiously with midodrine hydrochloride, as they may enhance or potentiate the pressor effects of midodrine hydrochloride (see Drug Interactions). Patients should also be made aware of the possibility of supine hypertension. They should be told to avoid taking their dose if they are to be supine for any length of time, i.e., they should take their last daily dose of midodrine hydrochloride 3 to 4 hours before bedtime to minimize nighttime supine hypertension.

Laboratory Tests

Since desglymidodrine is eliminated by the kidneys and the liver has a role in its metabolism, evaluation of the patient should include assessment of renal and hepatic function prior to initiating therapy and subsequently, as appropriate.

Drug Interactions

When administered concomitantly with midodrine hydrochloride, cardiac glycosides may enhance or precipitate bradycardia, A.V. block or arrhythmia.

The use of drugs that stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors (e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine or dihydroergotamine) may enhance or potentiate the pressor effects of midodrine hydrochloride. Therefore, caution should be used when midodrine hydrochloride is administered concomitantly with agents that cause vasoconstriction.

Midodrine hydrochloride has been used in patients concomitantly treated with salt-retaining steroid therapy (i.e., fludrocortisone acetate), with or without salt supplementation. The potential for supine hypertension should be carefully monitored in these patients and may be minimized by either reducing the dose of fludrocortisone acetate or decreasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with midodrine hydrochloride. Alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, such as prazosin, terazosin and doxazosin, can antagonize the effects of midodrine hydrochloride.

Potential for Drug Interaction

It appears possible, although there is no supporting experimental evidence, that the high renal clearance of desglymidodrine (a base) is due to active tubular secretion by the base-secreting system also responsible for the secretion of such drugs as metformin, cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, triamterene, flecainide and quinidine. Thus there may be a potential for drug-drug interaction with these drugs.

Norepinephrine

Norepinephrine is a catecholamine with a predominantly alpha-adrenergic effect, causing vasoconstriction with limited effects on myocardial contractility. In the setting of HRS-AKI, this corrects the low systemic vascular resistance closely associated with the condition. Despite being a potent renal vasoconstrictor, the increase in systemic blood pressure when using therapeutic doses generates a decrease in the renal vessel vasoconstrictor stimulation, thus improving renal blood flow and GFR. Norepinephrine is recommended at doses of 0.5–3.0 mg/h combined with albumin, with the aim of increasing MAP by at least 10 mm Hg.

In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating vasoactive drugs for the treatment of HRS-AKI, there were no significant differences in reversal rate or survival. The use of terlipressin signiﬁcantly increased the risk of all adverse events compared with norepinephrine. However, terlipressin induced fewer ischaemic adverse events than norepinephrine, and in patients with HRS-AKI in the context of ACLF, infusion of terlipressin had an earlier and more robust response than norepinephrine, with improved survival in ACLF patients with HRS-AKI.

Midodrine and octreotide

Other vasoconstrictor agents, such as somatostatin analogues (octreotide) and midodrine, an α adrenergic agonist, have also been studied. Prior evidence have found that the combined use of midodrine, octreotide and albumin improves systemic haemodynamic status, GFR and urinary sodium excretion. Also, a retrospective study in China, involving 60 patients with HRS-AKI, demonstrated that the concurrent administration of midodrine and octreotide could reduce mortality. However, a clinical trial conducted in Italy, involving 44 patients who were randomised to receive either terlipressin with albumin or midodrine and octreotide plus albumin, discovered a higher rate of renal function recovery when using terlipressin compared with midodrine and octreotide (70.4% vs 28.6%, p = 0.01). Due to the heterogeneity of the studies and the limited number of trials conducted, further trials are needed to draw a more precise conclusion regarding the use of octreotide and midodrine in this scenario. Midodrine is typically prescribed at an initial oral dose of 7.5 mg every 8 hours (maximum: 15 mg every 8 hours), along with a continuous infusion of octreotide at a rate of 50 mcg/h or subcutaneous administration of 100–200 μg every 8 hours.

Hemodialysis residual kidney function — hemodynamic management and diuretics: Episodes of intravascular volume depletion that frequently result in hypotension should be minimized and measures to maintain hemodynamic stability should be routine, with strategies to minimize hypotension during HD including avoidance of excessive ultrafiltration, maintaining the target hematocrit, reduction in dialysate temperature, increasing dialysate sodium concentration, and possibly administration of an α agonist, such as midodrine; avoidance of hypotension also helps ensure delivery of adequate dialysis and minimize symptoms during HD, and paradoxically, loop diuretics probably benefit HD patients because they reduce the requirement for fluid removal during dialysis.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^111g7Uz6]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Setting 4: Patients Undergoing Kidney Replacement Therapy

Recommendation

Recommendation 7: In patients undergoing kidney replacement therapy, intravenous albumin is not suggested for prevention or treatment of intradialytic hypotension or for improving ultrafiltration (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

Evidence Summary

A single Cochrane systematic review was identified evaluating the use of albumin, compared with an alternative strategy, for the treatment of intradialytic hypotension. The review identified a single (N = 45) randomized crossover trial of 5% albumin compared with normal saline and did not find a difference in the primary outcome (percentage target ultrafiltration achieved) or other clinical outcomes. Two small crossover trials identified in this review evaluated 20% albumin as compared with gelatin (N = 10) and a three-arm study compared 20% albumin with both saline and hydroxyethyl starch (N = 10). These RCTs suggested that BP was maintained better with albumin vs other fluid, but found no improvements in other outcomes, including improving ultrafiltration. Finally, a 2021 randomized crossover trial involving 65 hospitalized patients requiring hemodialysis with serum albumin levels of < 30 g/Lfound that hypotension, lowest intradialytic systolic BP, and ultrafiltration rate were improved with 25% albumin compared with saline.

Rationale for Recommendation

Intradialytic hypotension and fluid overload are experienced commonly during kidney replacement therapy. Patients with intradialytic hypotension are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. Given the costs of albumin, the need for thrice weekly treatment for patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis, and the lack of evidence to support superiority over less costly fluid alternatives, alternative fluids or treatments need to be considered. The annual cost of 25 g of albumin given with thrice-weekly maintenance dialysis is estimated at $20,000 per patient (United States dollars). Midodrine (an oral vasopressor) given alone or in combination with use of a high dialysate calcium concentration and lower dialysate temperature has been explored as a therapeutic option to mitigate intradialytic hypotension. In patients prescribed kidney replacement therapy, higher dialysate calcium, lower dialysate temperature, individualized ultrafiltration rates, or a combination of these strategies may mitigate intradialytic hypotension. Further studies are needed to understand the pathophysiology of intradialytic hypotensionto determine if albumin prevents intradialytic hypotension or improves ultrafiltration, mitigates associated symptoms, or improves patient-important outcomes.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH). Because Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP can cause marked elevation of supine blood pressure (BP > 200 mmHg systolic), it should be used in patients whose lives are considerably impaired despite standard clinical care, including non-pharmacologic treatment (such as support stockings), fluid expansion, and lifestyle alterations. The indication is based on Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP effect on increases in 1-minute standing systolic blood pressure, a surrogate marker considered likely to correspond to a clinical benefit. At present, however, clinical benefits of Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP principally improved ability to perform life activities, have not been established. Further clinical trials are underway to verify and describe the clinical benefits of Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP.

After initiation of treatment, Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP should be continued only for patients who report significant symptomatic improvement.

In a 2-day study, after open-label midodrine, known midodrine responders
received midodrine 10 mg or placebo at 0, 3, and 6 hours. One-minute standing

In a 1-day, dose-response trial, single doses of 0, 2.5, 10, and 20 mg of
midodrine were given to 25 patients. The 10- and 20-mg doses produced increases
in standing 1- minute systolic pressure of about 30 mmHg at 1 hour; the increase
was sustained in part for 2 hours after 10 mg and 4 hours after 20 mg. Supine

### Optimizing anemia management in hospitalized patients with end-stage renal disease [^112bxADA]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review available literature on the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who require hospitalization and to provide recommendations for ESA use in this setting.

Data Sources

Primary articles were identified by English-language MEDLINE search (1966-October 2008) using the MeSH headings: kidney failure (chronic), anemia, erythropoietin, darbepoetin, hospitalization, and hematinics. Relevant data presented at recent nephrology scientific meetings (2004-October 2008) were also identified.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Identified studies were reviewed and information regarding hospitalization, ESA use, and patient outcomes was evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Studies demonstrate that hospitalized patients with ESRD usually experience a decline in hemoglobin values. Contributing factors include infection, inflammation, and untreated iron deficiency. ESAs are used inconsistently during hospitalization, with less than 50% of hospitalized patients with ESRD receiving ESA therapy in some reports. Some controversy exists regarding optimal hemoglobin targets for ESA therapy in nonhospitalized patients with ESRD, and no targets are defined for hospitalized patients. Clinical trials examining in-hospital ESA use have primarily involved the intensive care population and excluded ESRD patients. Following the patient's hospitalization, lower hemoglobin values may persist for 6 months, despite increased ESA dosing. Variability exists in frequency of hemoglobin monitoring and ESA dose changes. To date, no clinical trials have evaluated different approaches to anemia management in hospitalized patients with ESRD, and there are no published guidelines in this area. Based on published observations and clinical experience, we offer recommendations for anemia management around the time of hospitalization in an attempt to define a more rational approach to ESA therapy in this population.

Conclusions

Trials are needed to define optimal ESA dosing strategies and hemoglobin targets in hospitalized patients with ESRD.

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^114g2szL]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

One limitation of this study is the fixed drug dosing. This was selected to simplify the protocol and it was shown to be safe during the pilot study. However, an individualized dose titrated according to renal or hepatic function may allow midodrine to be used in a wider range of patients. A second limitation is we do not have a standardized protocol with regards to blood pressure targets for initiation, escalation, or weaning of IV vasopressors. The different blood pressure goals set by the primary care team may confound the individual duration of vasopressor treatment. A third limitation is that we are not studying the use of this drug on the ward environment, which is another useful indication of midodrine in preventing ICU admission.

Problem

Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major issue for heath care systems both clinically and financially. There are currently over a million patients worldwide on dialysis, with the number increasing by ~7% yearly, particularly in the elderly, many of whom have significant extra-renal comorbidities and will do poorly on dialysis. Furthermore, dialysis is expensive costing ~£30,000 per patient per year in the UK. Given dialysis may not prolong life and may indeed impair quality of life alternative options for these patients such as conservative care are urgently needed.

Orthostatic hypotension pharmacologic therapy — midodrine and fludrocortisone are described with dosing, effects, and supporting evidence: Midodrine is stated to be "a useful addition to the first-line treatment in patients with chronic ANF" and that "midodrine increases BP in both supine and upright posture and that it ameliorates the symptoms of OH"; "Midodrine (5–20 mg, three times daily) has been shown to be effective in three randomized placebo-controlled trials". Fludrocortisone is presented as "Fludrocortisone (0.1–0.3 mg once daily) is a mineralocorticoid that stimulates renal sodium retention and expands fluid volume", with evidence "from two small observational studies (in combination with head-up sleeping) and one double-blind trial in 60 patients", in which treated patients "were less symptomatic with higher blood pressures".

### Midodrine hydrochloride (midodrine HCl) [^112oUJcF]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Midodrine hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH). Because midodrine hydrochloride tablets can cause marked elevation of supine blood pressure (BP > 200 mmHg systolic), it should be used in patients whose lives are considerably impaired despite standard clinical care, including non-pharmacologic treatment (such as support stockings), fluid expansion and lifestyle alterations. The indication is based on midodrine hydrochloride tablet's effect on increases in 1-minute standing systolic blood pressure, a surrogate marker considered likely to correspond to a clinical benefit. At present, however, clinical benefits of midodrine hydrochloride tablets, principally improved ability to perform life activities, have not been established. Further clinical trials are underway to verify and describe the clinical benefits of midodrine hydrochloride tablets.

After initiation of treatment, midodrine hydrochloride tablets should be continued only for patients who report significant symptomatic improvement.

Conclusions

HRS‐AKI is no longer a rare condition given the tremendous increase in the number of patients with advanced liver disease in the United States, and clinicians should be attentive to the development of HRS‐AKI in patients with cirrhosis. Early diagnosis and interventions involving specialists (in particular, nephrologists) are essential to improve outcomes, but HRS‐AKI is often rapidly fatal under any circumstances without effective interventions. LT remains the most effective intervention, but few patients with HRS‐AKI undergo transplantation. RRT is a temporary life‐saving intervention but may ultimately worsen outcomes, especially if implemented for long periods, and increase the risk of renal insufficiency after LT. In terms of pharmacologic therapy, vasoconstriction and plasma expansion are necessary therapeutic interventions. The agent of choice for volume resuscitation is albumin, and judicious use is encouraged. No vasoconstrictors are approved for HRS‐AKI, yet midodrine/octreotide has become the mainstay of therapy despite the lack of evidence of therapeutic efficacy. Terlipressin, approved in Europe for the treatment of HRS‐AKI and supported by recommendations for first‐line therapy by some liver societies and experts around the world, would constitute a beneficial option for many patients with HRS‐AKI were it available in the United States.

### Neurological complications of chronic kidney disease [^1145ezVk]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a critical and rapidly growing global health problem. Neurological complications occur in almost all patients with severe CKD, potentially affecting all levels of the nervous system, from the CNS through to the PNS. Cognitive impairment, manifesting typically as a vascular dementia, develops in a considerable proportion of patients on dialysis, and improves with renal transplantation. Patients on dialysis are generally weaker, less active and have reduced exercise capacity compared with healthy individuals. Peripheral neuropathy manifests in almost all such patients, leading to weakness and disability. Better dialysis strategies and dietary modification could improve outcomes of transplantation if implemented before surgery. For patients with autonomic neuropathy, specific treatments, including sildenafil for impotence and midodrine for intradialytic hypotension, are effective and well tolerated. Exercise training programs and carnitine supplementation might be beneficial for neuromuscular complications, and restless legs syndrome in CKD responds to dopaminergic agonists and levodopa treatment. The present Review dissects the pathophysiology of neurological complications related to CKD and highlights the spectrum of therapies currently available.

Treatment of HRS-AKI — dosing and agents: In conjunction with terlipressin, albumin is infused at a dose of 1 g/kg on day 1 of therapy followed by 40–50 g/day for the duration; ischemic risk with terlipressin may be reduced by continuous IV infusion (start dose 2 mg/day, increased every 24–48 hours up to 12 mg/day until creatinine decreases). Norepinephrine appears to be equally effective to terlipressin and is given as continuous IV infusion starting at 0.5 mg/hour to achieve an increase in mean arterial pressure of at least 10 mm Hg or urine output of > 200 mL/4 hours, with titration up to a maximum of 3 mg/hour if goals are not met. Albumin is also given to maintain a central venous pressure between 4 and 10 mm Hg. The orally active vasoconstrictor midodrine with octreotide is of much lower efficacy than terlipressin, and TIPS is not recommended in patients with AKI-HRS because of insufficient information.

### Hemodynamics in patients with intradialytic hypotension treated with cool dialysate or midodrine [^1144KJdc]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Cool dialysate and midodrine have been used successfully to treat intradialytic hypotension (IDH) in the end-stage renal disease population. However, the exact mechanisms by which these interventions improve hemodynamic stability are not well known. We undertook a study to evaluate the effect of these modalities on intradialytic hemodynamics in patients with documented dialysis-associated hypotension. We used the ultrasound dilution technique to measure cardiac output (CO), central blood volume (CBV), and peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) in these patients. The study was performed in two phases. Phase 1 consisted of control (1A) and cool dialysate (1B) studies, whereas phase 2 consisted of control (2A) and midodrine (2B) studies. CO, CBV, and PVR were measured 30 minutes after the initiation of hemodialysis (HD) and 30 minutes before the termination of HD using the HD01 monitor. Blood pressure was measured pre-HD and post-HD. Fourteen patients with documented IDH completed the study. CO and CBV were significantly more preserved in the cool dialysate and midodrine phases compared with control phases. PVR increased in all phases of the study. Declines in mean arterial pressures from pre-HD to post-HD were less with cool dialysate versus control and midodrine versus control. Ultrafiltration volumes were not significantly different between phases. Cool dialysate and midodrine appear to improve intradialytic hemodynamics in patients with dialysis-associated hypotension, mainly through the preservation of CBV and CO, rather than significantly elevating PVR.

Recommendations for initiating nOH treatment

There have been no head-to-head comparison studies to guide the initial choice of nOH treatments. An individualized treatment regimen should consider severity, co-morbid disease (especially cardiac or renal failure), and treatment goals. Midodrine has an FDA-approved indication for the treatment of symptomatic OH; FDA approval was based on studies showing an improvement in upright blood pressure as a surrogate for symptom relief. In contrast, the FDA-approved droxidopa with an orphan designation for the treatment of nOH based on studies showing improvement in symptoms of nOH. Patients receiving droxidopa reported a decrease in dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling as if they might black out compared with those receiving placebo. There have been no long-term studies on the durability of the treatment effect for either midodrine or droxidopa. However, a long-term study is underway to study durability of effectiveness with droxidopa (NCT02586623) in patients with nOH for up to 36 weeks of treatment.

Recommendations for changing nOH treatment

Once initial therapy has begun, symptomatic benefit, including impact on activities of daily living, and changes in blood pressure need to be assessed frequently. If symptoms do not improve after reaching maximum labeled dose, it is recommended that the treatment be changed and symptomatic benefit be assessed once more. This process is iterative until either symptomatic benefit is achieved or maximum tolerable dose of the therapy is reached.

Treating nOH — step 4: combination pharmacotherapy

Little data exists to determine efficacy and safety of different combinations of therapy compared to monotherapy for nOH. Based on the experience of the consensus panel, the recommendation is to appropriately titrate to maximum tolerable dose of a single agent and then, if symptomatic benefit is not obtained, consider switching to a different therapy or adding a second agent and titrate from its lowest starting dose.

### Recommendations for the screening and management of patients with chronic kidney disease [^117CbiNA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major health problem associated with considerable increase in morbidity and mortality and with decreased quality of life. To slow the progression of kidney failure, to prevent the consequences of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to decrease cardiovascular mortality associated with CKD, it is crucial to detect patients with CKD early and to optimize their care. To assist physicians in patient management, members of a working party for the management of CKD have identified several recommendations for the screening of patients at risk of CKD and for the management of patients with established CKD.

Vasoconstrictors in uncomplicated ascites — midodrine trials: The use of midodrine has been explored in 2 small randomized controlled trials (RCTs); in one RCT, midodrine improved systemic hemodynamics and sodium excretion in 12 patients, which was not observed in 8 patients on placebo, whereas a crossover RCT with 15 patients found no difference in natriuretic response or urine volume between furosemide plus midodrine or placebo; overall, evidence is insufficient to use midodrine as an adjunct to diuretics or to use more potent vasoconstrictors in this setting.

Midodrine and terlipressin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) — recommendation and randomized evidence are as follows: "We suggest not using midodrine or terlipressin empirically for critically ill ACLF patients with SBP (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence)". Supporting data include an RCT in which Salman et al randomized 200 cirrhotic patients with SBP to albumin, terlipressin, low-dose albumin plus terlipressin, or midodrine, with no significant differences, and analysis showed no differences for midodrine in mortality (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.68–3.91), renal failure (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 0.97–7.17), or resolution of SBP (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.08–52.74). A second trial randomized 55 cirrhotic patients with SBP to cefotaxime or cefotaxime plus terlipressin; despite early improvements, meta-analysis of both trials found no terlipressin benefit for mortality (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.27–1.58), renal failure (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.32–3.09), or resolution of SBP (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67–1.55). The page notes both studies did not use albumin as standard of care and were at high risk of bias due to small sample sizes and methodologic limitations.

### Attending rounds: a patient with intradialytic hypotension [^1147whTv]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Intradialytic hypotension is the most common adverse event that occurs during the hemodialysis procedure. Despite advances in machine technology, it remains a difficult management issue. The pathophysiology of intradialytic hypotension and measures to reduce its frequency are discussed. An accurate assessment of dry weight is crucial in all patients on dialysis and especially those patients prone to intradialytic hypotension. The presence of edema and hypertension has recently been shown to be a poor predictor of volume overload. Noninvasive methods to assess volume status, such as whole body and segmental bioimpedance, hold promise to more accurately assess fluid status. Reducing salt intake is key to limiting interdialytic weight gain. A common problem is that patients are often told to restrict fluid but not salt intake. Lowering the dialysate temperature, prohibiting food ingestion during hemodialysis, and midodrine administration are beneficial. Sodium modeling in the absence of ultrafiltration modeling should be abandoned. There is not enough data on the efficacy of l-carnitine to warrant its routine use.

### Midodrine hydrochloride [^114pkY4M]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a 2-day study, after open-label midodrine, known midodrine responders received midodrine 10 mg or placebo at 0, 3, and 6 hours. One-minute standing systolic blood pressures were increased 1 hour after each dose by about 15 mmHg and 3 hours after each dose by about 12mmHg; 3-minute standing pressures were increased also at 1, but not 3, hours after dosing. There were increases in standing time seen intermittently 1 hour after dosing, but not at 3 hours.

In a 1-day, dose-response trial, single doses of 0, 2.5, 10, and 20 mg of midodrine were given to 25 patients. The 10- and 20-mg doses produced increases in standing 1- minute systolic pressure of about 30 mmHg at 1 hour; the increase was sustained in part for 2 hours after 10 mg and 4 hours after 20 mg. Supine systolic pressure was ≥ 200 mmHg in 22% of patients on 10mg and 45% of patients on 20 mg; elevated pressures often lasted 6 hours or more.

Special Populations

A study with 16 patients undergoing hemodialysis demonstrated that Midodrine hydrochloride is removed by dialysis.
