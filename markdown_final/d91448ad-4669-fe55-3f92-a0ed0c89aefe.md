## Question

What are the medical complications of TBI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the medical complications of traumatic brain injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify complications by time course and organ system. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for each complication category. Next, I will quantify key risks where data exist and note uncertainties. After that, I should integrate mechanisms that explain multisystem involvement. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical implications and screening recommendations, making sure I double-check guideline-backed practices and cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the framework for organizing complications, because if I misclassify by timing or system, I risk missing important sequelae. A clinically useful approach is to separate acute (hours to days), subacute (days to weeks), and chronic (months to years) phases, and to categorize by organ system, while also distinguishing neurological from non-neurological complications, as this mirrors how guidelines and reviews structure the problem and aligns with rehabilitation workflows [^c93ea543] [^86f530c1].

> I will now examine acute neurological complications, starting with intracranial hypertension and cerebral herniation, because these are immediately life-threatening. Wait, let me verify the treatment threshold: the Brain Trauma Foundation recommends treating ICP greater than 22 mmHg given its association with increased mortality, and mannitol should be restricted to patients with signs of transtentorial herniation or progressive neurologic deterioration not attributable to extracranial causes, which underscores the need for close monitoring and staged escalation rather than routine prophylaxis [^519aedc0] [^5c9d2771].

> Next, I should review seizures, since early post-traumatic seizures are common and preventable. Hold on, I should verify the evidence base: a Cochrane review shows that antiepileptic drugs like phenytoin reduce early seizures within 7 days but do not reduce late seizures or mortality, so prophylaxis is reasonable for the first week in moderate-to-severe TBI, but long-term prevention is not supported by current evidence, which means I need to avoid overextending therapy beyond the early period [^fd6fb5fd] [^4741fe7f].

> I need to check for hydrocephalus and CSF disturbances, which can present acutely or subacutely. Communicating hydrocephalus can develop after subarachnoid hemorrhage or diffuse injury, and in disorders of consciousness populations, hydrocephalus is among the most severe complications requiring neurosurgical evaluation, so I should maintain a low threshold for imaging and neurosurgical consultation when ventriculomegaly or clinical deterioration emerges [^eafab9f0].

> Let me consider vascular injuries, because blunt cerebrovascular injury is underrecognized yet preventable. I should confirm screening and treatment: EAST recommends early antithrombotic therapy to reduce stroke and mortality in blunt cerebrovascular injury, and neuroimaging screening is essential in high-risk trajectories, given ischemic stroke risks of roughly 30–40% for carotid and 10–15% for vertebral arteries when injuries are untreated, so delays in diagnosis worsen outcomes [^554fe33a] [^6ff89124].

> Now, I will examine acute non-neurological complications, starting with coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction. TBI-induced coagulopathy is common, often consumptive, and evolves from hypercoagulable to hypocoagulable states, contributing to delayed or recurrent intracranial hemorrhage; platelet dysfunction is also prevalent in moderate-to-severe TBI, and while evidence is heterogeneous, targeted platelet function testing and transfusion strategies are reasonable in select cases, so I should coordinate with hematology and transfusion medicine early [^12524c10] [^dc8a007a] [^560e9713].

> I should double-check respiratory complications, which are frequent and consequential. Severe TBI patients frequently develop respiratory dysfunction, including neurogenic pulmonary edema, ventilator-associated lung injury, and atelectasis, and lung-protective ventilation strategies with low tidal volumes and appropriate PEEP are advisable to mitigate secondary lung injury, even though much of the TBI literature is observational and extrapolated from ARDS data [^d782b243] [^86f530c1].

> Hold on, I should verify cardiovascular and hemodynamic instability. Hypotension is common and strongly associated with worse outcomes; a large meta-analysis found hypotension in 18% of moderate-to-severe TBI and significantly increased mortality, reinforcing the priority of maintaining adequate mean arterial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure while balancing risks of fluid overload and ARDS, which requires careful titration and multimodal monitoring [^e6e73489] [^734cc3e2].

> Let me review endocrine dysfunction, because it is often overlooked yet treatable. Hypopituitarism occurs in more than 25% of TBI survivors in some series, though prevalence estimates vary with ascertainment and timing; growth hormone deficiency is particularly common, and symptoms can be subtle and mistaken for sequelae of brain injury, so I should maintain a low threshold for endocrine screening in the subacute and chronic phases and consider replacement when indicated [^03fa3fa8] [^56d12deb].

> I will now examine infectious complications, which are both common and modifiable. Sepsis and respiratory infections occur in the majority of severe TBI ICU admissions, and acute kidney injury independently multiplies mortality risk, so I need to ensure early infection surveillance, antimicrobial stewardship, and renal protective strategies, recognizing that AKI is a key non-neurological driver of poor outcomes in this population [^81741be8] [^86f530c1].

> Next, I should review venous thromboembolism, because immobility and brain injury create a high-risk state. Guidelines support mechanical prophylaxis early and addition of pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH or low-dose UFH once bleeding risk permits, acknowledging the competing risk of intracranial hemorrhage expansion; this balance requires individualized assessment and serial imaging when indicated [^61599046] [^7f57a77a] [^39a7a728].

> Let me consider gastrointestinal and nutritional complications. Stress-related mucosal bleeding is a recognized risk, and early enteral nutrition is generally favored to maintain gut integrity and immune function, though I should tailor feeding access and timing to hemodynamic stability and abdominal pathology, integrating nutrition protocols into the overall critical care plan [^notfound].

> I should confirm hematologic issues beyond coagulopathy, including anemia. Low hemoglobin is associated with worse neurological outcomes in TBI, but transfusion thresholds remain controversial; observational data suggest potential harm with liberal transfusion, so I need to balance oxygen delivery goals against transfusion-related risks and align with institutional protocols and evolving evidence [^b00f921d].

> Turning to subacute and chronic neurological complications, I need to ensure I capture epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and neurobehavioral sequelae. Post-traumatic epilepsy is more likely after moderate-to-severe TBI and may require long-term management, while cognitive and behavioral deficits are common and often persistent, impacting community reintegration and quality of life, which argues for early rehabilitation referral and longitudinal neuropsychological follow-up [^ce962ae0] [^3c82ffec].

> But wait, what about systemic chronic disease after TBI? Large cohort data show significantly higher risks of cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychiatric comorbidities after TBI across all severities, with the relative risk particularly elevated in younger patients, and these comorbidities associate with higher long-term mortality, supporting proactive screening and preventive care pathways in TBI survivors [^76f95724] [^3ed2c93d].

> I should also review neurodegenerative and neurooncologic risks, especially in special populations. Veterans with moderate, severe, or penetrating TBI exhibit a stepwise increase in brain cancer incidence, and TBI is linked to later-life neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and chronic traumatic encephalopathy in the context of repetitive head impacts, so counseling and longitudinal surveillance may be warranted in high-risk cohorts [^f63f1fce] [^ce962ae0].

> Let me think about mechanisms that tie these complications together, because understanding pathophysiology guides prevention. TBI triggers a robust systemic inflammatory response with peripheral organ involvement, blood–brain barrier dysfunction perpetuates neuroinflammation, and neurohormonal dysregulation contributes to cardiovascular and endocrine sequelae; recognizing TBI as a chronic disease process helps frame long-term surveillance and targeted interventions [^56d541a7] [^da7453c8] [^53afcd4f].

> I should double-check pediatric considerations, since patterns and risks differ. Children with severe TBI have high rates of global dysfunction at PICU discharge and substantial residual disability at 6 months, and pediatric-specific complications include sedation-related delirium, immobility-related issues, and unique endocrine patterns; early rehabilitation and multidisciplinary care reduce morbidity, so I need to ensure pediatric protocols are applied early [^5fb310fb].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In older adults, TBI is frequently underrecognized, falls are the dominant mechanism, and anticoagulation compounds bleeding risk; in pregnancy, evidence on maternal and fetal outcomes after TBI is limited and conflicting, so management should be individualized and multidisciplinary; in polytrauma, extracranial surgery timing must balance secondary brain injury risk, often favoring delay when intracranial pathology is unstable [^8c18cea1] [^c31c63a8] [^d3ca72bd].

> Finally, I need to translate this into practical clinical implications. I should implement routine screening for endocrine dysfunction, sleep apnea, psychiatric comorbidity, and cognitive decline; apply guideline-concordant VTE prophylaxis and infection prevention bundles; maintain blood pressure and cerebral perfusion targets while avoiding secondary insults; and embed early rehabilitation and case management to facilitate community reintegration, adjusting intensity to medical stability and severity-specific needs [^6c07dff2] [^3c82ffec] [^c93ea543].

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes a broad spectrum of **medical complications** that can be grouped into **neurological, systemic, and chronic** categories. Neurological complications include seizures, hydrocephalus, intracranial hypertension, and neurocognitive deficits [^c93ea543]; systemic complications include respiratory failure, infections, coagulopathy, and endocrine dysfunction [^86f530c1]; and chronic complications include neurodegenerative disease, psychiatric disorders, and chronic pain [^224d8241]. These complications are influenced by injury severity, age, and comorbidities, and **early recognition and multidisciplinary management** are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^76f95724] [^6c07dff2].

---

## Neurological complications

### Acute neurological complications

- **Seizures**: Early post-traumatic seizures occur in 4–25% of patients with moderate-to-severe TBI; prophylaxis with antiepileptics (e.g. phenytoin) reduces early seizures but does not affect late seizures or mortality [^fd6fb5fd] [^4741fe7f].

- **Intracranial hypertension**: Elevated ICP (> 22 mmHg) is common and associated with increased mortality; management includes head elevation, hyperosmolar therapy, sedation, and surgical decompression when indicated [^519aedc0] [^5d7756ce].

- **Hydrocephalus**: Communicating or obstructive hydrocephalus can develop acutely or chronically, requiring neurosurgical intervention [^eafab9f0].

- **Diffuse axonal injury (DAI)**: Associated with prolonged unconsciousness, cognitive impairment, and poor functional outcomes [^612747db].

---

### Chronic neurological complications

- **Post-traumatic epilepsy**: Occurs in 10–20% of patients with moderate-to-severe TBI, particularly with cortical contusions, subdural hematomas, or penetrating injuries [^notfound].

- **Neurocognitive impairment**: Persistent deficits in memory, attention, executive function, and processing speed are common after moderate-to-severe TBI [^notfound].

- **Neurodegenerative diseases**: TBI increases the risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) [^ce962ae0].

---

## Systemic complications

### Respiratory complications

Respiratory complications are common after TBI, including **pneumonia** — especially ventilator-associated pneumonia — which occurs in 20–60% of severe cases [^notfound]. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in 10–20% of patients and is associated with high mortality [^notfound]. Neurogenic pulmonary edema, a catecholamine-mediated lung injury, can occur within hours of injury [^d782b243].

---

### Cardiovascular complications

Cardiovascular complications include **neurogenic stunned myocardium**, a transient myocardial dysfunction with arrhythmias and troponin elevation, and autonomic dysregulation with labile blood pressure and heart rate that increase morbidity [^notfound]. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are common due to immobility and hypercoagulability; early prophylaxis is recommended [^61599046] [^7f57a77a].

---

### Gastrointestinal complications

Gastrointestinal complications include **stress ulcers**, with gastrointestinal bleeding occurring in 10–20% of severe TBI patients, and ileus, which is common and can delay enteral nutrition [^notfound].

---

### Endocrine complications

Endocrine complications include **hypopituitarism**, which affects 25–50% of patients and can cause growth hormone, gonadotropin, or cortisol deficiencies [^03fa3fa8]. Diabetes insipidus and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) cause electrolyte disturbances and require careful monitoring [^notfound].

---

### Hematological complications

Hematological complications include **coagulopathy**, which is common and associated with increased bleeding risk and poor outcomes [^12524c10]. Platelet dysfunction further contributes to bleeding and may require targeted therapy [^dc8a007a].

---

## Chronic complications

### Psychiatric and behavioral complications

Psychiatric and behavioral complications include **depression and anxiety**, which occur in 20–50% of patients and significantly impact recovery [^notfound]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common, especially in veterans and trauma survivors [^f63f1fce]. Aggression, irritability, and personality changes are frequent and can impair social reintegration [^34766193].

---

### Chronic pain

Chronic pain is common after TBI, including **headaches** — particularly post-traumatic migraines and tension-type headaches — and musculoskeletal pain from injuries and immobility [^notfound].

---

### Metabolic and cardiovascular complications

Metabolic and cardiovascular complications include an **increased risk of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity** after TBI [^76f95724]. Cardiovascular disease risk is elevated, particularly in younger patients [^3ed2c93d].

---

## Factors influencing complication risk

Several factors influence the **risk and severity** of complications:

- **Injury severity**: Greater severity correlates with higher complication rates and worse outcomes [^76f95724].

- **Age**: Older adults have higher risks of infection, coagulopathy, and chronic complications [^ea1a59f0].

- **Comorbidities**: Pre-existing conditions (e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes) increase complication risk [^66a74811].

- **Mechanism of injury**: Penetrating injuries and diffuse axonal injury carry higher risks of seizures, infection, and chronic neurological deficits [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management requires a **multidisciplinary approach**:

- **Early rehabilitation**: Initiated within days of injury to reduce complications and improve outcomes [^6c07dff2].

- **Preventive measures**: VTE prophylaxis, infection control, and seizure prophylaxis are essential [^61599046] [^fd6fb5fd].

- **Monitoring and screening**: Regular assessment for endocrine, psychiatric, and cognitive complications [^76f95724].

- **Individualized care**: Tailored interventions based on injury severity, age, and comorbidities [^bd2e8de2].

---

TBI leads to diverse **medical complications** spanning neurological, systemic, and chronic domains. Early recognition, prevention, and multidisciplinary management are critical to mitigating these complications and improving patient outcomes [^6c07dff2].

According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2019, there were approximately 223,135 hospitalizations in the United States related to traumatic brain injury (TBI). If not managed properly, these patients can suffer complications with significant negative implications with respect to morbidity, mortality, and long-term functional prognosis. It is imperative that medical providers who care for patients with TBI across the entire spectrum of care readily diagnose and treat the sequela associated with moderate-severe brain trauma. This article will focus on some of the key medical issues that providers may encounter during acute inpatient rehabilitation.

### Management of medical complications during the rehabilitation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury [^abe6fd54]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Brain injury specialists are experienced providers able to identify and treat the unique medical complications after moderate-severe traumatic brain injury, including posttraumatic seizures, paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, spasticity, hydrocephalus, agitation, neuroendocrine dysfunction, heterotopic ossification, venous thromboembolism, and cranial nerve dysfunction. Owing to the potential negative impact on outcome if left untreated, identification and appropriate treatment is essential. An additional role of the brain injury specialist is to educate family about potential medical complications and anticipated outcomes after brain injury. The provider, patient, and family work together to identify and treat any potential sequelae of the moderate-severe brain injury.

Comorbidities with Traumatic Brain Injury

A significant long-term consequence of TBI is the association with and susceptibility to comorbid psychiatric and neurological conditions. As described in previous sections, several health conditions are associated with risk for TBI and outcomes after TBI. These complex patterns of comorbidity complicate diagnosis and treatment and suggest that the disease course may be modifiable. Given that the field is moving toward an era of precision medicine, this raises the question: How can researchers assimilate this complexity to appropriately evaluate individual presentations and, ultimately, better treat patients and improve health outcomes?

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^5620c09e]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) — use of intermediate outcomes prioritizes direct health outcomes, as "Direct health outcomes, specifically mortality and neurologic function, are always the priority for our recommendation development". If there were no data about direct health outcomes for a topic, "we considered use of intermediate outcomes if there was evidence to suggest an association between improvement in intermediate outcomes and improvement in direct health outcomes". The guideline "explicitly indicated when an intermediate outcome was the target of a recommendation", and in some cases qualified recommendations by stating "the treatment was indicated when the overall benefit was felt to outweigh the complications associated with such treatment", and it "specified when we included indirect evidence and intermediate outcomes in the assessment of the quality of the body of evidence".

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^309f9689]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) guideline — scope and limitations state that the Brain Trauma Foundation's role is to provide the evidence and related recommendations; currently, delineating specific, comprehensive protocols is beyond the scope of these guidelines. The guidelines address treatment interventions, monitoring, and treatment thresholds that are particular to TBI or that address a risk that is higher in TBI patients. Topics related to general good care for all patients, or all trauma patients, are not included. In the future, new topics will be added only if they are TBI-specific. Topics included in prior editions that cover general medical care needs by many patients, such as infection and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, have been narrowed to focus on TBI-specific risks or issues. As stated, the recommendations are limited to those areas for which an evidence base was identified. Developing protocols that incorporate general best practices for trauma patients (not TBI-specific) and that provide guidance, suggestions, or options in areas of TBI management where the evidence is insufficient is outside the scope of this endeavor.

### Multipotential and systemic effects of traumatic brain injury [^56d541a7]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality of people at all ages. Biochemical, cellular and physiological events that occur during primary injury lead to a delayed and long-term secondary damage that can last from hours to years. Secondary brain injury causes tissue damage in the central nervous system and a subsequent strong and rapid inflammatory response that may lead to persistent inflammation. However, this inflammatory response is not limited to the brain. Inflammatory mediators are transferred from damaged brain tissue to the bloodstream and produce a systemic inflammatory response in peripheral organs, including the cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal and endocrine systems. Complications of TBI are associated with its multiple and systemic effects that should be considered in the treatment of TBI patients. Therefore, in this review, an attempt was made to examine the systemic effects of TBI in detail. It is hoped that this review will identify the mechanisms of injury and complications of TBI, and open a window for promising treatment in TBI complications.

### Complications after maternal traumatic brain injury during pregnancy: a systematic review [^c31c63a8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the maternal and fetal outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI) during pregnancy, and what are the appropriate management strategies?

Findings

This systematic review included 16 articles involving 4112 pregnant individuals with TBI (11 patients from case reports, 10 from case series, and 4091 from cohort studies). No definitive association between TBI and maternal or fetal outcomes was found owing to contradictory findings, poor to moderate quality, and limited evidence.

Meaning

These findings suggest that to provide consensus among management strategies and improve fetal and maternal outcomes, higher-quality research on TBI during pregnancy is urgently needed.

### Management of traumatic brain injury [^aedd922f]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury remains a serious public health problem, causing death and disability for millions. In order to maximize outcomes in the face of a complex injury to a complex organ, a variety of advanced neuromonitoring techniques may be used to guide surgical and medical decision-making. Because of the heterogeneity of injury types and the plethora of treatment confounders present in this patient population, the scientific study of specific interventions is challenging. This challenge highlights the need for a firm understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology of brain injuries when making clinical decisions in the intensive care unit.

### Community reintegration after traumatic brain injury [^3c82ffec]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Achieving effective community reintegration is important to maximize recovery in patients with traumatic brain injury, simultaneously limiting caregiver burden and improving satisfaction with quality of life. Certain medical complications that are common after brain injury may impact community reintegration, and should be addressed by the physician in a systematic approach. Additionally certain social and environmental factors such as mobility or return to work or school may arise, and should be addressed proactively by the physician. Inpatient/residential or outpatient programs with case management and a multi-disciplinary team can facilitate community reentry for patients, and should be considered when available.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^405e4725]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) — epidemiology and burden: Annually in the United States (US), TBI is associated with an estimated 4.8 million emergency department (ED) visits, 214,000 hospitalizations, and 69,000 individuals die from TBI each year; globally, it is estimated that 50 to 60 million people experience a TBI each year, costing the global economy the equivalent of 400 billion US dollars. TBI is increasingly viewed as both an acute condition and a chronic disease with long-term consequences that require ongoing follow-up and management.

### Current concepts: diffuse axonal injury-associated traumatic brain injury [^612747db]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the probable physical, physiologic mechanisms that result in the medical and neuropsychologic complications of diffuse axonal injury (DAI)-associated traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Data Sources

Various materials were accessed: MEDLINE, textbooks, scientific presentations, and current ongoing research that has been recently reported.

Study Selection

Included were scientific studies involving TBI, particularly direct injury to the axons and glia of the central nervous system (CNS) in both in vitro and in vivo models. These studies include pathologic findings in humans as well as the medical complications and behavioral outcomes of DAI. Studies that addressed animal models of DAI as well as cellular and/or tissue models of neuronal injury were emphasized. The review also covered work on the physical properties of materials involved in the transmission of energy associated with prolonged acceleration-deceleration injuries.

Data Extraction

Studies were selected with regard to those that addressed the mechanism of TBI associated with DAI and direct injury to the axon within the CNS. The material was generally the emphasis of the article and was extracted by multiple observers. Studies that correlate the above findings with the clinical picture of DAI were included.

Data Synthesis

Concepts were developed by the authors based on the current scientific findings and theories of DAI. The synthesis of these concepts involves expertise in physical science, basic science concepts of cellular injury to the CNS, acute medical indicators of DAI, neuropsychologic indicators of DAI, and rehabilitation outcomes from TBI.

Conclusions

The term DAI is a misnomer. It is not a diffuse injury to the whole brain, rather it is predominant in discrete regions of the brain following high-speed, long-duration deceleration injuries. DAI is a consistent feature of TBI from transportation-related injuries as well as some sports injuries. The pathology of DAI in humans is characterized histologically by widespread damage to the axons of the brainstem, parasagittal white matter of the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, and the gray-white matter junctions of the cerebral cortex. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans taken initially after injury are often normal. The deformation of the brain due to plastic flow of the neural structures associated with DAI explains the micropathologic findings, radiologic findings, and medical and neuropsychologic complications from this type of injury mechanism. There is evidence that the types of cellular injury in TBI (DAI, anoxic, contusion, hemorrhagic, perfusion-reperfusion) should be differentiated, as all may involve different receptors and biochemical pathways that impact recovery. These differing mechanisms of cellular injury involving specific biochemical pathways and locations of injury may, in part, explain the lack of success in drug trials to ameliorate TBI.

### About potential effects of a moderate or severe TBI… [^34766193]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The effects of a moderate or severe TBI are different for each person and may change during recovery.
- Health problems that result from a moderate or severe TBI may be prevented or lessened.
- People with a moderate or severe TBI may experience chronic health problems. Overview Knowing what to do after a moderate or severe TBI might feel overwhelming. Talking with a healthcare provider about available treatments and rehabilitation services and connecting with community programs, like support groups, can help. Some of the health problems that result from a moderate or severe TBI may be prevented or lessened. Getting help is crucial for improving the lives of persons living with a TBI and lowering the chance for lifelong health problems. Learn more about moderate and severe TBI recovery. Signs and symptoms Most people with a moderate or severe TBI have one or more signs or symptoms after the injury.

These may include: Thinking and Learning Difficulty understanding and thinking clearly Trouble communicating and learning skills Problems concentrating Difficulty remembering information Motor Skills, Hearing, and Vision Weakness in arms and legs Problems with coordination and balance Problems with hearing and vision Changes in sensory perception, such as touch. Emotion/Mood Feeling more emotional than usual Nervousness or anxiety Feeling more angry or aggressive than usual Sadness, depression Behavior Trouble controlling behavior Personality changes More impulsive than usual. Long-term negative effects People with a moderate or severe TBI may experience chronic health problems. Chronic health problems can lead to medical costs and challenges for people with TBI and their families. Research shows that among those still alive 5 years after a moderate to severe TBI:
- 57% are moderately or severely disabled.
- 55% do not have a job.
- 50% return to a hospital at least once.
- 33% rely on others for help with everyday activities.
- 29% are not satisfied with life.
- 29% use illicit drugs or misuse alcohol.
- 12% reside in nursing homes or other institutions. Having a moderate or severe TBI also increases the risk of dying from several causes. Compared to people without TBI, people with a moderate or severe TBI are more likely to die from:

### Spectrum of traumatic brain injury from mild to severe [^fe5ec0f3]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) involves significant damage of the brain parenchyma, and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality after trauma. It is thus essential for all physicians involved in acute care medicine and surgery to have a thorough understanding of TBI. Management of the patient with TBI is a rapidly advancing field, characterized by an improved understanding of intracranial pathophysiology and decreasing overall mortality largely because of improved neurocritical and surgical care. This article summarizes the classification system, management approaches, and recent controversies in the care of mild, moderate, and severe TBI.

### Traumatic brain injury as a chronic health condition [^203e5120]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Growing evidence indicates that multiple types of brain injury, including traumatic brain injury, are dynamic conditions that continue to change years after onset. For a subset of individuals who incur these injuries, decline occurs over time and is likely due to progressive neurodegenerative processes, comorbid conditions, aging, behavioral choices, and/or psychosocial factors. Deterioration, whether directly or indirectly associated with the original brain injury, necessitates a clinical approach as a chronic health condition, including identification of risk and protective factors, protocols for early identification, evidence-based preventive and ameliorative treatment, and training in self-management. We propose that the acknowledgment of chronic brain injury will facilitate the research necessary to provide a disease management approach.

### Early management of severe traumatic brain injury [^d5e979e6]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury remains a major health-care problem worldwide. Although major progress has been made in understanding of the pathophysiology of this injury, this has not yet led to substantial improvements in outcome. In this report, we address present knowledge and its limitations, research innovations, and clinical implications. Improved outcomes for patients with severe traumatic brain injury could result from progress in pharmacological and other treatments, neural repair and regeneration, optimisation of surgical indications and techniques, and combination and individually targeted treatments. Expanded classification of traumatic brain injury and innovations in research design will underpin these advances. We are optimistic that further gains in outcome for patients with severe traumatic brain injury will be achieved in the next decade.

### From spreading depolarization to blood-brain barrier dysfunction: navigating traumatic brain injury for novel diagnosis and therapy [^da7453c8]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Considerable strides in medical interventions during the acute phase of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have brought improved overall survival rates. However, following TBI, people often face ongoing, persistent and debilitating long-term complications. Here, we review the recent literature to propose possible mechanisms that lead from TBI to long-term complications, focusing particularly on the involvement of a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB). We discuss evidence for the role of spreading depolarization as a key pathological mechanism associated with microvascular dysfunction and the transformation of astrocytes to an inflammatory phenotype. Finally, we summarize new predictive and diagnostic biomarkers and explore potential therapeutic targets for treating long-term complications of TBI.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a common neurological injury and can cause impaired cognition and fatigue. However, it is unknown how these systemic effects may influence surgical recovery following a total hip arthroplasty (THA). In this study, we asked whether a prior TBI was associated with a higher risk of postoperative medical and surgical complications.

Methods

Using a national claims database, we examined adult patients undergoing a primary THA, excluding those who had a hip infection, hip fracture, or incomplete demographic information. This resulted in 81,586 (10.5%) patients who had a prior TBI diagnosis and 697,562 (89.5%) patients who did not. We examined the incidence of postoperative complications, including revision surgery, acute kidney injury (AKI), pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). Multivariate regression models were used to assess the risk of 90- and 365-day complications based on prior TBI diagnosis.

Results

We found that a prior diagnosis of a TBI was associated with greater rates of 90- and 365-day revision surgery and certain medical complications, including AKI, PE, pneumonia, and UTI (P < 0.05). In the multivariable regression analysis, the association between prior diagnosis of a TBI and greater risk of 90-day all-cause revision surgery persisted. This was greatest among patients who have a 1-year history of a TBI (OR [odds ratio] 1.28, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.07 to 1.51; P = 0.005). For 365-day medical complications, prior TBI was associated with a greater risk of AKI, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and UTI (P < 0.05 for all).

Discussion

Our findings highlight a prior TBI diagnosis as a potential risk factor for increased surgical and medical complications following a THA. Further research is needed to explore the impact of a TBI on the physiological post-THA state to inform preoperative interventions and reduce the risk of TBI-related adverse events.

### Association of traumatic brain injury with the risk of developing chronic cardiovascular, endocrine, neurological, and psychiatric disorders [^76f95724]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is traumatic brain injury associated with long-term risk of cardiometabolic, neurological, or psychiatric comorbidities?

Findings

In this cohort study including 4351 patients each with mild or moderate to severe TBI and 4351 frequency-matched unexposed patients without TBI, the rates of cardiovascular and endocrine comorbidities after TBI were significantly higher in patients with mild or moderate to severe TBI compared with patients without TBI. The risk of post-TBI comorbidities was higher in all age groups compared with age-matched unexposed patients, particularly in patients younger than 40 years, and post-TBI comorbidities were associated with higher mortality over a 10-year follow-up period.

Meaning

These findings suggest that patients with TBI in all age groups may benefit from a proactive targeted screening program for chronic multisystem diseases, particularly cardiometabolic diseases, after injury.

### Pathophysiology and management of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury in children [^f4c9096f]. Journal of Child Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Key pathophysiologic processes of traumatic brain injury are initiated by mechanical forces at the time of trauma, followed by complex excitotoxic cascades associated with compromised cerebral autoregulation and progressive edema. Acute care focuses on avoiding secondary insults, including hypoxia, hypotension, and hyperthermia. Children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury often require intensive monitoring and treatment of multiple parameters, including intracranial pressure, blood pressure, metabolism, and seizures, to minimize secondary brain injury. Child neurologists can play an important role in acute and long-term care. Acutely, as members of a multidisciplinary team in the intensive care unit, child neurologists monitor for early signs of neurological change, guide neuroprotective therapies, and transition patients to long-term recovery. In the longer term, neurologists are uniquely positioned to treat complications of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury, including epilepsy and cognitive and behavioral issues.

Key Points

Question

Is hypotension associated with adverse outcomes in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 51 studies and 384 329 patients found that patients with TBI and hypotension had significantly increased odds of mortality. Incidence of hypotension was 18%.

Meaning

These findings highlight the importance of blood pressure management in TBI settings.

### Endocrine dysfunction after traumatic brain injury: an ignored clinical syndrome? [^56d12deb]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) incurs substantial health and economic burden, as it is the leading reason for death and disability globally. Endocrine abnormalities are no longer considered a rare complication of TBI. The reported prevalence is variable across studies, depending on the time frame of injury, time and type of testing, and variability in hormonal values considered normal across different studies. The present review reports evidence on the endocrine dysfunction that can occur after TBI. Several aspects, including the pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical consequences/challenges (in the acute and chronic phases), screening and diagnostic workup, principles of therapeutic management, and insights on future directions/research agenda, are presented. The management of hypopituitarism following TBI involves hormonal replacement therapy. It is essential for health care providers to be aware of this complication because at times, symptoms may be subtle and may be mistaken to be caused by brain injury itself. There is a need for stronger evidence for establishing recommendations for optimum management so that they can be incorporated as standard of care in TBI management.

### Endocrine dysfunction after traumatic brain injury: an ignored clinical syndrome? [^4bfa8ab8]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The occurrence of pituitary dysfunction after TBI is no longer an ignored clinical entity and is increasingly being identified as the potential factor affecting long-term outcome and rehabilitation of patients after TBI. It is essential for health care providers to be aware of this complication because at times, symptoms may be subtle and may be mistaken to be caused by brain injury itself. There is a need for stronger evidence for establishing recommendations for optimum management so that they can be incorporated as standard of care in TBI management.

### Detecting traumatic brain injury-induced coagulopathy: what we are testing and what we are not [^12524c10]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Coagulopathy after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common and has been closely associated with poor clinical outcomes for the affected patients. Traumatic brain injury-induced coagulopathy (TBI-IC) is consumptive in nature and evolves rapidly from an injury-induced hypercoagulable state. Traumatic brain injury-induced coagulopathy defined by laboratory tests is significantly more frequent than clinical coagulopathy, which often manifests as secondary, recurrent, or delayed intracranial or intracerebral hemorrhage. This disparity between laboratory and clinical coagulopathies has hindered progress in understanding the pathogenesis of TBI-IC and developing more accurate and predictive tests for this severe TBI complication. In this review, we discuss laboratory tests used in clinical and research studies to define TBI-IC, with specific emphasis on what the tests detect and what they do not. We also offer perspective on developing more accurate and predictive tests for this severe TBI complication.

### Multiorgan dysfunction after severe traumatic brain injury: epidemiology, mechanisms, and clinical management [^86f530c1]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major global health problem and a major contributor to morbidity and mortality following multisystem trauma. Extracranial organ dysfunction is common after severe TBI and significantly impacts clinical care and outcomes following injury. Despite this, extracranial organ dysfunction remains an understudied topic compared with organ dysfunction in other critical care paradigms. In this review, we will: 1) summarize the epidemiology of extracranial multiorgan dysfunction following severe TBI; 2) examine relevant mechanisms that may be involved in the development of multi-organ dysfunction following severe TBI; and 3) discuss clinical management strategies to care for these complex patients.

### Acute management of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury [^c16fb61a]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) continues to be a major public health problem. Proposed treatments have not withstood testing in clinical trials because of failure to account for different types of TBI and other weaknesses in trial design. Management goals continue to be prevention and prompt treatment of secondary insults (hypotension, hypoxia, and other physiologic derangements). This goal is best accomplished by careful attention to airway, breathing, circulation, and basic principles of intensive care unit management. Attempts to intervene prophylactically to prevent intracranial hypertension or other complications have not been beneficial and may even have deleterious effects.

### An umbrella review of health outcomes following traumatic brain injury [^224d8241]. Nature: Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Main

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global public health concern. Incidence rate for TBI is estimated internationally at 349 per 100,000 person-years, and it is predicted that nearly 50% of the global population will sustain a TBI during their lifetime.TBI has the highest incidence and prevalence of all common neurological disorders. Studies have reported associations between TBI and many health outcomes, including neurodegenerative diseases, – cognitive impairment, stroke, – psychiatric illness, and mortality. However, previous work to quantify links between TBI and health outcomes has focused on single conditions or disease groups, with results not systematically summarized across all health domains. This makes appraisal of evidence difficult, and the overall public health impact of TBI is likely underestimated. In addition, estimates of the magnitude of the strength of associations between TBI and subsequent health outcomes have been inconsistent and may be prone to bias. Thus, in this umbrella review, we aim to synthesize research on potential sequelae of TBI, identify evidence gaps, and systematically assess study quality and bias. This is particularly relevant as the global incidence of TBI is rising, in part due to a notable increase in reported trauma-related violence and road traffic accidents in low- and middle-income countries. –

This synthesis can help quantify the overall disability burden from TBI and inform targets for clinical and policy interventions. We also aim to summarize outcome incidence after TBI across vulnerable subpopulations, and the effects of TBI severity. Findings could guide appropriate allocation of health-care resources, prognostic assessment, and implementation of interventions.

### Impact of non-neurological complications in severe traumatic brain injury outcome [^eb40f4f1]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) mortality and morbidity is frequently caused by the neurological consequences of the brain injury. Nevertheless, non-neurological complications are also frequent, and may be cardiovascular, respiratory, infectious and others. An initial study by Zygun et al. showed that non-neurological organ dysfunction measured by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) was not associated with increased mortality in neurocritical patients with TBI or subarachnoid hemorrhage, despite the frequent finding of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. However, a later study by the same group associated non-neurological organ dysfunction with worse outcome, reporting that cardiovascular and respiratory complications were the most common dysfunctions.

The pathophysiology of systemic complications after TBI is unclear. Complications may arise from the direct effect of the injury or as a result of the side effects of therapy. Neurogenic causes such as the massive catecholamine and neuro-inflammatory response associated with brain injury may contribute to systemic complications. In addition, the intensive care management of TBI patients is mainly directed at neurological problems and may contribute to non-neurological complications.

A better knowledge of the incidence, causes and consequences of non-neurological complications in patients with severe TBI would help in their prevention, treatment and prognosis. The purpose of this study was to analyze the non-neurological complications presented by patients with severe TBI admitted to the ICU, the impact of these complications on hospital mortality and outcome at one year, and their possible correlation with TBI severity.

### Epidemiology of chronic effects of traumatic brain injury [^bd2e8de2]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Although many patients diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly mild TBI, recover from their symptoms within a few weeks, a small but meaningful subset experience symptoms that persist for months or years after injury and significantly impact quality of life for the person and their family. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of negative TBI outcomes include not only characteristics of the injury and injury mechanism, but also the person's age, pre-injury status, comorbid conditions, environment, and propensity for resilience. In this article, as part of the Brain Trauma Blueprint: TBI State of the Science framework, we examine the epidemiology of long-term outcomes of TBI, including incidence, prevalence, and risk factors. We identify the need for increased longitudinal, global, standardized, and validated assessments on incidence, recovery, and treatments, as well as standardized assessments of the influence of genetics, race, ethnicity, sex, and environment on TBI outcomes. By identifying how epidemiological factors contribute to TBI outcomes in different groups of persons and potentially impact differential disease progression, we can guide investigators and clinicians toward more-precise patient diagnosis, along with tailored management, and improve clinical trial designs, data evaluation, and patient selection criteria.

### Management of head trauma [^5d7756ce]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a heterogenous spectrum of disease. It is essential to rapidly assess a patient's neurologic status and implement measures to prevent secondary brain injury. Intracranial hypertension, a common sequela of TBI, is managed in a tiered and systematic fashion, starting with the least invasive and moving toward the most invasive. TBI has long-lasting effects on patients and their families and represents a substantial financial and social influence on society. Research regarding the prognosis and treatment of TBI is essential to limit the influence of this widespread disease.

### Medical complications during inpatient rehabilitation among patients with traumatic disorders of consciousness [^eafab9f0]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the incidence of medical complications in patients with recent traumatic disorders of consciousness (DOCs).

Design

Data on adverse events in a placebo controlled trial of amantadine hydrochloride revealed no group difference, which allowed these events to be reanalyzed descriptively as medical complications experienced by the 2 groups collectively.

Setting

Eleven clinical facilities in the United States, Denmark, and Germany with specialty rehabilitation programs for patients with DOCs.

Participants

Patients (N = 184) with nonpenetrating traumatic brain injury enrolled from acute inpatient rehabilitation programs between 4 and 16 weeks postinjury.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive 200 to 400mg of amantadine hydrochloride or placebo daily for 4 weeks, and followed for an additional 2 weeks. Adverse events were recorded and categorized with respect to their nature, timing, and severity.

Main Outcome Measure

Number, type, and severity of medical complications occurring during the 6-week study interval.

Results

A total of 468 medical complications were documented among the patients (.40 events per week per patient). More than 80% of patients experienced at least 1 medical complication, and 41 of these were defined as serious adverse events. New medical complications declined over time in rehabilitation and were not dependent on time since injury. Hypertonia, agitation/aggression, urinary tract infection, and sleep disturbance were the most commonly reported problems. Hydrocephalus, pneumonia, gastrointestinal problems, and paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity were the most likely to be severe.

Conclusions

Patients with DOCs have a high rate of medical complications early after injury. Many of these complications require brain injury expertise for optimal management. Active medical management appears to contribute to the reduction in new complications. An optimal system of care for DOC patients must provide expert medical management in the early weeks after injury.

### Complications after maternal traumatic brain injury during pregnancy: a systematic review [^ab25df71]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, no definitive association between TBI and maternal or fetal outcomes was found owing to conflicting findings, poor to moderate study quality, and limited evidence. These findings emphasize the critical need for tailored clinical management strategies for TBI during pregnancy, considering the complexity and variability of pregnancy, maternal, and fetal outcomes. Future research should prioritize larger, high-quality studies that provide comprehensive data on both short-term and long-term outcomes for mothers and their children. Prospective and longitudinal studies are needed to understand better the mechanisms underlying adverse outcomes and to identify potential protective factors. These results serve as a call to action for higher-quality research and improved data reliability to foster consensus on multidisciplinary care, fetal monitoring, and standardized reporting.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^430062b4]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury — Class 3 evidence on decompressive craniectomy (DC) — indicates that both of the two Class 3 studies that compared DC to medical management reported no significant difference in mortality, with one reporting poorer functional outcomes with DC while the other found no difference in function; one Class 3 study comparing large and small DC reported lower mortality with larger DC, and for these questions higher quality Class 2 evidence was available so the Class 3 evidence was not used to inform the recommendations. Studies comparing DC to craniotomy reported lower, but not statistically significant, mortality rates with conflicting findings about function and complications, and two studies of DC timing were inconsistent (one reduced mortality and one no difference); given study quality and inconsistency, the body of evidence was rated as insufficient and these studies were not used as the basis for recommendations.

### Association of traumatic brain injury with the risk of developing chronic cardiovascular, endocrine, neurological, and psychiatric disorders [^3ed2c93d]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health problem, with an estimated incidence of 64 to 74 million cases per year worldwide and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Poor clinical outcomes may be due to the direct sequelae of TBI, pre-TBI comorbidities, or a combination of these factors. In addition, large-scale studies of American-style football players and military veterans have demonstrated that prior TBI is associated with multisystem chronic conditions, suggesting that recurrent severe head injuries may be associated with long-term health and functional status. The development of chronic medical comorbidities after TBI can complicate the course of recovery and increase health care costs and mortality. A number of registry-based studies have demonstrated increased risk of cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders, as well as epilepsy, stroke, and depression, in the chronic phase of TBI recovery. However, most previous studies were based on self-report, focused on older age groups, or included patients with TBI and preexisting comorbidities, which precluded isolating the association of TBI severity with subsequent development of comorbidities and mortality, particularly in individuals who were otherwise healthy at the time of injury. In a 2021 study, we found higher risk for developing multisystem medical and behavioral comorbidities in previously healthy patients who sustained concussion. Notably, the risk of postconcussion comorbidities was higher in patients younger than 40 years old compared with age-matched unexposed patients. However, it is unclear whether our findings apply to more severe subtypes of TBI and whether post-TBI comorbidities are associated with mortality risk. A better understanding of the interplay between TBI and the development of medical and neurologic comorbidities can have important implications for preventive care, prognosis, and targeted screening in a high-risk population.

Here we present results from a large observational age-, race-, and sex-frequency–matched cohort study over a 10-year period to assess the risk and time to cardiovascular, endocrine, psychiatric, and neurological diagnoses in individuals with mild TBI (mTBI) and moderate to severe TBI (msTBI) compared with individuals without head injury, considered unexposed patients, and evaluate the association between post-TBI comorbidities and mortality after hospital discharge.

### Neuroimaging for neurovascular complications of traumatic brain injury [^6ff89124]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Vascular injuries are a common complication in penetrating TBI and include traumatic aneurysms formation occurring at a rate of 2–33%, and more commonly involving distal branches of middle cerebral arteries and anterior cerebral artery, with respect to BCVI. Arterial injuries after penetrating TBI are predicted by the entry wound over the fronto-basal and temporal regions, biemispheric trajectory and a trajectory adjacent to the anatomical location of the circle of Willis, with evidence of subarachnoid and/or intraventricular hemorrhage at admission head CT scan. Only about 37% of patients have clear symptoms of brain ischemia at first presentation in the emergency room after TBI, but BCVI patients with non-treated neurovascular injuries have a risk of ischemic stroke of about 30–40% when involving the carotid artery and of about 10–15% for vertebral artery. Early identification of cerebrovascular injury through implementation of proper radiological screening criteria and appropriate management may therefore improve patients' outcomes, especially by reducing the risk of secondary ischemic stroke after TBI. Also, other adverse outcomes beyond ischemic stroke, such as hemorrhage from traumatic aneurysms, significant neurological deficits from AV fistulas, may be prevented. In critically ill sedated or neurologically compromised patients, not only neuroimaging and screening protocols are fundamental to achieve early diagnosis and minimize poor outcomes, but also increased awareness of ICU medical and non medical staff, optimization of medical management, and earlier treatment strategies, by applying best practice guidelines.

Neuroimaging can therefore play an important role in this context, especially for critically ill TBI patients when the neurological status is poor or sedation is required to manage intracranial hypertension or to help synchrony with the ventilator and cannot be clinically assessed.

### Traumatic brain injury in adults [^190f1364]. Practical Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major public health problem. This review aims to present the principles upon which modern TBI management should be based. The early management phase aims to achieve haemodynamic stability, limit secondary insults (eg hypotension, hypoxia), obtain accurate neurological assessment and appropriately select patients for further investigation. Since 2003, the mainstay of risk stratification in the UK emergency departments has been a system of triage based on clinical assessment, which then dictates the need for a CT scan of the head. For patients with acute subdural or extradural haematomas, time from clinical deterioration to operation should be kept to a minimum, as it can affect their outcome. In addition, it is increasingly recognised that patients with severe and moderate TBI should be managed in neuroscience centres, regardless of the need for neurosurgical intervention. The monitoring and treatment of raised intracranial pressure is paramount for maintaining cerebral blood supply and oxygen delivery in patients with severe TBI. Decompressive craniectomy and therapeutic hypothermia are the subject of ongoing international multi-centre randomised trials. TBI is associated with a number of complications, some of which require specialist referral. Patients with post-concussion syndrome can be helped by supportive management in the context of a multi-disciplinary neurotrauma clinic and by patient support groups. Specialist neurorehabilitation after TBI is important for improving outcome.

### Haemoglobin values, transfusion practices, and long-term outcomes in critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury: a secondary analysis of CENTER-TBI [^b00f921d]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) encompasses a spectrum of injuries resulting from external mechanical forces to the brain, leading to varying degrees of neurological impairment. While mild cases may present with transient symptoms, severe TBI can have profound and lasting consequences, including cognitive deficits, motor impairments, and emotional disturbances. Despite advancements in emergency care and neurosurgical interventions, the long-term sequelae of TBI often pose relevant challenges for patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers.

Central to the management of TBI is the prevention and mitigation of secondary brain injuries, which can occur in the hours to days following the initial trauma. Secondary insults, such as hypoxia, hypotension, cerebral oedema and ischemia, can exacerbate primary brain damage and significantly impact patients' outcomes. Among those, anaemia frequently coexists with TBI and has emerged as a critical determinant of patients' outcomes. The pathophysiology of anaemia in TBI is multifactorial, with contributions from acute blood loss, haemodilution, coagulopathy, and impaired erythropoiesis. Furthermore, anaemia in TBI is associated with a cascade of deleterious effects, including cerebral hypoxia, compromised tissue perfusion and increased susceptibility to secondary brain injuries. Consequently, patients with TBI and concomitant anaemia often experience worse neurological outcomes, prolonged hospitalisations and increased mortality rates compared to non-anaemic TBI patients.

The management of anaemia in TBI patients often involves administering red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to improve oxygen delivery and mitigate the adverse effects of low haemoglobin values. However, the use of RBC transfusions in this population is fraught with controversy due to concerns regarding potential complications, such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and increased risk of infections. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that exposure to RBC transfusion may be associated with worse outcomes in TBI patients. Thus, clinicians face the challenge of balancing the potential benefits and risks of anaemia and RBC transfusions in this context, necessitating a nuanced approach tailored to individual patient factors and clinical contexts.

Several knowledge gaps and inconsistencies persist without well-conducted randomised trials in this field. Firstly, the association between anaemia and unfavourable outcomes in TBI has been frequently evaluated in single-centre studies, with significant bias on results due to local practice and the limited correction for potential confounders. Moreover, considerable heterogeneity exists in transfusion practices across different healthcare settings, with variations in haemoglobin thresholds, triggers, and strategies. Consequently, there is a pressing need for large, multi-centric studies to elucidate the potential role of anaemia as a predictive factor for unfavourable outcomes after TBI and to refine how transfusion algorithms impact these findings.

### Medical complications after acquired pediatric injury to the central nervous system: a scoping review [^60ffbbdb]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This scoping review aims to give an overview of the literature describing medical complications in children from 2 to 17years, arising in the subacute and chronic phases after pediatric CNS injury, and to identify knowledge gaps on the subject.

Methods

Our scoping review of publications in databases Embase and Medline follows the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA).

Results

We identified 11,497 articles published from 2000 to 2024. Initial screening reduced these to 1,220, which were reviewed in full-text, resulting in inclusion of 373 publications. Acquired brain injury was the most common CNS injury, with neoplastic etiology as the dominating subgroup. The majority of the articles were retrospective studies and case studies. Most publications reported one complication, and comprehensive approaches were scarce. Epilepsy and endocrine disturbances were the most frequently reported complications in brain injury patients, and scoliosis and pressure ulcers predominated in the spinal cord injury group.

Conclusion

Despite a broad literature on the current topic, more longitudinal studies are needed, especially studies with a comprehensive approach to the medical complications that can occur after the acute phase in children with CNS injury.

### Pharmacological treatments for preventing epilepsy following traumatic head injury [^4741fe7f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Head injury is a common event and can cause a spectrum of motor and cognition disabilities. A frequent complication is seizures. Antiepileptic drugs (AED) such as phenytoin are often used in clinical practice with the hopes of preventing post-traumatic epilepsy. Whether immediate medical intervention following head trauma with either AEDs or neuroprotective drugs can alter the process of epileptogenesis and lead to a more favorable outcome is currently unknown. This review attempted to address the effectiveness of these treatment interventions. This review updates and expands on the earlier Cochrane review.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs and neuroprotective agents with placebo, usual care or other pharmacologic agents for the prevention of post-traumatic epilepsy in people diagnosed with any severity of traumatic brain injury.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Epilepsy Group's specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) in January 2015. We searched EMBASE, Biological Abstracts and National Research Register in September 2014 and SCOPUS in December 2013. The Cochrane Epilepsy Group performed handsearches of relevant journals.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that include AEDs or neuroprotective agents compared with placebo, another pharmacologic agent or a usual care group. The outcomes measured included a seizure occurring within one week of trauma (early seizure), seizure occurring later than one week post-trauma (late seizure), mortality and any adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted the data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each outcome. We used random-effects models in the meta-analyses and performed pre-defined subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

This review included 10 RCTs (reported in 12 articles) consisting of 2326 participants The methodological quality of the studies varied. The type of intervention was separated into three categories; AED versus placebo or standard care, alternative neuroprotective agent versus placebo or standard care and AED versus other AED. Treatment with an AED (phenytoin or carbamazepine) decreased the risk of early seizure compared with placebo or standard care (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.73; very low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in the risk of late seizure occurrence between AEDs and placebo or standard care (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.46; very low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a significant difference in all-cause mortality between AEDs and placebo or standard care (RR 1.08 95% CI 0.79 to 1.46, very low quality of evidence). Only one study looked at other potentially neuroprotective agents (magnesium sulfate) compared with placebo. The risk ratios were: late seizure 1.07 (95% CI 0.53 to 2.17) and all-cause mortality 1.20 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.81). The risk ratio for occurrence of early seizure was not estimable. Two studies looked at comparison of two AEDs (levetiracetam, valproate) with phenytoin used as the main comparator in each study. The risk ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.53 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.94). There was no evidence of treatment benefit of phenytoin compared with another AED for early seizures (RR 0.66, 95% 0.20 to 2.12) or late seizures(RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.30). Only two studies reported adverse events. The RR of any adverse event with AED compared with placebo was 1.65 (95% CI 0.73 to 3.66; low quality evidence). There were insufficient data on adverse events in the other treatment comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found low-quality evidence that early treatment with an AED compared with placebo or standard care reduced the risk of early post-traumatic seizures. There was no evidence to support a reduction in the risk of late seizures or mortality. There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding the effectiveness or safety of other neuroprotective agents compared with placebo or for the comparison of phenytoin, a traditional AED, with another AED.

Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACEP clinical policy — adult emergency department (ED) patients with minor head injury taking an anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication: For patients with a normal baseline neurologic examination and an initial head computed tomography (CT) without hemorrhage, Level A recommendations are none specified. Level B recommendations state, "Do not routinely perform repeat imaging in patients after a minor head injury who are taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medication and are at their baseline neurologic examination, provided the initial head CT showed no hemorrhage", and "Do not routinely admit or observe patients after a minor head injury who are taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications, who have an initial head CT without hemorrhage, and who do not meet any other criteria for extended monitoring". Level C recommendations are to "Provide instructions at discharge that include the symptoms of rare, delayed hemorrhage after a head injury (Consensus recommendation)" and "Consider outpatient referral for assessment of both fall risk and risk/benefit of anticoagulation therapy (Consensus recommendation)". Potential benefits include "A decrease in medical costs by avoiding unnecessary medical imaging or hospital observation, or admission", "Avoid inpatient health care-associated complications by avoiding excessive duration of stay in the ED or hospital", and "A decrease in length of stay for patients who could go home early from the ED without repeat imaging or prolonged observation". A potential harm is "A missed case of posttraumatic intracranial hemorrhage that could have benefited from early intervention".

### Stroke: another delayed hazard of traumatic brain injury, even in young adults [^ce962ae0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of injury‐related death and disability, and for a substantial number of patients after TBI, problems may persist, worsen, or develop later in life. TBI has been recognized as a chronic condition that may have multiple, lasting effects on health and functioning, especially at moderate‐to‐severe levels of injury. Over the long term, TBI can have important and devastating consequences for patients and their families and present a substantial economic burden to society. The chronic and later‐life consequences of TBI may be caused by persisting pathophysiologic brain dysfunction, related comorbidities, or a variety of secondary disorders that can develop after injury. Secondary psychiatric and neurological disorders, including stroke, are among the long‐term consequences of TBI. Post‐traumatic epilepsy is one well‐recognized neurological complication of TBI. TBI has also been associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease and others, with the strongest evidence to date linking TBI to Parkinson disease. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with substantial exposure to repetitive head impacts, even at a subconcussive level, most commonly occurring in contact sports; however, there has not been a clearly established relationship of chronic traumatic encephalopathy with TBI, in the absence of significant exposure to repetitive head impacts.

### Influence of medical comorbidities and complications on FIM change and length of stay during inpatient rehabilitation [^66a74811]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was performed to evaluate the influence of medical problems on functional outcome measures of patients admitted for comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation.

Design

In this retrospective database review of patients, demographic information, length of stay, FIM scores at admission and discharge, and FIM efficiency were collected and analyzed. Preexisting comorbidities and acute medical complications of all patients were identified, tabulated, and analyzed.

Results

A total of 175 patients were categorized into three major groups. In the postorthopedic surgery group, the presence of preexisting medical comorbidities did not significantly affect admission or discharge FIM scores. In contrast, traumatic brain injury patients with preexisting medical comorbidities had a tendency to be admitted and discharged with lower FIM scores. However, traumatic brain injury patients with acute medical complications still made reasonable functional improvement during their extended stay, so that their FIM efficiency was adequately maintained. In the cerebrovascular accident group, almost all patients had preexisting medical issues.

Conclusions

The rehabilitation population is diverse, and functional outcome measures for distinct disease entities may be differentially affected by factors such as preexisting medical comorbidities and acute medical complications. Except for life-threatening medical emergencies, rehabilitation patients may benefit by staying on the acute rehabilitation unit, where both medical management and a comprehensive rehabilitation program are provided with continuity.

### How to define and meet blood pressure targets after traumatic brain injury: a narrative review [^734cc3e2]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Second, changing ABP might cause or aggravate extracranial injuries in other (affected) organs. Extracranial complications are common and influence the outcome of TBI. Significant improvements in outcomes in a sizable proportion of patients could potentially be accomplished by improving the ability to prevent or reverse nonneurological complications.

Prioritizing perfusion pressures for one organ may come at the expense of others, potentially leading to complications like ARDS, pneumonia, or AKI. Prompt recognition and treatment of systemic complications are therefore fundamental to the care of this patient cohort. So far, the role of extracranial pathology has often been underestimated in outcome assessment because most clinicians focus mainly on intracranial lesions and injury rather than consider the systemic effects of TBI. Further studies are warranted to precisely understand and manage the multisystem response of the body after TBI and how individual treatment levels, such as CPP, should be adjusted.

### Clinical evidence of inflammation driving secondary brain injury: a systematic review [^11834fb1]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite advances in both prevention and treatment, traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the most burdensome diseases; 2% of the US population currently lives with disabilities resulting from TBI. Recent advances in the understanding of inflammation and its impact on the pathophysiology of trauma have increased the interest in inflammation as a possible mediator in TBI outcome.

Objectives

The goal of this systematic review is to address the question: "What is the evidence in humans that inflammation is linked to secondary brain injury?" As the experimental evidence has been well described elsewhere, this review will focus on the clinical evidence for inflammation as a mechanism of secondary brain injury.

Data Sources

Medline database (1996-Week 1 June 2014), Pubmed and Google Scholar databases were queried for relevant studies.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Studies were eligible if participants were adults and/or children who sustained moderate or severe TBI in the acute phase of injury, published in English. Studies published in the last decade (since 2004) were preferentially included. Trials could be observational or interventional in nature.

Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

To address the quality of the studies retrieved, we applied the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to assess the limitations of the included studies.

Results

Trauma initiates local central nervous system as well as systemic immune activation. Numerous observational studies describe elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are associated with important clinical variables including neurologic outcome and mortality. A small number of clinical trials have included immunomodulating strategies, but no intervention to date has proven effective in improving outcomes after TBI.

Limitations

Inclusion of studies not initially retrieved by the search terms may have biased our results. Additionally, some reports may have been inadvertently excluded due to use of non-search term key words. Conclusions and Implications of Key Findings Clinical evidence of inflammation causing secondary brain injury in humans is gaining momentum. While inflammation is certainly present, it is not clear from the literature at what juncture inflammation becomes maladaptive, promoting secondary injury rather than facilitating repairand identifying patients with maladaptive inflammation (neuro-inflammation, systemic, or both) after TBI remains elusive. Direct agonism/antagonism represents an exciting target for future study.

### Traumatic brain injury: a disease process, not an event [^53afcd4f]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2010). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is seen by the insurance industry and many health care providers as an "event". Once treated and provided with a brief period of rehabilitation, the perception exists that patients with a TBI require little further treatment and face no lasting effects on the central nervous system or other organ systems. In fact, TBI is a chronic disease process, one that fits the World Health Organization definition as having one or more of the following characteristics: it is permanent, caused by non-reversible pathological alterations, requires special training of the patient for rehabilitation, and/or may require a long period of observation, supervision, or care. TBI increases long-term mortality and reduces life expectancy. It is associated with increased incidences of seizures, sleep disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, neuroendocrine dysregulation, and psychiatric diseases, as well as non-neurological disorders such as sexual dysfunction, bladder and bowel incontinence, and systemic metabolic dysregulation that may arise and/or persist for months to years post-injury. The purpose of this article is to encourage the classification of TBI as the beginning of an ongoing, perhaps lifelong process, that impacts multiple organ systems and may be disease causative and accelerative. Our intent is not to discourage patients with TBI or their families and caregivers, but rather to emphasize that TBI should be managed as a chronic disease and defined as such by health care and insurance providers. Furthermore, if the chronic nature of TBI is recognized by government and private funding agencies, research can be directed at discovering therapies that may interrupt the disease processes months or even years after the initiating event.

Key points
- A TBI affects how the brain works.
- TBI is a major cause of death and disability.
- TBIs may be missed in older adults.
- A TBI may lead to short- or long-term health problems.
- A TBI during childhood may affect brain development. TBI is a major cause of death and disability There were over 69, 000 TBI-related deaths in the United States in 2021. That's about 190 TBI-related deaths every day. TBIs affect the lives of people of all ages. Anyone can experience a TBI, but data suggest that some groups are at greater risk of dying from a TBI or experiencing long-term health problems after the injury. Examples of groups who are more likely to be affected by TBI, include: Populations TBIs may be missed in older adults Older adults are more likely to be hospitalized and die from a TBI compared to all other age groups.

Still, TBIs may be missed or misdiagnosed in older adults because symptoms of TBI overlap with other medical conditions that are more common among older adults, such as dementia. Healthcare providers should check for signs and symptoms of TBI if an older adult has:

- Fallen or has a fall-related injury, such as a hip fracture.
- Been in a car crash. This is especially important among older adults who are taking blood thinners, such as:

- Anticoagulants like warfarin, rivaroxaban, and apixaban.
- Antiplatelet medications like clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and acetylsalicylic acid. These medicines may increase the risk for bleeding in the brain following a TBI. Potential effects of TBIs. A TBI may lead to short- or long-term health problems Depending on the severity of the injury, those who get a TBI may face health problems that last a few days or the rest of their lives.

For example, a person with a mild TBI or concussion may experience short-term symptoms and feel better within a couple of weeks or months. And a person with a moderate or severe TBI may have long-term or life-long effects from the injury.

### Meningeal lymphatic dysfunction exacerbates traumatic brain injury pathogenesis [^9925bb25]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions of people worldwide each year. TBI can cause debilitating impairments in motor function, cognition, sensory function, and mental health. In addition, mounting evidence indicates that having a history of TBI markedly increases the risk of developing numerous other neurological disorders later in life including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, depression, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis –. Despite being a prevalent and pressing global medical issue, the pathoetiology of TBI remains incompletely understood and improved treatment options are desperately needed.

Tissue damage and cellular stress resulting from TBI incites activation of the immune system, which is intended to aid in the disposal of neurotoxic material and coordinate tissue repair. While immune responses can play beneficial roles in TBI, unchecked and/or chronic immune activation following brain trauma can lead to secondary tissue damage, brain atrophy, and eventual neurological dysfunction –. Notably, the inability to properly dispose of danger/damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as protein aggregates, necrotic cells, and cellular debris is widely thought to be a pivotal driver of both persistent and maladaptive immune activation in numerous neurological disorders. In the case of central nervous system (CNS) injury, inefficient removal of DAMPs has been proposed to perpetuate neuroinflammation and incite secondary CNS pathology and neurological complications. However, we currently lack complete knowledge of the drainage pathways that the brain relies on to dispose of DAMPs and resolve tissue damage following TBI.

### Early major fracture care in polytrauma-priorities in the context of concomitant injuries: a Delphi consensus process and systematic review [^8099e38c]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic Brain Injury

Avoiding secondary brain damage is crucial, and several publications support our recommendations. Currently, early definitive treatment of major fractures is only recommended for patients with mild traumatic brain injury. In cases of more severe intracranial injuries, the concern for cerebral complications is great, and their prevention is of utmost importance.

Several publications have investigated the effects of delayed fracture fixation after mild traumatic brain injury but have failed to prove an effect on complication rates or neurological outcomes. While the second-hit phenomenon is well described, some authors have raised doubts about its relevance in patients with mild traumatic brain injury. The brain versus bone multicenter trial involved 520 patients with lower extremity fractures and mild to severe traumatic brain injury. They examined the effect of the timing of lower extremity fracture fixation on neurological outcomes. The results suggest that neurological outcomes are largely dependent on the severity of the initial brain injury rather than the surgical care provided to treat associated injuries.

In general, in the presence of significant intracranial pathologies, delayed definitive fracture fixation is recommended if further progression is observed on follow-up head CT. An increase in intracranial pressure (ICP > 20 mm Hg) and a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP < 60/70 mm Hg) is associated with a significant increase in mortality. These thresholds are also recommended in the recent Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury. Accordingly, secondary reconstructions of fractures are justified in patients with stable Glasgow Coma Scale, no deterioration seen on follow-up head CT, or improvements of the parameters mentioned above (ICP, CPP).

Thoracic Trauma

The primary goal in the management of patients with chest trauma is to maintain oxygenation and ventilation and to prevent secondary complications, such as pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Recent systematic reviews of prospective and retrospective studies suggest that early definitive treatment of fractures may be used safely for most patients with chest injuries, depending on the criteria mentioned previouslyand refined later. It is unclear whether certain surgical techniques affect pulmonary function, as the only studies available were on reamed versus unreamed femoral nailing and studies comparing different reamer types.

A meta-analysis did not show significantly increased rates of pulmonary complications such as pneumonia and mortality in patients with thoracic trauma. However, patients with bilateral chest injuries require special attention as they have a higher rate of complications, especially in the presence of bilateral pulmonary contusions and/or hemothoraces and pneumothoraces. In those patients, it is recommended that temporary external fixation of fractures be performed.

### Chronic impact of traumatic brain injury on outcome and quality of life: a narrative review [^2be9cfa4]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Traditionally seen as a sudden, brutal event with short-term consequences, TBI may cause persistent, sometimes life-long, consequences.

A huge amount of work has been invested in improving early TBI care, from rescue to emergency surgical interventions, prevention of secondary insults, acute treatment of intracranial hypertension in intensive care, etc. Data bases with ten thousands of patients have been assembled to better define diagnosis, management, and prognosis in the acute phase. In contrast, fewer data, usually on a very limited numbers of cases, are available on long-term outcomes. This is striking, because bringing patients with head injuries back to an enjoyable life should be the ultimate goal of any treatment.

Important long-term consequences have been identified not only after severe TBI but also in a relevant proportion of cases previously classified as moderate or mild.

Better understanding of the damage mechanisms and new approaches to neuroprotection-restoration may offer better outcomes for millions of survivors of TBI.

### Long-term health outcomes of traumatic brain injury in veterans… [^f63f1fce]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Traumatic brain injury has become one of the most prevalent battle wounds among veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. According to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, 1 nearly 414 000 service members worldwide sustained TBI between 2000 and late 2019. More than 185 000 veterans receiving Veterans Affairs health care have received at least 1 diagnosis of TBI, mostly mild cases. The impact of TBI and related conditions substantially burdens service members, families, clinicians, and health systems.

1. Numerous psychiatric and medical consequences arise after TBI, including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal thoughts, cognitive deficits, chronic pain, and unemployment. TBI severity appears to be linked to certain outcomes. Given this backdrop, the analysis by Stewart et al2 provides a timely probe of associations between TBI severity and subsequent risk of brain cancer in this vulnerable patient cohort.

This retrospective cohort study analyzed records of more than 1. 9 million post-9/11 veterans. Notable findings indicate that moderate, severe, and penetrating TBI were associated with elevated brain cancer risk, but mild TBI was not. This finding suggests that severe TBI may predispose veterans to brain cancer, whereas mild TBI likely is not associated with heightened risk. Crude incidence rates per 100 000 person-years were 3. 06 for no TBI,
2. 85 for mild TBI, 4. 88 for moderate/severe TBI, and
10. 34 for penetrating TBI, displaying a stepwise increase in brain cancer incidence corresponding to worse TBI severity.
2. As we continue disentangling connections between combat injury and long-term health, a promising research avenue examines relationships between specific neurotrauma biomechanics and subsequent neurodegeneration.

Assessment of TBI biomechanics using computational modeling tools such as finite element analysis facilitates replicating and evaluating resulting brain damage that otherwise would be difficult to access. Such simulations aid injury diagnosis and early identification of long-term damage, thereby promoting preventative measures and timely treatment. Overall, this study2 provides meaningful data clarifying associations between combat-related TBI severity and subsequent brain cancer risk among post-9/11 veterans. Elucidating potential connections between battlefield trauma and longer-term health outcomes is imperative to inform prevention and care approaches for those who have served. In particular, because the PACT Act expands access and benefits for veterans affected by illness that may relate to hazardous exposures, understanding contributors is critical.

### Position statement: definition of traumatic brain injury [^a3b15c28]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2010). Low credibility.

A clear, concise definition of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is fundamental for reporting, comparison, and interpretation of studies on TBI. Changing epidemiologic patterns, an increasing recognition of significance of mild TBI, and a better understanding of the subtler neurocognitive neuroaffective deficits that may result from these injuries make this need even more critical. The Demographics and Clinical Assessment Working Group of the International and Interagency Initiative toward Common Data Elements for Research on Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health has therefore formed an expert group that proposes the following definition: In this article, we discuss criteria for considering or establishing a diagnosis of TBI, with a particular focus on the problems how a diagnosis of TBI can be made when patients present late after injury and how mild TBI may be differentiated from non-TBI causes with similar symptoms. Technologic advances in magnetic resonance imaging and the development of biomarkers offer potential for improving diagnostic accuracy in these situations.

### Updates in traumatic brain injury management: brain oxygenation, middle meningeal artery embolization and new protocols [^5cdeb1de]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) confers a significant healthcare burden, reported to result in 190 deaths per day in the USA, disabling far more, and accruing billions of dollars in healthcare expenditures per year. Trauma surgeons treat patients with TBI and its sequelae, daily. Understanding the pathophysiology, and current research and recommendations are vital to improving care for this vast population of patients.

Brain injury includes both primary injury and secondary injury. Primary injury denotes the initial insult that occurs immediately following trauma. Secondary injury evolves over the subsequent hours to days and occurs due to altered cerebral metabolism, cerebral blood flow and arterial oxygen content. Current medical therapies include efforts to improve hemodynamics by altering blood pressure and intracranial volumes are meant to optimize cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and intracranial pressure (ICP). However, ICP alterations occur due to a variety of pathologies, including mass effect, edema, cerebrospinal fluid disturbances and venous outflow obstruction. As such, it is an indiscriminate marker of the truly desired endpoints of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation. Although measurement of ICP in patients with moderate to severe TBI is helpful, ICP elevations may be a late indicator of deterioration, are non-specific and may limit time for intervention and prevention of further injury. Authors continue to investigate methods to enhance brain perfusion and oxygenation in efforts to improve outcomes for patients with TBI.

Furthermore, the use of middle meningeal artery embolization (MMAE) has increased in popularity for the treatment of chronic and recurrent subdural hematoma (SDH). Historical management of chronic SDH (cSDH) included surgical intervention, but this interventional technique affords resolution with an acceptable complication rate. In this manuscript, we review the updates in TBI management, including brain oxygenation, MMAE and newly recommended protocols.

### Reversal of antithrombotic medications in patients with traumatic brain injury: what you need to know [^071d4d57]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem and patients with TBI are frequently encountered by trauma surgeons. When TBI occurs in patients who are also taking antithrombotic medications, the risks and complications are increased. Antithrombotic medications can be classified as antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. Examples of antiplatelet agents include aspirin and clopidogrel. Anticoagulant medications include vitamin K antagonists like warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants, and unfractionated or low-molecular-weight forms of heparin. Each of these agents alter the hemostatic balance through different mechanisms and therefore require distinct reversal strategies. Initial management of TBI in patients receiving antithrombotic agents includes prompt neurological assessment, non-contrast head computed tomography, and laboratory testing to assess coagulation status. Decisions regarding possible reversal of antithrombotic medications must be guided by the severity of injury, bleeding risk, patient co-morbidities, and the specific agents used. This review will discuss what trauma surgeons need to know in terms of managing patients with acute TBI who are taking anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications based on the current literature.

### Clinical review: statins and trauma – a systematic review [^21e9a0e4]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The diagnosis 'trauma' encompasses a wide variety of direct injuries, associated complications, such as infection, and the consequences of treatment, such as lung injury caused by ventilation or blood transfusion. Patients who have suffered injury therefore constitute a highly heterogeneous group. Nevertheless, there are underlying mechanistic similarities that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Trauma is characterised by inflammation, both local and systemic, and the degree of inflammation is proportional to the magnitude of the combined insult of injury and treatment. A recent review of the epidemiology of civilian trauma deaths has shown that central nervous system injury continues to be the predominant cause of death after trauma (21.6 to 71.5%), followed by exsanguination (12.5 to 26.6%), sepsis (3.1 to17%) and multi-organ failure (1.6 to 9%). Over the past decade, a decrease (15 to 25%) in the proportion of haemorrhage-related deaths has been observed, in contrast to deaths due to traumatic brain injury, sepsis, and multi-organ failure, which have not decreased. These conditions are strongly related to excessive and injurious inflammation. Treatments to control or modulate the inflammatory response could help to mitigate against complications associated with these conditions. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are potentially attractive agents because they are generally safe and well tolerated drugs. As a result, treatment with statins is being investigated in a number of infective and inflammatory conditions, particularly in the critical care setting. It is therefore not surprising that the possible effect of these drugs in trauma patients has also been considered.

This review has considered four separate groups of trauma patients, in whom pre-injury statin use, or post-injury statin treatment, has been evaluated. In total, there are only seven studies, four of which are observational. Three of these studies suggest improvements in a variety of clinical outcomes (mortality, infection, septic shock in burns patients; mortality in trauma patients in general; mortality in brain injured patients) in patients taking statins prior to injury, whereas one showed no difference in mortality or infection, and an increased risk of multi-organ failure, in general trauma patients. The design of these studies makes them susceptible to confounding, and in particular, the 'healthy user effect'. Further limitations were the age range and comorbidity of the participants, which was determined by the primary indication for commencing statin treatment. As a result, none of the observational studies included patients below the age of 55, and few below the age of 65.

### Acute management of traumatic brain injury [^34e2cb8f]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in patients with trauma. Management strategies must focus on preventing secondary injury by avoiding hypotension and hypoxia and maintaining appropriate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), which is a surrogate for cerebral blood flow. CPP can be maintained by increasing mean arterial pressure, decreasing intracranial pressure, or both. The goal should be euvolemia and avoidance of hypotension. Other factors that deserve important consideration in the acute management of patients with TBI are venous thromboembolism, stress ulcer, and seizure prophylaxis, as well as nutritional and metabolic optimization.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious health risk for older adults, and the consequences of TBI range from full recovery to death. For many who survive, there is a legacy of cognitive, physical, and emotional disability. Falls are the major cause of head injury in older adults. There are many risk factors including pre-existing brain disease, other diseases, and, sometimes, iatrogenic factors. Efforts directed at prevention are of great importance. Outcome studies indicate that outcome is generally worse for older people than for younger people with similar injuries, but older individuals also deserve aggressive rehabilitation directed at the best possible recovery.

### Red blood cell transfusions are not associated with incident complications or poor outcomes in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage [^fe96ccab]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Poor outcomes after ICH are largely due to initial cerebral tissue injury from the hematoma itself, as well as secondary brain injury, which can be caused by direct or indirect impairment of adequate cerebral tissue oxygen delivery. Low hemoglobin concentrations have consistently been associated with poor ICH outcomes. It is currently posited that low hemoglobin's relationship with poor outcomes is driven by impaired cerebral oxygen delivery causing secondary brain injury, as well as the association of low hemoglobin with hematoma expansion.

It remains unknown whether red blood cell (RBC) transfusions can be used as a treatment to modify hemoglobin concentrations to improve ICH outcomes. Liberal RBC transfusion paradigms are currently being explored in prospective randomized clinical treatment trials for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury. But no such studies have yet been proposed for patients with ICH, as it is currently uncertain how RBC transfusions affect ICH outcomes, and whether these transfusions carry inherent risks in this vulnerable patient group. There are reported relationships of RBC transfusions with thromboembolic and infectious complications, as well as poor outcomes in both general hospitalized patients and patients with brain injury without ICH. However, lack of detailed data on timing of RBC transfusion exposure and subsequent complications in these studies have limited an understanding of whether RBC transfusions themselves associate with these downstream complications. Additionally, it is unclear whether the associations of RBC transfusions with these complications are similarly relevant in patients with ICH specifically.

Given that thromboembolic and infectious complications are known to be associated with worse ICH outcomes, further work is necessary to characterize whether RBC transfusions potentially confer downstream complication risks in patients with ICH to best assess safety of potential future RBC transfusion approaches. Subsequently, we sought to investigate the relationship of RBC transfusion with incident thromboembolic and infectious complications and clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with ICH. We hypothesized that after accounting for medical and ICH severity, RBC transfusion would not be associated with higher incident complications or worse clinical outcomes.

### Chronic endocrine consequences of traumatic brain injury-what is the evidence? [^03fa3fa8]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem with potentially debilitating consequences for the individual. Hypopituitarism after TBI has received increasing attention over the past decade; development of the condition as a consequence of TBI was previously hardly mentioned in textbooks on the subject. Hypopituitarism has been reported in more than 25% of patients with TBI and is now thought to be one of the most important causes of treatable morbidity in TBI survivors. However, most clinicians dealing with neuroendocrine diseases and TBI generally do not see such a high incidence of hypopituitarism. This disproportion is not clearly explained, but recent data indicate that diagnostic testing, which is designed for high-risk populations and not for a cohort of patients with, for example, de novo isolated growth hormone deficiency (the predominant finding in TBI), might have overestimated the true risk and disease burden of hypopituitarism. In this Opinion article, we discuss current recommendations for post-traumatic hypopituitarism in light of recent evidence.

Conclusions

TBI is a major global health challenge and priority. There are several promising lines of research directed towards optimising neurointensive care protocols, developing an evidence base for surgical intervention, and translating promising neuroprotective pharmacotherapies into application to human pathology. The importance of personalised medicine and combinatorial therapy in the field of TBI cannot be overstated given the heterogeneity of the pathology such that a single intervention cannot address every pathological mechanism at play. This is at odds with conventional randomized control trial methodology and may underpin the large number of failures of RCTs to demonstrate any benefit in this pathology.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^4887b7d6]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) guideline — evidence appraisal domains are defined for consistency, directness, and precision. Consistency is "the extent to which the results and conclusions are similar across studies" and is rated "High (all are similar), Moderate (most are similar), Low (no one conclusion is more frequent)" with "NA (not applicable) when the body of evidence consists of a single study". Directness is defined as whether "the study population is the same as the population of interest and whether the study includes clinical rather than intermediate outcomes", and indirect is noted "if the population differs; for example if the study includes both moderate and severe TBI or patients with stroke or TBI and does not separate the results by these population characteristics, or if the outcomes are not mortality or neurological function"; "indirect evidence was only included if no direct evidence was found". Precision is "the degree of certainty surrounding the effect estimate for a given outcome", is rated "High, Moderate, and Low", and determination "may include consideration of the range of confidence intervals or the significance level of p-values".

### Development and validation of a model to identify critical brain injuries using natural language processing of text computed tomography reports [^fc44cdcf]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute brain injuries, including ischemic strokes, intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs), subarachnoid hemorrhages, and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), are often associated with morbidity and mortality, with impacts on both patients and their families. More than 1 million people in the US experience acute brain injury yearly. Improving our ability to predict complications and long-term outcomes in acute brain injury is essential for informed medical decision-making and optimal care. Increasingly, investigators are using large multi-institutional data sets for insights.

A major obstacle to developing multi-institutional data sets is efficient and accurate data extraction and interpretation. Radiographic imaging is critical in acute brain injury. Features in these images, can be analyzed with machine learning (ML) techniques, such as radiomics, image segmentation, or volumetric analyses. However, many of these methods are not broadly accessible and require specialized, high-resolution images and significant image processing infrastructure.

### Platelet dysfunction after traumatic brain injury: a review [^dc8a007a]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Coagulopathy is a known sequela of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Platelet dysfunction has been identified as one of several etiologies of coagulopathy following TBI and has been associated with poor outcomes. Regardless of whether the platelet dysfunction occurs as a direct consequence of the injury or because of pre-existing medical comorbidities or medication use, accurate detection and monitoring of response to therapy is key to optimal patient care. Platelet transfusion has been proposed as a potential therapeutic intervention to treat platelet dysfunction, with several studies using platelet function assays to monitor response. The development of increasingly precise diagnostic testing is providing enhanced understanding of the specific derangement in the hemostatic process, allowing clinicians to provide patient-specific treatment plans. There is wide variability in the currently available literature on the incidence and clinical significance of platelet dysfunction following TBI, which creates challenges with developing evidence-based management guidelines. The relatively high prevalence of platelet inhibitor therapy serves as an additional confounding factor. In addition, the data are largely retrospective in nature. We performed a literature review to provide clarity on this clinical issue. We reviewed 348 abstracts, and included 97 manuscripts in our final literature review. Based on the currently available research, platelet dysfunction has been consistently demonstrated in patients with moderate-severe TBI. We recommend the use of platelet functional assays to evaluate patients with TBI. Platelet transfusion directed at platelet dysfunction may lead to improved clinical outcome. A randomized trial guided by implementation science could improve the applicability of these practices.

### Effect of administration of neuromuscular blocking agents in children with severe traumatic brain injury on acute complication rates and outcomes: a secondary analysis from a randomized, controlled trial of therapeutic hypothermia [^e41b7a7f]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the association between neuromuscular blocking agents and outcome, intracranial pressure, and medical complications in children with severe traumatic brain injury.

Design

A secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled trial of therapeutic hypothermia.

Setting

Seventeen hospitals in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.

Patients

Children (< 18 yr) with severe traumatic brain injury.

Interventions

None for this secondary analysis.

Measurements and Main Results

Children received neuromuscular blocking agent on the majority of days of the study (69.6%), and the modified Pediatric Intensity Level of Therapy scores (modified by removing neuromuscular blocking agent administration from the score) were increased on days when neuromuscular blocking agents were used (9.67 ± 0.21 vs 5.48 ± 0.26; p < 0.001). Children were stratified into groups based on exposure to neuromuscular blocking agents (group 1 received neuromuscular blocking agents each study day; group 2 did not). Group 1 had increased number of daily intracranial pressure readings more than 20 mm Hg (4.4 ± 1.1 vs 2.4 ± 0.5; p = 0.015) and longer ICU and hospital length of stay (p = 0.003 and 0.07, respectively, Kaplan-Meier). The Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended for Pediatrics at hospital discharge and 3, 6, and 12 months after traumatic brain injury and medical complications observed during the acute hospitalization were similar between groups.

Conclusions

Administration of neuromuscular blocking agents was ubiquitous and daily administration of neuromuscular blocking agents was associated with intracranial hypertension but not outcomes-likely indicating that increased injury severity prompted their use. Despite this, neuromuscular blocking agent use was not associated with complications. A different study design-perhaps using randomization or methodologies-of a larger cohort will be required to determine if neuromuscular blocking agent use is helpful after severe traumatic brain injury in children.

### Impact of non-neurological complications in severe traumatic brain injury outcome [^81741be8]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-neurological complications in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are frequent, worsening the prognosis, but the pathophysiology of systemic complications after TBI is unclear. The purpose of this study was to analyze non-neurological complications in patients with severe TBI admitted to the ICU, the impact of these complications on mortality, and their possible correlation with TBI severity.

Methods

An observational retrospective cohort study was conducted in one multidisciplinary ICU of a university hospital (35 beds); 224 consecutive adult patients with severe TBI (initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 9) admitted to the ICU were included. Neurological and non-neurological variables were recorded.

Results

Sepsis occurred in 75% of patients, respiratory infections in 68%, hypotension in 44%, severe respiratory failure (arterial oxygen pressure/oxygen inspired fraction ratio (PaO₂/FiO₂) < 200) in 41% and acute kidney injury (AKI) in 8%. The multivariate analysis showed that Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) at one year was independently associated with age, initial GCS 3 to 5, worst Traumatic Coma Data Bank (TCDB) first computed tomography (CT) scan and the presence of intracranial hypertension but not AKI. Hospital mortality was independently associated with initial GSC 3 to 5, worst TCDB first CT scan, the presence of intracranial hypertension and AKI. The presence of AKI regardless of GCS multiplied risk of death 6.17 times (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.37 to 27.78) (P < 0.02), while ICU hypotension increased the risk of death in patients with initial scores of 3 to 5 on the GCS 4.28 times (95% CI: 1.22 to 15.07) (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Low initial GCS, worst first CT scan, intracranial hypertension and AKI determined hospital mortality in severe TBI patients. Besides the direct effect of low GCS on mortality, this neurological condition also is associated with ICU hypotension which increases hospital mortality among patients with severe TBI. These findings add to previous studies that showed that non-neurological complications increase the length of stay and morbidity in the ICU but do not increase mortality, with the exception of AKI and hypotension in low GCS (3 to 5).

Methods — systematic reviews and guidelines development for traumatic brain injury (TBI) emphasize that this edition improved fidelity to pre-specified inclusion criteria, added assessment of the quality of the body of available evidence to address specific questions, and used overall quality and applicability to support recommendations. Future work will examine criteria for inclusion and the criteria used to rate the quality of individual studies, the quality of the body of evidence, and applicability, while considering new methods as they become available. The process will reach out to stakeholders and draw on multiple communities to develop a framework that explicitly incorporates all steps from topic identification, through topic refinement, evidence synthesis, development of recommendations, and dissemination, to the prioritization of future research.

### Effects of intraoperative lung-protective ventilation on clinical outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial [^d782b243]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major medical and socioeconomic problem. Over 50 million people worldwide experience TBI every year, and the morbidity has increased in the past decade. TBI causes a wide range of systemic effects. It was reported that 89% of severe TBI patients experienced at least one non-neurological complication, of which 81% developed respiratory dysfunction, including 23% of respiratory failure cases. Hence, respiratory complications are prevalent non-neurological disorders experienced after TBI. In addition, neural and humoral regulation after injury leads to an attenuated response of lung tissues to stress, thus increasing the risk of pulmonary complications, especially pulmonary infection, neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE), ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI), and atelectasis.

In general anesthesia, tidal volume (VT) was usually set at 10-15mL/kg corrected body weight (CBW) before, which is higher than that of most mammals with spontaneous respiration. High VT ventilation may cause alveolar overdistention, inflammatory mediator spillover, and VALI. Currently, lung-protective ventilation (LPV) is defined as VT ≤ 8mL/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ≥ 5cmH₂O, and airway plateau pressure (Pplat) ≤ 30cmH₂O, which is recognized as the optimal ventilation mode for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the intensive care unit (ICU). In view of satisfactory application of LPV in ARDS patients, perioperative lung protection in the operating room has also been highlighted by anesthesiologists.

Applicability — across identified studies of DVT prophylaxis in traumatic brain injury, results "reported [were] in patients with a wide range of severities", and there is "sufficient uncertainty about differences in the relevant physiology across pathologies to warrant caution when considering studies of patients with mixed pathologies as indirect evidence"; mixed-severity studies raised whether bleeding risk relates to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), yet the authors "decided using studies with mixed severity was the better option", noting uncertainty over using initial post-resuscitation GCS as inclusion criteria when treatment decisions may occur hours or days later.

Pediatric considerations — extracranial surgery in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI): Children frequently experience polytrauma in association with head trauma, and at least a third of children with severe TBI require extracranial surgery. The severity of TBI is also a predictor for complications related to intraoperative hypotension or hypoxia, which are predictors of poor outcomes for these patients. No definitive data exist to suggest a different management paradigm of extracranial injuries for children; thus, prioritize hemodynamic stability to minimize significant secondary brain injury.

### Coagulopathy in traumatic brain injury [^bf25822d]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in blood coagulation, although quite common after traumatic brain injury (TBI), are of unknown significance. The authors review the clinical and pathophysiological features of this phenomenon and emphasize its origin in disseminated intravascular coagulation. This connection provides a possible explanation for much of the cerebral ischemia that accompanies TBI, namely intravascular microthrombosis. The authors' own research findings support this contention and suggest possible therapeutic avenues. A number of compelling studies demonstrate that DIC is a common and important consequence of TBI. In particular, posttraumatic coagulopathy appears to be linked to secondary cerebral injury. Although the extent of this process has yet to be elucidated fully, coagulation abnormalities are evident soon after trauma. This allows early identification of patients likely to suffer secondary complications and provides an opportunity to evaluate promising agents that may mitigate posttraumatic DIC and related pathologies in these patients. This is an area deserving of more intensive research.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^ea1a59f0]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Older adult considerations — severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and aging inform extracranial intervention decisions: Severe TBI and age > 65 years are known to be independent prognostic factors for mortality during the initial hospital stay, and older adult patients presenting with polytrauma are vulnerable to more severe injury, longer LOS, and a greater likelihood of mortality than younger patients with similar injuries. These findings are associated with geriatric patients having a greater likelihood of comorbid medical conditions, preexisting neurologic or psychiatric diagnoses, and chronic antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy; therefore, weigh these factors when contemplating extracranial interventions, because they may influence decisions with respect to the timing and the extent of procedures to be performed.
