## Question

19 yo F with newly diagnosed Crohn’s disease develops moderate acne unresponsive to topical therapy. Dermatologist recommends oral minocycline 100 mg BID for 12 weeks. Current meds: prednisone 20 mg daily, azathioprine 150 mg daily. You are asked to prescribe minocycline—okay to proceed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe and appropriate to prescribe oral minocycline 100 mg twice daily for 12 weeks for moderate acne in a 19-year-old woman with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease who is currently taking prednisone 20 mg daily and azathioprine 150 mg daily. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's immunologic context and infection risk. Then, I should verify minocycline's safety profile, especially autoimmune and hepatotoxic risks. Next, I will review antibiotic stewardship and guideline-concordant alternatives. After that, I need to check for drug–drug interactions and monitoring requirements. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit conclusion and outline a safer, evidence-based plan with contingencies if antibiotics are unavoidable.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline risk. Crohn's disease itself confers increased infection susceptibility, and prednisone at 20 mg daily adds immunosuppression, while azathioprine further suppresses cell-mediated immunity and carries risks of myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity; together, this profile elevates risks for serious infections and drug-induced liver injury, so I need to be cautious about adding agents with autoimmune or hepatic liabilities [^3807e713] [^7b09bcd8].

> Now, I should review minocycline's safety signals. Minocycline has a well-described propensity to trigger autoimmune phenomena, including drug-induced lupus, autoimmune hepatitis, and vasculitis, with latency that can extend beyond 12 months in some cases; the absolute risk is low but clinically meaningful and higher than with doxycycline, and the consequences can be severe and require prolonged immunosuppression, which is exactly the scenario we want to avoid in someone already immunosuppressed [^2ed1a6ec] [^dcda72ff] [^08d56c35].

> Wait, let me verify hepatotoxicity specifics because that matters here. Minocycline can cause idiosyncratic autoimmune hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure; given the patient is on azathioprine, which itself carries hepatotoxic risk and mandates routine LFT monitoring, layering minocycline meaningfully increases the risk of liver injury and complicates attribution if enzymes rise, so I should avoid that combination when alternatives exist [^2ed1a6ec] [^7b09bcd8].

> I need to check antibiotic stewardship and guideline direction. Contemporary dermatology guidelines emphasize limiting systemic antibiotic duration, avoiding monotherapy, and preferring doxycycline over minocycline when a tetracycline is indicated; they also note insufficient evidence to support long-term minocycline use and highlight higher rates of serious adverse events with minocycline compared with other tetracyclines, reinforcing the choice to avoid minocycline in this patient [^644168d6] [^e933cbf9] [^339cd838].

> Hold on, I should verify whether there is any unique benefit to minocycline here that would override risks. Evidence does not show minocycline is superior to doxycycline for acne, and Cochrane reviews conclude no reliable evidence supports minocycline as first-line over alternatives; thus, there is no efficacy justification to accept the additional autoimmune and hepatic risks in an immunocompromised host [^dcda72ff] [^39344a5b].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions and practical monitoring. There is no direct pharmacokinetic clash with prednisone or azathioprine, but the cumulative immunosuppression and hepatotoxic potential are the key issues; if a tetracycline were absolutely necessary, I would choose doxycycline with explicit counseling on photosensitivity and GI upset, and I would intensify LFT monitoring given azathioprine, but even then I would keep the course as short as possible and pair with topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide to avoid monotherapy [^644168d6] [^7b09bcd8].

> But wait, what if the acne is steroid-induced or otherwise atypical. Steroids can worsen or trigger acneiform eruptions, and in IBD populations drug-induced acne is common; in that scenario, the priority is to treat the underlying disease and minimize steroid exposure while using topical regimens and considering non-antibiotic systemic options like isotretinoin for refractory disease rather than layering an immunologically risky antibiotic [^1e974a36] [^6b760b61].

> I should double-check safer, guideline-concordant alternatives. Topical retinoids plus benzoyl peroxide remain first-line for moderate acne, with escalation to topical combinations or oral antibiotics only when necessary; if an oral antibiotic is unavoidable, doxycycline is preferred over minocycline, and sarecycline is a reasonable narrow-spectrum alternative with favorable tolerability, though cost and access may limit use; importantly, any oral antibiotic should be time-limited and paired with topical maintenance to mitigate resistance and adverse effects [^644168d6] [^c42533bc] [^e933cbf9].

> Let me reconsider the original request one more time to ensure I'm not missing a niche indication. The dermatologist's plan for minocycline 100 mg twice daily for 12 weeks is not aligned with current safety-focused guidance in an immunocompromised patient with Crohn's disease on prednisone and azathioprine; the autoimmune and hepatotoxic risks of minocycline are nontrivial in this context, and there is no compensatory efficacy advantage to justify those risks, so I should not proceed with minocycline [^2ed1a6ec] [^644168d6] [^dcda72ff].

> Final recommendation: Do not prescribe oral minocycline in this patient. Instead, optimize topical therapy with a retinoid plus benzoyl peroxide, consider adding a topical antibiotic if needed, and reserve systemic therapy for refractory cases using doxycycline for the shortest effective duration with close lab monitoring if absolutely necessary; discuss isotretinoin early for scarring or psychosocial burden, and coordinate with gastroenterology to taper steroids when feasible to reduce steroid-induced acne drivers [^644168d6] [^6b760b61] [^4bfebf96].

Do not prescribe **oral minocycline** for this patient. Minocycline is contraindicated in patients with **autoimmune disease** because of the risk of drug-induced lupus, autoimmune hepatitis, and vasculitis [^2ed1a6ec] [^72dda3bc]. Given her Crohn's disease and immunosuppressive therapy, the risk of serious autoimmune adverse effects is unacceptably high. If systemic therapy is needed, use **doxycycline** 100 mg daily for 12 weeks with close monitoring, and avoid minocycline entirely.

---

## Risks associated with minocycline in autoimmune disease

Minocycline has been linked to **autoimmune adverse effects**, including:

- **Drug-induced lupus**: Minocycline is the tetracycline most associated with drug-induced lupus, with a reported incidence of 8.8 cases per 100,000 patient-years [^dcda72ff].

- **Autoimmune hepatitis**: Minocycline can cause severe autoimmune hepatitis, sometimes requiring liver transplantation [^notfound].

- **Vasculitis**: Minocycline has been associated with ANCA-positive vasculitis, particularly in younger patients [^08d56c35].

These risks are **amplified in patients with autoimmune diseases** such as Crohn's disease, who already have dysregulated immune systems and are on immunosuppressive therapy.

---

## Interaction with current medications

The patient is on **prednisone 20 mg daily and azathioprine 150 mg daily**. Minocycline does not have direct pharmacokinetic interactions with these drugs, but the combination increases the risk of infections and immune-related adverse effects. Azathioprine already carries risks of hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression; adding minocycline further increases the risk of liver injury and immune complications [^3807e713].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current dermatology and gastroenterology guidelines advise against minocycline in patients with autoimmune disease. The AAD recommends avoiding minocycline in patients with autoimmune disease because of the risk of **autoimmune adverse effects**. Gastroenterology guidelines emphasize minimizing exposure to drugs with **autoimmune risks** in patients with IBD.

---

## Alternative acne treatments

Given the patient's autoimmune disease and immunosuppressive therapy, **consider the following alternatives**:

- **Topical therapies**: Topical retinoids (tretinoin, adapalene), benzoyl peroxide, and topical antibiotics (clindamycin, erythromycin) are first-line and safe.

- **Doxycycline**: If systemic therapy is needed, doxycycline 100 mg daily for 12 weeks is preferred over minocycline due to a lower risk of autoimmune adverse effects.

- **Hormonal therapy**: Combined oral contraceptives or spironolactone can be considered for female patients with hormonal acne.

- **Isotretinoin**: For severe, refractory acne, isotretinoin is effective but requires careful monitoring and counseling due to potential adverse effects [^dd1b69c5].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

If doxycycline is prescribed, monitor for gastrointestinal tolerance, photosensitivity, and rare autoimmune symptoms. Regular **liver function tests** are advisable given the patient's immunosuppressive therapy.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Oral minocycline is **contraindicated** in this patient because of the high risk of autoimmune adverse effects. Use topical therapies or doxycycline 100 mg daily for 12 weeks with close monitoring, and avoid minocycline entirely.

013. To assess the association of minocycline with autoimmunity, investigators at the Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School report a case series of patients who developed a variety of symptoms suggestive of rheumatologic disease while receiving minocycline for acne vulgaris. Study children were identified by reviewing the medical records of children undergoing ANCA testing at a pediatric rheumatology practice between 1996 and 2006. Minocycline-induced autoimmunity was defined as a history of minocycline usage and clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of autoimmunity.

Patients with MIA were divided into three categories on the basis of disease duration after discontinuation of minocycline: transient; intermediate; or chronic. Of 583 children tested, 33 met criteria for a diagnosis of MIA. Of these, data on 27 children were analyzed. The mean age of study patients at onset of symptoms was 16. 5±1. 4 years and the mean duration of minocycline use before diagnosis was 13±10. 8 months. Clinical manifestations were present for a mean of 4. 3 months before a diagnosis of MIA was made. All patients presented with constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and malaise.

Twenty-two study patients had polyarthralgia and 17 had polyarthritis, primarily affecting hands and feet. Laboratory features included elevated sedimentation rate in 50% of patients and elevated C-reactive protein in 56%. Leukopenia was present in 26%, ANA was positive in 74%, and ANCA was positive in 67%. Fourteen patients had transient, six intermediate, and seven chronic disease. All seven patients with a chronic course had arthritis at presentation and required long-term immunosuppressive therapy with agents such as corticosteroids, methotrexate, and anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents for treatment of symptoms, primarily arthritis. Most of the six patients with an intermediate course required therapy with corticosteroids and NSAIDs. The authors conclude that prescribing physicians should be aware that minocycline-induced autoimmunity may be associated with debilitating chronic symptoms. Drs.

### Is minocycline overused in acne? [^b05b8d1b]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with moderate or severe acne vulgaris, or an inadequate response to topical treatments, are often treated with oral antibacterials, in particular, tetracyclines. Minocycline is one of the most commonly prescribed tetracyclines in acne, the predominant use for this drug. In 2005, around 2.5 million prescriptions for oral tetracyclines were dispensed in England at a cost to the NHS of over pound 21 million, and minocycline accounted for 40% of this expenditure. The drug is often recommended with claims that it is more effective, less likely to cause bacterial resistance, and easier to take than other tetracyclines. Here we consider the use of minocycline for acne.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^e933cbf9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne systemic antibiotic stewardship—Monotherapy with oral antibiotics is strongly discouraged, and the use of topical maintenance regimens cannot be overemphasized. Topical therapies can accomplish continued efficacy months after the discontinuation of systemic antibiotics, and the work group's consensus suggests that such maintenance is paramount to reducing antibiotic resistance. Other attempts to limit antibiotic use revolve around different dosing recommendations, such as pulse dosing and submicrobial dosing, but no alternative dosing routines consistently appear superior to standard dosing. Limiting systemic antibiotic use is urged because of the reported associations of inflammatory bowel disease, pharyngitis, C difficile infection, and the induction of Candida vulvovaginitis. While limiting the use of systemic antibiotics is necessary, the work group's consensus agrees there are a subset of patients for whom alternative therapies are inappropriate and who may require a longer course of antibiotics even while taking topical medications.

### Minocycline for acne vulgaris: efficacy and safety [^39344a5b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that is commonly used in the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. Although it is more convenient for patients to take than first-generation tetracyclines, as it only needs to be taken once or twice a day and can be taken with food, it is more expensive. Concerns have also been expressed over its safety following the deaths of two patients taking the drug. There is a lack of consensus among dermatologists over the relative risks and benefits of minocycline. As most acne prescribing is undertaken by general practitioners, it is important that guidelines issued to them are based on the best available evidence rather than personal judgements.

Objectives

To collate and evaluate the evidence on the clinical efficacy of minocycline in the treatment of inflammatory acne vulgaris. Specific objectives were to compare the efficacy of minocycline with other drug treatments for acne and to collate information on the incidence of adverse drug reactions.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of minocycline for acne vulgaris were identified by searching the following electronic databases; MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, Biological Abstracts, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Cochrane Skin Group's Trial Register, Theses Online, BIDS ISI Science Citation Index, National Research Register, Current Controlled Trials and Bids Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings. Other strategies used were scanning the references of articles retrieved, hand-searching of major dermatology journals and personal communication with trialists and drug companies.

Selection Criteria

To be eligible for the review, studies had to be RCTs comparing the efficacy of minocycline at any dose to active or placebo control, in subjects with inflammatory acne vulgaris. Diagnoses of papulo-pustular, polymorphic and nodular acne were also accepted. Trials were not excluded on the basis of language.

Data Collection and Analysis

27 randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. The comparators used were placebo (2 studies), oxytetracycline (1), tetracycline (6), doxycycline (7), lymecycline (2), topical clindamycin (3), topical erythromycin/zinc (1), cyproterone acetate/ ethinyloestradiol (1), oral isotretinoin (2), topical fusidic acid (1) and there was one dose response study. Two studies are ongoing and it remains to be clarified whether one further study is a RCT. Major outcome measures used in the trials included lesion counts, acne grades/severity scores, doctors' and patients' global assessments, adverse drug reactions and drop out rates. The quality of each study was assessed independently by two assessors and an effect size calculated where possible. An additional three RCTs and three safety studies were identified by searches conducted in November 2002; these will be reviewed for a major update in early 2003 when it is anticipated that the results of the two ongoing studies will be available.

Main Results

The trials were generally small and of poor quality and in many cases the published reports were inadequate for our purpose. Pooling of the studies was not attempted due to the lack of common outcome measures and endpoints and the unavailability of some primary data. Although minocycline was shown to be an effective treatment for acne vulgaris, in only two studies was it found to be superior to other tetracyclines. Both of these were conducted under open conditions and had serious methodological problems. A third study showed it to be more effective than 2% fusidic acid, applied topically, against inflammatory lesions in mild to moderate acne. Differences in the way adverse drug reactions were identified could have accounted for the wide variation between studies in numbers of events reported. This meant that no overall evaluation could be made of incidence rates of adverse events associated with minocycline therapy. No RCT evidence was found to support the benefits of minocycline in acne resistant to other therapies and the dose response has only been evaluated up to eight weeks of therapy.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Minocycline is likely to be an effective treatment for moderate acne vulgaris, but this review found no reliable RCT evidence to justify its continued use first-line, especially given the price differential and the concerns that still remain about its safety. Its efficacy relative to other acne therapies could not be reliably determined due to the poor methodological quality of the trials and lack of consistent choice of outcome measures. Similarly the relative risk of adverse drug reactions could not be ascertained reliably and no recommendations can be made concerning the appropriate dose that should be used. It is hoped that this review will highlight the inadequacy of acne trials in general and encourage improvements in methodological quality and standards of reporting.

### Long-term minocycline use for acne in healthy adolescents can cause severe autoimmune hepatitis [^82ae24a2]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Over the years, a variety of abnormal immune reactions to minocycline have been reported including arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatitis. The current report describes the detailed clinical and pathologic features of 3 patients who presented with chronic/autoimmune hepatitis alone while on minocycline at our hospital over a 2-year period. Minocycline use in these patients was temporally related to onset of severe hepatitis. Adolescents with such a reaction to minocycline have been included in previous reports but have not been well described as a distinct entity. We have compared our cases with similar cases previously reported with a review of the literature and a discussion of the implications for prescribing physicians.

### Acne vulgaris: treatment guidelines from the AAD (...) [^ae99e74e]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice • First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications including topical antibiotics. • Tetracyclines are the preferred oral antibiotic, and doxycycline and minocycline have been shown to be more effective than tetracycline. • Topical or oral antibiotics should not be used as monotherapy because of the risk of developing resistance. From the AFP Editors Acne vulgaris, which occurs in 50 million persons living in the United States, is associated with physical and psychological morbidity and results in more than $3 billion in direct costs annually. In addition, knowledge about its pathogenesis is constantly evolving. The American Academy of Dermatology has released guidelines for managing acne vulgaris in adolescents and adults.

First-line and Alternative Treatment Options First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications consisting of benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic, retinoid, or both. An alternative treatment would include the addition of a topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide if not already prescribed; a different retinoid; or topical dapsone. First-line treatment for moderate acne vulgaris includes a combination of benzoyl peroxide and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both; benzoyl peroxide, an oral antibiotic, and topical retinoid; or benzoyl peroxide, oral and topical antibiotics, and a topical retinoid. Alternative treatments to be considered include a different combination of medications; changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or oral isotretinoin.

First-line treatment for severe acne vulgaris includes an oral antibiotic, benzoyl peroxide, and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both. Oral isotretinoin can also be considered as a first-line option. Alternative treatment options to consider include changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or starting oral isotretinoin. Treatment Options TOPICAL AGENTS The choice of topical agent is based on patient age, acne sites and severity, and patient preference. Most patients should be treated with a combination of medications that affect a variety of acne pathogenesis aspects. The benefit of using sulfur, nicotinamide, resorcinol, sulfacetamide, aluminum chloride, or zinc has not been supported by data. Because of the risk of developing bacterial resistance when erythromycin and clindamycin are used as monotherapy, if prescribed, they should be combined with benzoyl peroxide.

A topical retinoid alone is recommended primarily for comedonal acne, and for persons with mixed or inflammatory acne, it also can be used in conjunction with a topical or oral antimicrobial. Inflammatory acne can be treated with topical dapsone 5% gel, especially in women. Azelaic acid can be used to manage dyspigmentation that occurs with inflammatory acne. For acne in children who have not reached adolescence, topical adapalene, tretinoin, and benzoyl peroxide are safe to use. SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS Moderate to severe acne, as well as inflammatory acne in which topical medications have been ineffective, can be treated with systemic antibiotics. Data are limited regarding the use of antibiotics that are not tetracyclines or macrolides; therefore, their use should be avoided. Doxycycline and minocycline have been shown to be more effective than tetracycline.

### Doxycycline and minocycline for the management of acne: a review of efficacy and safety with emphasis on clinical implications [^19f47fa0]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

A significant number of patients with moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne are candidates for oral antibiotic therapy. Use of tetracycline for acne has yielded to second-generation molecules doxycycline and minocycline, which are associated with numerous benefits over their predecessor, especially less frequent dosing and improved safety. Nonetheless, these agents are associated with certain potential side effects, including gastrointestinal (GI) concerns, staining of developing teeth in children, candidiasis, vestibular concerns and, somewhat more controversially, photosensitivity. Additionally, minocycline may be associated with the development of autoantibodies, including anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and anti-phospholipid antibodies with or without associated clinical symptoms. Given their similar efficacy for the management of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris, the choice of doxycycline or minocycline may depend on specific clinical considerations, including patient satisfaction with therapy, compliance and convenience. Data and clinical experience suggest that enteric-coated doxycycline, with its low rate of GI symptoms, may represent a more tolerable treatment option for many acne patients and therefore be associated with better likelihood of compliance.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^644168d6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris—systemic antibiotic recommendations—Systemic antibiotics are recommended in the management of moderate and severe acne and forms of inflammatory acne that are resistant to topical treatments. Doxycycline and minocycline are more effective than tetracycline, but neither is superior to each other. Although oral erythromycin and azithromycin can be effective in treating acne, its use should be limited to those who cannot use the tetracyclines (ie, pregnant women or children <8 years of age), and erythromycin use should be restricted because of its increased risk of bacterial resistance. Use of systemic antibiotics, other than the tetracyclines and macrolides, is discouraged; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim use should be restricted to patients who are unable to tolerate tetracyclines or in treatment-resistant patients. Systemic antibiotic use should be limited to the shortest possible duration. Re-evaluate at 3-4 months to minimize the development of bacterial resistance, and monotherapy with systemic antibiotics is not recommended. Concomitant topical therapy with benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid should be used with systemic antibiotics and for maintenance after completion of systemic antibiotic therapy.

### Minocycline for acne vulgaris: efficacy and safety [^dcda72ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Minocycline is an oral antibiotic used for acne vulgaris. Its use has lessened due to safety concerns (including potentially irreversible pigmentation), a relatively high cost, and no evidence of any greater benefit than other acne treatments. A modified-release version of minocycline is being promoted as having fewer side-effects.

Objectives

To assess new evidence on the effects of minocycline for acne vulgaris.

Search Methods

Searches were updated in the following databases to November 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched trials registers and checked reference lists for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).The Cochrane Skin Group's Trials Search Co-ordinator undertook searches exploring minocycline's adverse effects in EMBASE and MEDLINE in February 2012.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing minocycline, at any dose, to an active or a placebo control, in participants with inflammatory acne vulgaris. For adverse effects, we selected additional studies that reported the number of adverse effects and the number of participants treated.

Data Collection and Analysis

Outcome measures used in the trials included lesion counts, acne grades/severity scores, doctors' and participants' global assessments, adverse effects, and dropout rates. Two authors independently assessed the quality of each study. Effect sizes were calculated, and meta-analyses were undertaken where possible.Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria for the review of adverse effects.

Main Results

We included 12 new RCTs for this update, giving a total of 39 RCTs (6013 participants). These additional 12 RCTs have not changed the original conclusions about the clinical efficacy of minocycline.The identified RCTs were generally small and poor quality. Meta-analysis was rarely possible because of the lack of data and different outcome measures and trial durations. Although minocycline was shown to be an effective treatment for moderate to moderately-severe acne vulgaris, there was no evidence that it is better than any of the other commonly-used acne treatments. One company-sponsored RCT found minocycline to be less effective than combination treatment with topical erythromycin and zinc. No trials have been conducted using minocycline in those participants whose acne is resistant to other therapies. Also, there is no evidence to guide what dose should be used.The adverse effects studies must be interpreted with caution. The evidence suggests that minocycline is associated with more severe adverse effects than doxycycline. Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, is associated with lupus erythematosus, but the risk is small: 8.8 cases per 100,000 person-years. The risk of autoimmune reactions increases with duration of use. The evidence does not support the conclusion that the more expensive extended-release preparation is safer than standard minocycline preparations.

Authors' Conclusions

Minocycline is an effective treatment for moderate to moderately-severe inflammatory acne vulgaris, but there is still no evidence that it is superior to other commonly-used therapies. This review found no reliable evidence to justify the reinstatement of its first-line use, even though the price-differential is less than it was 10 years ago. Concerns remain about its safety compared to other tetracyclines.

### Drug-induced acne in inflammatory bowel disease: a practical guide for the gastroenterologist [^1e974a36]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced acne is a common side effect to a wide array of pharmacological therapies and is characterized by a monomorphic, papulopustular eruption typically affecting the face, scalp, and the upper thorax. Corticosteroids and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) are commonly used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and are known to aggravate a prior tendency to acne or trigger the development of new acneiform eruptions. Recent attention on managing drug-induced acne has been driven by the increasing use of JAKi, an expanding therapeutic class in IBD and several other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Both randomized controlled trials and real-world studies have identified acne as one of the most common treatment-emergent adverse events in JAKi. Left untreated, this common skin reaction can significantly affect patient self-esteem and quality of life leading to poor treatment adherence and suboptimal IBD control. This review examines the characteristics of drug-induced acne in IBD treatments, provides a practical guide for gastroenterologists to manage mild-to-moderate occurrences, and highlights when to seek specialist dermatology advice. Such approaches enable early treatment of a common and often distressing adverse event and optimize the management of IBD by preventing the premature discontinuation or dose reduction of efficacious IBD drugs.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The safety and efficacy of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris was assessed in two 12-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trials in subjects ≥ 12 years. The mean age of subjects was 20 years and subjects were from the following racial groups: White (73%), Hispanic (13%), Black (11%), Asian/Pacific Islander (2%), and Other (2%).

In two efficacy and safety trials, a total of 924 subjects with non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris received Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets or placebo for a total of 12 weeks, according to the following dose assignments.

The two primary efficacy endpoints were:

1)  Mean percent change in inflammatory lesion counts from Baseline to 12 weeks.

2)  Percentage of subjects with an Evaluator's Global Severity Assessment (EGSA) of clear or almost clear at 12 weeks. Efficacy results are presented in Table 4.

Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not demonstrate any effect on non-inflammatory lesions (benefit or worsening).

### Minocycline hepatitis [^7cbe68c4]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Minocycline is an effective antibiotic widely used in the treatment of acne vulgaris. We report a previously well 20-year-old woman who developed liver dysfunction with jaundice and malaise following a 1 year course of minocycline for acne vulgaris. Serum antinuclear antibody was strongly positive (1 : 2560) and liver transaminases were grossly deranged. All other causes of liver disease were excluded. Both the clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities resolved spontaneously on stopping the drug. We review the three different types of hepatotoxicity associated with minocycline and draw evidence to support the diagnosis of minocycline-induced autoimmune hepatitis. This case supports the call to monitor patients on minocycline therapy for autoimmune disease of the liver and highlights the need for a multicentre prospective trial of the risks and benefits of long-term minocycline therapy.

Antibiotics are indicated for inappropriately prolonged durations not only for infectious diseases but also for non-infectious dermatologic conditions such as acne vulgaris, but inappropriate use is not uncommon. Inappropriate antibiotic prescription can contribute to the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms, patient harm such as adverse drug events and increased healthcare costs. We experienced a case involving a late adolescent with acne vulgaris who had been treated with minocycline for more than 2 years, leading to the development of drug-induced lupus, attributed to minocycline. This resulted in multiple clinic and emergency department visits and extensive and expensive workups, including an invasive procedure. A collaboration between antibiotic stewardship activities and patient-centred medication reviews, followed by personalised deprescribing, could effectively mitigate inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for non-infectious dermatologic conditions.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^51b01f64]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris—systemic antibiotics indications and dosing—Systemic antibiotics have been a mainstay of acne treatment for years; they are indicated for use in moderate to severe inflammatory acne and should be used in combination with a topical retinoid and BP. Evidence supports the efficacy of tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), trimethoprim, erythromycin, azithromycin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin. The tetracycline class of antibiotics should be considered first-line therapy in moderate to severe acne, except when contraindicated because of other circumstances (ie, pregnancy, <8 years of age, or allergy). Minocycline in an extended release form appears safest (at 1 mg/kg), but no dose response was found for efficacy; doxycycline appears effective in the 1.7 to 2.4 mg/kg dose range, and subantimicrobial dosing of doxycycline (ie, 20 mg twice daily to 40 mg daily) has also shown efficacy in patients with moderate inflammatory acne. Azithromycin has been primarily studied in the treatment of acne in open label studies with different pulse dosing regimens ranging from 3 times a week to 4 days a month, with azithromycin being an effective treatment in the time span evaluated—usually 2 to 3 months. A recent randomized controlled trial comparing 3 days per month of azithromycin to daily doxycycline did show superiority of doxycycline. Outside of case reports, there is 1 small, double-blind study showing that TMP/SMX is as effective as oxytetracycline.

### Once-daily oral sarecycline 1.5 mg / kg / day is effective for moderate to severe acne vulgaris: results from two identically designed, phase 3, randomized, double-blind clinical trials [^c42533bc]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Side effects may limit the use of current tetracycline-class antibiotics for acne.

Objective

Evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily sarecycline, a novel, narrow-spectrum tetracycline-class antibiotic, in moderate to severe acne.

Methods

Patients 9-45 years with moderate to severe facial acne (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score ≥ 3, 20-50 inflammatory and ≤ 100 noninflammatory lesions, and ≤ 2 nodules) were randomized 1:1 to sarecycline 1.5 mg/kg/day or placebo for 12 weeks in identically designed phase 3 studies (SC1401 and SC1402).

Results

In SC1401 (sarecycline n=483, placebo n=485) and SC1402 (sarecycline n=519, placebo n=515), at week 12, IGA success (≥ 2-grade improvement and score 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear]) rates were 21.9% and 22.6% (sarecycline), respectively, versus 10.5% and 15.3% (placebo; P less than 0.0001 and P equals 0.0038). Onset of efficacy in inflammatory lesions occurred by the first visit (week 3), with mean percentage reduction in inflammatory lesions at week 12 in SC1401 and SC1402 of -51.8% and -49.9% (sarecycline), respectively, versus -35.1% and -35.4% (placebo; P less than 0.0001). Onset of efficacy for absolute reduction of noninflammatory lesion count occurred at week 6 in SC1401 (P less than 0.05) and week 9 in SC1402 (P less than 0.01). In SC1401, the most common TEAEs (in ≥ 2% of either sarecycline or placebo group) were nausea (4.6% [sarecycline]; 2.5% [placebo]), nasopharyngitis (3.1%; 1.7%), headache (2.7%; 2.7%), and vomiting (2.1%; 1.4%) and, in SC1402, nasopharyngitis (2.5%; 2.9%) and headache (2.9%; 4.9%). Most were not considered treatment-related. Vestibular (dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo) and phototoxic (sunburn, photosensitivity) TEAEs both occurred in ≤ 1% of sarecycline patients. Gastrointestinal TEAE rates for sarecycline were low. Among females, vulvovaginal candidiasis (SC1401: 1.1% [sarecycline] and 0 [placebo]; SC1402: 0.3% and 0) and mycotic infection (0.7% and 0; 1.0% and 0) rates were low.

Conclusion

The narrow-spectrum antibiotic sarecycline was safe, well tolerated, and effective for moderate to severe acne, with low rates of side effects common with tetracycline antibiotics. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(9):987-996.

### Efficacy and safety of a novel topical minocycline foam for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris: a phase 3 study [^45bcab03]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

FMX101 4% topical minocycline foam has been shown to be an effective and safe treatment for acne vulgaris (AV).

Objective

To further evaluate the efficacy and safety of FMX101 4% in treating moderate to severe acne vulgaris.

Methods

A 12-week, multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, vehicle-controlled study was conducted. Coprimary end points were the absolute change in inflammatory lesion count from baseline and the rate of treatment success (Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 with a ≥2-grade improvement).

Results

There were 1488 participants in the intent-to-treat population. The FMX101 4% group had significantly greater reductions in the number of inflammatory lesions from baseline (P < .0001) and a greater rate of treatment success based on Investigator's Global Assessment (P < .0001) versus the foam vehicle group at week 12. FMX101 4% was generally safe and well tolerated.

Limitations

The efficacy and safety of FMX101 4% were not characterized in participants with mild AV.

Conclusion

FMX101 4% topical minocycline foam was effective and safe for the treatment of moderate to severe AV.

### Potential association between the oral tetracycline class of antimicrobials used to treat acne and inflammatory bowel disease [^ded481bf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Previous studies have shown an association between isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The majority of patients prescribed isotretinoin for their acne are previously on an extended course of antibiotics. Therefore, it is important to consider antibiotic use as a confounding variable for the development of IBD.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study using The Health Improvement Network database of the United Kingdom. We identified 94,487 individuals with acne who were followed up by a general practitioner for 406,294 person-years.

Results

>A prescription for minocycline was received by 24,085 individuals, for tetracycline/oxytetracycline by 38,603 individuals, and doxycycline by 15,032 individuals. IBD was noted in 41 individuals exposed to minocycline, 79 individuals exposed to tetracycline/oxytetracycline, 32 individuals exposed to doxycycline, and 55 (0.11%) individuals not exposed to any of these antibiotics. The hazard ratio (HR) for developing IBD for any exposure to a tetracycline antibiotic was 1.39 (1.02, 1.90). HRs for individual antibiotics were 1.19 (0.79, 1.79) for minocycline, 1.43 (1.02, 2.02) for tetracycline/oxytetracycline, and 1.63 (1.05, 2.52) for doxycycline. For ulcerative colitis, the associations (HR) were 1.10 (0.76, 1.82) for minocycline, 1.27 (0.78, 2.07) for tetracycline/oxytetracycline, and 1.06 (0.53, 2.13) for doxycycline. For Crohn's disease (CD), the associations (HR) were 1.28 (0.72, 2.30) for minocycline, 1.61 (0.995, 2.63) for tetracycline/oxytetracycline, and 2.25 (1.27 4.00) for doxycycline.

Conclusions

Tetracycline class antibiotics, and particularly doxycycline use may be associated with the development of IBD, particularly CD. Potential confounding by previous doxycycline exposure should be considered when assessing whether treatment with other acne medications increases the risk of IBD.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^339cd838]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Systemic antibiotic safety and stewardship in acne vulgaris are summarized as follows: Adverse events with the tetracycline class vary with each medication, with photosensitivity seen across the class and “doxycycline being more photosensitizing than minocycline,” and doxycycline is “more frequently associated with gastrointestinal disturbances.” When minocycline is compared to other tetracyclines, “more serious adverse events are reported (8.8 cases per 100,000 patient years).” For trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), adverse events include “gastrointestinal upset, photosensitivity, and drug eruptions,” and the most severe eruptions are “Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis,” which are “more common in patients with HIV”; with long-term therapy, patients “should be periodically monitored with a complete blood cell count,” and “the concurrent use of TMP/SMX and methotrexate (MTX) can be associated with severe toxicity.” For macrolides, “The macrolide class of antibiotics is most commonly associated with gastrointestinal disturbances,” and macrolides “can also decrease metabolism of cyclosporine.” Penicillins and cephalosporins are “most associated with the adverse events of hypersensitivity reactions ranging from mild drug eruptions to anaphylaxis.” Regarding duration to limit resistance, “Limiting antibiotic use to the shortest possible duration, ideally 3-4 months, can be accomplished with the concomitant use of a retinoid.”

### Real-world safety and effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa: 12-week interim analysis of post-marketing surveillance in Japan [^6930b8e5]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend a holistic approach to manage HS and associated comorbidities; in general, a combination of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological therapy is recommended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pharmacological treatment includes topical treatment (clindamycin), systemic antibiotics (tetracycline, clindamycin‐rifampicin), anti‐inflammatory agents (corticosteroids), and biologics (anti‐TNF, ustekinumab). Combination therapy with a biologic, including adalimumab, and surgery has been shown to be effective.,,,The majority of patients (84.3%) in this study had received pharmacological treatment for HS prior to adalimumab administration. Treatment consisted predominantly of systemic antibacterial drugs, mainly a tetracycline (minocycline hydrochloride and doxycycline hydrochloride hydrate); administration of concomitant systemic antibacterials decreased with adalimumab administration. Oral anti‐inflammatory treatment was received by a minority of patients prior to (eight patients) and during (seven patients) adalimumab treatment, and injectables were rarely administered to this patient population both prior to and during adalimumab treatment. A similar treatment profile was observed in an observational study of Australian patients with HS, with the most common treatment type being an oral antibiotic.

The strengths of this study are that the results are real‐world data that included a Japanese population of >80 patients with HS, and the study included a variety of outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of adalimumab in clinical practice. The study was limited by the open‐label design, with no control or comparator group, and the variable data capture outside of the controlled environment of a clinical trial. Patients who were previously prescribed adalimumab for HS and other diseases were excluded from this study; this may explain why no comorbidity of IBD was observed in this patient cohort. This study is still ongoing, and the real‐world, long‐term (up to 52 weeks) effectiveness of adalimumab in Japanese patients with HS is still to be determined.

In conclusion, the safety and effectiveness of adalimumab were demonstrated in Japanese patients in the largest observational trial for HS patients. The safety and effectiveness data reported here are consistent with the data from previous clinical trials, and no new safety concerns were observed in patients with HS in real‐world clinical practice. The study also documented the characteristics of Japanese patients prescribed adalimumab for HS.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^dd1b69c5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Isotretinoin—recommendations for acne vulgaris: Oral isotretinoin is recommended for the treatment of severe nodular acne, and oral isotretinoin is appropriate for the treatment of moderate acne that is treatment-resistant or for the management of acne that is producing physical scarring or psychosocial distress. Low-dose isotretinoin can be used to effectively treat acne and reduce the frequency and severity of medication-related side effects; intermittent dosing of isotretinoin is not recommended. Routine monitoring of liver function tests, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides at baseline and again until response to treatment is established is recommended, whereas routine monitoring of complete blood count is not recommended. All patients treated with isotretinoin must adhere to the iPLEDGE risk management program, and females of child-bearing potential taking isotretinoin should be counseled regarding various contraceptive methods including user-independent forms. Prescribing physicians also should monitor their patients for any indication of inflammatory bowel disease and depressive symptoms and educate their patients about the potential risks with isotretinoin.

### Tofacitinib for induction and maintenance therapy of Crohn's disease: results of two phase IIb randomised placebo-controlled trials [^97e62b58]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 1 
Study design. Patients who completed the 8-week induction study and achieved clinical response-100 (decrease in Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) score at week 8 of at least 100 points from baseline) and/or clinical remission (CDAI <150) and met eligibility criteria, were potentially eligible to enter the 26-week maintenance study. Patients were followed up for 4 weeks after completion or early withdrawal of the induction or maintenance study. *Patients were initially randomised (3:2:2:4) to receive placebo, tofacitinib 5, 10 or 15 mg twice daily. A protocol amendment was implemented to stop enrolment in the tofacitinib 15 mg twice daily dose group after 16 patients were enrolled. BID, twice daily.

Patients receiving azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate were required to stop these agents at least two weeks before randomisation. Concomitant tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) were not allowed, and a wash-out period of at least eight 8 weeks prior to randomisation was required. Concomitant corticosteroids were allowed up to oral prednisone-equivalent 30 mg/day or budesonide 9 mg/day, provided a stable dose had been taken for at least two weeks prior to baseline. Patients were required to have completed the induction study and achieved a clinical response-100 (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) decrease from baseline ≥100 points) or clinical remission (CDAI <150 points) at week 8, regardless of whether they received active treatment or placebo, to be eligible to enter the maintenance study (subject to meeting other selection criteria; see online supplementary file).

In the maintenance study, patients were re-randomised (1:1:1) to receive treatment with placebo, tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily for 26 weeks. A mandatory steroid taper algorithm was applied for patients receiving oral corticosteroids, starting at baseline of the maintenance period with the dose decreased by 5 mg prednisolone-equivalent per week until the dose reached 20 mg/day and then by 2.5 mg/week to 10 mg/day. Further taper was at the discretion of the investigator. Patients who completed the double-blind treatment period or fulfilled criteria for treatment failure were potentially eligible to transfer to an open-label extension study. Patients who withdrew from the maintenance study early and did not fulfil treatment failure criteria, or who declined to participate in the extension study, were followed-up for 4 weeks after the end of their treatment and assessed for safety.

### Sarecycline treatment for acne vulgaris: rationale for weight-based dosing and limited impact of food intake on clinical efficacy [^34775208]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The results of the current PK studies demonstrate that sarecycline can be administered using a weight‐based dosing regimen and can be taken with or without food without a clinical relevant impact on efficacy. As described above, data with older first‐ and second‐generation tetracycline‐class antibiotics report diet‐related effects, which may potentially have impact on efficacy in some patients. Co‐administration of a delayed‐release doxycycline formulation with a high‐fat meal reduced the overall bioavailability (AUC) by 15%–18% compared to a fasted state, with published reports stating reduction in doxycycline bioavailability by 26% and tetracycline bioavailability by 46%.Given that patients who take doxycycline are commonly instructed to ingest the drug with food (including dairy products) to prevent GI tract‐associated AEs, it is difficult to assess the true clinical impact of this decrease in bioavailability, especially when lower doses are prescribed. Similarly, coadministration of minocycline with iron or food decreases its bioavailability by 77% and 13%–14%, respectively.

### Minocycline hydrochloride (minolira extended release) [^49671e60]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Contraception

MINOLIRA may reduce the effectiveness of low-dose oral contraceptives. Patients of reproductive potential should not rely on low-dose oral contraceptives as an effective contraceptive method, and should use an additional method of contraception during treatment with MINOLIRA [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] .

Infertility

Avoid using MINOLIRA in males who are attempting to conceive a child. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. In a fertility study in rats, minocycline adversely affected spermatogenesis when orally administered to male rats at doses resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients administered MINOLIRA [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] .

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of MINOLIRA have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)] . Tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth have been observed in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)] . The safety and effectiveness of MINOLIRA have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of MINOLIRA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### Twenty-four-week interim analysis from a phase 3 open-label trial of adalimumab in Japanese patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa [^00dd8f95]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

Eligible patients were men and non‐pregnant women aged 18 years or older with diagnosed HS who had had stable disease for 2 months or more at baseline, lesions in two or more anatomical areas (one of which was Hurley stage II or III) and a total abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count of three or more at baseline. Patients were excluded from the study if they were of child‐bearing potential and not using contraception; had received prior ADA treatment or other anti‐TNF therapy; participated in an ADA trial; or received topical therapies for HS or oral concomitant analgesics (including opioids) for HS‐related pain 14 days or less prior to the baseline visit. Patients who received antibiotic treatment or systemic non‐biologic therapies (other than permitted oral antibiotics, doxycycline or minocycline) for HS 28 days or less prior to the baseline visit were also excluded. See Table S1 for a detailed list of inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Study design and treatment

This was a 24‐week interim analysis of data collected during an ongoing phase 3, multicenter, open‐label, single‐arm study in Japanese patients with moderate to severe HS (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02904902). The study was designed and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice as defined by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, the Declaration of Helsinki and all other applicable regulations. An independent ethics committee/institutional review board approved the protocol and informed consent documents. Patients provided written informed consent.

The study included a 35‐day screening period, open‐label treatment period and a phone call follow up 70 days after the last study drug dose (Fig. 1). All patients received s.c. injections of ADA 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, followed by 40 mg every week (ADAew) starting at week 4. The treatment period was expected to extend to 99 weeks or more, until HS indication approval or marketing application withdrawal in Japan.

### Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release (Emrosi) [^2ed1a6ec]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea (Antibiotic-Associated Colitis)

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinue EMROSI.

5.5 Hepatotoxicity

Postmarketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. Discontinue EMROSI if liver injury is suspected.

5.6 Central Nervous System Effects

Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Caution patients who experience these symptoms about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on EMROSI. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued.

5.7 Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension

Idiopathic Intracranial hypertension has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Clinical manifestations of idiopathic intracranial hypertension include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension are at a greater risk for developing idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Avoid concomitant use of isotretinoin and EMROSI because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Permanent visual loss may exist, even after the medication is discontinued. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Because intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, monitor patients until they stabilize.

5.8 Autoimmune Syndromes

Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. Evaluate symptomatic patients. If symptoms occur, immediately discontinue EMROSI.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE: sarecycline improves acne severity, symptoms, and psychosocial burden in non-nodular acne vulgaris: PROSES study [^8bfb4424]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are emerging as a fundamental component of disease impact assessment in acne vulgaris (AV), complementing clinician-reported outcomes. No data is available on PROs for patients with AV using sarecycline in real-world settings.

Methods

A single-arm, prospective cohort study that included patients &ge;9 years old diagnosed with moderate or severe non-nodular AV was implemented as part of routine care in clinical practices (N=30). Patients received oral sarecycline (60 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg) for 12 weeks, as part of usual care. The primary endpoint was Acne Symptom and Impact Scale (ASIS) responses from patients (&ge;12 years) and caregivers (for patients 9-11 years) at week 12 and change from baseline (CFB). Investigator&rsquo;s Global Assessment (IGA) of AV severity and adverse events (AEs) were also recorded.

Results

A total of 253 patients with AV completed the study (adults: 60.1%, females: 77.6%). ASIS mean scores significantly decreased (P &lt;.0001) at week 12 for: signs (mean CFB &plusmn; standard deviation [SD]: &ndash;0.8 &plusmn; 0.7), impact (&ndash;1.0 &plusmn; 1.0), emotional impact (&ndash;1.2 &plusmn; 1.1), and social impact (0.6 &plusmn; 1.1). Significant reductions in AV severity (P &lt;.0001) were reported by patients and caregivers. The IGA success rate was 58.9% and physician satisfaction with treatment outcomes was 88.1%. A total of 31 (10.3%) patients reported &ge;1 AE during the study.

Conclusions

Patients with moderate-to-severe AV receiving acne management with an oral antibiotic for 12 weeks experienced a significant improvement in AV-related symptoms and psychosocial burden. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23:1(Suppl 1):s12-18.

Over the next 6 months, various treatments were tried and failed including topical ivermectin 1% cream, adapalene 0.1% gel, intralesional triamcinolone injections (10 mg/mL), oral minocycline 100 mg twice daily, oral prednisone (max dose of 20 mg/d), oral isotretinoin (20 mg/d), and a Jessner's-trichloroacetic acid (35%) peel on one occasion. Eventually, all treatments were discontinued due to lack of efficacy, and a drug eruption was considered. On review of her medications, all were unchanged for several years and included ruxolitinib (15 mg twice daily), levothyroxine, gabapentin, hydrochlorothiazide, duloxetine, and aspirin. Although she had been taking ruxolitinib continuously for 5 years, the decision was made to trial off of it. Within the first week of stopping ruxolitinib, the patient reported improvement, and within 6 months, her granulomatous dermatitis resolved (Fig 4, A and B). At follow-up with the dermatology department 12 months later, she maintained clinical remission without specific therapy. Her myelofibrosis is now managed with routine monitoring and active nonintervention by the hematology department.

3.6.2 Beclomethasone dipropionate

Oral beclomethasone dipropionate is a second-generation corticosteroid and may also be an alternative to conventional corticosteroids. In a randomised controlled trial in 282 patients, oral beclomethasone dipropionate 5 mg daily for 4 weeks, then alternate weekly for a further 4 weeks was shown to be non-inferior to prednisolone in efficacy, but there was also no difference in the co-primary end-point of steroid-related adverse events and reduction in morning cortisol below 150 nmol/L.In patients with active left-sided or extensive UC, oral beclomethasone dipropionate 5 mg/day has been demonstrated as equivalent to 2.4 g 5-ASA,and has been shown as more effective when added to 5-ASA compared with 5-ASA alone.

Although more expensive, topically-acting oral corticosteroids are an alternative to prednisolone in UC patients with mild to moderate disease and 5-ASA failure.

3.7 Corticosteroids in moderate to severe UC

Statement 7. We recommend that moderate to severe ulcerative colitis should be treated with oral corticosteroids such as prednisolone 40 mg daily weaning over 6–8 weeks (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Oral corticosteroids are effective for the induction of remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis refractory to sulfasalazine or 5-ASA, and in patients who have responded to initial treatment with intravenous corticosteroids following hospitalisation for acute severe disease.

In a meta-analysis of five randomised controlled trials, corticosteroids were superior to placebo for induction of remission in UC (RR of no remission, 0.65; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93).Although the optimal dose and regimen for systemic corticosteroids in UC is uncertain, the current 40 mg dose recommendation is based on Baron’s studies where 40 mg was more effective than 20 mg/day.There is no evidence of benefit with doses higher than 40–60 mg/day,and doses above 40 mg may be associated with increased adverse effects.Approximately 50% of patients experience short-term corticosteroid-related adverse events such as acne, oedema, sleep and mood disturbance, glucose intolerance and dyspepsia.Single daily dosing is as effective as split-dosing and causes less adrenal suppression.The dose should be tapered over 6–8 weeks.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^378acc42]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative Crohn’s disease antibiotic prophylaxis—We suggest imidazole antibiotics (metronidazole) at doses between 1 and 2 g/d after small intestinal resection in CD patients to prevent recurrence (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). Metronidazole (20 mg/kg daily) may significantly reduce the incidence of severe (Rutgeerts i3–4) endoscopic recurrent disease compared with placebo-treated patients at 3 months after surgery and clinical recurrence at 1 year. Combining metronidazole (1 g/d) for 3 months with azathioprine (100–150 mg/d) for 12 months reduces endoscopic recurrent disease (i2–4) at 1 year after surgery compared with those patients receiving metronidazole alone. In placebo-controlled trials, nearly 50% of patients were intolerant to the imidazole antibiotics.

### Minocycline in acne vulgaris: benefits and risks [^95fb3875]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Minocycline is a semi-synthetic, second-generation tetracycline. It was introduced in 1972 and has both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Minocycline is used for a variety of infectious diseases and in acne. Even today, new indications beyond the antibacterial indications are being investigated such as its use in neurologic diseases. Formerly, minocycline was thought to have a superior efficacy in the treatment of inflammatory acne, especially with respect to antibacterial-resistant Propionibacterium acnes. A thorough review of the literature, however, shows that minocycline is not more effective in acne than other tetracyclines. Compared with first-generation tetracyclines, minocycline has a better pharmacokinetic profile, and compared with doxycycline it is not phototoxic. However, minocycline has an increased risk of severe adverse effects compared with other tetracyclines. It may induce hypersensitivity reactions affecting the liver, lung, kidneys, or multiple organs (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms [DRESS] syndrome) in the first weeks of treatment and, with long-term treatment, may cause autoimmune reactions (systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hepatitis). In addition, CNS symptoms, such as dizziness, are more frequent compared with other tetracyclines. Long-term treatment may induce hyperpigmentation of the skin or other organs. Resistance of P. acnes to minocycline also occurs, dependent on the prescribing behavior. Considering the aspects of efficacy, its adverse effect profile, resistance, price, and alternatives, minocycline is no longer considered the first-line antibacterial in the treatment of acne.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^4bfebf96]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease—corticosteroids: We recommend oral corticosteroids for short-term induction of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Prednisone-equivalent dosing for active disease ranges from 40 to 60 mg/d, and the use of corticosteroids should not exceed 3 continuous months without attempting to introduce corticosteroid-sparing agents. Even short-term use may be accompanied by adverse events including venous thromboembolic events (5-fold increased risk). Despite effectiveness for symptom control, nearly 1 in 4 patients will have prolonged exposure to corticosteroids (greater than 6 months) with approximately 15% of patients becoming steroid-dependent.

### Management of acne vulgaris: a review [^6b760b61]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit of the skin that primarily involves the face and trunk and affects approximately 9% of the population worldwide (approximately 85% of individuals aged 12-24 years, and approximately 50% of patients aged 20-29 years). Acne vulgaris can cause permanent physical scarring, negatively affect quality of life and self-image, and has been associated with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.

Observations

Acne vulgaris is classified based on patient age, lesion morphology (comedonal, inflammatory, mixed, nodulocystic), distribution (location on face, trunk, or both), and severity (extent, presence or absence of scarring, postinflammatory erythema, or hyperpigmentation). Although most acne does not require specific medical evaluation, medical workup is sometimes warranted. Topical therapies such as retinoids (eg, tretinoin, adapalene), benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and/or combinations of topical agents are first-line treatments. When prescribed as a single therapy in a randomized trial of 207 patients, treatment with tretinoin 0.025% gel reduced acne lesion counts at 12 weeks by 63% compared with baseline. Combinations of topical agents with systemic agents (oral antibiotics such as doxycycline and minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral contraception [COC] or spironolactone, or isotretinoin) are recommended for more severe disease. In a meta-analysis of 32 randomized clinical trials, COC was associated with reductions in inflammatory lesions by 62%, placebo was associated with a 26% reduction, and oral antibiotics were associated with a 58% reduction at 6-month follow-up. Isotretinoin is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne but is often used to treat resistant or persistent moderate to severe acne, as well as acne that produces scarring or significant psychosocial distress.

Conclusions and Relevance

Acne vulgaris affects approximately 9% of the population worldwide and approximately 85% of those aged 12 to 24 years. First-line therapies are topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, or combinations of topicals. For more severe disease, oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral conceptive agents or spironolactone, or isotretinoin are most effective.

### Screening and management of the hyperandrogenic adolescent: ACOG committee opinion, number 789 [^4661def1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Hyperandrogenic adolescent—acne management favors topical or hormonal first-line options with adjuncts as needed. Acne treatment algorithms often show topical therapy as a first-line approach, and benzoyl peroxide is available over the counter; patients should be counseled that it can bleach hair or clothing, and for tolerability a dose escalation regimen can be used (for example, every other night for 1–2 weeks before nightly use). For patients who desire it, hormonal therapy such as a combination oral contraceptive pill (OCP) can be considered an acceptable first-line treatment, and hormonal therapy is an acceptable first-line approach for postmenarchal adolescents. Spironolactone can be used for acne with dose-dependent response; dosages of 25 mg daily may be effective and can be increased to a maximum of 100–200 mg/d. Oral antibiotics are typically used for moderate-to-severe acne, including chest/back or inflammatory lesions when topicals have not been useful; it is recommended that oral antibiotics be tapered or discontinued once new inflammatory lesions have stopped emerging, and current antibiotics recommended for acne do not interact with hormonal contraception. Working with a dermatologist can be beneficial for moderate-to-severe or refractory acne, and referral to a dermatologist should be made for complex cases.

Crohn's Disease

The safety of Ustekinumab was assessed in 1407 subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] greater than or equal to 220 and less than or equal to 450) in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trials. These 1407 subjects included 40 subjects who received a prior investigational intravenous ustekinumab formulation but were not included in the efficacy analyses. In trials CD-1 and CD-2 there were 470 subjects who received Ustekinumab 6 mg/kg as a weight-based single intravenous induction dose and 466 who received placebo [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Subjects who were responders in either trial CD-1 or CD-2 were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg Ustekinumab every 8 weeks, or placebo for 44 weeks in trial CD-3. Subjects in these 3 trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents [azathioprine (AZA), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate (MTX)], oral corticosteroids (prednisone or budesonide), and/or antibiotics for their Crohn's disease [see Clinical Studies (14.4)] .

The overall safety profile of Ustekinumab was consistent with the safety profile seen in the adult psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis clinical trials. Common adverse reactions in trials CD-1 and CD-2 and in trial CD-3 are listed in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.

Other less common adverse reactions reported in subjects in trials CD-1 and CD-2 included asthenia (1% vs 0.4%), acne (1% vs 0.4%), and pruritus (2% vs 0.4%).

Infections

In subjects with Crohn's disease, serious or other clinically significant infections included anal abscess, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. In addition, listeria meningitis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one patient each [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

[See FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information)] 

Patients taking Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should receive the following information and instructions:

Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by pregnant women or women attempting to conceive a child [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].
It is recommended that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets not be used by men who are attempting to father a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].
Patients should be advised that pseudomembranous colitis can occur with minocycline therapy. If patients develop watery or bloody stools, they should seek medical attention.
Patients should be counseled about the possibility of hepatotoxicity. Patients should seek medical advice if they experience symptoms which can include loss of appetite, tiredness, diarrhea, skin turning yellow, bleeding easily, confusion, and sleepiness.
Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. Patients should seek medical help for persistent headaches or blurred vision.
Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective [see Drug Interactions (7.5)].
Autoimmune syndromes, including drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, vasculitis and serum sickness have been observed with tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline. Symptoms may be manifested by arthralgia, fever, rash and malaise. Patients who experience such symptoms should be cautioned to stop the drug immediately and seek medical help.
Patients should be counseled about discoloration of skin, scars, teeth or gums that can arise from minocycline therapy.
Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines, including minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. Treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.
Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the current treatment course and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by other antibacterial drugs in the future.
Patients should be advised to swallow Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets whole and not to chew, crush, or split the tablets.

Hidradenitis suppurativa disease characteristics prior to adalimumab treatment are reported in Table 2. The majority of patients (61.4%) had Hurley stage III disease. The most common affected sites were the axilla (60.2%), buttocks (59.0%), and the inguinal and femoral regions (47.0%). The mean (SD) number of inflammatory nodules, abscesses, and drainage fistulas was 8.2 (7.4), 4.9 (7.6), and 5.6 (8.9), respectively. The mean (SD) HS disease period was 12.8 (11.1) years, and 33 (39.8%) patients had HS disease for a period ≥10 years.

TABLE 2 
HS disease characteristics prior to the start of adalimumab treatment

Note

The majority of patients (70/83 patients; 84.3%) had received prior medication for HS before starting adalimumab treatment (Table 3). Prior medications consisted of antibacterial drugs, anti‐inflammatory agents, and others, and were administered p.o. topically, or as an injection. The most common treatment types were oral antibacterial drugs (61/70 patients; 87.1%) and topical antibacterial drugs (20/70 patients; 28.6%). Prior medications received by ≥10 patients for HS were minocycline hydrochloride (25/70 patients; 35.7%), doxycycline hydrochloride hydrate (12/70 patients; 17.1%), and roxithromycin (10/70 patients; 14.3%) (Table S3). Non‐pharmacological therapy for HS prior to adalimumab treatment was received by 54 patients (65.1%). Therapy consisted of a surgical procedure (50/54 patients; 92.6%) and surgery (25/54 patients; 46.3%) (Table 3).

Thiopurines and methotrexate—use, dosing, and safety include that for newly diagnosed pediatric CD, 6-mercaptopurine, dosed at 1.5 mg/kg/d, administered in combination with the first course of corticosteroids, has demonstrated efficacy; adverse effects of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, myelosuppression, nausea, infections, hepatotoxicity, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and lymphoproliferative disorders, with risks of skin cancer and lymphoma demonstrated in observational studies and decreasing with medication discontinuation, and although these agents may be considered as steroid-sparing maintenance agents, accumulating risks associated with thiopurine exposures may outweigh the original steroid-sparing benefit. Methotrexate is also effective as a corticosteroid-sparing agent for the maintenance of CD remission, with parenteral methotrexate at 25 mg per week for at least 6 months with potential reduction to 15 mg per week; patients with normal small bowel absorption may be started on or switched to oral methotrexate at 15–25 mg once per week. Adverse effects related to methotrexate include nausea and vomiting, hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, bone marrow suppression and skin cancer, and likely lymphoma; the white blood cell counts and liver chemistries should be routinely monitored, and when prescribed to women with child-bearing capability, methotrexate should be administered only if highly effective contraception is in place. For patients on anti-TNF therapy, thiopurines or methotrexate may also be used as adjunctive therapy for reducing immunogenicity with methotrexate 12.5–15 mg orally once weekly; antidrug antibodies can develop as early as the first 100 days of treatment, and lower drug levels at week 14 and greater risk of loss of response may be associated with active smoking status, increased body mass index, and anti-TNF monotherapy, whereas earlier initiation of combination therapy with immunomodulators may yield more durable effectiveness.

Drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)-like injury—clinical phenotype, implicated agents, checkpoint inhibitor effects, and latency are detailed: Drug-induced liver injury can mimic AIH, and an unpredictable idiosyncratic or hypersensitivity drug reaction has been implicated in 2%-17% of patients with classical features of AIH. Minocycline, nitrofurantoin, infliximab have been most commonly incriminated. Immune-related adverse events with checkpoint inhibitors have usually improved with glucocorticoid therapy but lacked the laboratory and histological features characteristic of AIH; some cases have been resistant to glucocorticoid therapy and associated with bile duct injury, and the liver injuries associated with the checkpoint inhibitors should not be confused with AIH. The latency interval from drug exposure to disease onset ranges from 1-8 weeks to 3-12 months, but nitrofurantoin and minocycline can have latency periods that exceed 12 months, and the clinical history should detail all previous exposures to drugs and supplements.

### A multicentre, randomized, double-masked, parallel group, vehicle-controlled phase IIb study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1% and 3% topical minocycline gel in patients with papulopustular rosacea [^b3592548]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory lesions

The primary outcome measure of the study was the amount of decrease in the absolute inflammatory lesion count at week 12, compared with that at baseline. In the minocycline 1% and minocycline 3% arms, the mean decrease was 12·6 lesions and 13·1 lesions, respectively. The vehicle arm had a mean decrease of 7·9 lesions. The decreases in the mean number of lesions in the minocycline 1% and minocycline 3% arms were significantly greater than that in the vehicle arm [P = 0·015, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7·9–0·9, and P = 0·0073, 95% CI 8·3–1·3, respectively].

Table 3 3 and Figure 2 2 show the decreases in lesion count for each arm at each timepoint. The minocycline 3% arm achieved a significantly greater reduction in lesions than the vehicle arm did at week 4, and this result persisted throughout the remainder of the study. Minocycline 1% achieved significance at week 9 and maintained significance, compared with vehicle, throughout the treatment period. At 4 weeks following the cessation of treatment, a significant reduction in the inflammatory lesion count was maintained in the minocycline 3% arm but not in the minocycline 1% arm, as compared with that in the vehicle arm.

17	PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

[See FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information)]

Patients taking SOLODYN (minocycline HCl, USP) Extended Release Tablets should receive the following information and instructions:

SOLODYN should not be used by pregnant women or women attempting to conceive a child [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] .
It is recommended that SOLODYN not be used by men who are attempting to father a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].
Patients should be advised that pseudomembranous colitis can occur with minocycline therapy. If patients develop watery or bloody stools, they should seek medical attention.
Patients should be counseled about the possibility of hepatotoxicity. Patients should seek medical advice if they experience symptoms which can include loss of appetite, tiredness, diarrhea, skin turning yellow, bleeding easily, confusion, and sleepiness.
Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. Patients should seek medical help for persistent headaches or blurred vision.
Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective [see Drug Interactions (7.5)] .
Autoimmune syndromes, including drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, vasculitis and serum sickness have been observed with tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline. Symptoms may be manifested by arthralgia, fever, rash and malaise. Patients who experience such symptoms should be cautioned to stop the drug immediately and seek medical help.
Patients should be counseled about discoloration of skin, scars, teeth or gums that can arise from minocycline therapy.
Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines, including minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. Treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.
SOLODYN should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the current treatment course and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by other antibacterial drugs in the future.
Patients should be advised to swallow SOLODYN Tablets whole and not to chew, crush, or split the tablets.

### Real-world experience of upadacitinib reinduction and high-dose maintenance therapy in inflammatory bowel disease [^e3eae4d6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Upadacitinib (UPA) is approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Responders to UPA 45mg daily (QD) may lose response (LOR) after transition to lower maintenance doses. We describe our real-world experience of LOR, reinduction, and subsequent maintenance with UPA 45mg QD.

Methods

This is a prospective cohort study of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with UPA between April 2022 and November 2023. Included patients responded to UPA induction, had LOR after dose reduction, and subsequently received reinduction therapy with 45mg QD. Clinical, biochemical, radiologic and endoscopic data were collected; comparative statistics and Kaplan-Meier survival were calculated.

Results

181 patients (79 CD, 83 UC, 6 IBD-U, 13 IPAA) responded to UPA 45mg QD induction and were switched to a lower maintenance dose (30mg QD, N=180; 15mg QD, N=1), 46 (16 CD, 23 UC, 1 IBD-U, 6 IPAA; Table 1) met the above criteria. They were followed for a median duration 93 (interquartile range (IQR): 62-119) weeks . Relapse occurred at a median 21 (IQR: 8-46) weeks after dose reduction. Dose escalation to 45mgQD for a median 13 (IQR: 8-36) weeks recaptured clinical response in 80.4%. Among patients who recaptured response, 19 again reduced to 30mg or 15mg. Over a median 40 (IQR: 22-59) weeks, 93.8% patients on 45mg QD maintained remission versus 21.1% who again dropped to 30mg QD (p < 0.001). Disease extent and duration did not significantly predict response recapture. Acne/rosacea was the most common adverse event (39%); there were no serious adverse events.

Conclusion

Most patients with IBD who lose response to UPA when dose reduced in maintenance can be recaptured with 45mg QD. Among these, continuing 45mg QD for maintenance is effective, and appears safe.

Erythema severity score

Erythema was measured on a 4‐point scale from none to severe at each treatment visit. The decreases in erythema severity at week 12, with respect to baseline values, were 0·4, 0·6 and 0·4 for the minocycline 1%, minocycline 3% and vehicle arms, respectively. The minocycline 3% arm had a significantly greater reduction in the erythema severity score, compared with the vehicle arm (P = 0·039, 95% CI 0·4–0·0).

Patient satisfaction and safety

With respect to patient satisfaction, in response to the question ‘Do you like the product?’, 72%, 70% and 49% of patients responded ‘Yes’ at day 84 in the minocycline 1%, minocycline 3% and vehicle arms, respectively.

With respect to safety, there were three treatment‐related treatment‐emergent adverse events in the minocycline 1% arm, five in the minocycline 3% arm and one in the vehicle arm (Table 5 5). These adverse events were typically mild and transient.

Table 5 
Profile of treatment‐emergent adverse events related to investigational products

Eighty‐seven per cent of the patients in the minocycline 1% arm, and 79% in the minocycline 3% arm, completed the study, while 76% of patients in the vehicle arm completed the study. This finding appears to be similar to those reported in the published literature for similarly sized studies. Overall, minocycline gel appeared to be well tolerated and safe.

Investigator's Global Assessment

Success on the IGA was achieved at week 12 in 39%, 46% and 31% of patients in the minocycline 1%, minocycline 3% and vehicles arms, respectively. Table 4 4 shows the proportion of patients achieving success on the IGA and the IGAe, for each treatment arm vs. the vehicle arm. Compared with the vehicle arm, the minocycline 3% arm had a significantly greater proportion of patients achieving success on the IGA [P = 0·038, odds ratio (OR) 95% CI 1·04–3·95]. The percentage of patients achieving success in each study arm is shown in Figure 3 3.000000000000000e+00

### A multicentre, randomized, double-masked, parallel group, vehicle-controlled phase IIb study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1% and 3% topical minocycline gel in patients with papulopustular rosacea [^adc5339e]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Papulopustular rosacea is characterized by chronic facial erythema and inflammatory facial lesions. Minocycline has anti‐inflammatory properties which may be effective in the treatment of rosacea inflammatory lesions.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of once‐daily topical minocycline gel 1% and 3% in patients with papulopustular rosacea.

Methods

This was a prospective, 12‐week, double‐blinded study conducted at 26 sites in the United States; 270 patients with papulopustular rosacea and 12–40 inflammatory lesions were randomized to minocycline 1%, minocycline 3% or vehicle. The primary endpoint was the mean change in inflammatory lesions at week 12. Key secondary endpoints included success on an Investigator's Global Assessment.

Results

Baseline mean lesion counts were 24·6, 25·1 and 24·3 in the minocycline 1%, minocycline 3% and vehicle groups, respectively; at week 12, the counts had decreased by 12·6, 13·1 and 7·9, respectively. Minocycline significantly decreased lesions, compared with the vehicle [P = 0·01, 95% confidence interval 7·9 to 0·9, for minocycline 1%; P = 0·007, 95%8·3 to 1·3, for minocycline 3%]. The proportion of patients achievingsuccess was 39% in the minocycline 1% arm [P = 0·34, odds ratio 1·396 and95%0·71 to 2·75 vs. vehicle], 46% in the minocycline 3% arm (P = 0·04,2·03 and95%1·04 to 3·95 vs. vehicle) and 31% in the vehicle arm.

Conclusions

Minocycline topical gel appears to be safe and tolerable at concentrations of 1% and 3%, and both concentrations significantly decreased inflammatory lesion counts, with a significantly larger proportion of patients achievingsuccess at week 12 in the minocycline 3% arm. These findings support further evaluation of minocycline gel for treating inflammatory lesions associated with papulopustular rosacea.

### Efficacy and safety of subantimicrobial dose, modified-release doxycycline 40 mg versus doxycycline 100 mg versus placebo for the treatment of inflammatory lesions in moderate and severe acne: a randomized, double-blinded, controlled study [^31fa634b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Routine use of doxycycline (DC) 100 mg for the treatment of moderate to severe acne may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs), thus potentially impacting patient adherence, and antibiotic resistance. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of subantimicrobial, modified-release (MR) DC 40 mg compared to DC 100 mg and to placebo for the treatment of inflammatory lesions in moderate and severe acne.

Methods

662 subjects aged 12 years or older with moderate to severe acne received subantimicrobial, MR-DC 40 mg tablets, DC 100 mg capsules, or placebo once daily for 16 weeks.

Results

MR-DC 40 mg was superior to placebo in the mean reduction of the number of inflammatory lesions, median percent reduction in inflammatory and total lesions, and success rate. MR-DC 40 mg was also comparable to DC 100 mg in the reduction of the number of inflammatory lesions, and percent reduction of total lesions. Incidence of drug-related AEs for MR-DC 40 mg was similar to placebo and was markedly smaller compared to DC 100 mg.

Discussion

MR-DC 40 mg demonstrated comparable efficacy and superior safety to DC 100 mg in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne.
