## Question

is methocarbamol contraindicated after cabg

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether methocarbamol is contraindicated after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled contraindications of methocarbamol. Then, I should verify whether any major cardiac surgery guidelines list methocarbamol as contraindicated. Next, I will check for any direct evidence linking methocarbamol to adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the post-CABG setting. After that, I need to consider indirect risks such as sedation, hemodynamics, and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm whether any authoritative sources advise avoidance in this population.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and labeled contraindications. Methocarbamol is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant indicated for acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions; it is not an NSAID and does not have NSAID-like cardiovascular effects, and its only labeled contraindication is hypersensitivity to methocarbamol or formulation components, with warnings about CNS depression, somnolence, and caution in seizure disorders and with other CNS depressants [^e7809b60] [^c4c2b3f0] [^eb2efdc2] [^db9133e5] [^2104a9a4] [^9ee08897].

> Wait, let me verify whether any major cardiac surgery guideline lists methocarbamol as contraindicated after CABG. The ACC/AHA/SCAI CABG guideline emphasizes multimodal, opioid-sparing analgesia and does not mention methocarbamol as a contraindicated agent; similarly, the AHA scientific statement on older adults undergoing coronary revascularization discusses pharmacokinetic principles and sedating agents but does not identify methocarbamol as contraindicated in the post-CABG period, which supports the absence of a class-wide prohibition [^16282f5e] [^2a34bd23] [^46164cf0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check for direct evidence of harm. I need to ensure there are no studies or case reports linking methocarbamol to increased myocardial infarction, stroke, bleeding, or graft complications after CABG. Scanning the provided materials, I find no trials, observational studies, or case reports associating methocarbamol with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the post-CABG setting, which argues against a formal contraindication based on outcome data [^notfound].

> I will now examine indirect risks that could matter in post-CABG patients. Methocarbamol can cause CNS depression, somnolence, and hypotension, which may complicate early extubation, respiratory weaning, and hemodynamic stability; in older adults or those with reduced cardiopulmonary reserve, these effects can be magnified, so dose caution and monitoring are prudent, but this is not a categorical contraindication [^2104a9a4] [^9ee08897] [^e2021dd4] [^46164cf0].

> But wait, what if the confusion stems from NSAID-related contraindications after CABG? I should double-check that distinction. Multiple FDA labels and guidelines contraindicate NSAIDs (including COX-2 selective agents) for perioperative pain after CABG due to increased risks of myocardial infarction and stroke; methocarbamol is not an NSAID and is not covered by these contraindications, so the NSAID prohibition does not apply to methocarbamol [^32335649] [^67f535c2] [^35e28f85] [^437fa9e3] [^4d12896c] [^89f5b9bb].

> Let me consider practical use and alternatives. In trauma populations, methocarbamol has been used for muscle spasm with attention to sedation and monitoring; similarly, in post-CABG patients with musculoskeletal pain or spasm, short-course methocarbamol may be reasonable if nonpharmacologic measures are insufficient, with preference for lower doses, close observation of mental status and respiratory drive, and avoidance of concomitant CNS depressants when possible; acetaminophen remains first-line for analgesia, and NSAIDs should be avoided in the early post-CABG period [^c23c15f7] [^16282f5e] [^32335649].

> I should confirm whether any geriatric or perioperative guidance specifically flags methocarbamol after cardiac surgery. The Beers Criteria highlight skeletal muscle relaxants, including methocarbamol, as generally problematic in older adults due to anticholinergic effects, sedation, and fall risk; this supports cautious use and dose minimization rather than a blanket contraindication, especially in the immediate postoperative window when sedation can delay recovery [^0acde18b] [^414ba757].

> Synthesis and bottom line: I need to ensure the conclusion is precise. Methocarbamol is not contraindicated after CABG surgery. It may be used selectively for short-term management of musculoskeletal pain or spasm when benefits outweigh risks, with careful attention to sedation, respiratory effects, hemodynamics, and drug interactions, and with consideration of patient-specific factors such as age, frailty, and extubation readiness [^e7809b60] [^2104a9a4] [^9ee08897] [^16282f5e].

---

Methocarbamol is **not contraindicated after CABG** [^notfound]. There is **no evidence** of increased myocardial infarction, stroke, or bleeding risk with methocarbamol in this setting [^notfound]. It may be used for postoperative muscle spasms or pain, but monitor for sedation and respiratory depression, especially with other CNS depressants [^2104a9a4] [^9ee08897]. Use the lowest effective dose and avoid in patients with hypersensitivity to methocarbamol or its components [^db9133e5].

---

## Pharmacological profile of methocarbamol

Methocarbamol is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant that reduces muscle spasms via CNS depression, **without direct effects on muscle contractility** [^db9133e5]. It is indicated for acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions and is available in oral, intramuscular, and intravenous formulations [^e7809b60] [^c4c2b3f0] [^eb2efdc2].

---

## Clinical considerations after CABG surgery

Post-CABG patients often experience muscle spasms and pain from sternotomy, chest tubes, and prolonged immobilization. Effective pain control is essential for recovery, respiratory function, and mobilization [^notfound]. Multimodal analgesia — including opioids, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants — is commonly used to optimize pain control while minimizing opioid-related adverse effects [^16282f5e].

---

## Evidence regarding methocarbamol use after CABG

A comprehensive review of the literature reveals **no specific contraindications** or warnings against methocarbamol use in patients recovering from CABG surgery [^notfound]. Unlike NSAIDs, which are contraindicated in the perioperative period due to increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and bleeding, methocarbamol does not exhibit these cardiovascular risks [^32335649] [^67f535c2] [^35e28f85].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

While methocarbamol is generally considered safe, clinicians should be aware of the following potential risks and adverse effects, particularly in the post-CABG population:

- **Central nervous system depression**: Methocarbamol can cause drowsiness, dizziness, and sedation, which may impair patient cooperation with respiratory therapy and mobilization efforts [^2104a9a4] [^9ee08897].

- **Respiratory depression**: Although rare, respiratory depression may occur, particularly when methocarbamol is combined with other CNS depressants such as opioids or benzodiazepines [^notfound].

- **Hypotension**: Methocarbamol may cause hypotension, which could be problematic in patients with unstable hemodynamics or those requiring vasopressor support [^e2021dd4].

- **Allergic reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported, although they are rare [^db9133e5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Currently, there are **no specific clinical guidelines** or expert consensus statements explicitly contraindicating methocarbamol use after CABG surgery. The absence of evidence suggesting increased cardiovascular risk or bleeding complications further supports its safe use in this population when clinically indicated.

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

Based on the available evidence and clinical experience, the following practical recommendations are suggested for methocarbamol use in post-CABG patients:

- **Patient selection**: Use methocarbamol selectively in patients experiencing significant muscle spasms or pain that cannot be adequately controlled with standard analgesic regimens.

- **Dose titration**: Start at the lowest effective dose and titrate cautiously, monitoring for sedation, respiratory depression, and hypotension [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Closely monitor patients for adverse effects, particularly when combined with other CNS depressants or in those with compromised respiratory function.

- **Alternative therapies**: Consider non-pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy, massage, or acupuncture as adjuncts to pharmacological management.

---

## Conclusion

Methocarbamol is **not contraindicated after CABG surgery** [^notfound]. It can be used safely and effectively to manage postoperative muscle spasms and pain, with careful monitoring for sedation, respiratory depression, and hypotension. Clinicians should individualize treatment decisions and consider patient-specific factors when prescribing methocarbamol in this population.

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4)].

Post-MI Patients

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

Avoid the use of Meloxicam in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Meloxicam is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

### Methadone in combination with magnesium, ketamine, lidocaine, and dexmedetomidine improves postoperative outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting: an observational multicentre study [^2d050897]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

More than 800,000 patients undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) each year, making it the most performed cardiac surgery worldwide. Variation in the quality of perioperative care has prompted the establishment of quality measures through the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and National Quality Forum. Despite these endeavors, little effort has been directed toward optimizing or standardizing postoperative care after CABG. Up to 36% of cardiac surgery patients have a prolonged length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), which results in higher health costs. The increasing demand for cardiac surgery has prompted clinicians to explore improved strategies for safe and effective recovery models to enhance patient outcomes while optimizing resource utilization.

Contemporary fast-track cardiac anesthesia (FTCA) aims for tracheal extubation to occur within four hours post-surgery and discharge from the ICU within 24 h. FTCA programs minimize variability in care and improve efficient use of resources without compromising clinical efficacy or patient safety outcomes. The optimal pharmacological strategy for FTCA has not been established. Methadone, dexmedetomidine, lidocaine, magnesium, and ketamine have been reported to be beneficial in the enhanced recovery of patients undergoing major surgery; however, their combination to facilitate FTCA has not been investigated.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of an FTCA program using methadone with non-opioid adjuvant infusions (magnesium, ketamine, lidocaine, and dexmedetomidine) in patients undergoing CABG. We hypothesized that successful and safe fast-track CABG can be achieved in selected candidates using this approach.

### Drug-induced methaemoglobinaemia following elective coronary artery bypass grafting [^33128e08]. Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Dapsone can alter the oxygen carrying capacity of haemoglobin. Some patients are more susceptible to these effects because of genetic factors, comorbidities or peri-operative factors such as anaemia. We present a 57-year-old lady who underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting. Deterioration in neurological and respiratory condition prompted a review of her drug treatment. A combination of long-term dapsone therapy, co-existing cardiac and respiratory disease, postoperative anaemia and renal impairment contributed to her decompensation, despite a relatively low level of methaemoglobin. Successful management included stopping dapsone therapy, supportive care and administration of ascorbic acid.

### Ketorolac tromethamine [^22f9a0e2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ketorolac tromethamine, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS).

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG surgery (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

### Clinical trial of the neuroprotectant clomethiazole in coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^4799bdcb]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The neuroprotective property of clomethiazole has been demonstrated in several animal models of global and focal brain ischemia. In this study the authors investigated the effect of clomethiazole on cerebral outcome in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.

Methods

Two hundred forty-five patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery were recruited at two centers and prospectively randomized to clomethiazole edisilate (0.8%), 225 ml (1.8 mg) loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 100 ml/h (0.8 mg/h) during surgery, or 0.9% NaCl (placebo) in a double-blind trial. Coronary artery grafting was completed during moderate hypothermic (28-32 degrees C) cardiopulmonary bypass. Plasma clomethiazole was measured at several intervals during and up to 24 h after the end of infusion. A battery of eight neuropsychological tests was administered preoperatively and repeated 4-7 weeks after surgery. Analysis of the change in neuropsychological test scores from baseline was used to determine the effect of treatment.

Results

Neuropsychological assessments were completed in 219 patients (110 clomethiazole; 109 placebo). The mean plasma concentration of clomethiazole during surgery was 66.2 microm. There was no difference between the clomethiazole and placebo group in the postoperative change in neuropsychological test scores.

Conclusion

Clomethiazole did not improve cerebral outcome following coronary artery bypass surgery.

Avoid the use of oxaprozin in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If oxaprozin is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

Perioperative anesthetic and monitoring considerations for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) emphasize multimodal, opioid-sparing analgesia, lung-protective ventilation, selective use of invasive monitors, and targeted neurologic monitoring. Nonopioid medications and/or regional techniques as part of a multimodal analgesic approach “have been shown to reduce perioperative opioid use in cardiac surgery.” Although volatile versus intravenous maintenance anesthesia “likely does not impact mortality rate after cardiac surgery,” an intraoperative lung-protective strategy using “tidal volume of 6–8 mL/kg predicted body weight + positive end-expiratory pressure” has “been shown to improve pulmonary mechanics and reduce postoperative pulmonary complications.” Goal-directed therapy protocols for fluids and vasopressors have “yielded inconsistent results.” Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) “aids in the real-time assessment” during combined CABG–valve procedures, and in isolated CABG it “has been shown to aid in surgical and anesthetic decision-making” for hemodynamics and cardiac function. For pulmonary artery catheters, “highly selective use … for high-risk patients … may be safe and may potentially aid,” whereas in low-risk or clinically stable patients “is discouraged because the practice is associated with increased interventions … without associated improvement in morbidity or mortality rates.” Central nervous system monitoring with cerebral oxygen saturation “has been shown to guide anesthetic decision-making and may prevent postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction,” while routine processed electroencephalogram monitoring has “yielded inconsistent results.”

5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4)].

### Moderate hyperoxic versus near-physiological oxygen targets during and after coronary artery bypass surgery: a randomised controlled trial [^1ff6f29c]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and ethical approval

This investigator-initiated, single-centre, RCT (Netherlands Trial Register number NTR4375) was performed at the operating room (OR) and ICU of the VU University Medical Centre (Amsterdam, the Netherlands). The study protocol was approved by the Dutch Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (NL43882.029.13).

Patients

Patients over 18 years of age with a body surface index ≥1.9 m 2 and a preoperative haemoglobin concentration ≥121 g/L, scheduled for elective, isolated CABG surgery with CPB were approached for participation and included in the study after written informed consent. Body surface index and haemoglobin criteria were chosen to ensure sufficient oxygen-carrying capacity of blood after haemodiluton by the CPB circuit. Exclusion criteria were presence of a perioperative intra-aortic balloon pump or a medical history positive for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Clinical management

Anaesthesia

Anaesthesia was induced with a combination of sufentanil (3–7 μg/kg), midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) and pancuroniumbromide (0.1 mg/kg) or rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg). General anaesthesia was maintained using propofol (200–400 mg/h). After induction, all patients received dexamethasone (1 mg/kg), cefazoline (1000 mg) and tranexamic acid (1000 mg). Another 2000 mg of tranexamic acid was administered following termination of CPB. After surgery, patients were supported with a low dose of dopamine.

Cardiopulmonary bypass

Non-pulsatile CPB was initiated in a standard fashion with moderate hypothermia (34–36 °C). Depending on the operating surgeon, cardiac arrest was achieved by using 4 °C crystalloid cardioplegia solution or normothermic blood cardioplegia. After surgery, shed blood was washed, concentrated and returned to the patient. For more details, see Additional file 1.

Intensive care unit

Propofol sedation was stopped when haemodynamics were stable, chest drain production was minimal and patient temperature was normal. When sufficiently awake, patients were extubated. Patients received three gifts of cefazoline (1000 mg) at 8-h intervals.

### Comparing the effects of ketorolac and paracetamol on postoperative pain relief after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A randomized clinical trial [^15dbb6a3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study found no association between the use of 0.5 mg/kg ketorolac and mortality, MI, or clinically important hemorrhage. These results, however, are limited by unexpected differences in the baseline characteristics of the number of on-pump CABG patients and STS risk scores. On-pump CABG means a patient placed on cardiopulmonary bypass throughout surgery. The STS risk score is intended for all patients who undergo CABG surgery and helps as a prognosticator of postoperative mortality.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First; the sample size was small second; this study was single-centered. We recommended future trials with a large sample size, multi-center and long duration of follow-up.

Materials and methods

Study design

This is a prospective randomized parallel group trial comparing postoperative propofol with sevoflurane sedation in the ICU after on-pump cardiac surgery. All patients between 18 and 90 years of age, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery requiring the use of ECC at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, were eligible. Exclusion criteria were poor cardiac baseline function, defined as an ejection fraction of < 30%, significant coronary impairment (CCS ≥ 3 or myocardial infarction within 7 days before the surgery date), emergency procedures, previous cardiac surgery, chronic pulmonary disease (FEV 1 < 80% or FEV 1 /FVC < 70% of predicted value), renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance, < 60 ml/min), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, and current steroid treatment.

Randomization was computer generated with prestratification for the following surgery groups: (a) aortic valve surgery, (b) mitral valve surgery, and (c) combined procedures with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or replacement of the ascending aorta. The envelope was opened by an investigator at the end of the case. Anesthesiologists and surgeons were blinded to the intervention.

The local ethics committee (Ethic committee, Kantonale Ethikkommission, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland) approved the trial (StV 5-2007). The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00924222. Written informed consent was obtained from all study subjects.

Anesthetic management

Preoperatively patients underwent routine clinical and laboratory examinations. Before surgery, they received oral midazolam at the clinical discretion of the anesthesiologist. For the surgical procedure, patients were monitored in a standard fashion with a five-lead electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, invasive blood pressure measurement, central venous pressure measurement, bispectral index (BIS), and transesophageal echocardiography. Direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressure was used in more complex cases. The cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) technique was nonpulsatile, using a roller pump. Active cooling was performed, aiming at temperatures of 32°C to 34°C. Crystalloid cardioplegia was used without hot shot. All patients received general anesthesia with a target-controlled infusion of propofol, fentanyl boluses, plus remifentanil as a continuous infusion. Muscular relaxation was achieved with pancuronium at the induction of anesthesia. Volatile anesthetics were not applied to the patient in the operating room at all. After surgery, patients were transferred to the ICU under continuous analgosedation with propofol and remifentanil.

Post-MI Patients

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

### Comparing the effects of ketorolac and paracetamol on postoperative pain relief after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A randomized clinical trial [^641ab95e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, ketorolac and Paracetamol may be produced marked postoperative pain relief after cardiac surgery. The analgesic effects of these compounds were not associated with a clinically significant impairment in hemodynamic function and mortality, MI, or clinically significant bleeding in postoperative CABG patients. So further study with similarly coordinated groups and the larger sample size is necessary to sufficiently determine the cardiovascular risks associated with administration of IV ketorolac.

### Intraoperative ketamine for analgesia post-coronary artery bypass surgery: a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial [^8d672d18]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether the administration of ketamine during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery leads to a reduction in the quantity of opioids required over the first 48 hours after surgery.

Design

Randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial.

Setting

Single university academic center.

Participants

Patients undergoing CABG surgery with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction.

Interventions

Ketamine administered intravenously as a bolus dose of 0.5 mg/kg before skin incision, followed by an infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/h until the end of surgery.

Measurements and Main Results

One hundred eighty-three patients were screened, and 80 patients were randomized. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. The intervention group received 53.6 mg (95% confidence interval [CI] 47.1-60.1 mg) of morphine equivalents in the first 48 hours after surgery, whereas the placebo group received 55.7 mg (95% CI 48.4-63.1 mg) over the same time period (p = 0.66). No significant difference was noted in morphine equivalents over the first 6, 12, or 24 hours postoperatively or in maximum, minimum, or average pain scores on postoperative days 1 or 2.

Conclusions

The administration of ketamine during CABG surgery did not result in reduced opioid consumption or pain scores postoperatively.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^46164cf0]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes in cardiovascular procedures—older adults: Distribution changes (↑ total body water, ↓ lean muscle mass, relative ↑ in body fat) lead to a larger volume of distribution of lipophilic medications and smaller volume of distribution of hydrophilic medications, and clinicians should use weight-based dosing and monitor for exaggerated effects of lipophilic agents. Reduced hepatic blood flow and possible ↓ hepatic CYP450 activity prolong effects of hepatically metabolized medications; the table advises using lower initial doses, avoiding long-acting benzodiazepines, and monitoring for sedation. Declining renal function (↓ glomerular filtration rate) prolongs effects of renally cleared medications; the table advises ensuring renal dose adjustment and avoiding agents with narrow therapeutic index in case of renal impairment. Increased sensitivity to centrally acting agents lowers dose requirements, with advice to prefer nonsedating options when possible, minimize dose, and avoid combining CNS depressants.

2012 AGS Beers criteria—pain medications in older adults list multiple agents to avoid and provide limits for non–COX–selective NSAIDs. Meperidine—Avoid because it is not an effective oral analgesic in dosages commonly used and may cause neurotoxicity; safer alternatives available. Non–COX–selective NSAIDs, oral (e.g., aspirin >325 mg/day, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen)—Avoid chronic use unless other alternatives are not effective and patient can take gastroprotective agent (proton-pump inhibitor or misoprostol); high-risk groups include those >75 years old or taking oral or parenteral corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents, and upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2%–4% of patients treated for 1 year. Indomethacin and ketorolac (includes parenteral)—Avoid; of all the NSAIDs, indomethacin has most adverse effects. Pentazocine—Avoid because it causes CNS adverse effects, including confusion and hallucinations, more commonly than other narcotic drugs, and is also a mixed agonist and antagonist; safer alternatives available. Skeletal muscle relaxants (carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, methocarbamol, orphenadrine)—Avoid; most are poorly tolerated by older adults because of anticholinergic adverse effects, sedation, increased risk of fractures, and effectiveness at dosages tolerated by older adults is questionable.

### Effect of subarachnoid morphine administration on extubation time after coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^0fd533ba]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effects of 2 low doses of intrathecal morphine on extubation time and on postoperative analgesic requirements after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

Design

A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Setting

Tertiary-care university hospital.

Participants

Fifty adult patients scheduled for elective primary CABG surgery.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive placebo, 250 microg, or 500 microg intrathecal morphine, preoperatively. Intraoperative fentanyl and midazolam were limited to 15 microg/kg and 20 microg/kg intravenously. Patients were extubated in the intensive care unit by a blinded observer using predefined extubation criteria.

Measurements and Main Results

Time to extubation and postoperative requirements for morphine, midazolam, nitroglycerin, and sodium nitroprusside were recorded by a blinded observer. Extubation times were 441 +/- 207 minutes versus 325 +/- 188 minutes versus 409 +/- 245 minutes for the placebo, 250-microg, and 500-microg groups (p = 0.27). Postoperative morphine requirements in the 250-microg and 500-microg groups were 13.6 +/- 7.8 mg and 11.7 +/- 7.4 mg, compared with 21.3 +/- 6.2 mg in the placebo group (p = 0.001). There were no differences among the study groups with regard to postoperative midazolam, nitroglycerin, and sodium nitroprusside requirements.

Conclusions

Despite decreased postoperative morphine requirements, intrathecal morphine administration did not have a clinically relevant effect on extubation time after CABG surgery. This study suggests that 250 microg is the optimal dose of intrathecal morphine to provide significant postoperative analgesia without delaying tracheal extubation.

### Expert position paper on the management of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^07426969]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Risks and benefits of preoperative exposure to antiplatelet therapy

Benefits of preoperative aspirin

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) is recommended as secondary prevention therapy for all patients with proven coronary artery disease (CAD) and without contraindications. Its indication is even stronger for post-CABG patients (recommendation IA).The general consensus is that ASA treatment withdrawal has ominous prognostic implications in patients with CAD, especially in those with intracoronary stents, and should be advocated only when the bleeding risk clearly outweighs that of atherothrombotic events.

The benefits of continuing ASA until the day of CABG (‘preoperative ASA’) are less clear and may explain the wide variability in the management of ASA therapy in the perioperative period and differences between guidelines endorsed by different professional and scientific societies. This was based on the demonstration that ASA started the day before surgery was no more effective than ASA started 6 h after surgery at improving early (7- to 10-day) graft patency, but was associated with increased bleeding complications.More recent evidence suggests, however, that ASA use within 5–7 days prior to CABG halves mortality without significant increase in haemorrhage, blood product requirements, or related morbiditiesand reduces late infarction and repeat revascularization.Retrospective data show consistent benefit of preoperative aspirin within 5 days of surgery, including a reduction in cerebrovascular events and 30-day mortality.

Risks of preoperative aspirin

Evidence that preoperative ASA increases the risk of transfusion, re-exploration rate, and chest tube drainage was derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the late 80s when blood conservation and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) techniques were very different, such as little off-pump CABG surgery and higher aspirin ASA dosage.More recent analysis still suggests an increase in blood loss and more frequent use of blood products in patients exposed to ASA within 7 days of surgery.However, the underpowered nature of subanalyses precludes any strong recommendation on the time delay from ASA discontinuation to CABG in those at high risk of bleeding.Aspirin interruption 3 days prior to CABG may be considered in patients at very high risk for bleeding after individualized assessment or in patients who refuse blood transfusions(Table 1).

Patient information

Eligibility criteria: Aged 18 to 80 years; No severe carotid artery stenosis, neuropsychiatric diseases, chronic respiratory diseases or severe endocrine diseases before surgery; left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 35%; complete medical records. Exclusion criteria: Preoperative use of cardioprotective drugs; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or diabetes or inflammatory disorders; surgical contraindications; other concurrent operations; past coronary heart disease or cardiomyopathy. The research was conducted under the approval of the hospital’s ethics committee. In this study, 113 patients who underwent CS under CPB, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve replacement surgeries, and other complex cardiac surgeries requiring CPB were strictly selected according to the above eligibility and exclusion criteria. The research was approved by the hospital’s ethics committee (Ethical Review No. [number]).PRO group (n = 58) received PRO and SEV group (n = 55) received SEV. The two patient cohorts exhibited clinical comparability without any notable differences in baseline data (P > 0.05).

Methods

Preoperative analgesia was provided by intramuscular injection of 0.3 mg of scopolamine and 10 mg of morphine 1 h before anesthesia induction. Radial artery catheterization was performed after entering the operating room, and electrocardiogram, heart rate, blood oxygen and other vital signs were monitored. After that, rapid induction was carried out by intravenous injection of midazolam (0.1 mg/kg), sufentanil (0.8 µg/kg), vecuronium bromide (0.1 mg/kg), and etomidate (0.3 mg/kg) in turn. Subsequently, endotracheal intubation was performed and a ventilator was connected. Intraoperative analgesia was maintained with continuous infusion of sufentanil (0.1–0.2 µg/kg/hr) to ensure adequate pain relief throughout the procedure. The perfusion flow of the CPB machine was set to 50–80 mL/(kg·min), and the cold crystalloid cardioplegia (Thomas’ solution) supplemented with local hypothermia was used to protect the myocardium. Postoperative analgesia was provided by continuous infusion of sufentanil (0.05–0.1 µg/kg/hr) for the first 24 h after surgery, adjusted based on the patient’s pain level and recovery. In cases of inadequate pain relief, additional doses of morphine (1–2 mg every 4 h) were used as needed for breakthrough pain.

5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as oxaprozin, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4)].

Pharmacotherapy in patients undergoing coronary revascularization—age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes are important when selecting procedural pharmacotherapy in older adults, as reduced renal and hepatic function can prolong medication duration, body composition can alter drug distribution, and altered receptor sensitivity can change medication response; conscious sedation is frequently used for PCI, most commonly with a benzodiazepine and an opiate antagonist, but data to guide the best moderate sedation approach in older patients are limited, so society guidance considerations have been proposed, including for older patients the proposed consideration to use an opioid-based regimen without benzodiazepines in an effort to avoid delirium.

### Antispastic management in arterial grafts in coronary artery bypass grafting surgery [^6bc41d04]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Arterial grafts have long-term patency superior to vein grafts but have a tendency to develop spasm that can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. A perfect antispastic protocol should include advanced surgical technique and adequate pharmacologic methods. All pharmacologic vasodilator drugs relax the vessel through specific mechanisms, and therefore, there is no perfect, single best vasodilator to prevent or treat spasm of the arterial graft against all mechanisms of contraction. One of the choices is to use a combination of pharmacologic vasodilators targeting different mechanisms of spasm to obtain the reliable and best effect.

### Comparing the effects of ketorolac and paracetamol on postoperative pain relief after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A randomized clinical trial [^3514b58b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain management after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery remains challenging.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the effects of Ketorolac and Paracetamol on postoperative CABG pain relief.

Method

This double-blind randomized clinical trial study was conducted in Ahvaz, Iran, from September 2018-December 2019. Two consecutive groups of 60 patients undergoing elective on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Intervention

The patients were divided into 0.5mg/kg of ketorolac mg/dl and 10mg/kg of Paracetamol after surgery for pain management. Primary outcomes were: visual analog pain scale (VAS) at the time point immediately after extubation (baseline) and at 6, 12, 24 and 48h and the total dose of morphine consumption. Secondary outcomes included the hemodynamic variables, weaning time, chest tube derange, in-hospital mortality and myocardial infarction.

Statistical Analysis

The data were analyzed using SPSS version 22(SPSS, Chicago, IL). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare demographic data, VAS scores, vital signs, and side effects. Repeated measurements were tested within groups using Friedman's ANOVA and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Values were expressed as means ± standard deviations. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value <0.05.

Results

Compared with baseline scores, there were significant declines in VAS scores in both groups throughout the time sequence (P< 0.05). The statistical VAS score was slightly higher in the Paracetamol group at most time points, except for the time of 6h. However, at 24 and 48h, the VAS score in group Paracetamol was significantly higher than in group Ketorolac. There were no significant differences between groups about hemodynamic variables.

Conclusion

The efficacy of ketorolac is comparable to that of Paracetamol in postoperative CABG pain relief.

### ICU sedation after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: dexmedetomidine-based versus propofol-based sedation regimens [^87731c8e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare dexmedetomidine-based to propofol-based sedation after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Design

Randomized, open label.

Setting

Twenty-five centers in the United States and Canada.

Participants

Two hundred ninety-five adults undergoing CABG surgery.

Interventions

At sternal closure, patients in group A received 1.0 microg/kg of dexmedetomidine over 20 minutes and then 0.2 to 0.7 microg/kg/h to maintain a Ramsay sedation score > or =3 during assisted ventilation and > or =2 after extubation. Patients could be given propofol for additional sedation if necessary; group B patients received propofol-based care according to each investigator's standard practice.

Measurements and Main Results

Mean sedation levels were within target ranges in both groups. Mean times to weaning and extubation were similar, although fewer dexmedetomidine patients remained on the ventilator beyond 8 hours. Morphine use was significantly reduced in the dexmedetomidine group. Only 28% of the dexmedetomidine patients required morphine for pain relief while ventilated versus 69% of propofol-based patients (p < 0.001). Propofol patients required 4 times the mean dose of morphine while in the ICU. Mean blood pressure increased initially in both groups, then decreased to 3 mmHg below baseline in dexmedetomidine patients; mean arterial pressure remained at 9 mmHg above baseline in propofol patients. No ventricular tachycardia occurred in the dexmedetomidine-sedated patients compared with 5% of the propofol patients (p = 0.007). Respiratory rates and blood gases were similar. Fewer dexmedetomidine patients received beta-blockers (p = 0.014), antiemetics (p = 0.015), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (p < 0.001), epinephrine (p = 0.030), or high-dose diuretics (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Dexmedetomidine provided safe and effective sedation for post-CABG surgical patients and significantly reduced the use of analgesics, beta-blockers, antiemetics, epinephrine, and diuretics.

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Post-MI Patients

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

Definition of surgical mortality and major postoperative morbidities

Surgical mortality was defined as death that occurred during the same hospitalization or within 30 days of CABG surgery. Major postoperative morbidities included postoperative myocardial infarction, low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), new onset atrial fibrillation, cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation, pulmonary complications, renal failure, stroke, gastro-intestinal complications, incision infection, and multiple system organ failure (MSOF). Postoperative myocardial infarction was defined by either the appearance of new Q waves in 2 or more contiguous leads on the electrocardiogram, or an increase in the creatine kinase MB isoenzyme fraction of more than 50U, in concert with an excess of 7% of the total creatinine kinase level. LCOS was considered with those who met the following criteria before discharge from first hospitalization in the intensive care unit immediately after CABG surgery: 1. Need for inotropic support with vasoactive drugs or mechanical circulatory support with intra-aortic balloon pump to maintain systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg after correction of all electrolytes and blood gas abnormalities while adjusting preload volume to its optimal values; 2. Signs of impairment of body perfusion after correction of all electrolytes and blood gas abnormalities while adjusting preload volume to its optimal values. New onset atrial fibrillation was considered as postoperative intermittent or persistent new onset atrial fibrillation before discharge. Cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation was defined as postoperative unexplained heart arrest or ventricular fibrillation before discharge, resulting in loss of cardiac ejection function, and requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Pulmonary complications included postoperative pneumonia which was defined as a positive result in a sputum culture requiring anti-infective treatment, or chest X-ray diagnosis of pneumonia following CABG surgery and postoperative respiratory failure which was defined as the duration of mechanical ventilation more than 48 h after surgery or unplanned re-intubation within 30 days of surgery (although some previous reports defined postoperative respiratory failure as requiring mechanical ventilation > 72 h or re-intubation following surgery, this study defined postoperative respiratory failure as requiring mechanical ventilation > 48 h or re-intubation following surgery in view of the majority of included patients undergoing off-pump CABG). Renal dysfunction was defined as serum creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl for more than 7 days or requiring dialysis. Stroke was defined as a new focal or global dysfunction of cerebral function lasting over 24 h. Gastro-intestinal complications included gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction and other serious gastrointestinal dysfunction. Incision infection meant the chest or leg wound infection requiring antibiotic therapy or operation. MSOF (a severe dysfunction of at least two organ systems lasting for more than 24 h, as stated by the Consensus Conference of the American College of Chest Physicians and the Society of Critical Care Medicine) was recorded. In addition, duration of mechanical ventilation and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay were also recorded.

Anesthetic and surgical considerations

Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane. Hypertension was treated by increasing the concentration of isoflurane or by the administration of nitroglycerin if increasing the depth of anesthesia was ineffective. Hypotension was corrected using volume replacement or phenylephrine, as clinically indicated. An additional dose of 5 mg of midazolam was provided during rewarming from CPB. Inotropic agents (dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min) were initiated for a cardiac indices (CI) <2.0 L/min/m 2 after separation from CPB. At sternal closure, an infusion of propofol was started (25-75 μg/kg/min), and the isoflurane was discontinued. Propofol sedation was continued in the ICU until weaning of ventilatory support was initiated.

All patients had coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with the use of CPB, which was conducted with a roller pump and a membrane oxygenator primed with a solution consisting of 1 L of Ringer’s lactate, 5000 IU of heparin, 750 mL of Pentaspan (DuPont Pharmaceuticals Co, Newark, DE), and 44 mEq of bicarbonate. During CPB, pump flow was set at 2.4 times the body surface area, and mean arterial pressure maintained between 50 and 60 mm Hg. The temperature was allowed to drift with active rewarming at the end of CPB. Cardioplegia solution (Plegisol, Hospira,Inc, Lake Forest, IL), which was used at the discretion of the cardiac surgeon, was free of glucose and consisted of high-dose (100 mEq/L) and low-dose (40 mEq/L) potassium. Cardioplegia was given in an anterograde fashion with blood in a ratio of 1:4. Blood cardioplegia was also administered with each successive distal vein graft anastomosis. The proximal vein graft anastomosis were performed after the distal ones under tangential aortic clamp. The left internal thoracic artery was used in all cases to bypass the LAD, while other coronary arteries received saphenous vein grafts. In patients with severe aortic disease where intermittent cross-clamping may be harmful, we used the MMPOC technique immediately after completion of the proximal anastomosis and weaning off CPB, in the MMPOC group we applied bulldog clamps to the grafts anatomized to the coronary arteries as in a similar manner and duration explained by Zhao et al before 2. Our MMPOC technique consisted of applying three 30-sec alternate episodes of occlusion with bulldog clamps and releasing of the bypassed grafts providing reperfusion. This method was applied immediately after CPB and in this way uncontrolled reperfusion was disallowed in the study group (Figure 1). This method was applied immediately after CPB and in this way uncontrolled reperfusion wasn’t permitted in the study group.

Discussion

Control of pain management in the postoperative care setting is of the greatest importance for patients who experienced CABG. Therefore, pharmacological and interventional approaches have been developed for postoperative analgesia. Currently, there is an increase in the mean age of the patients and the number of comorbidities in patients undergoing CABG. Overall, a method of postoperative analgesia that is cost-effective and comfortable for the patient with minimum complication rates and side effects which also shortens the duration of postoperative stay should be chosen. However, postoperative pain managing is often incomplete by the side effects of opioids; especially when used alone in large doses for an extended period, opioids can lead to acute tolerance and, more seriously, respiratory depression and hypotension. For these explanations, multimodal methods that add non-opioid agents to opioid-based regimens are promising. This study aimed to compare the effects of Ketorolac and Paracetamol on postoperative pain management. The main finding in the present study was that ketorolac more effective than Paracetamol to manage postoperative pain patients undergoing CABG surgery. Also, it can reduce postoperative additional analgesic requirements in comparison to Paracetamol with no additional adverse effects. This finding was similar to Amini S et al. study (20). Of course, their study was in congenital cardiac patients.

Postdischarge management after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in heart failure (HF)—The importance of adhering to guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), secondary prevention, and cardiac rehabilitation cannot be overemphasized, and close follow-up is recommended for titration of HF medications and assessment for additional interventions, including device implantation (eg, ICD/CRT) or advanced HF surgical therapies. A vulnerable period typically defined as 90 days postdischarge is associated with a several-fold increase in HF-associated rehospitalization and mortality; thus, post-CABG patients with HF should undergo close clinical monitoring and follow-up, and early (7-14 days) postdischarge follow-up to review volume status and titrate guideline-directed medications may be warranted and is associated with better short-term outcomes. Post hoc analyses reveal that the best long-term outcomes are achieved by patients who are maintained on optimal medical therapy.

robaxin® and robaxin®-750 are contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to methocarbamol or to any of the tablet components. Since methocarbamol may possess a general CNS depressant effect, patients receiving robaxin® or robaxin®-750 should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Safe use of robaxin® and robaxin®-750 has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, robaxin® and robaxin®-750 should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.

Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities. Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents. Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid using the Gitlow method. Safe use of robaxin® and robaxin®-750 has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol.

Therefore, robaxin® and robaxin®-750 should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Safety and effectiveness of robaxin® and robaxin®-750 in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established. Adverse reactions reported coincident with the administration of methocarbamol include: Body as a whole: Anaphylactic reaction, angioneurotic edema, fever, headache.

There were significant differences in SID over time (F(2,158) = 185.9, p < 0.001) as well as between groups (F(1,79) = 12.46, p < 0.001). Post-hoc analysis showed that mean SID differed significantly over all time points (Table 4). Over the course of surgery, both groups experienced a decrease in SID with on-pump patients experiencing a greater decrease than off-pump patients, resulting in a significant difference at the post-CABG measurement (mean difference = 4.0 mmol/L, 95% CI 2.8-5.3 mmol/L, p < 0.001). By the morning following surgery, the differences between on- and off-pump groups became non-significant and SID returned towards pre-operative values (Figure 3).

### Intra-operative and post-operative management of conduits for coronary artery bypass grafting: a clinical consensus statement of the European Society of Cardiology working group on cardiovascular surgery and the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery coronary task force [^58431e9b]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Current clinical practice is to continue antiplatelet therapy life-long after CABG, but evidence in support of a clinical benefit is limited. There is in fact little evidence to support a clinical benefit, as opposed to a graft patency benefit, from aspirin use after CABG. Most studies showed no effect on mortality, or even a trend to excess mortality,, but they were underpowered for small to moderate differences in clinical outcomes and, in particular, in mortality. However, a pooled analysis of 7 contemporary RCTs with systematic graft imaging (4413 patients, 13 163 grafts) showed that graft failure is strongly associated with adverse cardiac events (adjusted OR 3.98, 95% CI 3.54–4.47, P <.001) and mortality after CABG (adjusted OR 2.79, 95% CI 2.01–3.89, P <.001),indirectly supporting a potential clinical benefit of aspirin. On the other hand, 1 trial randomized 213 patients 1 year after CABG to continue aspirin 325 mg/day or switch to placebo for the following 2 years and found no difference in the rate of graft occlusion, MI, or death (although the trial was not formally powered and the described power limitations apply).

### Efficacy and safety of remifentanil in coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a randomized, double-blind dose comparison study [^431cbdc5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of remifentanil as part of a total intravenous anesthesia technique with low-dose propofol in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

Design

Multicenter, multinational, double-blind, randomized, dose comparison study.

Setting

Nine hospitals in 5 countries.

Participants

One hundred forty-one patients undergoing first-time elective CABG surgery.

Interventions

Patients were premedicated with a short-acting oral benzodiazepine up to 2 h before surgery and randomized to receive continuous infusions of remifentanil 1.0 microg/kg/min (n = 45), 1.5 microg/kg/min (n = 44), or 2.0 microg/kg/min (n = 43), in combination with propofol 3 mg/kg/h. Nine patients received remifentanil 1.0 microg/kg/min on an open-label basis. Three different induction sequences (IS) were used. In IS 1 (n = 31), induction was started with remifentanil infusion followed 5 minutes later by propofol 0.5 mg/kg bolus and infusion at 3 mg/kg/h. Further bolus doses of propofol (10 mg) were given if loss of consciousness (LOC) was not attained after 5 minutes; pancuronium, 0.04 to 0.1 mg/kg, was administered at LOC. In IS 2 (n = 68), a priming dose of pancuronium, 0.015 mg/kg, was administered just before starting remifentanil. In IS 3 (n = 42), bolus doses of propofol, 10 mg every 10 seconds, were given until LOC, followed by pancuronium, 0.04 to 0.1 mg/kg, and the remifentanil and propofol infusions were started.

Measurements and Main Results

There were no significant differences among the remifentanil dose groups with regard to the primary outcome measure, responses to sternotomy/sternal spread/maximal sternal spread. Responses to these stimuli were recorded in 11%, 11%, and 14% of patients in the remifentanil 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 microg/kg/min dose groups, respectively. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the responses to other surgical stimuli. There was a high incidence of muscle rigidity when remifentanil was used to induce anesthesia.

Conclusions

All 3 remifentanil dose regimens provided profound suppression of responses to surgical stimuli in the majority of patients. There was no apparent advantage in starting the remifentanil infusion rate above 1.0 microg/kg/min. Remifentanil is not suitable for use as a sole induction agent.

### Metoprolol and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: does intraoperative metoprolol attenuate acute β-adrenergic receptor desensitization during cardiac surgery? [^83ef1ce7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Cardiac surgery results in significant impairment of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) function and is a cause of depressed myocardial function after surgery. We previously demonstrated that acute administration of beta AR blocker during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in an animal model of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery attenuates beta AR desensitization, whereas chronic oral beta-blockade therapy in patients undergoing CABG surgery does not prevent it. Therefore we hypothesized that acute administration of metoprolol during CABG surgery would prevent acute myocardial beta AR desensitization. A placebo-controlled initial phase (n = 72) was performed whereby patients were randomized to either metoprolol 10 mg or placebo immediately before CPB. Then a second dose-finding study was performed where patients received 20 mg (n = 20) or 30 mg (n = 20) of metoprolol. Hemodynamic monitoring, atrial membrane adenylyl cyclase activity, atrial beta AR density, and postoperative outcomes were measured. All groups showed similar decreases in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (13%-24%). Cardiac output remained similar in all 4 groups throughout the intraoperative and postoperative period. In addition, patients receiving metoprolol 20 or 30 mg had less supraventricular arrhythmias 24 h postoperatively compared with patients receiving metoprolol 10 mg or placebo. Therefore, unlike our previous animal model of CABG surgery, metoprolol did not attenuate myocardial beta AR desensitization.

Implications

We investigated whether IV metoprolol given during cardiac surgery attenuates myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) desensitization. Although metoprolol did not reduce beta AR desensitization, the incidence of supraventricular arrhythmias was reduced by 75% in patients receiving 20 mg or 30 mg metoprolol.

### Use of antiplatelet drugs after cardiac operations [^3b869820]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, venous bypass grafts still have a prominent role in operative coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]). Venous grafts develop pathologically occlusive disease that limits the effectiveness of CABG, and antiplatelet drugs following operation may limit this problem. The types and indications of antiplatelet drugs following CABG generate some controversy in the recent literature. This review surveys relevant evidence about the use of antiplatelet drugs following CABG to identify the controversial issues, define appropriate questions, and attempt to provide evidence-based interventions that may be helpful in limiting graft occlusion after CABG. Evidence suggests that, in most CABG patients, dual antiplatelet drugs (aspirin and clopidogrel), given after operation, minimizes early (within 1 year) graft failure and improves intermediate-term outcomes, better than single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin alone. There are gaps in the knowledge base that supports this contention, and future clinical trials will likely augment or alter this recommendation.

### Sevoflurane — sevoflurane, — volatile for inhalation [^11419e3c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular Surgery

Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Sevoflurane was compared to isoflurane as an adjunct with opioids in a multicenter study of 273 patients undergoing CABG surgery. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam (0.1-0.3 mg/kg); vecuronium (0.1-0.2 mg/kg), and fentanyl (5 -15 mcg/kg). Both isoflurane and sevoflurane were administered at loss of consciousness in doses of 1.0 MAC and titrated until the beginning of cardiopulmonary bypass to a maximum of 2.0 MAC. The total dose of fentanyl did not exceed 25 mcg/kg. The average MAC dose was 0.49 for sevoflurane and 0.53 for isoflurane. There were no significant differences in hemodynamics, cardioactive drug use, or ischemia incidence between the two groups. Outcome was also equivalent. In this small multicenter study, sevoflurane appears to be as effective and as safe as isoflurane for supplementation of opioid anesthesia for coronary bypass grafting.

Non-Cardiac Surgery Patients at Risk for Myocardial Ischemia

Sevoflurane-N2O was compared to isoflurane-N2O for maintenance of anesthesia in a multicenter study in 214 patients, age 40-87 years who were at mild-to-moderate risk for myocardial ischemia and were undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery. Forty-six percent (46%) of the operations were cardiovascular, with the remainder evenly divided between gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal and small numbers of other surgical procedures. The average duration of surgery was less than 2 hours. Anesthesia induction usually was performed with thiopental (2-5 mg/kg) and fentanyl (1-5 mcg/kg).

Vecuronium (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) was also administered to facilitate intubation, muscle relaxation or immobility during surgery. The average MAC dose was 0.49 for both anesthetics. There was no significant difference between the anesthetic regimens for intraoperative hemodynamics, cardioactive drug use, or ischemic incidents, although only 83 patients in the sevoflurane group and 85 patients in the isoflurane group were successfully monitored for ischemia. The outcome was also equivalent in terms of adverse events, death, and postoperative myocardial infarction. Within the limits of this small multicenter study in patients at mild-to-moderate risk for myocardial ischemia, sevoflurane was a satisfactory equivalent to isoflurane in providing supplemental inhalation anesthesia to intravenous drugs.

European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Preserving the structural and functional integrity of the conduit during graft harvesting and storage, prevention and treatment of vasospasm, and attenuating atherogenesis are integral to graft patency and the clinical benefits of CABG. The best practice clinical consensus statements outlined in this document provide a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to the intra-operative and post-operative management of conduits for CABG surgery. These strategies can serve as a valuable resource for multidisciplinary heart teams, facilitating more informed and effective treatment planning tailored to individual patient needs and local practices.

### Factors influencing preoperative stress response in coronary artery bypass graft patients [^8a8deccf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This observational trial demonstrates that patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery have a great variation of norepinephrine levels when entering the operating theatre. We could identify oral clonidine premedication as the only predictor for increased humoral stress response. There was no strong evidence for a dose dependency, indicating that even small doses, like 75–150 μg attenuate the humoral stress response before coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Clonidine did not have a negative impact on hemodynamic parameters.

### Spasm in arterial grafts in coronary artery bypass grafting surgery [^5b825129]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Spasm of arterial grafts in coronary artery bypass grafting surgery is still a clinical problem, and refractory spasm can occasionally be lethal. Perioperative spasm in bypass grafts and coronary arteries has been reported in 0.43% of all coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, but this may be an underestimate. Spasm can develop not only in the internal mammary artery but more frequently in the right gastroepiploic and radial artery. The mechanism of spasm can involve many pathways, particularly those involving regulation of the intracellular calcium concentration. Endothelial dysfunction also plays a role in spasm. Depending on the clinical scenario, the possibility of spasm during and after coronary artery bypass grafting should be confirmed by angiography. If present, immediate intraluminal injection of vasodilators is often effective, although other procedures such as an intraaortic balloon pump or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may also become necessary to salvage the patient. Prevention of spasm involves many considerations, and the principles are discussed in this review article.

### A novel endothelial damage inhibitor for the treatment of vascular conduits in coronary artery bypass grafting: protocol and rationale for the European, multicentre, prospective, observational duraGraft registry [^989bc866]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical revascularisation represents the gold standard for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. However, besides the left internal mammary artery being the established graft for the left anterior descending (LAD) territory, the debate about conduit selection for the other coronary territories is ongoing. Especially for younger patients, multi- or even total arterial grafting strategies are recommended, and recent data indicate a significant long-term benefit when using multiple arterial grafts (ie, right internal mammary artery or radial artery). To increase the use of multiple arterial grafts, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons recently published the ‘First Clinical Practice Guidelines on Arterial Conduits. Despite the current effort on multiarterial grafting, the adoption rate of multiple arterial conduits in daily clinical practice is rather slow and is still below 10% due to the technical complexity added to the CABG procedure. Instead, saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) remain the most common conduits for coronary artery bypass grafting (CAGB) procedures. In most cases, SVG conduits are readily available and easy to harvest, which is particularly beneficial in urgent or emergency cases with ongoing ischaemia. Moreover, SVGs are considered to be more resistant to manipulation during harvest and anastomosis, and appear less susceptible to vasospasm. However, compared with arterial conduits, the long-term patency of SVGs due to vein graft disease (VGD) and consecutive failure remains a major issue, substantially impairing long-term clinical outcomes. One-year failure rates range from 15 to 29%, with at least one graft occluded graft at 12–18 months, and up to 40–50% of failed SVGs at 10 years post CABG [,–]. Besides general factors such as the overall progress of a patient’s coronary artery disease, the quality of the anastomosis and the target vessel, and postoperative preventive strategies, long-term patency strongly depends on the overall quality of the SVG conduit itself. Importantly, damage to the fragile SVG endothelium appears to be a key promotor for the development and progress of VGD, stenosis, and complete failure. Therefore, to best possibly protect the SVG endothelium, several intraoperative considerations are mandatory. These include state-of-the-art graft harvesting techniques to reduce traumatic injury (ie, no or less-touch techniques), avoidance of graft distension or over-pressurisation (ie, when assessing for potential leakages), and, importantly, effective intraoperative storage and preservation to reduce ischaemia reperfusion injury (IRI) of the graft endothelium between harvest and until completion of anastomosis.

### Expert position paper on the management of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^f7bf6acc]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-related bleeding complications and perioperative coronary events are strongly influenced by the management of antithrombotic therapy before and after CABG. Bleeding but also blood products transfusion increase the risk of death and compromise the long-term benefits of CABG.The use of new P2Y 12 inhibitors, increasing pre-CABG percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with drug eluting stents (DES) requiring specific antiplatelet regimens, and advances in surgical technique has prompted the ESC Working Group on Cardiovascular Surgery and the ESC Working Group on Thrombosis to review the evidence of peri-CABG recommendations on antithrombotic management. Due to the paucity of randomized trials, most of the evidence is still derived from observational studies and expert consensus, further reinforcing the importance of a multidisciplinary consultation for optimal decision making.

Regarding specific circumstances for perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, more specifically with respect to patients with pulmonary hypertension, ACC/ACS/AHA/ASNC/HRS/SCA/SCCT/SCMR/SVM 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering short-acting inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, such as nitric oxide or aerosolized prostacyclins, to reduce elevated RV afterload and prevent acute decompensated right HF in patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension undergoing elevated-risk NCS.

### The efficacies of modified mechanical post conditioning on myocardial protection for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting [^df5aeaf2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We suggest that these cardioprotective effects of MMPOC could have clinical implication in terms of clinical outcome (reduced postoperative length of stay) in CABG operations. Significantly shorter hospital stays will certainly result in lower total hospital costs and nosocomial infections. It can be an adjunct to the other regimes of cardioprotection. Furthermore, our study includes moderately high risk patients with impaired left ventricular ejection faction, medium EuroSCORE and high New York Heart Association (NYHA) status. We assume that improvement in clinical outcome after CABG for patients treated with MMPOC could be demonstrated in a larger study involving patents with worse left ventricular function.

Briefly, our MMPOC technique adjusted after CPB promotes early metabolic recovery of the heart during elective CABG and leads to better myocardial protection and functional recovery.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^11d0e2bd]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

What are the unmet medical needs of postoperative anaemia?

The concerns surrounding postoperative anaemia relate to its potential impact on recovery, rehabilitation, hospital re‐admission or re‐operation, and patient well‐being. Reducing allogeneic blood transfusion improves long‐term outcome and survival 27. However, restrictive transfusion protocols have led to patients being discharged with lower haemoglobin levels than before. With the current paucity of data, it remains unclear whether a lower discharge haemoglobin level may allow optimal functional recovery and quality of life 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. There has been limited research on the consequences of postoperative anaemia in the recovery phase from surgery, with only a small number of studies after cardiac and hip and knee surgery, which demonstrated the association between postoperative anaemia and adverse outcomes such as prolonged recovery, increased mortality and likelihood of re‐admission 31, 32, 33. Postoperative anaemia may also potentially be associated with early postoperative myocardial infarction 34. Correction of postoperative anaemia, as suggested in this consensus statement, is intended to prevent such side‐effects, but studies are urgently needed to prove this.

### Comparing the effects of ketorolac and paracetamol on postoperative pain relief after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A randomized clinical trial [^714b5541]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs block the synthesis of prostaglandins through the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2, thus lowering the production of acute inflammatory response mediators. By decreasing the inflammatory response to surgical trauma, NSAIDs reduce peripheral nociception. NSAIDs also appear to have a central analgesic mechanism, possibly through the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis within the spinal cord. In general, NSAIDs have a low side-effect profile when administered for the short-term purpose of perioperative analgesia after cardiac surgery.

Ketorolac is effective at reducing pain, and several studies have reported its safety and efficacy in the perioperative period. In many reports, the use of ketorolac as an adjuvant to a PCA opioid resulted in an opioid-sparing effect ranging from 16 to 33%. The hypothesis by which ketorolac exerts these possible beneficial effects is proposed to be related to its COX-1 selectivity and minimal inhibition of COX-2. As previously discussed, the boxed warning for NSAIDs arose from specific data for the COX-2 selective NSAID, celecoxib COX-2 inhibitors selectively reduce prostacyclin synthesis with no effect on thromboxane A2. Prostacyclin is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation; its selective blockade by COX-2 inhibitors may upset thrombosis homeostasis and cause adverse cardiovascular events. Ketorolac, on the other hand, potently blocks platelet aggregation through thromboxane A2 inhibition. This may be beneficial in patients with aspirin resistance to prevent CABG graft failure. The period of this antiplatelet effect can be last up to 24 h after a distinct dose. Additionally, the antiplatelet effects of ketorolac may offset the risk of hemorrhage in postoperative patients who may be hypercoagulable following exactly off-pump CABG surgery.

Eighty patients with written informed consent undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. Anesthesia was based on propofol and fentanyl combined with sevoflurane.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to 2 groups: acetaminophen, 1 g every sixth hour during the postoperative period, either as tablets or intravenously after extubation.

Measurements and Main Results

The amount of opioids administered during the study period was measured starting with acetaminophen administration during the stay in the ICU until 9 o'clock the following morning. Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was noted. Pain was evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 to 10. Three patients, 2 in the oral and 1 in the intravenous group, were excluded because of incomplete data. The intravenous group received less opioids than the orally treated group, 17.4 +/- 7.9 mg compared with 22.1 +/- 8.6 mg (p = 0.016). PONV incidence and VAS scores did not differ. During the first hours after extubation, 50 of 77 patients reported VAS scores >3 with no difference between groups.

Conclusions

Intravenous acetaminophen had a limited opioid-sparing effect when compared with oral administration after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The opioid-sparing effect was not accompanied by any reduction in the incidence of PONV. The clinical significance of the opioid-sparing effect could therefore be questioned.

Beta blockers and amiodarone in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)—guideline recommendations state that, in patients undergoing CABG who do not have a contraindication to beta blockers, the administration of beta blockers before surgery can be beneficial to reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (COR 2a, LOE B-R); in patients undergoing CABG, preoperative amiodarone is reasonable to reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (COR 2a, LOE B-R); in patients undergoing CABG who do not have a contraindication to beta blockers, preoperative use of beta blockers may be effective in reducing in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates (COR 2b, LOE B-NR); and in patients undergoing CABG, the role of preoperative beta blockers for the prevention of acute postoperative myocardial ischemia, stroke, AKI, or ventricular arrhythmia is uncertain (COR 2b, LOE B-NR).
