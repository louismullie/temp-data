## Question

Nursemaid elbow in 8 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage suspected nursemaid's elbow (radial head subluxation) in an 8-year-old child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and whether an 8-year-old fits the typical profile. Then, I should verify the classic history and physical findings and how they differ in older children. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis and when to image. After that, I should review reduction techniques and their evidence base. Finally, I need to plan follow-up, address recurrence, and outline special considerations in older children, including hypermobility and missed Monteggia patterns.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and typical age range. Nursemaid's elbow classically occurs in children 1 to 4 years, with a median around 2 years, so an 8-year-old is atypical and should raise my index of suspicion for alternative diagnoses or an underlying predisposition such as joint hypermobility, which has been documented in older children presenting with radial head subluxation [^112iofK3] [^115S6cA7].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism and clinical phenotype. The classic history is sudden longitudinal traction on an extended, pronated forearm, often "lifting by the hands", swinging, or the child pulling away. The child holds the arm limp, slightly flexed at the elbow, and pronated, refusing to use it, with no obvious swelling or deformity, and tenderness is often diffuse rather than focal, which helps distinguish it from a fracture in many cases [^112ZJvJY] [^116QgmXb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions in an older child. I need to check for red flags that would push me to obtain imaging before attempting reduction: focal bony tenderness, swelling, deformity, ecchymosis, or an atypical mechanism such as a direct blow or fall on an outstretched hand, because these features increase the likelihood of fracture or Monteggia-equivalent lesions in children older than 6 years [^116QgmXb] [^111P3ZvV].

> I should confirm the imaging threshold. In typical toddlers with a classic history and exam, no radiographs are needed; however, in older children or when the story is atypical, obtaining AP and lateral elbow radiographs is prudent to exclude occult fractures, radial neck injury, or Monteggia variants, as missed fractures are more likely in children older than 6 years and radiography is commonly performed in this group [^111P3ZvV] [^112iofK3]. But wait, what if I need a dynamic bedside adjunct? Point-of-care ultrasound can help differentiate subluxation from fracture when the diagnosis is uncertain or when reduction fails, with reports of "hook" or "partial eclipse" signs supporting the diagnosis and guiding management, though evidence quality varies and this remains adjunctive rather than mandatory [^111tUqwB] [^115boHwX] [^113TrVCY].

> Next, I should review reduction techniques and their comparative effectiveness. Let me consider the two main maneuvers: supination-flexion and hyperpronation. Historically, supination with extension or flexion has been widely taught, but randomized trials and Cochrane reviews suggest hyperpronation has a lower first-attempt failure rate, with a number needed to treat around 6 to prevent one additional failure compared with supination-flexion; a recent RCT in children ≤ 6 years also favored hyperpronation for first-attempt success, and although our patient is 8, the biomechanics are similar and hyperpronation remains reasonable [^115j2Gmg] [^116QuqUW] [^117FhwGt].

> I will now examine the practical steps for reduction. Hyperpronation is performed by stabilizing the elbow, applying gentle longitudinal traction, and then smoothly hyperpronating the forearm until a palpable or audible click is appreciated, after which the child typically resumes normal use of the arm within minutes. If hyperpronation fails, supination-flexion can be attempted as an alternative, and if both fail, I should double-check for an alternative diagnosis or proceed to imaging before repeated attempts [^116QgmXb] [^115j2Gmg].

> Let me think about post-reduction assessment and counseling. Immediate restoration of full, pain-free range of motion — especially supination and pronation — is highly supportive of successful reduction; if the child remains guarded or refuses to use the arm, I should reconsider the diagnosis or obtain radiographs to exclude a missed fracture or persistent subluxation, and I should advise caregivers to avoid traction-type activities for several weeks to reduce recurrence risk [^116QgmXb].

> I should confirm follow-up needs. Routine follow-up is not mandatory after a successful reduction with immediate return to function, but I need to ensure return precautions and advise that recurrence can occur, particularly in children with joint hypermobility. If symptoms persist beyond 24 to 48 hours or recur frequently, I should reassess for underlying ligamentous laxity or consider imaging to exclude subtle fractures or chronic instability patterns [^115S6cA7] [^116QgmXb].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the reduction repeatedly fails? In older children, I need to keep a high index of suspicion for radial neck fractures, Monteggia-equivalent injuries with plastic deformation of the ulna, or chronic radiocapitellar instability; careful radiographic evaluation of the radiocapitellar line, ulnar bow, and radial head position is essential, and if instability persists, orthopedic referral for possible ulnar osteotomy or ligamentous reconstruction may be indicated [^114ZT5mc] [^113xmapp] [^112NFDT8].

> Let me reconsider the overall approach for this 8-year-old. Given the atypical age, I should obtain AP and lateral elbow radiographs before attempting reduction unless the history and exam are absolutely classic and the child demonstrates immediate, full, pain-free motion after a cautious trial maneuver. If I proceed to reduction, I will favor hyperpronation given its superior first-attempt success, and if the arm is not fully functional within minutes, I will escalate to imaging and orthopedic consultation to avoid missing a fracture or a Monteggia-equivalent lesion [^112iofK3] [^115j2Gmg] [^116QgmXb].

Nursemaid's elbow is rare in 8-year-olds but can occur, especially with **hypermobility** or repetitive traction [^115S6cA7]. Diagnosis is clinical: refusal to use the arm, slight flexion/pronation, and no deformity [^116vVXx7]. Radiographs are not routine but should be obtained if the history is atypical, the child is older, or reduction fails [^111P3ZvV] [^112iofK3]. Hyperpronation is the **preferred reduction method** and is highly effective [^115j2Gmg]; recurrence is uncommon after age 5 but can occur with hypermobility or repeated traction [^116QgmXb]. After successful reduction, immediate full function returns and **no immobilization is needed**; counsel to avoid pulling the arm and seek care if symptoms recur [^notfound].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

- **Age distribution**: Most common in children 1–4 years; rare after 5–6 years due to maturation of the annular ligament [^111r2nUj].
- **Incidence at 8 years**: Uncommon but reported, often with hypermobility or repetitive traction [^115S6cA7].
- **Risk factors**: Joint hypermobility, connective tissue disorders, and activities with repetitive traction (e.g. gymnastics, playground play) [^115S6cA7].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical presentation includes the following:

| **Clinical feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Arm position | Slightly flexed elbow, pronated forearm, hand held at waist level [^116vVXx7] |
| Pain | Mild to moderate, localized to lateral elbow |
| Function | Refusal to use the arm, inability to supinate [^116vVXx7] |
| Swelling/deformity | Absent or minimal [^1165pEqb] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Based on history and exam; classic features suffice in typical cases [^111tUqwB].
- **Imaging**: Not routine; obtain radiographs if history is atypical, the child is older, or reduction fails [^111r2nUj] [^112iofK3].
- **Ultrasound**: Optional adjunct when diagnosis is uncertain or to confirm reduction [^111tUqwB] [^113TrVCY].

---

## Reduction techniques

Hyperpronation is the **preferred method** [^117FhwGt] with higher first-attempt success and less pain than supination-flexion [^117FhwGt]. Supination-flexion is an **alternative** when hyperpronation fails or is not tolerated [^notfound].

---

## Post-reduction care and recurrence

Post-reduction care is **minimal** — no immobilization is needed, and immediate return to normal activity is expected. Recurrence is **uncommon after age 5** but may occur with hypermobility or repeated traction; counsel caregivers accordingly [^112iofK3].

---

## Potential complications

Complications are **rare**; chronic instability is unusual but may occur with repeated subluxation or underlying ligamentous laxity. Missed fractures can occur if a fracture is mistaken for nursemaid's elbow, underscoring the need for appropriate imaging when indicated [^111P3ZvV].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **education** to teach caregivers to avoid pulling or lifting by the hands or forearms and on **activity modification** to limit repetitive traction activities in children with hypermobility.

---

Nursemaid's elbow is uncommon in 8-year-olds but can occur, especially with **hypermobility** or repetitive traction. Diagnosis is clinical; use **imaging selectively**. Hyperpronation is the **preferred reduction**, with excellent outcomes and low recurrence after age 5.

### Radial head incarceration after closed reduction of a pediatric elbow dislocation with a radial neck fracture: a case report [^111sgPu5]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Case

A 10-year-old girl sustained a radial neck fracture with a posterior elbow dislocation. She was treated with closed reduction of the elbow with subsequent intra-articular displacement of the radial head, which necessitated open reduction and pinning of the radial neck fracture.

Conclusion

Displacement of the radial neck fracture from impingement of the capitellum on the anterior radial head during closed reduction of the elbow dislocation is a rare injury pattern. It is important to examine the radial neck in high-energy posterior elbow dislocations before attempted reduction. We present a case with imaging depicting the injury mechanism and successful management with subsequent open reduction and fixation of the radial neck fracture.

### Grisel's syndrome: a case report on this rare pediatric disease and its anesthetic challenges [^112AhAjX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Grisel's syndrome is a non-traumatic atlantoaxial subluxation associated with inflammatory conditions of the head and neck, which occurs primarily in children. Increased flexibility of the ligaments during inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of the subluxation between the axis and atlas. The potential sequelae may be severe, and early diagnosis and treatment of Grisel's syndrome can prevent tragic outcomes.

Case presentation

We present a case of torticollis in an 8-year-old child. She had a two-week history of a streptococcal throat infection. The patient was treated with several different methods of conservative care, including muscle relaxation, cervical halter traction, and Halo application. However, the torticollis persisted. The patient then required surgical correction involving cervical spine fusion. She had no complications and experienced no reoccurrence of the torticollis to date.

Conclusion

Grisel's syndrome is a pathology for which conservative management is successful in most cases. Cases requiring surgical intervention are rarely documented in the literature. Our case is significant, as in spite of aggressive conservative management, the patient required surgical correction. Patients requiring surgical management of Grisel's syndrome may require additional anesthetic exposure for diagnostic interventions like magnetic resonance imaging or neck manipulations for closed reduction. We discuss the features of Grisel's syndrome and specific anesthetic management considerations for procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging, application of cervical traction, and surgical correction of torticollis.

Paired t Test Between Normal and Fractured Side in Radial Head Diameter at Follow-up Antero-posterior Radiograms; Valgus Angle, Flexion-extension, Pronation-supination at Clinical Follow-up

TABLE 4
Clinical and Radiologic Data at Follow-up

Pain was considered intermittent and slight by 3 patients who practiced intensive sports, which involved use of the injured extremity. Four patients experienced pain and mild loss of strength (loss of strength is defined by the patient self-sensing reduction of strength or by the examiner during manual muscle testing involving tightening the examiner's fingers) and 4 experienced pain and moderate loss of strength.

On radiographic examination there was radial head enlargement of 2 to 5 mm in 90% of patients. Loss of motion was not associated with this morphologic change (P = 0.08); poor outcomes were seen in 3 cases with avascular necrosis and in 7 cases with premature closure of the growth plate and residual neck deformity (Fig. 3). The main functional losses were pronation and supination and elbow flexion (Table 1; cases 1, 4, 5, 11, 17, 18).

### Predicting radial head instability in multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE): a multicenter analysis of risk factors [^117Hr55v]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Forearm deformity occurs in one third of patients with multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE). Conservative and surgical treatment are aimed at preventing radial head subluxation and/or dislocation. Dislocation has been associated with isolated distal ulnar lesions, radial bowing, and ulnar shortening. Risk factors for radial head subluxation have not been clearly elucidated. This study aimed to identify risk factors for all radial head instability in MHE, to optimize early detection and prevent frank dislocation.

Methods

This multicenter retrospective case-control investigation included MHE patients with forearm lesions seen between 2000 and 2017 at 2 tertiary care children's hospitals. Demographic, clinical factors, radiographic measures, and surgical history were quantified. Comparisons were made between forearms that developed radial head instability versus those that remained stable and between those that progressed to radial head subluxation versus those that progressed to dislocation.

Results

This study included 171 forearms in 113 patients with MHE, who presented at a mean age of 8.0 years with a median follow-up time of 6.0 years. Nine forearms progressed to radial head subluxation (mean age: 10.2y), and 24 forearms had radial head dislocation (mean age: 9.9y). Five subluxations and 3 dislocations occurred despite preventative surgery. Initial radial bowing (7.2% vs. 8.5%, P = 0.04), ulnar variance (-5.8% vs. 11.0%, P < 0.001), and ulnar shortening (-2.5 vs. 9.1mm, P = 0.04) were predictive of radial head instability. Distal ulnar lesions and more severe ulnar variance (-5.8 vs. -10.6, P < 0.001) and shortening (-2.5 vs. 13.2mm, P = 0.02) were associated with an increased risk of radial head subluxation. No significant differences were identified between forearms that progressed to subluxation versus those that progressed to dislocation.

Conclusions

Distal ulnar lesions and radiographic measures can be used to determine the risk of radial head instability in MHE. Ulnar variance and shortening are early identifiable risk factors for radial head subluxation that can help guide monitoring and treatment. Radial bowing may be a late predictor of instability.

### Radial head subluxation: factors associated with its recurrence and radiographic evaluation in a tertiary pediatric emergency department [^112iofK3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Radial head subluxation (RHS) is a common complaint seen in the pediatric emergency department in children ages 6 months to 4 years. Classically, injury occurs due to axial traction on the arm, but this mechanism is not universal. Some patients will have recurrent RHS; some may undergo x-ray (XR) evaluation for alternative diagnosis.

Objectives

To determine factors associated with recurrences and radiographic evaluations in RHS.

Methods

A retrospective study with inclusion criteria: under 10 years of age with discharge diagnosis "nursemaid", "radial head", or "subluxation". We examined factors associated with RHS recurrences, circumstances when radiographic evaluations performed, physician's training background (pediatric vs. general emergency medicine), mechanisms of injury, and demographic factors including age, gender, and arm involved.

Results

In 246 visits, median age was 27 months (interquartile range 16.1), with females comprising 55.7% (n = 137), and left-sided predominance (52%, n = 130). Mechanisms of injury were classified as "pull" (65.9%, n = 162), "non-pull" (15.9%, n = 39), and "unknown" (18.3%, n = 45). Eighteen patients with recurring RHS were more likely to be male (p = 0.008). In 61 visits where radiography was performed, patients were older (p = 0.03), with a higher frequency seen in non-pull and unknown mechanism (p = 0.0001). No significant difference was found in frequency of radiographs obtained in regard to physician training (p = 0.4660).

Conclusion

RHS can result from a myriad of mechanisms. We found that recurrence was more likely in male patients. Factors associated with radiographic evaluation included atypical mechanism, older age, and unclear history, regardless of physician training background.

### Monteggia equivalent lesion in children: a narrative review [^114ZT5mc]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis for PMELs has always been tricky for the highly heterogeneous presentation, obscure mechanism, and difficulty of discerning the immature radiocapitellar joint and the occult ulnar fracture patterns. Yet, regarding the high risk of misdiagnosis for PMELs and atrocious prognosis for shortened ulna and deformed forearm, and chronically degenerated radiocapitellar joint when subluxation or dislocation of it is unrecognized and untreated, the orthopedists are urgently recommended to acquire proper diagnosis tips.

Physical examinations may reveal non-specific swelling and tenderness of the forearm and elbow, inability to rotate the forearm, flex, and extend the elbow. Considering children's nature, orthopedists will currently have to rely heavily on imaging measures, traditionally the anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs, to diagnose the PMELs. As the tabled case series shows, the AP and lateral X-rays might not always be accountable initially in discovering a radial neck or head fracture, for the vagary induced by unossified physisor the shading from adjacent bony structure. Yet, it is still an effective first-line approach to discern most of the group III cases. For group I and II cases, where the radiocapitellar joint matters, the classical principle of the radiocapitellar line, named by Storen, intersects the capitellum in all views could help. However, a recent study has found approximately 16% of the normal elbow does not fit that law, especially in AP view of children under 5 years old. Thus, the lateral humeral line was introduced by Souder et al to complement evaluating radiocapitellar dislocation or incongruity. For all of the PMEL cases, the plastic deformity or gradual malunion of the ulna was an easily neglected condition, which could be responsible for delayed dislocation of the radiocapitellar joint. The line drawn tangential to the posterior border of the ulnar diaphysis has been introduced by Lincoln and Mubarakto determine the 'ulnar bow sign', and the maximum perpendicular distance of more than 3 mm of this line from the ulnar shaft would be deemed as a possible Monteggia equivalent.

### Pediatric elbow fractures: a new angle on an old topic [^1131F5bS]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The three most common elbow fractures classically reported in pediatric orthopedic literature are supracondylar (50–70%), lateral condylar (17–34%), and medial epicondylar fractures (10%), with fractures of the proximal radius (including but not limited to fractures of the radial neck) being relatively uncommon (5–10%). Our experience at a large children's hospital suggests a different distribution.

Objective

Our goals were (1) to ascertain the frequency of different elbow fracture types in a large pediatric population, and (2) to determine which fracture types were occult on initial radiographs but detected on follow-up.

Materials and Methods

Review of medical records identified 462 children, median age 6 years and interquartile range for age of 4–8 years (range 0.8–18 years), who were diagnosed with elbow fractures at our institution over a 10-month period. Initial and follow-up radiographs were reviewed in blinded fashion independently by two experienced pediatric musculoskeletal radiologists to identify fracture types on initial and follow-up radiographs.

Results

The most common fractures included supracondylar (n = 258, 56%), radial neck (n = 80, 17%), and lateral condylar (n = 69, 15%). Additional fractures were seen on follow-up exams in 32 children. Of these, 25 had a different fracture type than was identified on initial radiographs. The most common follow-up fractures were olecranon (n = 23, 72%), coronoid process (n = 4, 13%) and supracondylar (n = 3, 9%). Olecranon fractures were significantly more common on follow-up radiographs than they were on initial radiographs (n = 33, 7%; P < .0001). Twenty-six children had more than one fracture type on the initial radiograph. The most common fracture combinations were radial neck with olecranon (n = 9) and supracondylar with lateral condylar (n = 9).

Conclusion

Supracondylar fractures are the most frequent elbow fracture seen initially, followed by radial neck, lateral condylar, and olecranon fractures in a distribution different from what has been historically described. The relatively high frequency of olecranon fractures detected on follow-up speaks to their potentially occult nature. Careful attention to these areas is warranted in children with initially normal radiographs.

### No longer a "nursemaid' s" elbow: mechanisms, caregivers, and prevention [^112ZJvJY]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to identify specific mechanisms leading to radial head subluxation, as well as correlation with different caregivers, as a potential platform for education and injury prevention.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to an urban pediatric tertiary care emergency department with radial head subluxation from 1995 to 2009 was performed. Cases were identified using a text-search module followed by a manual chart review. We excluded patients with fractures, osteopenia, and neuromuscular conditions. Data collected included age, gender, arm involved, position of the arm at presentation, mechanism of injury, caregivers involved, imaging, and type of reduction. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors for different mechanisms.

Results

There were 3170 cases of radial head subluxation identified. The median age was 2.1 years (interquartile range, 1.5–2.8 years), and 59% were female (95% confidence interval [CI] 57%-60%). There were 2011 patients (63%) presenting with a traction mechanism, 547 (17%) with a nontraction traumatic mechanism, and 612 (19%) with an unknown or undocumented mechanism. Within the traction group, we identified several potentially preventable mechanisms including lifting the child by the arms (28.3%), "wrestling" (12.3%), swinging child by the arms (9.2%), and placing the child into and out of a seat (4.3%). Male caregivers were more likely to be involved when a child is swung by the arms (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6–6.2), lifted (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.7), or "wrestled" with (OR, 6.4; 95% CI, 3.3–12.0). Mechanisms common for female caregivers included the child pulling away from parent (OR, 2.3; CI, 1.54 3.4), tripping (2.0; CI, 1.3–3.0), and getting dressed (OR, 2.1; CI, 1.1–4.4).

Conclusions

Radial head subluxation mechanisms can be classified into subcategories, which may be caregiver and even patient gender specific. Provider awareness regarding these mechanisms may help target education and prevention.

### The usefulness of dynamic ultrasonography in nursemaid's elbow: a prospective case series of 13 patients reconsideration of the pathophysiology of nursemaid's elbow [^113TrVCY]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Nursemaid's elbow is a common musculoskeletal disorder among children under 5 years of age. However, diagnostic imaging to confirm a nursemaid's elbow diagnosis is still unavailable. Through the use of a high-frequency ultrasound probe, we determined the etiology and possible pathophysiology of nursemaid's elbow.

Methods:

Thirteen consecutive patients with the clinical suspicion of nursemaid's elbows were examined. A high-frequency linear array 6 to 24 MHz hockey stick transducer was used to detect small changes (partial eclipse signs) of the radial head in the axial view before and after manipulation.

Results:

All patients in this study had a successful reduction. A partial eclipse sign was found in all patients before reduction and disappeared after successful reduction.

Conclusion:

These pathologic features detected through high-frequency ultrasonography suggest the role of the escaped posterior synovial fringe in the pathogenesis of the nursemaid's elbow. The specific finding of a "partial eclipse sign" could be a useful additional clue leading to the correct diagnosis of the nursemaid's elbow and may help avoid the unnecessary reduction in patients who do not have a "partial eclipse sign".

Level of Evidence:

Level II, diagnostic studies.

### Radial neck fractures in children: results when open reduction is indicated [^116oXK9D]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2014). Low credibility.

TABLE 2
Correlation Between Steinberg and Rodriguez-Merchan Classification of the Results (1 Good, 2 Fair, 3 Poor) and Clinical and Radiologic Results

FIGURE 1
A and B, Radial neck fracture of the right elbow in a 6–year-old and 3-month-old girl. C and D, Postoperative radiographs after open reduction of the fracture. Radiographic result 9.1 years after treatment: E and F, Contralateral normal elbow; G and H, Operated elbow (case 13, good result).

FIGURE 2
A and B, Radial neck fracture of the left elbow in a 9-year-old and 2-month-old boy. C and D, Postoperative radiographs after open reduction of the fracture. Radiographic result 3.2 years after treatment: E and F, Operated elbow: physeal premature closure of the proximal radius; G and H, contralateral normal elbow (case 4, fair result).

FIGURE 3
A and B, Radial neck fracture of the left elbow associated with olecranon fracture in an 8-year-old and 3-month-old boy. C and D, Radiographs after 1 year showing head necrosis, premature closure of the physis. E and F, Radiographic result after 4.1 years: severe deformity of the radial head and subluxation (case 5, poor result).

Significant statistical differences were seen between the injured and normal elbow with radial head diameter (P < 0.0001), valgus angle of the elbow (P < 0.0001), elbow flexion-extension ROM (P < 0.01) [due to the reduction of flexion which is correlated with poor results (P < 0.003)], and with loss of pronation-supination ROM (P < 0.0003) [the reduction of pronation and supination were both correlated with poor results (P < 0.01)] (Table 3). The main cause of unsatisfactory results was a limitation in pronation-supination: 6 cases had about 20 degrees less than normal pronation-supination (Table 4; cases 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 17) and another 5 cases had about 40 degrees less supination than normal pronation-supination (Table 4; cases 1, 5, 8, 9, 10) compared with the noninjured contralateral elbow.

### Radial head subluxation in an 8-year-old girl with joint hypermobility [^115S6cA7]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

An 8-year-old girl attended the children's emergency department after having been play-fighting with her younger brother. Her arm had been pushed away by her father during the fight. The girl immediately complained of pain in her arm and refused to move it. Following analgesia and investigation with a plain radiograph of the elbow it was decided to attempt a manipulation procedure with the possibility that this could represent a 'pulled elbow' in an unusual age group. Soon after the manipulation the child was completely pain-free and moving her arm fully at the elbow, suggesting a diagnosis of radial head subluxation. The patient demonstrated hypermobility of several joints and she was able to hyperextend her unaffected elbow by > 10°. This case highlights the association between radial head subluxation and joint hypermobility.

### Chronic radial head dislocation in children, part 2: results of open treatment and factors affecting final outcome [^113Nm2gg]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2002). Low credibility.

Fifteen elbows (3 congenital, 12 traumatic) in 14 children (mean age 9.5 years) with chronic radial head dislocation for at least 3 months (range 3–180 months) underwent radial head-sparing reconstructive surgery and were followed up at an average of 43.5 months postoperatively (range 12–105 months). At follow-up, the patients were evaluated radiographically and clinically using range-of-motion measurements and an elbow performance score based on four parameters (deformity, pain, motion, function). Ten cases had excellent results, two had good results, two had fair results, and one case had poor results. Scores at follow-up were evaluated with seven preoperative factors. Among those, the degree of preoperative carrying angle asymmetry associated with flexion contracture correlated significantly with the elbow scores. The most common complication was loss of pronation. The authors advocate radial head reduction and reconstruction in chronic radial head dislocations in children after obtaining informed consent from patient and parents.

### Radial neck fractures in children: results when open reduction is indicated [^112M98rs]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2014). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Twenty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria except for the final follow-up, which 4 patients refused to take part in. Twenty-four cases satisfied all the inclusion criteria and were evaluated clinically and radiologically at a mean follow-up of 7 years and 1 month (range, 3.2 to 12.1 y). There were 11 boys and 13 girls with a median age of 7 years and 1 month (range, 4.3 to 10.2 y), the right arm was involved in 16 patients and the left in 8. (In all the 16 patients the right arm was dominant and in 4 of the 8 the left was dominant and it did not play a role in the outcome).

All fractures were completely displaced without contact between the head and the radial metaphysis and had an angulation of > 60 degrees (O'Brien type 3). In 4 cases, there were olecranon fractures, 2 with an associated elbow dislocation (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Clinical and Radiologic Data

Results were graded as good, (Fig. 1) fair, (Fig. 2) or poor (Fig. 3) as shown in Table 1. Fair (25%) and poor (20%) results were directly correlated with reduction of pronation-supination ROM (P = 0.001), reduction of flexion-extension ROM (P = 0.001), increase of elbow valgus angle (P = 0.002), presence of necrosis of the radial head (P = 0.001), premature physeal closure (Fig. 2 F) (P = 0.01), and an associated lesion, for example, olecranon fracture associated with or without elbow dislocation (P = 0.002) (Table 2).

### Arthroscopic reduction and percutaneous fixation of a radial neck fracture in a child [^1179Gjsv]. Arthroscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Radial neck fractures are frequent lesions in the developing elbow. For important angular displacement higher than 60 degrees, there are several alternative treatments. We present an unpublished technique of reduction with arthroscopic assistance and percutaneous stabilization that allows one to perform direct pressure to the radial head, better intra-articular evaluation, reduction control, with minimal soft tissue lesion, and reduce the need for intraoperative fluoroscopy.

### Inadvertent radial head inversion during closed reduction of a pediatric radial neck fracture [^117Ci1fQ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Management of displaced pediatric radial neck fractures can be fraught with challenges. This unique case presents an 11-year-old female with a Salter-Harris type II radial neck fracture and how her radial head overturned 180° with the articular surface facing the radial shaft rather than the capitellum during closed manipulation under anesthesia. The malreduction subsequently required open reduction and highlights the importance of a careful stepwise approach to managing markedly displaced radial neck fractures. After closed reduction, meticulous assessment of intraoperative imaging when determining proper alignment is of the utmost importance as a result of the transverse nature of Salter-Harris type I and II fractures.

Figure 7
Radiographs (case 15) showing example of redislocation or pseudoreduction. A, The radial head is anteriorly subluxated in a pronation position. B, The radial head is nearly reduced in a supination position. If one examines it more precisely, however, a radiocapitellar line is seen not crossing the center of the capitellum. C, At 4 weeks after cast immobilization in the supination position, this lateral radiograph shows redislocation of the radial head. D, At 6 months after open reduction, the radial head is in the anatomic position.

Other causes of hindered reduction, such as PIN and biceps tendon interference, seemed to be rare. Usually, recovery from associated PINP occurs spontaneously if there is early reduction of the dislocated radial head. If the PIN is entrapped in the radiocapitellar joint, preventing reduction of the radial head, spontaneous recovery cannot be expected. Thus, the PIN must be removed from the radiocapitellar joint and the radial head reduced. In case 3 of our series, we attempted closed reduction, causing the PIN to become interposed between the capitellum and the radial head. When we explored the radiocapitellar joint 5 months later, we found that the nerve was severely damaged. We had to reconstruct finger extension by tendon transfer because the nerve did not recover. Morris, Spur, and Li et alreported similar experiences and emphasized that the PIN may become wrapped around the anterolaterally dislocated radial head during attempted closed reduction. Hence, exploration of the radiocapitellar joint is necessary in cases of associated PINP with irreducible radial head dislocation.

### The usefulness of MRI in atypical pulled / nursemaid's elbow: a case report [^116rNzrc]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A nursemaid's elbow most frequently occurs with transient longitudinal traction of the pronated forearm and extended elbow, which can be reduced by manipulation without sedation. There are circumstances in which the history is atypical and reduction of the elbow is unsuccessful. Imaging may be helpful in these cases.

Methods

A 33-month-old child was injured in a fall from a tire swing and sustained what was thought to be a nursemaid's elbow. Typical reduction maneuvers were unsuccessful. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with conscious sedation, which demonstrated the entrapment of the annular ligament in the radicapitellar joint. A presumed successful reduction was performed with confirmed reduction of the annular ligament by immediate MRI.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first case report on MRI being used to diagnose and confirm treatment of an atypical nursemaid's elbow.

### Indirect reduction of the radial head in children with chronic monteggia lesions [^116z1tPu]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to report the long-term follow-up results of chronic Monteggia fractures treated with angulation-translation osteotomy of ulna and closed reduction of the radial head.

Design

Retrospective.

Setting

Level 1 trauma center.

Patients

We retrospectively reviewed 10 missed Monteggia fractures in children. The mean age of the patients was 7.5 years (range, 6–10 years), and there were 2 girls and 8 boys. The mean duration of time between initial injury and initial presentation was 1.7 years (range, 6 weeks to 5 years).

Intervention

Closed reduction with ulna osteotomy or lengthening was performed in all 10 cases. Annular ligament reconstruction (ALR) was done in 2 cases. Final follow-up ranged from 3 to 20 years (mean 10 years).

Main Outcome Measurement

We assessed preoperative and postoperative radiographs to evaluate the quality of the radial head reduction. Clinical results were assessed according to the functional elbow score devised by Kim et al.

Results

Radial head reduction was achieved and maintained in 8 of 10 cases after primary or secondary surgery. The radial head was mildly subluxated in one case and dislocated in another case at final follow-up. ALR was performed in only 2 cases. Open reduction and ALR is not required in every case, and its need should depend on intraoperative stability of radial head.

### The usefulness of dynamic ultrasonography in nursemaid's elbow: a prospective case series of 13 patients reconsideration of the pathophysiology of nursemaid's elbow [^111Syn1z]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Early ultrasonographic studies of the nursemaid's elbow almost all focused on the anterior joint with a long-axis view to assess the morphology of the annular ligament and supinator muscle.–The J -sign, a change in the shape of the supinator muscle and annular ligament, and enlargement of the anterior synovial fringe were found.

However, these findings may be based on detecting secondary changes in the joint.

In our hypothesis, when a nursemaid's elbow occurs, the posterior synovial fringe escapes from the radiocapitellar joint space and is entrapped between the annular ligament and the posterior lateral side's radial head. This can push the subluxed radial head in a more anterior and medial direction. As the posterior fringe escapes from the joint space, it also causes the rotation axis of the radial bone to change. The joint line of the radial head tilts changes as well. All these changes can cause morphologic changes in the supinator muscle and anterior joint capsule. This may be the reason for the J -sign in the axial view of the anterior joint. Therefore, we believe that all the ultrasonography findings in the anterior joint in the long-axis view could be a second sign of the nursemaid's elbow.

There were some limitations in this study. First, the small case number in this study may be insufficient to broadly generalize the results on current information. Accumulating data from more patients is mandatory to establish solid conclusions in future studies. However, to minimize possible bias, we conducted this study through the longitudinal collection of data in a consecutive case series. Second, another possible bias may occur due to data interpretation by only 1 examiner/physician throughout the study. However, the bias may also be reduced because all examinations were performed by a single experienced pediatric orthopaedic specialist; thus variations could be minimized.

### Surgical treatment for chronic radial head dislocation [^112NFDT8]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of chronic radial head dislocation remains controversial. High rates of redislocation and complications have been reported after surgery. In our view, correction of malalignment with ulnar osteotomy is the key to a good surgical result.

Methods

Since 1975, twenty-two patients were treated surgically for chronic radial head dislocation at our hospital. The procedure consisted of open reduction of a dislocated radial head followed by radial and/or ulnar osteotomy, with or without reconstruction of the annular ligament or by reconstruction of the annular ligament alone. The ages of the patients ranged from four to twenty years. In 1991, we modified the surgical technique by performing an oblique ulnar osteotomy with angulation and elongation and rigid plate fixation. Bone-grafting at the osteotomy site was also performed if necessary. A cast was applied with the forearm in neutral rotation and was worn for two to four weeks. Nine patients were treated with this modified technique.

Results

The mean interval between the initial injury and the reconstructive surgery was ten months. There were no serious surgical complications. Of the thirteen patients treated before 1991, four had a good reduction and seven had redislocation. Seven patients had restricted forearm rotation postoperatively. Of the nine patients treated with the modified osteotomy since 1991, seven had a good reduction. Two patients, who had had slight radial head deformity preoperatively, had subluxation postoperatively. Two patients had restricted forearm rotation.

Conclusions

Since we modified our technique for ulnar osteotomy, good reduction of the radial head has been achieved without causing serious contracture. Both angulation and elongation of the ulna are required to allow the radial head to reduce.

### Absence of radiographic abnormalities in nursemaid's elbows [^117BEa2q]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Disagreement exists between physicians on the usefulness of a prereduction radiograph for diagnosis and treatment of nursemaid's elbows in children. Some evidence suggests that nursemaid's elbows have identifying features on radiographs. This study compares the radiographs of nursemaid's elbows to normal, control elbows in children and hypothesizes that differentiating features do not exist on radiograph.

Methods

For this retrospective case-control study, hospital billing records were searched to identify all patients under age 6 treated with closed reduction for a nursemaid's elbow between November 2005 and October 2009. Twenty-seven nursemaid's elbows were age-matched and sex-matched to 27 normal "comparison view", control elbows. Radiocapitellar line offset, proximal radial length, anterior fat pad angle, and visibility of the posterior fat pad were measured on the radiographs by 2 raters. Their interrater reliability was assessed with intraclass correlations, and the nursemaid's and control elbow measures were compared using Wilcoxon tests.

Results

Nursemaid's elbows and healthy control elbows did not differ significantly in offset of the radiocapitellar line from the capitellum center on anteroposterior (P = 0.49) or lateral views (P = 0.67), in proximal radial length (P = 0.95), anterior fat pad angle (P = 0.49), or posterior fat pad visibility (P = 1.00) on lateral views.

Conclusions

Nursemaid's elbows are indistinguishable from healthy elbows on radiograph. Thus, the term "radial head subluxation" appears to be a misnomer, and prereduction radiographs should only be used to eliminate the possibility of fracture. From a radiologic perspective, nursemaid's elbows remain a diagnosis of exclusion.

### Idiopathic anterior dislocation of the radial head: symptoms, radiographic findings, and management of 8 patients [^115u5P5C]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Radial head dislocation may occur during trauma or in association with congenital diseases, or it may be developmental or idiopathic. Reports of idiopathic dislocation of the radial head have been scarce. The symptoms, radiographic findings, and management of idiopathic dislocation of the radial head have not been well described in the literature.

Methods

During the past 28 years, we have encountered 8 cases of idiopathic anterior dislocation of the radial head (mean patient age, 12.5 years). In only 1 case did the patient and/or the patient's parents recall any preceding trauma or injury to the affected limb. Patients' complaints included a bulging mass, pain, and limited elbow flexion. Radiographically, the shape of the radial head was flat or slightly convex. Seven of the patients were treated with open reduction of the radial head and angulation osteotomy of the ulna. The other patient's radial head was stabilized without osteotomy.

Results

The mean postoperative follow-up period was 4.5 years. In patients whose elbow flexion was limited before surgery, improvement to more than 125° occurred. The bulging mass in the cubital fossa disappeared. None of the patients complained of disability during activities of daily living or sports participation. Radiographically, the radial head remained in the reduced position in all patients in whom open reduction of the radial head with angulation osteotomy of the ulna was performed.

Conclusions

We have described the symptoms, radiographic characteristics, and treatment of idiopathic anterior dislocation of the radial head. Open reduction of the radial head combined with angulation osteotomy of the ulna yielded favorable results both clinically and radiographically.

### Comparison of supination / flexion maneuver to hyperpronation maneuver in the reduction of radial head subluxations: a randomized clinical trial [^117FhwGt]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of supination/flexion (SF) and hyperpronation (HP) maneuvers in the management of radial head subluxation (RHS) in children ≤ 6 years old presenting to the emergency department.

Methods

Patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatment arms. Following the application of the respective reduction maneuver, maneuver success was assessed after 10 min. If unsuccessful, the maneuver was repeated up to three times. Patients failing to achieve reduction after three attempts were classified as experiencing ultimate failure. Treatment failure rates were compared between groups for each reduction attempt. Additionally, procedural pain, side effects, and recurrence within 72 h were compared between treatment groups.

Results

In this study involving 119 patients, first attempt failure rates were 9.8% in the HP group and 24.2% in the SF group, indicating a statistically significant advantage for HP (Risk ratio 0.41 (95% confidence interval 0.19 to 0.98)). No statistically significant differences were observed between groups regarding second-attempt success, ultimate failure, procedural pain, side effects, or recurrence rates within 72 h.

Conclusion

Among children ≤ 6 years old presenting with RHS, the HP maneuver demonstrated significantly superior first-attempt success rates compared to SF. Therefore, we recommend the HP maneuver as the preferred initial treatment option for managing these patients.

### Missed monteggia injuries [^113xmapp]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

The classical Monteggia injury comprises a dislocation of the radial head with an associated fracture of the ulna. In the variant type, there is no ulnar fracture merely plastic deformation. We performed a retrospective study of all Monteggia injuries from 1992 to 2001. A total of 39 were reviewed, of which 8 were missed (1 classical and 7 variant). Of those, five were male and three female with a mean age of 6.3 years. The mean follow-up was 2.5 years, with a mean interval between injury and diagnosis of 33.5 weeks. Two Monteggia injuries diagnosed within 4 weeks were successfully treated by closed manipulation. The other six required ulnar osteotomy, repair of the annular ligament and stabilisation of the radial head with a transcapitellar pin. A protocol for the diagnosis of Monteggia injuries is described. Doubtful cases require an immediate review since early treatment improves the outcome. Acceptable clinical and radiological results in late diagnosed Monteggia injuries can result from ulnar osteotomy, open reduction of the radial head with repair of the annular ligament and transcapitellar pin stabilisation of the reduced radial head.

### Manipulative interventions for reducing pulled elbow in young children [^115j2Gmg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pulled elbow (nursemaid's elbow) is a common injury in young children. It often results from a sudden pull on the arm, usually by an adult or taller person, which pulls the radius through the annular ligament, resulting in subluxation (partial dislocation) of the radial head. It can also be caused by a fall or twist. The child experiences sudden acute pain and loss of function in the affected arm. Pulled elbow is usually treated by manual reduction of the subluxed radial head. Various manoeuvres can be applied; most commonly, supination of the forearm, often combined with flexion, and (hyper-)pronation. It is unclear which is most successful. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and last updated in 2011.

Objectives

To compare the effects (benefits and harms) of the different methods used to manipulate pulled elbow in young children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, clinical trial registers and reference lists of articles. Date of last search: September 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating manipulative interventions for pulled elbow were included. Our primary outcome was failure at the first attempt, necessitating further treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently evaluated trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Overall, nine trials with 906 children (all younger than seven years old and 58% of whom were female) were included, of which five trials were newly identified in this update. Eight trials were performed in emergency departments or ambulatory care centres, and one was performed in a tertiary paediatric orthopaedic unit. Four trials were conducted in the USA, three in Turkey, one in Iran, and one in Spain. Five trials were at high risk of selection bias because allocation was not concealed and all trials were at high risk of detection bias due to the lack of assessor blinding. Eight trials compared hyperpronation with supination-flexion. We found low-quality evidence that hyperpronation resulted in less failure at first attempt than supination-flexion (9.2% versus 26.4%, risk ratio (RR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.50; 811 participants, 8 studies). Based on an illustrative risk of 268 failures at first attempt per 1000 children treated using supination-flexion, this amounted to 174 fewer failures per 1000 children treated using hyperpronation (95% CI 134 to 201 fewer). Based on risk differences data, we also estimated a number needed to treat of 6 (95% CI 5 to 8); this means that six children would need to be treated with the hyperpronation method rather than the supination-flexion method to avoid one additional failure at the first attempt. The very low-quality evidence (from four studies) for pain during or after manipulation means that it is uncertain whether there is or is not a difference between pronation and supination-flexion. There was very low-quality evidence from six studies that repeat pronation may be more effective than repeat supination-flexion for the second attempt after initial failure. The remaining outcomes were either not reported (adverse effects, recurrence) or unsuitable for pooling (ultimate failure). Ultimate failure, reported for the overall population only because of the differences in the study protocols with respect to what to do after the first attempt failed, ranged from no ultimate failures in two studies to six failures (4.1% of 148 episodes) in one study. One trial compared supination-extension versus supination-flexion. It provided very low-quality evidence (downgraded three levels for very serious risk of bias and serious imprecision) of no clear difference in failure at first attempt between the two methods.

Authors' Conclusions

There was low-quality evidence from eight small trials that the pronation method may be more effective at first attempt than the supination method for manipulating pulled elbow in young children. For other outcomes, no conclusions could be drawn either because of very low-quality evidence or the outcomes not being reported. We suggest that a high-quality randomised clinical trial comparing hyperpronation and supination-flexion is required to provide definitive evidence. We recommend that this is preceded by a survey among clinicians to establish the extent of clinical equipoise and to optimise the study design and recruitment.

### The relationship between the bevel of the radial head epiphysis and the posterior synovial fringe during rotation of the elbow: an ultrasonography study with possible implications regarding the pathophysiology of nursemaid's elbow [^115Yk6DL]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

For the nursemaid's elbow, subluxation of the radial head is possible because of the anatomy of the proximal radius. – Much research has attempted to develop an anatomic explanation for why the nursemaid's elbow occurs, thus, giving rise to multiple theories for the mechanism responsible for nursemaid elbow. – The radial head is actually oval rather than circular. The radial head is not much larger than the radial neck, less than 5 years old.

The radial head is a solid structure with a very complicated, irregular shape, and it plays a very important role in the function of the elbow joint. Due to its precise shape, the proximal radius can correctly articulate with the humerus and the ulna during the complex movements of the elbow joint. In adults, the exact geometry of the radial head is still a matter of discussion. For the design of radial head prostheses, after measuring the ventrodorsal and transverse diameters of the radial circumference in 28 cadaver elbows, King et al did not find any difference between the ventrodorsal diameter and the transverse diameter. Mahaisavariya combined CT scans with a reverse engineering technique on 40 cadaveric bones and found that the radial heads were likely to be circular. Captier et al analyzed the shape of the radial heads from the biometry of the radius in 96 cadavers. The anatomic study of the radial head shows that it is either circular (43%) or elliptical (57%), not always elliptical.

In adults, the gross anatomy of the radial head has been well documented in the literature. The proximal extremity of the radius contributes to the proximal radial ulna joint and the humeroradial joint, which shares the same joint capsule as the humeroulnar joint. The proximal aspect of the radial head carries the radial head fovea for articulation with the capitellar dome as well as the periphery area called the radial head rim. The peripheral rim of the radial head is not symmetrical, and the lateral side (with the forearm in neutral rotation) has a convex narrow slope that never articulates with the lateral trochlear ridge (zona conoidea); it is also known as the nonarticular portion of the radial head peripheral rim. In contrast, the wide and obtuse slope or the beveled rim of the medial side articulates with the lateral trochlear ridge and the lesser sigmoid notch of the ulna. (Fig. 3)

### Point-of-care ultrasonography to assist in the diagnosis and management of subluxation of the radial head in pediatric patients: a case series [^111tUqwB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A subluxation of the radial head (SRH) is a clinical condition that commonly occurs in children under 6 years of age. History and physical examination findings typically include a child who presents with an elbow held in extension and with forearm pronation, after having suffered significant longitudinal traction on the arm, or after a fall on an outstretched hand. The diagnosis is often clinically obvious. The injury responds dramatically to closed reduction, and usually no imaging is required. However, cases with atypical presentations and patients who do not respond favorably to a reduction maneuver present clinical challenges, because the initial diagnosis of SRH may seem to be questionable or erroneous. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can assist decision-making and clinical management for these patients.

Case Reports

We report three cases of SRH that were diagnosed and managed with POCUS in the emergency department. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? POCUS can assist in the diagnosis and management of patients with clinical suspicion of SRH, especially in cases of atypical presentations or cases in which the mechanism of injury is unknown. It is also an extremely valuable tool in determining postprocedure reduction success.

Fractures of the proximal radius are among the most common fractures and account for 9% to 25% of the elbow fractures in children. However, bilateral radial neck fractures are extremely rare injuries in children and have been reported only once before in present English literature. We report a case of bilateral radial neck fractures in a 10-year-old girl resulting from a fall on outstretched hands. Careful physical examination and proper radiographs are necessary for the diagnosis. Early recognition, proper management, and physical therapy led to complete recovery and full functional movement of the elbows.

### Radial head incarceration after closed reduction of a pediatric elbow dislocation with a radial neck fracture: a case report [^113TMBvL]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Case:

A 10-year-old girl sustained a radial neck fracture with a posterior elbow dislocation. She was treated with closed reduction of the elbow with subsequent intra-articular displacement of the radial head, which necessitated open reduction and pinning of the radial neck fracture.

Conclusion:

Displacement of the radial neck fracture from impingement of the capitellum on the anterior radial head during closed reduction of the elbow dislocation is a rare injury pattern. It is important to examine the radial neck in high-energy posterior elbow dislocations before attempted reduction. We present a case with imaging depicting the injury mechanism and successful management with subsequent open reduction and fixation of the radial neck fracture.

### Posterolateral instability of the elbow in an adolescent boy with a lateral epicondyle fracture: a case report [^117CddBL]. Hand (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Posterolateral rotatory instability of elbow is considered to be due to the disruption of the ulnar part of the lateral collateral ligament (LUCL). This instability pattern may also be induced by a fracture of components of the lateral column.

Results

We present the case of a 16-year-old boy who fell on his left outstretched arm as he attempted to jump over a tennis net. On initial physical examination, the elbow had instability found on varus stress and the radial head could be felt posteriorly. With attempted valgus and supination force combined with axial loading, the elbow gapped open and the patient had a sense of increased instability. X-rays showed a fracture of the lateral humeral epicondyle and posterolateral subluxation of the elbow. In the operating room, the patient was found to have reproducible posterolateral instability of the elbow. The lateral epicondyle was found to be fractured off the humerus with the LUCL still attached to the fragment. The elbow was reduced, and the injury was stabilized with small screws and suture anchors. At 6-month follow-up, the patient was pain-free, and physical examination revealed 170° of flexion, full extension, 90° of pronation, and 65° of supination. X-rays showed healing of the fracture with concentric reduction of the elbow joint.

Conclusion

In lateral epicondyle fractures, the affected elbow should be assessed for any signs of associated instability. If signs of clear instability are seen that would prohibit proper postinjury rehabilitation, then surgical reduction and fixation of the epicondyle with reinforcement of the LUCL is an effective method of treatment.

### Chronic radial head dislocation in children, part 1: pathologic changes preventing stable reduction and surgical correction [^113tRYmz]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2002). Low credibility.

The pathologic changes in 15 elbows of 14 children (2 bilateral congenital, 12 unilateral posttraumatic, mean age 9.5 years) with radial head dislocation unreduced for at least 3 months (range 3–180 months) and their open treatment were reviewed. Common dysplastic changes observed in both congenital and posttraumatic groups included large deformed radial heads, slender radial necks, and ulnar bowing. Changes were bilateral and symmetrical in the congenital group. In traumatic dislocations, patients with more severe deformities had longer delays from time of injury to time of reduction. Persistent pain, limitation of motion, and deformity were unacceptable symptoms to both patients and their parents, prompting surgical intervention. To produce a smooth rotational arc for the radius and maintain it in stable reduction, restoration of the congruency of the capitello-radioulnar joint and correction of the various dysplastic changes were mandatory during open reduction.

### Irreducible dislocation of the radial head associated with pediatric monteggia lesions [^115QGPsf]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background:

In pediatric patients with Monteggia lesions, the radial head can be reduced manually when displacement of the fractured ulna is corrected. Occasionally, however, a dislocated radial head could not be reduced manually even when the length and/or angulation of the fractured ulna had been corrected. We can find such cases in the literature, but those are single case reports. We encountered 17 cases of irreducible dislocation of the radial head in pediatric Monteggia lesions during the past 43 years. The purposes of this study were to identify the characteristics of our cases and to discuss the factors that inhibited reduction of the radial head.

Methods:

Of 109 children treated for Monteggia lesions between 1972 and 2015, we encountered 17 cases of irreducible dislocation of the radial head. The patients' ages averaged 7.1 years, ranging from 2.6 to 12.1 years. Directions of the radial head dislocation were anterior in five cases, anteromedial in four, lateral in one, and anterolateral in seven. Most of the patients were referred to us from local orthopaedic clinics because of irreducibility of the radial head. We reduced the radial head surgically and confirmed the causes of irreducibility.

Results:

In 10 of the 17 cases, the problem was identified as pseudoreduction. In those cases, the radial head was reduced in a supination position but redisplaced in a pronation position. Causes of irreducibility were traced to the annular ligament in 15 cases, biceps tendon in 1, and posterior interosseous nerve in 1.

Conclusions:

In cases of pediatric Monteggia lesions, we should pay attention to patients in whom the dislocated radial head is not reduced after closed reduction. The most frequent cause of hindered reduction was interposition of the annular ligament in the radiocapitellar joint. Here, the radial head seems to be reduced in the supination position but becomes redisplaced in the pronation position. After closed reduction, it is important to confirm whether the radial head is stable in both pronation and supination positions.

Level of Evidence:

Diagnostic level IV.

### Inadvertent radial head inversion during closed reduction of a pediatric radial neck fracture [^1114URc3]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Pediatric radial neck fractures have an incidence of 5% to 10% with respect to pediatric elbow fractures and represent nearly 1% of all pediatric fractures. In such cases, angulation of > 30° or notable translation typically necessitate surgical reduction. It is generally accepted that closed reduction should precede open reduction whenever the case allows, but the factors that shift the treatment threshold toward open reduction continue to be debated. Although the literature has notable case-control studies, it remains difficult to determine what independent factors will produce suboptimal outcomes after reduction. Furthermore, abundant variation in fracture pattern occurs among these fractures, and specific complications associated with a particular radial neck fracture pattern remains relatively understudied.

We present a Salter-Harris type II pediatric radial neck fracture with substantial angulation and posterior displacement. A closed reduction was performed initially and thought to be effective after proper alignment was established. Further intraoperative inspection revealed that the radial head was overturned 180° with the articular surface facing the radial shaft rather than the capitellum. After this detection, a challenging open reduction was performed.

### Secondary radial head dislocation and dysplasia of the lateral condyle after elbow trauma in children [^114qqgK4]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2001). Low credibility.

We report five cases of a rare complication of childhood fractures of the elbow region. The complication consists of posttraumatic dissolution of the lateral humeral condyle followed by secondary radial head overgrowth and dislocation. The initial injuries ranged from displaced lateral condyle fractures (three patients) to a supracondylar fracture and an open elbow dislocation. Dysplasia of the lateral humeral condyle was first noted 1 to 4 years after the trauma (mean, 2.5 years) and seemed to be caused by removal of the displaced fracture fragment in one patient, and possibly by malfixation and repeated surgical procedures in the others. Because of loss of motion, ulnar nerve irritation, and cosmetic deformities, corrective osteotomies had to be performed in four patients and additional radial head removal in two patients.

### The usefulness of dynamic ultrasonography in nursemaid's elbow: a prospective case series of 13 patients reconsideration of the pathophysiology of nursemaid's elbow [^116vVXx7]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Nursemaid's elbow, also known as pulled elbow or radial head subluxation, is a common musculoskeletal disorder among children under 5 years of age.

It usually occurs with axial traction to the forearm while a child's arm is in pronated and extended positions.

The diagnosis of the nursemaid's elbow is based on history and physical examination. Children with nursemaid's elbow usually do not want to use the arm and will protect it with a slightly flexed elbow and pronated wrist position.

However, the pathophysiology of the nursemaid's elbow still lacks strong evidence. The exact pathology of the nursemaid's elbow remains to be defined.

In adults, Clarke and several authors have indicated that the synovial fold could be a cause of lateral elbow pain associated with mechanical symptoms such as clicking, catching, and painful snapping.–

The role of imaging in diagnosis has also been somewhat controversial. Physicians tend to order radiographs for elbow injuries that they initially perceive to be radial head subluxations when attempts at reduction fail.

Using a high-frequency ultrasound probe, we attempted to determine the etiology and possible pathophysiology of the nursemaid's elbow.

Our hypothesis was that an escaped and entrapped posterior synovial fringe could be the pathogenesis of the nursemaid's elbow (Fig. 1).

Case 12

A 5-year-old girl had fallen off a sofa and presented to an emergency department with complaints of pain and swelling in her left elbow. There was no neurovascular deficit. Radiographs revealed incomplete fracture of the proximal metaphysis of the ulna with anterolateral subluxation of the radial head (Figure 4). Closed reduction without anesthesia was attempted, but stable reduction was not obtained. Soon after, she was referred to our department.

Figure 4
Anteroposterior (A) and lateral (B) radiographs (case 12) show anterolateral subluxation of the radial head with incomplete fracture of the proximal metaphysis of the ulna.

Under general anesthesia, closed reduction was again attempted. The radial head seemed to be reduced in a supination position but subluxated in a pronation position (Figure 5). We considered that these findings indicate some type of pseudoreduction. Therefore, we decided to reduce the radial head surgically. Open reduction was performed using the same approach as in case 4. The intraoperative findings were nearly the same as in case 4. That is, the annular ligament was interposed between the capitellum and the radial head. Hence, we reduced the radial head using the same maneuver that was successful in case 4.

Figure 5
Lateral radiographs (case 12) show that the radial head is nearly reduced in a supination position (A) but anteriorly subluxated in a pronation position (B).

The patient's postoperative course after surgery was uneventful, and she resumed nearly normal elbow motion 3 months after surgery. At the final follow-up, 7 months after injury, she had a normal carrying angle and full range of motion of the elbow and forearm. Plain radiography showed that the radial head was in a normal position even in pronation (Figure 6).

Figure 6
Anteroposterior (A) and lateral (B) radiographs radiographs (case 12) obtained at 7 months after open reduction show that the radiocapitellar relationship is normal even in a pronation position.

### Ultrasonography of the annular ligament partial tear and recurrent "pulled elbow" [^117X2oKc]. Pediatric Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old boy had multiple episodes of radial head subluxation, recurrent "pulled elbow". On initial ultrasonography, there was subluxation of the radial head in relation to the capitellum, and the annular ligament was partially disrupted. Following brace treatment, subluxation of the radial head was corrected and annular ligament disruption healed. As shown by ultrasonography, these findings correlated well with the clinical course and can be utilized to guide treatment.

### The child with a painful arm: a POCUS screening protocol to identify fracture in children with upper extremity injury [^1165pEqb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Young children present frequently to the emergency department with an immobile, painful arm. It is often difficult to discern a point of tenderness in a frightened, injured child. Common approaches included sending the child for x-ray studies of the extremity or empirically attempting reduction of radial head subluxation. We created a step-by-step point-of-care ultrasound screening protocol of the upper extremity to increase or decrease the probability of fracture before x-ray study or reduction.

Case Report

We present the cases of 6 children younger than 4 years without a clear history of pulled elbow and without swelling or deformity on examination, for whom this protocol revealed fracture or lowered the probability of fracture, thereby increasing the safety of radial head reduction. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? In most cases, identification of a single fracture on ultrasound allows for focused x-ray study on the area of fracture. Children with a normal ultrasound screen can undergo reduction of radial head subluxation safely.

### Use of corrective ulnar osteotomy and radial head relocation into preserved annular ligament in the treatment of radiocapitellar instability secondary to pediatric chronic monteggia fracture-dislocation [^116ztX2r]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Opening-wedge osteotomy of the ulna restores normal ulnar length and corrects the angulation of the ulna in patients with chronic Monteggia fracture-dislocations. In addition, this eases the reduction of the radial head. Morbidity caused by annular ligament reconstruction surgery can be prevented by preserving the intact annular ligament. After dilatation and mobilization of the annular ligament, reduction of the radial head can be accomplished. This study evaluated the effectiveness of corrective opening-wedge ulnar osteotomy and radial head relocation into the intact annular ligament in the treatment of radiocapitellar instability secondary to pediatric chronic Monteggia fracture-dislocation.

Methods

Fourteen patients diagnosed with radial head dislocation associated with plastic deformation of the ulna or ulnar fracture were included in the study. Radiologic and clinical results of these patients who underwent corrective ulnar osteotomy and radial head relocation into an intact annular ligament were evaluated retrospectively.

Results

The mean age of the patients at the time of injury was 7.4 years (range, 3 years to 12 years). The average time between the injury and surgery was 19.1 months (median, 8 months; range, 3 months to 66 months); the average follow-up period was 28.7 months (range, 12 months to 60 months). The mean Kim score was 69.6 (range, 50 to 75) preoperatively and 92.9 (60 to 100) at last follow-up. According to Kim score, the results were considered excellent in 12 cases and poor in 2 cases. Radial head subluxation recurred in 2 separate cases. In addition, chondrolysis changes were seen in 1 case. Reduction loss and osteoarthritic changes in the radiocapitellar joint were considered poor results in follow-up radiographs.

Conclusions

Corrective ulnar osteotomy and relocating the radial head into the intact annular ligament can be safely used for treating chronic Monteggia fracture-dislocation cases without radial head and capitellum deformity.

### Rare cause of block to reduction after radial head dislocation in children [^111HqkHR]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2011). Low credibility.

This case report documents a rare cause of block to reduction in association with an anterior traumatic dislocation of the radial head in children. The radial head dislocations described were not reducible with a closed reduction secondary to "button holing" of the radial head through the anterior joint capsule. Open reduction was required to release the capsule and reduce the radial head. After reduction, the elbow was immobilized in flexion and the forearm in mild supination for 3 weeks. Postoperatively, all patients demonstrated full elbow function and range of function.

### The relationship between the bevel of the radial head epiphysis and the posterior synovial fringe during rotation of the elbow: an ultrasonography study with possible implications regarding the pathophysiology of nursemaid's elbow [^111ERf6s]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

Nursemaid's elbow, also called the "pulled elbow", is the most common upper extremity injury in children under 5 years old, whereby it results from an axial pulling force onto an extended elbow and pronated forearm. – However, patients present with the axial traction mechanism of a nursemaid's elbow only 50% to 65% of the time. Schunk demonstrated that only 49% of patients in their prospective study had a history of an axial traction mechanism. In a previous study, we tried to find diagnostic imaging to confirm a nursemaid's elbow diagnosis, and we found that an escaped and entrapped posterior synovial fringe could be the pathogenesis of the nursemaid's elbow. The ultrasound figures did not show subluxation of the radial head but only showed the subluxation of the posterior fringe entrapped between the radial head and annular ligament. The entrapment sign or ellipse sign could be detected in both the axillary and long-axis views (Fig. 1). In this study, we attempted to determine the relationship between the anterior edge of the posterior synovial fringe and the peripheral rim of the radial head epiphysis during rotation in the normal elbow and to discuss why we feel this anatomy places children at risk for nursemaid's elbow.

### Virtual coaching and the reduction of radial head subluxation: a case series [^114r8VVa]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

After the establishment of the virtual pediatric emergency medicine clinic at our institution, we noted that several physicians independently began to instruct caregivers virtually on reducing a radial head subluxation. We thus conducted a case series to investigate the number, success, and follow-ups for the virtual reduction of radial head subluxation.

Methods

The electronic medical records at our institution were searched from the inception of the virtual clinic in May 2020 until August 2022 (inclusive), for visits and discharge diagnosis containing the word "elbow" or "arm".

Results

Fourteen charts were retrieved; however, 2 were excluded because they were not a suspected radial head subluxation. A virtual reduction was attempted for eight (66.7%) of the 12 patients. In 6 of 8 patients (75.0%), the reduction was deemed successful, and for 2 patients (25.0%), it was deemed unsuccessful. Of the latter, one was found to have a nondisplaced radial neck fracture. All 4 patients (33.3%) for whom a virtual reduction was not attempted were referred to the emergency department.

Conclusions

Virtual video coaching of pulled elbow reduction was completed at our institution with overall good success rate. All the physicians involved noted the essential need and benefits of video conferencing for successfully reducing radial head subluxation. We note that a pediatric population may be more amenable to video-based appointments than other populations due to their caregivers' familiarity with digital technology. Finally, as nonphysician models of healthcare delivery for virtual urgent care visits expand, we propose a checklist based on our experience to ensure patient safety.

### Not just another nursemaid' s: an enigmatic paediatric humeral fracture [^114PPmdg]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

In the medical literature, the discussion of radial head subluxation (RHS) and nursemaid's elbow may highlight the ability to diagnose and treat the injured patient without obtaining imaging studies. This case reiterates the importance of a thorough physical examination and the use of appropriate imaging when point tenderness is exposed in the injured limb. With point tenderness to the arm, a child with a presumed RHS, otherwise known as nursemaid's elbow, should be evaluated using radiographic imaging to prevent additional potentially destructive physical manipulation of the patient's upper extremity.

### Surgical treatment of chronic elbow dislocation allowing for early range of motion: operative technique and clinical results [^114S1kGx]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2018). Low credibility.

Olecranon Articular Scar Dissection

The olecranon articular surface is routinely covered with the adherent scar, which requires careful dissection. Once the articular cartilage margin is identified, the adherent scar is mobilized starting from 1 margin and working across the joint. The scar was elevated en masse from the cartilage with gentle leverage from a Freer elevator or gentle dissection with a 15 blade while attempting to preserve the underlying articular cartilage (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 7, for photographs of the scar adherent to the distal humerus) (see Figures, Supplemental Digital Content 8A and B, for photographs of olecranon and coronoid before and after debridement of the scar and HO). At some point, the mass of the adherent articular scar becomes mobilized and completely excised. It was essential to identify and remove the bands of scar running parallel to the olecranon so as to allow full congruent reduction of the olecranon in the trochlea. The depths of the olecranon fossae and coronoid fossae are cleaned out with a curette or rongeurs of scar. Any HO was removed; this was almost uniformly present adjacent to the radial head on the posterolateral humerus and was completely removed in both children and adults with aide of rongeurs (see Figures, Supplemental Digital Content 9A and B, for photographs of the distal humerus before and after removal of HO).

Elbow Reduction

Attention was redirected medially with care taken to make sure that there was adequate space between the anterior and posterior soft tissue sleeves distally to permit passage for reduction of the humerus. This usually required deep dissection into the flexor pronator mass in line with the ulnar nerve until the first motor branch was identified. Care was taken to avoid entrapment of the ulnar nerve when reducing the elbow. The elbow was then carefully inspected for impinging soft tissue from around the olecranon to be sure that the elbow was concentrically reduced with near full extension. The triceps was uniformly tight with flexion of the reduced elbow; care should be taken to avoid forceful manipulation, as gentle incremental manipulation was usually enough to stretch the triceps. In approximately 25% of elbows, an 18-gauge needle was used to repeatedly pierce the triceps tendon percutaneously to incrementally lengthen it (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 10, for drawing of needle barbotage lengthening of triceps). As a caveat, generous needle barbotage can lead to significant swelling and should be avoided.

### Management and outcomes of children with nursemaid's elbow [^111P3ZvV]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

We identify the incidence and predictors of missed fracture and characterize patterns of radiography performance in children with a diagnosis of radial head subluxation in the emergency department (ED) setting.

Methods

We queried the Pediatric Health Information System database for visits by children younger than 10 years and with a diagnosis of radial head subluxation at 1 of 45 pediatric EDs from 2010 to 2018. The frequency of radiography use was assessed overall and between hospitals. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between patient-level characteristics and the outcome of missed fracture (return visit for upper extremity fracture within 7 days of the index visit).

Results

We identified 88,466 eligible visits; the median patient age was 2.1 years, 59% of visits were by female patients, and in visits in which laterality was noted, 60% of cases occurred in the left arm. Radiography was performed at 28.5% of visits; hospital rates of radiography performance ranged from 19.8% to 41.7%. Missed upper extremity fractures were observed in 247 cases (0.3% of the cohort). The odds of missed fracture were higher in children older than 6 years (adjusted odds ratio 2.32; 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 4.81), children who underwent radiography at the index visit (adjusted odds ratio 2.52; 95% confidence interval 1.84 to 3.43), and children receiving acetaminophen or ibuprofen (adjusted odds ratio 1.54; 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 2.06).

Conclusion

Radiographs were obtained for greater than one quarter of children presenting to a pediatric ED with radial head subluxation, with wide variation between hospitals. Missed fractures were rare. Future efforts should aim to reduce unnecessary radiography in this population.

### Osteomyelitis of the ulnar head in a presumed "pulled elbow" [^112sqxNH]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The "pulled elbow" is a common emergency department diagnosis that presents with a classic history and examination. A differential diagnosis should be sought in all children with atypical clinical features or in those in whom manipulation is unsatisfactory. The importance of follow-up should also be highlighted in the atypical pulled elbow. An unusual presentation of osteomyelitis of the ulnar head initially diagnosed as a pulled elbow in a 9-month-old boy is discussed. This case was further complicated by the lack of inflammatory response to infection and the manifestation clinically of signs apparently within the elbow rather than the osteomyelitic inferior radioulnar joint.

### Radial head dislocation and subluxation in osteogenesis imperfecta [^115hyq1p]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Upper limb deformity in children with osteogenesis imperfecta may substantially impair function. The aims of this retrospective work were to study the prevalence of radial head malalignment (dislocation or subluxation) in different types of osteogenesis imperfecta and to identify factors linked to it.

Methods

We assessed 489 upper limbs from 254 patients (with a mean age of 9.6 years and including 130 female patients) who had various types of osteogenesis imperfecta. Radiographs representing a single time-point for each patient were assessed for the presence and direction of radial head malalignment and associated abnormalities (dysplasia of the capitellum or of the radial head or neck, calcification of the interosseous membrane, or radioulnar synostosis). Deformations of the humerus, radius, and ulna were assessed with regard to location, direction, and magnitude. The forearm range of motion in pronation and supination and the hand grip force were measured in a subset of patients.

Results

We observed radial head dislocation or subluxation in forty-four and thirty-nine upper extremities, respectively. The frequency of radial head malalignment was significantly higher in type-V osteogenesis imperfecta (86%) than in the other types (0% to 29%) (p < 0.001). Dysplasia of the humeral capitellum, radial head, or radial neck was associated with malalignment in all types of osteogenesis imperfecta, with the exception of capitellum dysplasia in type V. Malalignment in type V was associated with calcification of the interosseous membrane, an abnormality that was specific for type V. In the other osteogenesis imperfecta types, malalignment was commonly linked with radial and ulnar deformation and was associated with decreased forearm range of motion in supination and pronation and a lower grip force.

Conclusions

Radial head malalignment is common in osteogenesis imperfecta, especially in type V. Malalignment is associated with bowing characteristics and impaired function of the upper limb. These findings may provide support for surgical correction of radial and ulnar bowing in selected patients with osteogenesis imperfecta.

### Radial head replacement through a kocher approach [^116uu71c]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Radial head fractures are some of the most common elbow fractures. Fractures with 3 or more fracture fragments have been shown to have worse outcomes when treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Radial head replacement offers an alternative treatment for those more comminuted radial head fractures.

Methods

Three-part radial head fractures make anatomical reduction more difficult to obtain with ORIF. Radial head fractures requiring replacement have shown good clinical outcomes. As a result, radial head arthroplasty offers a good treatment option for 3-or-more-part radial head fractures.

Results

This video presents a case of a radial head arthroplasty for a 3-part radial head fracture in a 23-year-old man. The radial head implant provides a smooth and concentric surface for articulation with the capitellum while providing stability to the elbow.

Conclusions

Radial head replacement provides a good alternative to ORIF, producing similar elbow range of motion and providing good stability compared with the contralateral elbow.

### Transbrachialis buttonholing of the radial head as a cause for irreducible radiocapitellar dislocation: a case report [^113MQbFL]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Isolated dislocation of the radial head is an uncommon injury among pediatric patients. Although closed reduction may be successful, some patients require open reduction with or without soft-tissue repair or reconstruction. If the radiocapitellar joint is not properly reduced, the long-term complications of pain, stiffness, neuropathy, and dysplasia can result from chronic radial head dislocation.

Methods

While performing a cartwheel, a 13-year-old gymnast sustained a radiocapitellar dislocation that was unable to be reduced by closed means and failed 2 attempts at open reduction. Ultimately, the radial head was determined to have translated anterior to the brachialis muscle during the dislocation and subsequently buttonholed through the muscle as the elbow was flexed and rotated. It remained suspended by the brachialis tendon, preventing anatomic reduction. Once the radial head was delivered from this tendinous sling, anatomic restoration of the radiocapitellar joint was obtained.

Results

Ultimately, the patient was able to return to full, unrestricted activity. At 9 months following surgery, she denied pain, and the elbow was stable upon examination. Elbow range of motion was 5 to 130 degrees with 80 and 90 degrees of pronation and supination respectively.

Conclusions

This represents the first reported case of suspension transbrachialis buttonholing of the radial head in the brachialis tendon as a cause of initially irreducible radiocapitellar dislocation. When evaluating patients with persistent anterior subluxation or dislocation of the radial head, this etiology should be considered.

### Paediatric fracture dislocation of the forearm: an unusual presentation [^117Ln8zA]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Traumatic injuries of the elbow in children pose a diagnostic challenge. They demand precise knowledge of radiographic anatomy, growth characteristics of healthy and injured bones as well as specific fracture dynamics in this age group. Dislocation of the elbow is rare in children, accounting for 3–6% of all childhood elbow injuries. Fractures at the distal humerus and proximal forearm have been extensively discussed in the literature. We describe a unique case of a 4-year-old child presenting with a traumatic radial head fracture and ulnar dislocation not previously reported. Diagnosis and recognition of the injury pattern was fundamental in the successful management of this case. We recommend the use of CT with three-dimensional reconstructions, to fully understand the fracture pattern and dictate subsequent reduction manoeuvres during closed manipulation. Thus preventing open surgical techniques and their associated morbidities.

### Inadvertent radial head inversion during closed reduction of a pediatric radial neck fracture [^115Xmb61]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Case Report

An 11-year-old female presented to the emergency department with right elbow pain after falling on her outstretched right upper extremity. After physical and radiographic evaluation, the patient was found to have a Salter-Harris type II fracture of the radial neck with complete posterior dislocation and 90° angulation of the epiphysis on the radial neck (Figure 1). Direct surgical treatment was arranged with the provisional strategy of a closed reduction. Should closed reduction fail, the need for percutaneous versus open reduction was discussed with the patient and family.

Figure 1
Radiographs showing lateral (A) and AP (B) views of the patient's right elbow demonstrating complete posterior dislocation and 90° angulation of the radial neck toward the capitellum.

After proper anesthesia and preoperative preparation, closed manipulation using the Pattersonmaneuver was performed. With the elbow in extension and application of distal traction, the forearm was supinated and pulled into varus with simultaneous application of direct pressure over the radial head which brought the radial head back into alignment with the radial shaft. With the fracture "reduced", the articular cartilage of the radial head separated the metaphysis and epiphysis, giving the impression of a normal physis in this pediatric patient. Initially, the treating surgeons felt the reduction was successful and began preparing to cast the elbow. However, careful evaluation of final fluoroscopic images indicated that the radial head was flipped 180° with the articular surface facing the radial shaft rather than the capitellum (Figure 2). Close inspection shows that the false physis is wider than it should be at age 11, particularly given the maturity of the patient's other growth centers. Furthermore, the subchondral bone of the radial head articular surface is noticeably concave and thicker than the flat and indistinct bone of the metaphyseal surface.

### The relationship between the bevel of the radial head epiphysis and the posterior synovial fringe during rotation of the elbow: an ultrasonography study with possible implications regarding the pathophysiology of nursemaid's elbow [^115oUaKz]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

When the child's elbow sustained a passive pronation force, the anterior edge of the posterior synovial fringe touched the beveled peripheral rim of the radial head epiphysis, and the tension of the lateral collateral ligament complex may further force the anterior edge of the posterior fringe to pull distally and to easily escape from the normal position between the radial fovea and capitellum. We believe this is why the nursemaid's elbow happened in pronation. Although the peripheral rim of the radial head epiphysis was homogeneous with that in the adult radial head, the epiphysis of the radial head had not yet ossified before 5 y/o. The epiphyseal center or secondary ossification center of the radial head appears around the age of 5. Before ossification, the epiphysis of the radial head consisted entirely of a hyaline cartilage structure. We speculate that this is why nursemaid's elbow only occurs before age 6.

There were some limitations in this study. First, all patients in this study were children who had a history of nursemaid's elbow, and children who never had a history of nursemaid elbow were excluded. Second, although we found the offset of radial fovea change during rotation, we did not discuss its impact on the morphologic change of the posterior synovial fringe. Finally, the small case number may be insufficient to broadly generalize the results on the current information. Accumulating data from more patients is mandatory to establish solid conclusions in future studies.

DISCUSSION

This study reports the largest series of these fractures with a combination of significant angulation and displacement of the fracture requiring open reduction. We feel that open reduction is indicated when the head of the radius is completely displaced and without contact with the rim of the metaphysis. Even minimal contact was noted in other series to help obtain a closed reduction with a Kirschner wire or an intramedullary elastic nail. In our series, the degree of angulation was always > 60 degrees and about 90 degrees in most cases.

In our cases, residual radial head deformity due to premature closure of the growth plate and avascular necrosis were correlated with a functional deficit. Associated elbow injury was coupled with a negative prognosis. In our series, about 25% of patients had fair and 20% had poor results. Outcomes were good in 55% and felt to represent a better outcome than if the fracture remained nonanatomically reduced with residual angulation and/or displacement of the radial head.

Loss of motion, the primary cause of poor results, is felt to be secondary to a combination of loss of joint congruity and fibrous adhesions. Open reduction was performed to provide an anatomic reduction with minimal trauma of soft tissue around the fracture. The bloody supply of the radial head is precarious, and meticulous dissection with preservation of soft tissue attachments to the metaphyseal spike may improve the results. In our series, the head was repositioned as gently as possible removing interposed structures that blocked reduction. We found the head fragment to be stable after reduction and internal fixation was not performed.

Complication relative to internal fixation to the fragment blood supply and particular surface was avoided without loss of reduction.

Acceptability of reduction has to be related to the type of proximal fragment dislocation and displacement and age of the patient, with a younger child having greater potential of remodeling. The generally accepted upper limit of accepted angulation is 45 degrees at 10 years of age. This angular value was chosen from series that included multiple methods of treatment, limited follow-up, and, in some cases, not including the amount of fracture translation.

### Grisel's syndrome: a case report on this rare pediatric disease and its anesthetic challenges [^111VuQCE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Grisel's syndrome is a non-traumatic atlantoaxial subluxation associated with inflammatory conditions of the head and neck, which occurs primarily in children. Increased flexibility of the ligaments during inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of the subluxation between the axis and atlas. The potential sequelae may be severe, and early diagnosis and treatment of Grisel's syndrome can prevent tragic outcomes.

Case Presentation

We present a case of torticollis in an 8-year-old child. She had a two-week history of a streptococcal throat infection. The patient was treated with several different methods of conservative care, including muscle relaxation, cervical halter traction, and Halo application. However, the torticollis persisted. The patient then required surgical correction involving cervical spine fusion. She had no complications and experienced no reoccurrence of the torticollis to date.

Conclusion

Grisel's syndrome is a pathology for which conservative management is successful in most cases. Cases requiring surgical intervention are rarely documented in the literature. Our case is significant, as in spite of aggressive conservative management, the patient required surgical correction. Patients requiring surgical management of Grisel's syndrome may require additional anesthetic exposure for diagnostic interventions like magnetic resonance imaging or neck manipulations for closed reduction. We discuss the features of Grisel's syndrome and specific anesthetic management considerations for procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging, application of cervical traction, and surgical correction of torticollis.

### Inadvertent radial head inversion during closed reduction of a pediatric radial neck fracture [^116UWkTW]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

This is the first reported example of 180° radial head inversion as an intraoperative complication during reduction of a pediatric radial neck fracture. The transverse nature of Salter-Harris type I and II fractures makes this inverted position possible and also difficult to appreciate on imaging. The epiphysis of the proximal radius is an almost symmetric disk, and reversal of the head could certainly be missed in an immature patient who is expected to have a physis between the two fragments. Fortunately, this complication was identified before leaving the operating room and was corrected with a good long-term outcome. The long-term consequences of an unrecognized inverted radial head are not known but would be expected to include articular surface damage, nonunion, and stiffness. Once this complication is recognized, open reduction is necessary to restore normal anatomy. Because of the instability of the fracture and the skeletal maturity of the patient's elbow, the senior author chose to repair the fracture using a plate and screws; however, this strategy would not be attractive in a younger patient. A number of fixation options have been advocated after open reduction of a radial neck fracture in an immature patient. If the fracture is relatively stable, cast application without fixation has demonstrated good results. A transarticular pin through the capitellum and radial head has been recommended, but this technique may result in breakage of the pin and difficulty retrieving the fragments. The Metaizeau technique involves use of an intramedullary pin or elastic nail to both reduce and stabilize the fracture and has been shown to yield excellent results. Many authors use an oblique pin or pins across the fracture site, either antegrade or retrograde, and this approach is the preferred fixation method at our institution in immature patients. Bioabsorbable pin fixation has also been advocated in both children and adults to avoid implant-related complications and the need for implant removal.

In conclusion, this case provides insight on recognizing and managing a notable intraoperative malreduction of a displaced radial neck fracture when initial closed reduction fails. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of meticulous assessment of intraoperative imaging when determining proper alignment of grossly unstable, transverse Salter-Harris type I and II fractures.

### Suspected radial head subluxation in infants: the need for radiologic evaluation [^111r2nUj]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Radial head subluxation ("pulled elbow" or "nursemaid's elbow") is a common pediatric condition in children aged 1 to 4 years, although it is an uncommon finding in nonambulatory infants. It is a clinical diagnosis, and further investigations such as x-ray are not routinely done. We present a case series of 2 nonambulatory infants with forearm fractures that were initially diagnosed as radial head subluxation. Current literature supports the use of x-ray in children with atypical or unclear history prior to an attempted pulled elbow reduction. We suggest that this recommendation should be extended to all nonambulatory infants, given the unlikely diagnosis of radial head subluxation, and the necessity for early recognition of injuries that may be indicators of abuse.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^114HVaKR]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures — epidemiology and evaluation note these are common pediatric injuries, accounting for more than half of all pediatric elbow fractures, most commonly occurring in children ages five to seven years old with a similar frequency in males and females. These fractures are typically a result of an extension injury, most often a fall on an outstretched hand, and all patients with these fractures should be evaluated for neuropraxias, vascular injuries, and/or an ipsilateral distal radius fracture. When evaluating potential cases, a thorough physical exam is required, including neurological, vascular, and other osseous assessment, and any radiographic evidence of a supracondylar fracture, including a posterior fat pad sign, should prompt evaluation by an orthopaedic surgeon.

### Pediatric and adolescent T-type distal humerus fractures [^11647eds]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Although injuries to the upper extremity in children are very common, T-type distal humerus fractures are more rare, representing < 2% of observed pediatric elbow fractures. The typical age range of other common elbow fractures in the pediatric population tends to occur at younger ages (ie, 5–8 years old). T-type distal humerus fractures are more common in the adolescent population (ie, > 10 years old) and are not typically seen in the younger age group. – Boys tend to be affected more than girls. These injuries often result from a fall onto the posterior aspect of a flexed elbow, with the nondominant arm affected at a ratio of 2.5:1. A high degree of vigilance is required to diagnose intra-articular extension in these fractures because most require open surgical management.

### Convergent radioulnar translocation with radial head fracture in a child: a case report and review of the literature [^116qk5eZ]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2012). Low credibility.

Summary

Convergent type radioulnar translocation is an extremely rare form of injury occurring in a growing child. We report a case of convergent radioulnar translocation along with a radial head fracture in a young child. Open reduction of the elbow and internal fixation of the radial head fragment helped in achieving concentric reduction and good functional outcome at 2 years of follow-up. This case has been shown to highlight the diagnostic and management issues of this rare condition, which may be easily missed initially.

### Radial head incarceration after closed reduction of a pediatric elbow dislocation with a radial neck fracture: a case report [^113Px3g2]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 10-year-old girl presented to an outside emergency department with left elbow pain after falling off of a horse. She was neurovascularly intact and found to have a posterior elbow dislocation with a Salter-Harris II fracture of the radial neck (Figure 1). Reduction attempt of the posterior elbow dislocation displaced the radial neck fracture, with the capitellum remaining interposed between the radial shaft and head (Figure 2). The patient was transferred to our hospital, and the decision was made to urgently proceed to open reduction to decrease the risk of osteonecrosis to the radial head and to decrease additional chondral damage.

### The usefulness of dynamic ultrasonography in nursemaid's elbow: a prospective case series of 13 patients reconsideration of the pathophysiology of nursemaid's elbow [^117QUFDR]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Nursemaid's elbow, also known as radial head subluxation or pulled elbow, is the most common cause of upper extremity immobility in preschool children. However, the pathophysiology is not very clear, as the diagnosis is still made based on history and clinical examination. Sankarreported that 30% of the patients in his study had no history of traction. Some children can have elbow fractures or other pathologies that can mimic the physical findings of the nursemaid's elbows.–Reduction attempts in these cases can cause iatrogenic displacement of the fracture and unnecessary pain. By ultrasonography, it has become possible to obtain objective diagnostic images of the nursemaid's elbow.

The exact pathology of the nursemaid's elbow also remains to be defined. Subluxation of the radial head is possible because of the anatomy of the proximal radius. Salter and Zaltzfound that traction on the pronated forearm with the elbow extended could cause a transverse tear of the distal attachment of the annular ligament, allowing the partial escape of the radial head. However, almost all these patients were pain-free immediately after successful reduction. It seems that the annular ligament was not torn in all these patients.

### Radial head incarceration after closed reduction of a pediatric elbow dislocation with a radial neck fracture: a case report [^115ZX8TB]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Radial neck fractures represent 1% of all pediatric fractures and 5% to 10% of elbow injuries in children. Injury typically occurs after a fall from height onto an outstretched arm with a possible torsional component. Initial treatment involves closed reduction with progression to percutaneous or open reduction if adequate results cannot be achieved through closed means. There is debate as to which injury characteristics may preclude successful closed management and should proceed directly to open reduction to minimize articular damage. Increased displacement increases the risk for postoperative complications, such as osteonecrosis, nonunion, overgrowth, physeal arrest, and stiffness, and up to half of children with radial neck fractures have subsequent limited forearm rotation. Risk for stiffness and loss of motion is due to trauma at the time of injury but can be exacerbated by subsequent trauma from attempted closed reductions. It is generally accepted that residual angulation over 30° or translation over 2 mm necessitates open reduction. In a retrospective study on pediatric radial neck fractures by Zimmerman et al, the authors found that initial displacement and age older than 10 years were associated with poor outcomes while another study by Gutierrez found only initial displacement as a predictor of poor outcome.

We present a pediatric posterior elbow dislocation with Salter-Harris type II radial neck fracture complicated by post–elbow reduction radial head incarceration within the ulnohumeral joint. The closed reduction fluoroscopy demonstrates the mechanism of the rare Jeffery type II lesion in which the capitellum impinges on the anterior lip on the radial head during reduction of a posterior dislocation, causing a 90° backward tilt of the head. After transfer to our facility, the decision was made to proceed urgently to open reduction with pinning to minimize additional articular damage and because of the difficulties associated with closed management of Jeffery type II lesions.

The patient was followed up at 1 week, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. At 1 week, radiographs showed stable alignment of the fracture and no implant complication and the splint was overwrapped with fiberglass. At 4 weeks, periosteal reaction was seen over the proximal radius, her pins were pulled, and she was placed back in a long arm cast (Figure 3). At 6 weeks, she was neurovascularly intact, the incision was well healed, and she was transitioned to a hinged elbow brace with 30° range of motion; on imaging, the radial neck fracture was well aligned with callous formation evident. At 3 months, she had full flexion and pronation. She was lacking 5° extension and supination. She was pain-free and stable to varus and valgus stress. Imaging at her 3-month postoperative visit revealed a well-healed radial neck with excellent radial neck, ulnohumeral, and radiocapitellar alignment with no signs of displacement or osteonecrosis (Figure 4). This was maintained at her 6-month evaluation.

Two case reports of successful ALD reduction via telephone are described. The pathology of ALD and techniques for its treatment are reviewed, and guidelines are given. The rationale for the introduction of the new term annular ligament displacement as well as areas for additional investigation are discussed.

### Manipulative interventions for reducing pulled elbow in young children [^116QuqUW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pulled elbow (nursemaid's elbow) is a common injury in young children. It results from a sudden pull on the arm, usually by an adult or taller person, which pulls the radius through the annular ligament, resulting in subluxation (partial dislocation) of the radial head. The child experiences sudden acute pain and loss of function in the affected arm. Pulled elbow is usually treated by manual reduction of the subluxed radial head. Various manoeuvres can be applied. Most textbooks recommend supination of the forearm, as opposed to pronation and other approaches. It is unclear which manoeuvre is most successful. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to compare the effectiveness and painfulness of the different methods used to manipulate pulled elbow in young children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, clinical trial registers and reference lists of articles. Date of last search: July 2011.

Selection Criteria

Any randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating manipulative interventions for pulled elbow were included. Our primary outcome was failure at the first attempt, necessitating further treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently evaluated trials for inclusion and, for the included trials, independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data.

Main Results

One trial with 66 children was newly included in this update. Overall, four trials with 379 children, all younger than seven years old, were included. All four trials compared pronation versus supination. One trial was at high risk of selection bias because allocation was not concealed and all four trials were at high risk of detection bias due to the lack of assessor blinding. Pronation resulted in statistically significantly less failure than supination (21/177 versus 47/181, risk ratio 0.45; 95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.73). Pain perception was reported by two trials but data were unavailable for pooling. Both studies concluded that the pronation technique was less painful than the supination technique.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence from four small low-quality trials that the pronation method might be more effective and less painful than the supination method for manipulating pulled elbow in young children. We recommend that a high quality randomised trial be performed to strengthen the evidence.

### Irreducible dislocation of the radial head associated with pediatric monteggia lesions [^112rU6qH]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

In the current series, 10 of the 17 cases were considered to be a type of pseudoreduction. In these cases, the radial head was nearly reduced in a supination position but redislocated or subluxated in a pronation position (Figure 5). Tan et alnoted that if the forearm was pronated, the lateral face of the radial head appeared outside the annular ligament, allowing redislocation of the radial head. They emphasized that frequent radiographic examinations are therefore necessary.

In contrast to our findings and to the report of Tan et al, Shinohara et aldescribed two cases of incomplete reduction, in which the radial head was reduced in a supination position but redislocated during rotation from a neutral position to pronation position. Instead of open reduction of the radial head, they treated these cases using a hinged elbow splint. They stated that the purpose of the splint was to reduce the traction force of the biceps muscle on the radial head while allowing the soft tissue surrounding the radial head to heal and stabilize the proximal radioulnar joint.

We treated one patient (case 15) conservatively with a cast in a supination position. In this case, the radial head seemed to be reduced in a supination position, despite showing subluxation in a pronation position. Four weeks later, however, the radial head dislocated completely (Figure 7). The surgeon who treated this boy thought that the radial head was in a reduced position. If the radiocapitellar lineis precisely visualized, however, a line drawn along the radial shaft misses the capitellum. We therefore emphasize that whenever reduction of the radial head is attempted, it is important to confirm that a line drawn along the radial shaft intersects the center of the capitellum. Also, if the radial head is unstable in supination and pronation positions, we recommend open reduction.

Prevalence of capitellar OCD in chronic radial head subluxation and dislocation

Delma Jarrett, Paul Kleinman

Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, (United States)

Purpose-Objective. To determine the prevalence of capitellar osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) in children with chronic radial head subluxation (RHS) or dislocation (RHD).

Material and methods. We searched radiology reports from 1/1/04 to 10/1/12 for patients < 19 years old with RHS/RHD. Cases of skeletal dysplasia, intra-articular pathology, fracture of the capitellum, longitudinal deficiency of the radius or radioulnar synostoses were excluded. Images and records were reviewed to determine etiology of RHS/RHD, extent and direction of subluxation/dislocation, and presence of OCD. Difference in prevalence of OCD in patients with RHS versus RHD was calculated using the Fisher exact test.

Results. 162 instances of RHS/RHD were found in 134 patients. Etiologies were: congenital/developmental (99), post traumatic (31), chronic of uncertain etiology (4). 42 RHS, 118 RHD, and 2 unknown status post radial head excision. 14/162 (6%) cases had capitellar OCD. Etiology was congenital/developmental in 8/14 (57%), post traumatic in 6/14 (43%). Relative prevalence of OCD in RHS (13/42 = 31%) and RHD (0/118 = 0%) was statiscally significant (p < 0.0001). In 1 case, position of the radial head was unknown since imaging was following radial head resection.

Discussion and conclusions. Capitellar OCD is common in patients with chronic RHS and the prevalence is significantly greater than with RHD. This supports abnormal radio-capitellar mechanics as the etiology of OCD in this context.

### Prevalence of capitellar osteochondritis dissecans in children with chronic radial head subluxation and dislocation [^112S3iAU]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

An abnormal radiocapitellar articulation may play a role in the development of capitellar osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of capitellar OCD in pediatric patients with chronic radial head subluxation (RHS) or radial head dislocation (RHD).

Materials and Methods

We searched the radiology reports generated at a large pediatric hospital between 2004 and 2012, to identify patients 8–18 years old with chronic RHS or RHD. Patients with underlying bony abnormalities that could obscure, be confused with, or increase the risk of OCD of the elbow were excluded. Two pediatric radiologists assessed images of the elbow, grading radiocapitellar alignment as follows: normal, subluxed, dislocated, or intermittently subluxed and dislocated. Readers also reviewed images to detect capitellar OCD. The differences in the prevalence of OCD noted in elbows in each category of radiocapitellar alignment were assessed.

Results

A total of 118 cases of chronic RHS, RHD, or both were detected in 100 patients. The radiocapitellar alignment of these cases was defined as follows: 53–58% were dislocated, 26–31% were subluxed, 14–15% were intermittently subluxed and dislocated, and less than 1% had normal alignment. There were 14 cases of capitellar OCD (11.9%). One elbow with OCD was categorized by both readers as dislocated, with the remaining 13 elbows (93%) deemed by the two readers to be either subluxed or intermittently subluxed and dislocated. The percentage of elbows with RHS that were found to have capitellar OCD was 32.3–33.3%, compared with 1.4–1.6% of elbows with RHD.

Conclusion

The prevalence of capitellar OCD is greater in elbows with RHS than in those with RHD. This finding suggests that abnormal radiocapitellar mechanics are a factor in the development of OCD. In children with RHS and new or worsening pain, capitellar OCD should be considered, and imaging strategies should be directed toward early identification of this important and treatable condition.

### Radial head incarceration after closed reduction of a pediatric elbow dislocation with a radial neck fracture: a case report [^111yab3d]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this case provides insight into the complications that can arise after attempted closed reduction of an elbow dislocation associated with radial neck fracture and the subsequent management of the displaced radial head. Multiple attempts at closed reduction may further traumatize the elbow and increase the risk of postoperative complications, especially with an increasing degree of displacement; therefore, open reduction and pinning provide an appealing alternative treatment with good postoperative functional outcome in this presented case. It is important to closely scrutinize the radial neck in posterior elbow dislocations before reduction. It may be prudent to reduce elbow dislocations with radial neck fractures in the operating room to address radial head displacement and entrapment urgently, if this complication arises.

### Surgical management of pediatric radial neck fractures [^115jW9HG]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Management of pediatric radial neck fractures is controversial regarding acceptable alignment, variable reduction techniques, and suboptimal outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess the characteristics, management, and results in a surgical cohort, in efforts to identify prognostic factors and offer treatment suggestions. It was hypothesized that less invasive reduction maneuvers would precede open reduction and that worse results would correlate with fracture severity, open reduction, and the presence of associated injuries.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of 151 children in whom a radial neck fracture had been surgically treated from 2001 to 2011 was performed. The mean age (and standard deviation) and duration of follow-up were 8.4 ± 2.9 years and 13.3 ± 20.0 months, respectively; 40% of the patients were male. A successful clinical result was defined as elbow flexion of ≥ 120°, flexion contracture of < 20°, forearm rotation of ≥ 90° with ≥ 45° of supination and pronation, and no complications.

Results

An isolated radial neck fracture occurred in 54% of the children. The mean angulation and displacement improved from 43° ± 19° and 37% ± 35%, respectively, before treatment to 13° ± 7° and 0.9% ± 4% after treatment (p < 0.001). Twenty-two procedural combinations were used to treat these patients, and 67% of the open reductions were not preceded by percutaneous or closed reduction attempts. Among 131 patients with adequate follow-up, 31% had an unsuccessful outcome. An age of ten years or more (odds ratio [OR] = 5.85, p = 0.001), a time to surgery of two days or less (OR = 4.73, p = 0.02), and greater fracture displacement (OR = 1.25 per 10%, p = 0.001) were independent predictors of unsuccessful outcomes. Increased fracture severity and open reduction were associated with poor results, although the presence of concomitant injuries was not. It is predicted that closed manipulation will fail for half of fractures angulated ≥ 36°, and that half of fractures displaced ≥ 65% will require open reduction. The predicted frequency of unsuccessful outcomes is 50% with 76% displacement.

Conclusions

There continues to be great variation in the approach to treatment of displaced radial neck fractures in children. Suboptimal results occurred in 31% of the patients in this series, with worse results in patients older than ten years, who had increased fracture severity, and who underwent open reduction. Less invasive reduction methods should precede open reduction whenever possible.

### Sonographic finding of a pulled elbow: the "hook sign" [^115boHwX]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Point-of-care ultrasound has become a useful clinical adjunct, especially in emergency medicine, because it is noninvasive, repeatable, and nonradiating. In cases of pulled elbow also known as nursemaid's elbow or radial head subluxation, diagnosis is usually performed clinically. However, there is the potential for a failed reduction or misdiagnosis. We introduce a potentially useful diagnostic finding for pulled elbow ("Hook sign") using point-of-care ultrasound in the emergency department.

### Progressive unilateral arm weakness in a 7-year-old boy [^1148T47j]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

A child with joint or extremity pain is a common presentation to the emergency department. Often, there is some element to the patient's history, whether it is trauma or some other significant history, which leads to a likely diagnosis. When there is a history of fever and progressive arm weakness, an astute emergency physician would have heightened awareness of a possible systemic process. We describe a case of unilateral shoulder pain with associated fever in a 7-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with progressive arm weakness to the same side.

### Persistent posterior interosseous nerve palsy associated with a chronic type I monteggia fracture-dislocation in a child: a case report and review of the literature [^113cAxHz]. Hand (2009). Low credibility.

We present a rare case of persistent complete posterior interosseous nerve palsy associated with a chronic type I Monteggia elbow fracture-dislocation consisting of anterior dislocation of the radial head and malunion of the ulna in an 8-year-old child requiring surgical treatment. Posterior interosseous nerve neuropraxia following acute Monteggia injury patterns about the elbow has been described and is thought to be secondary to traction or direct trauma. The condition typically resolves following successful closed reduction of the radial head. This report describes combined treatment of the nerve and skeletal injury for the chronic type I Monteggia injury. The literature is reviewed, and diagnostic challenges with and treatment options for chronic Monteggia fracture-dislocations in children are discussed.

At follow-up, the carrying angle in full elbow extension and the range of motion (ROM) of the elbow and forearm were measured bilaterally. We recorded clinical results as good, fair, or poor according to the range of movement (pronation, supination, flexion, extension) and the presence of pain as per the Steinberg and Rodriguez-Merchan classification. We also evaluated any change in the carrying angle and axial deformity.

Flexion and extension of the elbow, pronation and supination of the forearm, and the valgus angle of the extended elbow were measured using a goniometer. The uninjured elbows served as controls.

Radiographic evaluation documented the size of the radial head, presence of avascular necrosis, premature physeal closure and cubitus valgus. The final follow-up radiographs included standard antero-posterior and lateral radiographs of both elbows.

Statistics

Descriptive statistics were used for the variables of our group. The paired Student t test was used to analyze the differences between the normal elbow and the injured elbow when the data were parametric, and the Pearson correlation was used to correlate the results with the collected data. Outcome data for each group are presented as the mean and SD, and the mean difference between groups and the 95% confidence interval are provided. A P value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using a GraphPad prism 5 computer program.

Surgical Technique of Open Reduction

The anconeus-extensor carpi ulnaris interval was used to expose the orbicular ligament. The radial head was gently repositioned and interposed capsular or ligamentous structures that blocked reduction were removed. Rotation can be judged by the fit of the fragments at surgery especially if there was a Salter 2 type fragment. We usually check by fluoroscopy the reduction obtained (in all cases no residual angulation or translation was observed).

The head fragment was stable after reduction and internal fixation was not performed.

Reduction was maintained by cast immobilization in 90-degree elbow flexion and about 45 degrees of pronation for 4 to 5 weeks.
