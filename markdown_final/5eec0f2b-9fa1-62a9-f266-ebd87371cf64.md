## Question

Ferritin level elevated

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage an elevated serum ferritin level. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should verify the magnitude of ferritin elevation and what thresholds imply. Next, I will integrate transferrin saturation to separate iron overload from inflammatory or hepatic causes. After that, I need to build a prioritized differential diagnosis and decide on targeted testing. Finally, I will outline management principles by etiology and highlight special scenarios and pitfalls, ensuring I double-check where ferritin can be misleading in inflammation or CKD [^a0fd667b] [^07c4d638].

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and exclude pre-analytical or analytical artifacts, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a false-positive ferritin. I should repeat the ferritin on a fasting morning sample, review concurrent medications and supplements that could raise ferritin or iron indices, and check for recent transfusions, IV iron, or acute illness that could acutely elevate ferritin as an acute-phase reactant, since these can confound interpretation and delay correct diagnosis [^a0fd667b] [^515fb3a1].

> Next, I should review the magnitude of ferritin elevation, because the height of ferritin guides the differential and urgency. Mild elevations, roughly 1–3 times the upper limit of normal, often reflect inflammation, NAFLD, or alcohol use; moderate elevations, around 3–10 times ULN, broaden to include hemochromatosis, chronic liver disease, and malignancy; extreme elevations above 10,000 µg/L are classically linked to HLH/MAS, though I must remember this is not specific in adults and can also be seen with transfusional iron overload, severe liver injury, or renal failure, so I should not jump to conclusions here [^7f30b579] [^bfe2e896] [^57eb408f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should integrate transferrin saturation next because it is the key discriminator. If transferrin saturation is elevated, typically above 45% in men or 40% in women, I should consider hereditary hemochromatosis and proceed to HFE testing, whereas if transferrin saturation is normal or low, iron overload is less likely and I should pivot toward inflammation, liver disease, renal dysfunction, or metabolic causes of hyperferritinemia [^58cfbe93] [^9168f25f] [^5d5f3f0c].

> I will now examine the likely etiologies in a structured way. Let me consider iron overload first: HFE hemochromatosis is common in patients of Northern European ancestry with elevated ferritin and transferrin saturation, and guidelines support HFE testing in this context; I should also remember that ferritin above 1,000 µg/L in C282Y homozygotes signals higher risk of advanced fibrosis and may warrant liver biopsy or MRI for fibrosis staging, while ferritin below 1,000 µg/L with normal enzymes carries low fibrosis risk and can often proceed to phlebotomy without biopsy [^85106541] [^9168f25f] [^0281f098] [^55cb8bb0].

> Wait, let me verify the role of liver disease and metabolic dysfunction. NAFLD and alcoholic liver disease are frequent causes of modest ferritin elevation, and ferritin can be an acute-phase reactant in hepatitis; in these settings, ferritin elevation does not reliably indicate increased iron stores, so I should correlate with transferrin saturation, liver enzymes, and clinical context, and consider MRI for hepatic iron quantification if iron overload remains suspected after excluding secondary causes [^361c0486] [^7a579ac5] [^90052cea].

> I need to check for inflammatory and hematologic causes next. Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, so chronic inflammatory conditions, infections, and malignancies can raise ferritin independent of iron status; in adults, marked hyperferritinemia is not specific for HLH, though ferritin above 10,000 µg/L is concerning and should trigger evaluation for HLH/MAS when accompanied by fever, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypofibrinogenemia, with expert hematology input and consideration of bone marrow or targeted biomarkers like soluble IL-2 receptor [^a0fd667b] [^fc6014e6] [^a6901007].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD or is perioperative? I should double-check for functional iron deficiency, where ferritin can be normal or high despite depleted stores due to inflammation; in CKD and inflammatory states, transferrin saturation below 20% with ferritin above 100 µg/L supports functional iron deficiency and a role for iron therapy, and in preoperative patients, ferritin 30–100 µg/L with low transferrin saturation may indicate iron-restricted erythropoiesis that could benefit from iron repletion [^07c4d638] [^41431d6b] [^97b23988].

> Let me consider special syndromes and pediatric contexts. Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome presents with early-onset cataracts and isolated ferritin elevation due to a ferritin light-chain mutation; recognizing this avoids unnecessary invasive workups. In pediatrics, extreme ferritin elevations can signal HLH/MAS, but I should confirm with clinical criteria and remember that KD and sJIA can both feature very high ferritin, complicating differentiation and requiring integrated cytokine profiles and clinical evolution [^a3c8f14f] [^bfe2e896] [^61d1047e].

> Next, I should review targeted diagnostic testing based on the working diagnosis. If hemochromatosis is suspected, I will order HFE C282Y and H63D testing and, if positive with ferritin above 1,000 µg/L or elevated liver enzymes, assess fibrosis with MRI or consider liver biopsy. If HLH/MAS is suspected, I will obtain CBC, triglycerides, fibrinogen, soluble IL-2 receptor, and consider bone marrow. If liver disease is suspected, I will check AST/ALT, ALP, GGT, and consider liver imaging. If CKD or inflammation is present, I will assess CRP and use transferrin saturation to guide iron therapy decisions [^9168f25f] [^90052cea] [^fc6014e6] [^07c4d638].

> I should confirm management principles by etiology. For HFE hemochromatosis, therapeutic phlebotomy to a ferritin target of 50–100 µg/L is standard, with avoidance of vitamin C and iron supplements; for metabolic hyperferritinemia, lifestyle modification and treatment of metabolic risk factors are first-line, with consideration of iron reduction only in select cases; for HLH/MAS, urgent immunomodulatory therapy and treatment of the trigger are critical; for functional iron deficiency in CKD or inflammatory states, IV iron is often preferred when transferrin saturation is low despite elevated ferritin; and for extreme hyperferritinemia from transfusional iron, chelation may be indicated [^a5431ea7] [^2bf0684a] [^07c4d638] [^361c0486].

> Hold on, I should verify pitfalls and ensure I do not misclassify. Ferritin can be normal or elevated in true iron deficiency when inflammation is present, so a normal ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency; conversely, ferritin above 100 µg/L makes absolute iron deficiency unlikely in many settings, though exceptions exist in CKD and inflammatory disease; thus, transferrin saturation, CRP, and clinical context are essential to avoid both under- and over-diagnosis of iron deficiency or overload [^a0fd667b] [^07c4d638] [^d293ab36].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: confirm the ferritin abnormality, quantify the elevation, integrate transferrin saturation to separate iron overload from inflammatory causes, construct a prioritized differential, and pursue targeted testing and etiology-specific management; I should remain vigilant for special syndromes and remember that ferritin is a dual-purpose biomarker reflecting both iron stores and inflammation, which is why careful clinical correlation is indispensable to avoid misinterpretation and delays in appropriate care [^e0f70a82] [^a0fd667b] [^58cfbe93].

An elevated ferritin level reflects **increased iron stores** or **inflammation** [^a0fd667b], not iron overload alone [^5d5f3f0c]. The most common causes are **iron overload** (hereditary hemochromatosis, transfusions) [^5d5f3f0c], **chronic inflammation** (infection, autoimmune disease, malignancy) [^8f9c443f], and **liver disease** (NAFLD, alcoholic liver disease) [^7a579ac5]. Evaluate with **transferrin saturation** [^58cfbe93], **CBC**, **LFTs**, **CRP/ESR**, and **HFE testing** if indicated [^9168f25f]. Management targets the underlying cause: phlebotomy for iron overload [^a5431ea7], treat inflammation or infection, and address liver disease; extreme ferritin (> 10,000 µg/L) warrants urgent evaluation for HLH/MAS or other hyperinflammatory states [^bfe2e896] [^fc6014e6].

## Physiological role of ferritin

Ferritin is the **primary intracellular iron storage protein** [^a0fd667b], maintaining iron in a soluble, non-toxic form and releasing it as needed. Serum ferritin reflects iron stores but also rises with inflammation, making it an **acute-phase reactant** [^29a74b18].

---

## Common causes of elevated ferritin levels

| **Category** | **Specific conditions** |
|-|-|
| Iron overload | - Hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE-related) [^5d5f3f0c] <br/> - Transfusional iron overload (repeated transfusions) [^7f30b579] <br/> - Iron-loading anemias (e.g. thalassemia) [^notfound] |
| Chronic inflammation | - Infections (tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B/C) [^notfound] <br/> - Autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, SLE) [^76c12c79] <br/> - Malignancies (lymphoma, leukemia, solid tumors) [^7f30b579] |
| Liver disease | - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [^7a579ac5] <br/> - Alcoholic liver disease [^361c0486] <br/> - Chronic hepatitis B/C [^notfound] |
| Metabolic syndrome | - Obesity <br/> - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Dyslipidemia [^2fd47fa7] |
| Hyperinflammatory syndromes | - Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) [^fc6014e6] <br/> - Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) [^51e0e88c] <br/> - Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) [^c3a6400f] |
| Other causes | - Renal failure [^7f30b579] <br/> - Hyperthyroidism [^76c12c79] <br/> - Alcohol consumption [^5d5f3f0c] <br/> - Supplements (iron, vitamin C) [^a5431ea7] |

## Clinical evaluation of elevated ferritin

### Initial laboratory tests

- **Transferrin saturation (TS)**: Helps distinguish iron overload (TS > 45%) from inflammation [^58cfbe93].
- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Assess for anemia, cytopenias, or macrocytosis [^f4ad26bf].
- **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: Evaluate hepatic injury or disease [^edfdb197].
- **C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)**: Assess inflammation [^58ccfb16].
- **HFE gene testing**: Indicated if TS is elevated or hereditary hemochromatosis is suspected [^9168f25f].

---

### Additional investigations

Additional investigations include **MRI** to quantify hepatic iron noninvasively when iron overload is suspected [^90052cea] and, selectively, **liver biopsy** to assess fibrosis or iron deposition when indicated [^a8c14a66]. Evaluate for infection, autoimmunity, or malignancy when clinically suspected [^8f9c443f].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

- **Iron overload**: Elevated ferritin with high TS indicates increased iron stores, risking organ damage (liver, heart, endocrine glands) [^5d5f3f0c].
- **Inflammation**: Elevated ferritin with normal/low TS suggests inflammation, infection, or malignancy [^8f9c443f].
- **Liver disease**: Persistent ferritin elevation in NAFLD or alcoholic liver disease indicates ongoing hepatic injury and fibrosis risk [^7a579ac5].
- **Hyperinflammatory syndromes**: Extreme ferritin (> 10,000 µg/L) is highly suggestive of HLH/MAS or other cytokine storm syndromes [^bfe2e896] [^fc6014e6].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Iron overload**: Therapeutic phlebotomy to reduce iron stores; target ferritin 50–100 µg/L [^a5431ea7].
- **Chronic inflammation**: Treat the underlying inflammatory condition or infection [^notfound].
- **Liver disease**: Address lifestyle factors, manage metabolic syndrome, and treat liver disease [^notfound].
- **Hyperinflammatory syndromes**: Urgent immunosuppressive therapy and supportive care are required [^fc6014e6].

---

## Prognostic implications

Elevated ferritin is associated with worse outcomes in chronic liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy. Extreme hyperferritinemia signals **high mortality** and mandates rapid evaluation and treatment [^e51b53ef] [^bfe2e896].

---

An elevated ferritin level signals increased iron stores or inflammation and requires a structured evaluation to determine the cause. Management should target the **underlying etiology**, with extreme elevations prompting urgent assessment for hyperinflammatory syndromes.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^e0f70a82]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. Whilst low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can be due to multiple different aetiologies, including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. The investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis is not dealt with however and is the subject of a separate guideline.

### Perturbed iron biology in the prefrontal cortex of people with schizophrenia [^12f7d41e]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

To probe if differential patterns of iron-dependent ferritin accumulation affected disease risk, we performed a series of logistic regression analyses using sequential iron cutoffs, each examining the OR of a schizophrenia diagnosis attributed to a 1 SD increase in covariate-adjusted ferritin (Figure S12b, Table S38). As the OR was farthest from 1 when the analysis included only individuals with iron levels below the control group's mean (Fig. 3b), this value was selected as a cutoff for generating low-iron and high-iron subcohorts. While in the low-iron cohort the probability of having been diagnosed with schizophrenia markedly decreased as PFC ferritin rose (OR = 0.284 [95%CI 0.139 to 0.578]), in the high-iron subcohort ferritin did not predict an individual's disease status (Fig. 3c, Table S39). Mirroring the prediction models, the difference in covariate-adjusted ferritin between cases and controls was large in the low-iron subcohort (−0.96 [95%CI −1.46 to −0.47] SDs), yet minimal (-0.17 [95%CI ‒0.67 to 0.33] SDs) in the high-iron subcohort (Fig. 3d, Table S40). Extending our previous findings indicating that elevated iron in young adulthood predicted disease status, these data reveal that even in the context of low prefrontal iron, a deficiency in iron's protective storage protein markedly increased the risk for a schizophrenia diagnosis.

### A case of incomplete Kawasaki disease with extremely high serum ferritin and interleukin-18 levels [^8306dd07]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, patients with sJIA generally have high serum IL-18 and ferritin levels. This was a case of incomplete KD with extremely high serum levels of IL-18 and ferritin, although KD patients with coronary artery lesions have been reported to have mild IL-18 elevations. Serum cytokines and ferritin are often used for the differential diagnosis of KD and sJIA. However, we should need to recognize the existence of KD in patients with high serum IL-18 and ferritin levels. Further studies are needed about the novel biomarkers to clearly distinguish sJIA from KD at an early phase of the disease progression.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^86756324]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relationship to other clinical parameters including the patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine, and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### The unique aspects of presentation and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in adults [^0bac5077]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was initially described as an inflammatory condition affecting young children but is increasingly diagnosed in adults. Presenting features such as fever, cytopenias, phagocytosis, elevated ferritin, and increased levels of soluble IL-2 receptor are common in both age groups, but the prevalence of several clinical and biochemical criteria differ between pediatric and adult patients. Specifically, an elevated ferritin level does not have the same specificity for HLH in adults, and many other inflammatory conditions need to be considered in the differential. In contrast to the high incidence of infectious triggers seen in pediatric HLH, HLH in adults is often precipitated by a hematologic malignancy. Malignancy-associated HLH has unique manifestations and a uniformly very poor prognosis. Given these differences, diagnostic scoring systems unique to adult HLH have been proposed, and additional prognostic clinical and immunologic parameters are being explored. Although a genetic predisposition is increasingly found to underlie cases of adult-onset HLH, the mutations are less likely to be bi-allelic and differ slightly from those seen in pediatric cases of familial HLH. The facilitating genetic and environmental factors governing presentation of HLH in adults remain elusive. Understanding the clinical aspects and pathophysiology specific to adults with HLH is necessary to tailor therapies derived in pediatric disease to this under-recognized population.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^07c4d638]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using a transferrin saturation < 20% and a normal or elevated ferritin level to define functional iron deficiency in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD or maintained on peritoneal dialysis and in those receiving hemodialysis. Recognize that normal or high serum ferritin values do not exclude iron deficiency, as it could be due to other causes such as infection or inflammation.

Ferritin interpretation and inflammation in chronic kidney disease — "Ferritin levels need to be interpreted with caution in patients who may have an underlying inflammatory condition", and "in the absence of a clinically evident infectious or inflammatory process, assessment of CRP may suggest the presence of an occult inflammatory state that may be associated with an elevated ferritin level and ESA-hyporesponsiveness".

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^82eb6e84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^76c12c79]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, increased serum ferritin can be caused by hereditary hemochromatosis, iron poisoning, hyperthyroidism, hemosiderosis, adult-onset Still's disease, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, acute promyelocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, acute starvation, ceruloplasmin deficiency, hepatocellular injury, acute phase reaction and rheumatoid arthritis.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with down syndrome [^7a2bd36f]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Down syndrome — ferritin interpretation and sleep problems indicates serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and is not useful if inflammation is present or CRP is elevated, prompting possible evaluation with iron concentration and TIBC; low ferritin is associated with sleep problems and iron deficiency may be considered in differentials for sleep difficulty, and a physician may prescribe iron supplementation for children with sleep problems when ferritin concentration is < 50 μg/L.

### Serum ferritin is derived primarily from macrophages through a nonclassical secretory pathway [^29a74b18]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

The serum ferritin concentration is a clinical parameter measured widely for the differential diagnosis of anemia. Its levels increase with elevations of tissue iron stores and with inflammation, but studies on cellular sources of serum ferritin as well as its subunit composition, degree of iron loading and glycosylation have given rise to conflicting results. To gain further understanding of serum ferritin, we have used traditional and modern methodologies to characterize mouse serum ferritin. We find that both splenic macrophages and proximal tubule cells of the kidney are possible cellular sources for serum ferritin and that serum ferritin is secreted by cells rather than being the product of a cytosolic leak from damaged cells. Mouse serum ferritin is composed mostly of L-subunits, whereas it contains few H-subunits and iron content is low. L-subunits of serum ferritin are frequently truncated at the C-terminus, giving rise to a characteristic 17-kD band that has been previously observed in lysosomal ferritin. Taken together with the fact that mouse serum ferritin is not detectably glycosylated, we propose that mouse serum ferritin is secreted through the nonclassical lysosomal secretory pathway.

### Anemia in older adults [^f4ad26bf]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Clinical manifestations but not cytokine profiles differentiate adult-onset Still's disease and sepsis [^487f1edc]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze clinical manifestations, serum ferritin, and serum cytokine levels in patients with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) or bacterial sepsis and to evaluate their potential use for differential diagnosis.

Methods

Twenty-two consecutive patients with the first flare of AOSD and 6 patients with an established diagnosis of AOSD under immunosuppressive therapy were compared with 14 patients with bacterial sepsis. Clinical manifestations were scored in a Pouchot AOSD activity score including elevated serum ferritin levels to obtain a modified Pouchot score. Serum cytokine profiles were analyzed from each patient.

Results

The scores of clinical manifestations using a modified Pouchot activity score were significantly higher in patients with active untreated AOSD (mean 5.60 ± 1.93) compared with patients with chronic AOSD (mean 1.16 ± 0.98; p < 0.001) and patients with sepsis (mean 2.38 ± 1.19; p < 0.001). A modified Pouchot score ≥ 4 shows a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 93% for active AOSD. Serum cytokine levels of interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and calprotectin were elevated in acute AOSD and sepsis. Significant differences were detected only in patients with sepsis who had higher levels of IL-6 and IL-8. The overlap of the 2 groups limits the use of cytokines for differential diagnosis in individual patients.

Conclusion

A modified Pouchot AOSD activity score including elevated serum ferritin levels was more useful to confirm the diagnosis of AOSD compared to patients with sepsis. Elevated serum cytokines correlate with inflammation but are of limited use to differentiate between active AOSD and bacterial sepsis.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^5f7de556]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How is the choice of guideline-recommended cutoffs for ferritin associated with the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses in primary care?

Findings

In this cohort study of 255 351 adult primary care patients, ferritin cutoffs of 15, 30, and 45 ng/mL were associated with incidences of iron deficiency diagnoses of 10.9, 29.9, and 48.3 cases per 1000 patient-years, respectively.

Meaning

The results of this study provide useful components for the evaluation of ferritin testing in high-resource primary care settings and call for harmonization of guidelines for iron deficiency.

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^ab7f58a9]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, the serum ferritin is the most able to discriminate iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories will lead to underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women will have no marrow iron stores, so basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest the body physiologic ferritin "cutoff" is 50ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing a readily treatable disorder.

### A case of incomplete Kawasaki disease with extremely high serum ferritin and interleukin-18 levels [^61d1047e]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical features and laboratory parameters of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) occasionally overlap. Therefore, serum levels of cytokine and ferritin are used as markers to distinguish between KD and sJIA. KD patients have a high level of interleukin (IL)-6, low level of IL-18, and no elevation of the level of serum ferritin. Conversely, sJIA patients have a low level of IL-6 and high levels of IL-18 and ferritin in the serum. However, to the best of our knowledge, no case report of KD with a low serum level of IL-6 and extremely high levels of IL-18 and ferritin is found.

Case Presentation

A 6-year-old boy presented with a history of fever for 9days and a rash that appeared 7days from the onset. He was diagnosed with incomplete KD because of fever, skin rash, oral cavity erythematous changes, and erythema and edema of the hands with laboratory findings of serum albumin level < 3.0g/dL, elevated alanine aminotransferase level and leukocyturia. Intravenous immunoglobulin and prednisolone and oral aspirin were introduced on the 10th day. Fever subsided 1day after initiating the treatment, but arthritis of both knees appeared in addition to hepatosplenomegaly. We suspected sJIA, as the serum level of ferritin was 19,740ng/mL, IL-6 was < 3pg/mL, and IL-18 was 132,000pg/mL. Skin desquamation of the fingertips was observed 18days from the onset; thus, he was finally diagnosed with incomplete KD with arthritis. At 32days from the onset, we stopped the prednisolone therapy and no symptoms of relapse were observed afterwards. In the follow-up at 16months from the onset, he had neither signs of active joint or skin involvement, nor cardiac involvement.

Conclusions

Although patients with sJIA generally have high serum levels of IL-18 and ferritin, this was a case of incomplete KD with extremely high serum levels of IL-18 and ferritin. Serum cytokine and ferritin are often used for the differential diagnosis of KD and sJIA. We need to recognize the existence of KD with high serum levels of IL-18 and ferritin.

Elevated ferritin and HFE mutations — mildly elevated serum ferritin is common in patients with NAFLD and it does not necessarily indicate increased iron stores; persistently high serum ferritin and increased iron saturation, especially in the context of homozygote or heterozygote C282Y HFE mutations may warrant a liver biopsy (Strength – 1, Evidence - B).

Rationale.

A variety of laboratory investigations may aid in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. Some markers may predict disease severity and progression to ARDS, thromboembolic complications, or multi-organ failure. The U.S. NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelines suggest performing the following laboratory tests as part of the initial evaluation of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 disease: a complete blood count with differential, metabolic profile, and liver and renal function tests. It also advises measuring the levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), D -dimer, and ferritin for their prognostic values, though not part of the standard care. The WHO interim guidelines on the management of COVID-19 disease (May 27, 2020, September 11, 2020) however do not provide guidance on specific laboratory testing in COVID-19 patients. This section attempts to address this discrepancy with a focus on resource-constrained LMIC settings.

Search results.

MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched through the end of September 2020. The search used combinations of MeSH terms and free-text words, including "COVID–19", "coronavirus", "SARS–CoV–2", and "laboratory findings" or "laboratory abnormalities". Few of the studies originated from LMICs. The search identified two useful systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The search, did not identify any randomized clinical studies.

Evidence.

Hematology.

Lymphopenia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and low hemoglobin predict progression toward severe COVID-19. White blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts are higher, and lymphocyte counts and hemoglobin are lower in patients who die. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was one of the independent predictive factors for critical illness at hospital admission. Eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe and non-severe COVID-19. Blood cell counts may be a useful diagnostic aid in patients with a suggestive history and imaging for COVID-19 but who test negative by RT-PCR. –

Nonspecific tests of immunologic inflammation — routine laboratory tests such as complete blood cell count with differential, sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and other acute-phase reactants are useful in determining the inflammatory consequences of innate immunity, and functional assays of neutrophils and macrophages may be necessary to pinpoint inflammatory responses (B); functional assays of macrophages and neutrophils may indicate either impaired defense or uncontrolled inflammatory responses (ie, the macrophage activation syndrome), neutrophil and macrophage function tests may only be available in specialized medical centers, and high ferritin levels associated with the macrophage activation syndrome can be used to monitor treatment of this disorder.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia, more specifically with respect to MRI, MHF-CG 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a noninvasive estimation of iron concentration in the liver by MRI in the context of a clinical trial, given the initial evidence that serum levels of ferritin might be associated with iron accumulation in tissue in patients with stable metabolic hyperferritinemia. Consider obtaining it in patients with high serum levels of ferritin (grade 2, but in particular, grade 3) and/or additional clinical risk factors for iron overload. Prefer iron concentration in tissues over serum ferritin levels, when available, for grading metabolic hyperferritinemia.

NCCN Neuroblastoma — additional workup: The NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel recommends that all patients undergo an H&P with special attention to abdominal and neurologic examinations, and any family history of neuroblastoma or other childhood cancers should be noted. Several laboratory tests are considered essential as part of the workup for neuroblastoma, including a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel; urine catecholamine levels — homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) — are elevated in the majority of patients, and analysis of urine HVA and VMA is required for diagnosis only if bone marrow is the only diagnostic tissue obtained. In selected cases, clinicians may consider obtaining the prothrombin (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) if the liver is involved or bleeding is a concern; pregnancy tests should be done for all patients of childbearing potential, and referral to fertility specialists should be made for patients with high-risk disease to discuss fertility preservation. Analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin levels can be considered in select cases, and high levels of LDH and ferritin in patients with neuroblastoma have been associated with worse prognosis.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^5d5f3f0c]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — serum ferritin interpretation and predictive thresholds include the following: in a study of individuals < 35 years of age, serum ferritin in the normal range in combination with a TS < 45% had a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload; in a California primary care population, a serum ferritin > 250 μg/L in men and > 200 μg/L in women was positive in 77% and 56% of C282Y homozygotes; and in the HEIRS screening study of 99,711 North American participants, serum ferritin levels were elevated (> 300 μg/L in men, > 200 μg/L in women) in 57% of female and 88% of male C282Y homozygotes. Ferritin can be elevated in the absence of increased iron stores, and in the general population, iron overload is not the most common cause of an elevated ferritin level; in most circumstances, serum ferritin provides additional confirmation of the significance of an elevated TS in C282Y homozygotes, and an elevated ferritin with a normal TS may occur particularly in non–HFE-related iron overload or in a C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^d293ab36]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Ferritin, fever, and frequent visits: hyperferritinemic syndromes in the emergency department [^95326031]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is defined as persistent fevers without an identifiable cause despite extensive medical workup. Emergency physicians caring for patients reporting a persistent, nonspecific, febrile illness should carefully consider potentially serious non-infectious causes of FUO. We present a case of a 35-year-old man who presented to the emergency department (ED) three times over a 10-day period for persistent febrile illness and was ultimately diagnosed with Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD) after a serum ferritin level was found to be over 42,000 μg/L. AOSD, along with macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock comprise the four hyperferritinemic syndromes. These are potentially life-threatening febrile illnesses that characteristically present with elevated ferritin levels. In this article, we highlight the value of a serum ferritin level in the workup of a patient with prolonged febrile illness and its utility in facilitating early diagnosis and prompt treatment of hyperferritinemic syndromes in the ED.

### Early detection of type 1 haemochromatosis: a case of normal ferritin levels with elevated transferrin saturation [^bbbc53cd]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Haemochromatosis is marked by excessive iron accumulation leading to damage to various organs. Although haemochromatosis dates to 1865, diagnosing the condition remains challenging due to its non-specific symptoms and due to its quiescent course, it often leads to significant delay in recognition. A woman in her 50s who presented with arthralgia was found to have raised transferrin saturation with normal ferritin. She underwent human homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE) genetic screening test which showed H63D type 1 haemochromatosis. This report aims to draw attention to the pitfalls in diagnosing haemochromatosis as normal ferritin does not exclude hereditary haemochromatosis.

### The role of liver biopsy in the workup of liver dysfunction late after SCT: is the role of iron overload underestimated? [^da37f813]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in liver function tests are common in hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) recipients. We retrospectively investigated the role of liver biopsy in determining the cause of elevated liver enzymes and its impact on the management of patients in the post-HSCT setting. A total of 24 consecutive liver biopsies were obtained from 20 patients from September 2003 to December 2007. A definite histopathologic diagnosis was obtained in 91.7% of the biopsies. Iron overload (IO) was found in 75% and GVHD in 54.2% of the patients. The initial clinical diagnosis of GVHD was confirmed in 56.5% and refuted in 43.5% of the allogeneic HSCT recipients. The median number of post transplant transfusions, percent transferrin saturation and ferritin levels were found to be higher in patients who had histologically proven hepatic IO (p1 = 0.007, p2 = 0.003 and p3 = 0.009, respectively). Regression analysis showed a significant correlation between serum ferritin levels and histological grade of iron in the hepatocytes. Our data suggest that hepatic IO is a frequent finding in the post-HSCT setting, which contributes to hepatic dysfunction and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis, particularly in patients with high serum ferritin levels.

Introduction: Hyperferritinemia is a key biomarker in the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of life-threatening cytokine storms, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and hyperinflammatory conditions, as Still's disease (SD). However, marked ferritin elevation may also be caused by a wide variety of other complex pediatric conditions, which differential is essential in clinical care.

Objectives: To investigate the underlying etiology of markedly elevated ferritin levels in a tertiary-level pediatric center

Methods: Data of patients evaluated in our center from 2020 to 2024 with at least 1 value greater than 1000 ng/ml were retrospectively reviewed. For each episode of hyperferritinemia, the highest value of serum ferritin available was selected and concomitant other laboratory parameters were collected, together with demographic data, diagnosis and outcomes.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Methods: The dominant clinical and laboratory finding is hyperinflammation (expressed by the elevation of CRP, serum amyloid A, ferritin…), which after excluding infectious, metabolic and paraneoplastic causes, leads to the indication of genetic testing focused on autoinflammatory diseases with confirmation of the IFIH1 gene mutation: NM_022168.4 c.1806A > Tp.E602D. Mutation in this gene is typical for Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome type 7 (AGS7).

Results: Based on the international EULAR/ACR recommendations for the treatment of diseases from the type I interferonopathy spectrum, the patient was treated with a non-selective Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) – baricitinib (dose 4 mg/kg/per day), with a significant effect especially on the neurological condition and thus improving the patient's quality of life.

Conclusion: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) belongs to the spectrum of rare primary immunodeficiencies. In the context of differential diagnosis, it is important to exclude other causes of hyperinflammation. Genetic testing is essential for the final diagnosis.

Despite the severity of the disease, early confirmation of the diagnosis and targeted treatment leads to an improvement in neurological symptomatology and the management of often fatal hyperinflammation. Consent to published had been obtained.

Differential diagnosis mainly includes the classic (HFE) and nonclassic (TfR2, HAMP, HJV and FPN1) forms of HH, all characterized by early and progressive increase of TS followed by elevation of serum ferritin as iron accumulation increases in parenchymal cells of the liver, pancreas, heart and other organs (Table 2). As discussed, unlike HH, in FD clinical expressivity is milder.

Abdominal MRI is a useful non-invasive tool to categorize and diagnose the disorder, as it can differentiate patients with FD, characterized by the SSL triad (spleen, spine, liver) iron retention (Figure 5B), from all other forms of HH, including FPN1-HC, associated with liver iron overload but normal spleen and bone marrow iron content (Figure 5D).

### Elevated serum ferritin level with cataract of spectacular morphology: hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome [^a3c8f14f]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome, characterized by high serum ferritin concentration and cataracts in early life, remains a less-known rare disease, with fewer than 100 families reported worldwide. Though benign, high ferritin levels frequently result in misdiagnosis with iron storage disease, and patients can be exposed to unnecessary, even invasive, evaluation and treatment procedures. The presence of cataract together with isolated serum ferritin elevation should alert clinicians to consider this syndrome. We herein present a new family with hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome to increase clinical awareness.

### Highly elevated ferritin levels and the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^bfe2e896]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a potentially lethal condition characterized by a pathologic inflammation. The diagnostic criteria for HLH include fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, abnormal natural killer cell (NK cell) functional assay, elevated soluble IL-2Ralpha level, and elevated ferritin level (> 500 microg/L). Institution of timely therapy in these critically ill patients may be delayed by difficulties establishing the diagnosis. NK cell functional assay and soluble IL-2Ralpha level may require send-out to a specialized lab. However, ferritin level is available on a same-day basis at most institutions. In this study, we examined the utility of quantitative ferritin levels in diagnosing HLH.

Procedure

All patients with ferritin values > 500 microg/L obtained at Texas Children's Hospital between January 10, 2003 and January 10, 2005 were identified. Patient charts were reviewed for ferritin levels and hospital course.

Results

During the study interval, 330 patients had ferritin levels > 500 microg/L. Ten of the 330 patients were diagnosed with HLH. A ferritin level over 10,000 microg/L was 90% sensitive and 96% specific for HLH. Another diagnostic category with significantly elevated ferritin level was illness of unknown cause (n = 10), and only two of these patients were fully evaluated for HLH.

Conclusions

Ferritin levels above 10,000 microg/L appear to be specific and sensitive for HLH. In patients without a significant medical history and a new onset of febrile illness with highly elevated ferritin levels, the diagnosis of HLH should be evaluated.

### Hereditary haemochromatosis discovered after COVID-19 hospitalisation [^84547f22]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

COVID-19 infection and hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) have something in common; the disease course can be monitored with ferritin levels. Throughout the pandemic, physicians have looked for markers to help predict disease severity. Ferritin levels are commonly used to predict and monitor disease severity in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. While ferritin is elevated as part of the acute-phase reaction in response to infection, it can also be elevated due to iron overload. We report a case of undiagnosed, asymptomatic HH that was unveiled after COVID-19 infection via monitoring for resolution of ferritin levels that were found to be extremely elevated during a moderate COVID-19 infection. This diagnosis allowed the patient to initiate phlebotomy treatment before symptoms of HH arose.

Management states "Recommend expert consultation" and prioritizes "Treatment of the underlying T-cell lymphoma with preference for etoposide- and steroid-containing regimens", with the instruction to "Start with HLH-directed therapy if cytopenias preclude standard anti-lymphoma therapy, and then initiate standard anti-lymphoma therapy when cytopenias improve", and notes "Antiviral therapy - See Monoclonal Antibody Therapy and Viral Reactivation (TCLYM-B 3 of 4)". HLH in adults "is often associated with an underlying T-cell lymphoma" and diagnostic workup with prompt initiation of lymphoma treatment "is often required". For diagnosis, "Consider optimized HLH inflammatory (OHI) index [combined elevation of sCD25 (> 3900 U/mL) and ferritin (> 1000 ng/mL)] to simplify the diagnosis of HLH in patients with hematologic malignancies". All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Marked hyperferritinemia does not predict for HLH in the adult population [^57eb408f]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare syndrome of uncontrolled immune activation that has gained increasing attention during the last decade. The diagnosis of HLH is based on a constellation of clinical and laboratory abnormalities, including elevated serum ferritin levels. In the pediatric population, marked hyperferritinemia is specific for HLH. To determine what conditions are associated with profoundly elevated ferritin in the adult population, we performed a retrospective analysis in a large academic health care system. We identified 113 patients with serum ferritin levels higher than 50,000 µg/L. The most frequently observed conditions included renal failure, hepatocellular injury, infections, and hematologic malignancies. Our results suggest that marked hyperferritinemia can be seen in a variety of conditions and is not specific for HLH in adults.

### Determination of an appropriate cut-off value for ferritin in the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^ad6c26d7]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperferritinemia is a hallmark of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). In the HLH-2004 criteria, a ferritin value > 500 µg/L is considered positive. However, this level was not determined based on evidence. We compared 123 patients with HLH and 320 patients with other hyperferritinemic conditions, calculated a receiver-operating characteristic, and determined sensitivity and specificity for different values. At 2,000 µg/L a trade-off is reached with sensitivity at 70% and specificity at 68%. If familial HLH and virus-associated acquired HLH are analyzed separately, sensitivity and specificity are similar for this level. The results may guide a potential modification of the current HLH criteria.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^515fb3a1]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this nationally representative survey study of internal medicine PCPs, we found substantial variation in the management of anemia. Specifically, we found self-reported evidence of both overuse of screening CBCs (76.9% of respondents) and underuse of bidirectional endoscopy in patients with IDA. Certain knowledge gaps also existed in the interpretation of discordant laboratory test results, which may contribute to diagnostic errors. Specifically, 26.5% of respondents misdiagnosed a scenario of IDA as anemia with an alternate cause despite a low transferrin saturation (2%) and a borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL). Several subtle but important nuances in interpretation of these studies may contribute to errors, including the high specificity of a low ferritin level (98% specific for iron deficiency with a ferritin level ≤ 12 ng/mL), the potential for the ferritin level to be normal or elevated in inflammatory states when a patient is iron deficient, and the importance of measuring serum iron level in a fasting state to avoid potential confounders of dietary or supplemental iron. Given the relatively high baseline prevalence of anemia of 5.6% in the US, incorrect interpretation of these laboratory results may lead to a substantial number of missed or delayed diagnoses of IDA and, by extension, potential delays in diagnosis of GI tract malignant neoplasm.

### Diagnostic challenges in pediatric hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^b5d084d6]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of severe immune dysregulation that encompasses a broad range of underlying genetic diseases and infectious triggers. Monogenic conditions, autoimmune diseases, and infections can all drive the phenotype of HLH and associated immune hyperactivation with hypercytokinemia. A diagnosis of HLH usually requires a combination of clinical and laboratory findings; there is no single sensitive and specific diagnostic test, which often leads to "diagnostic dilemmas" and delays in treatment initiation. Ferritin levels, one of the most commonly used screening tests, were collected across a large tertiary care pediatric hospital to identify the positive predictive value for HLH. Herein, we present several cases that illustrate the clinical challenges of confirming an HLH diagnosis. Additionally, we report on the utility of establishing a formal multi-disciplinary group to aid the prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with HLH-like pathophysiologies.

Hemochromatosis (HH) — genetic prevalence and clinical penetrance are characterized by C282Y homozygosity seen in approximately one in 250 Caucasians, with fully expressed disease with end-organ manifestations in fewer than 10% of these individuals, and full clinical manifestations seen approximately one in 2500. The heterozygote genotype (C282Y/wild type) is found in approximately one in 10 individuals and may be associated with elevated serum iron markers, but without associated tissue iron overload or damage. Approximately 75% did not have symptoms and did not exhibit any of the end-stage manifestations of the disease when identified in this way, and in large population screening studies only approximately 70% of C282Y homozygotes are found to have an elevated ferritin level; more men than women have increased ferritin levels.

Diagnosis

The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels, which reflects an increase in hepatic iron content. HH can be further defined genotypically by the familial occurrence of iron overload associated with C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity. Serologic iron markers (TS, ferritin) are widely available, and the majority of patients with HH are now identified while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. There are certain high-risk groups that should be targeted for evaluation, such as those with a family history of HH, those with suspected organ involvement, and those with chance detection of biochemical and/or radiological abnormalities suggestive of the possibility of iron overload. It is generally recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function have iron studies done at some point in their evaluation. The algorithm outlined in Fig. 3 can provide some further direction regarding testing and is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

Fig. 3
An algorithm can provide some further direction regarding testing and treatment for HH. The algorithm is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

The initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin (Table 7). TS is calculated from the ratio of serum iron to total iron-binding capacity. In some laboratories, the total iron-binding capacity is calculated from the sum of the serum iron and the unsaturated iron-binding capacity, whereas in others, it is calculated indirectly from the transferrin concentration in the serum. A recent study, using fasting samples, has shown no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes. Accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Over the years, different studies have used a variety of cutoff values for TS to identify patients eligible for further testing. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values. Thus, using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, and these cases will require further evaluation.

### Interpretation of ferritin concentrations in the dermatology clinic [^ce25c402]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ferritin measurement is a common laboratory test in dermatology. Ferritin is a marker of iron storage in the human body but can also be -elevated in inflammatory states. Therefore, changes in ferritin are nonspecific, and correlation of specific clinical findings and risk factors with ferritin concentration and other biomarkers, e.g. iron studies or C-reactive protein tests, is recommended. This article discusses iron metabolism and the indications for ferritin measurement in dermatology and how to interpret the laboratory results.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^3a9c6eef]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Extreme hyperferritinemia: causes and impact on diagnostic reasoning [^7f30c579]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hyperferritinemia can be a result of inflammation, infection, chronic iron overload, or other uncommon pathologies including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). There is a historical association between extreme hyperferritinemia and HLH, but in reality HLH is associated with a minority of hyperferritinemic states.

Methods

We identified conditions most associated with hyperferritinemia by identifying 65,536 serum ferritin levels at the University of Minnesota Hospital over a five-year period, with 86 values higher than 10,000ng/mL. Pediatric patients comprised 22% of this population, and adults, 78%.

Results

The majority of cases in both populations with hyperferritinemia were due to chronic transfusion (35%), followed by liver disease (27%), and hematologic malignancy (16%). Solid malignancies, infection, macrophage activation syndrome, and primary and secondary HLH comprised the remaining (22%).

Conclusions

Although this supports the relationship between extreme hyperferritinemia and HLH, it maintains that the positive predictive value of hyperferritinemia for HLH is quite low, and one should consider more common explanations before suspecting HLH.

### Best but not perfect: indirect measure of low iron stores [^788e2d58]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The other biomarkers studied by the authors demonstrated inferior diagnostic performance compared to ferritin except for transferrin in females. Multivariate logistic regression models including these biomarkers did not improve the prediction of low or absent bone marrow iron stores over ferritin alone.

The clinical implications of the current study are important. The high specificity of ferritin at the 30 μg/L cutoff suggests that it can be a reliable marker for ruling in low or absent iron stores in patients with a high pretest probability of the condition. However, the low sensitivity indicates that clinicians should be cautious in ruling out low or absent iron stores based solely on ferritin levels, particularly in patients with conditions that can elevate ferritin, such as inflammation or liver disease. In such cases, additional diagnostic tests or clinical judgment may be necessary to accurately diagnose low or absent iron stores. We cannot emphasize too strongly that bone marrow aspirate with iron staining is often necessary, as the finding of absent iron necessitates an evaluation that may uncover a gastrointestinal or genitourinary malignance at an early, curable stage.

The reliability of the bone marrow iron determination depends on the adequacy of the specimen including the presence of spicules in the aspirate, and it would have been good to have specific comments about these factors in this study. In addition, it would have been good to provide their analysis based on the classical definition of iron deficiency, which is absence of stainable iron in an adequate bone marrow aspirate. The retrospective design and single institution character of the study are offset by the very impressive sample size.

In conclusion, this study reinforces the importance of ferritin as the primary biomarker for diagnosing iron deficiency, while also highlighting its limitations in terms of sensitivity. Clinicians should consider these findings when interpreting laboratory measures of iron status, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions. Importantly, the presence of a normal or elevated serum ferritin does not negate the potential need for a bone marrow aspirate to assess potential metabolic or malignant conditions that may present with iron deficiency.

### Serum or plasma ferritin concentration as an index of iron deficiency and overload [^a0fd667b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Reference standard indices of iron deficiency and iron overload are generally invasive, expensive, and can be unpleasant or occasionally risky. Ferritin is an iron storage protein and its concentration in the plasma or serum reflects iron stores; low ferritin indicates iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin reflects risk of iron overload. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase protein and its levels are elevated in inflammation and infection. The use of ferritin as a diagnostic test of iron deficiency and overload is a common clinical practice.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and risk of iron overload in primary and secondary iron-loading syndromes.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases (10 June 2020): DARE (Cochrane Library) Issue 2 of 4 2015, HTA (Cochrane Library) Issue 4 of 4 2016, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) Issue 6 of 12 2020, MEDLINE (OVID) 1946 to 9 June 2020, Embase (OVID) 1947 to week 23 2020, CINAHL (Ebsco) 1982 to June 2020, Web of Science (ISI) SCI, SSCI, CPCI-exp & CPCI-SSH to June 2020, POPLINE 16/8/18, Open Grey (10/6/20), TRoPHI (10/6/20), Bibliomap (10/6/20), IBECS (10/6/20), SCIELO (10/6/20), Global Index Medicus (10/6/20) AIM, IMSEAR, WPRIM, IMEMR, LILACS (10/6/20), PAHO (10/6/20), WHOLIS 10/6/20, IndMED (16/8/18) and Native Health Research Database (10/6/20). We also searched two trials registers and contacted relevant organisations for unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all study designs seeking to evaluate serum or plasma ferritin concentrations measured by any current or previously available quantitative assay as an index of iron status in individuals of any age, sex, clinical and physiological status from any country.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We designed the data extraction form to record results for ferritin concentration as the index test, and bone marrow iron content for iron deficiency and liver iron content for iron overload as the reference standards. Two other authors further extracted and validated the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative cases, and extracted or derived the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for each threshold presented for iron deficiency and iron overload in included studies. We assessed risk of bias and applicability using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool. We used GRADE assessment to enable the quality of evidence and hence strength of evidence for our conclusions.

Main Results

Our search was conducted initially in 2014 and updated in 2017, 2018 and 2020 (10 June). We identified 21,217 records and screened 14,244 records after duplicates were removed. We assessed 316 records in full text. We excluded 190 studies (193 records) with reasons and included 108 studies (111 records) in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. There were 11 studies (12 records) that we screened from the last search update and appeared eligible for a future analysis. We decided to enter these as awaiting classification. We stratified the analysis first by participant clinical status: apparently healthy and non-healthy populations. We then stratified by age and pregnancy status as: infants and children, adolescents, pregnant women, and adults. Iron deficiency We included 72 studies (75 records) involving 6059 participants. Apparently healthy populations Five studies screened for iron deficiency in people without apparent illness. In the general adult population, three studies reported sensitivities of 63% to 100% at the optimum cutoff for ferritin, with corresponding specificities of 92% to 98%, but the ferritin cutoffs varied between studies. One study in healthy children reported a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 77%. One study in pregnant women reported a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100%. Overall confidence in these estimates was very low because of potential bias, indirectness, and sparse and heterogenous evidence. No studies screened for iron overload in apparently healthy people. People presenting for medical care There were 63 studies among adults presenting for medical care (5042 participants). For a sample of 1000 subjects with a 35% prevalence of iron deficiency (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 85% specificity, there would be 315 iron-deficient subjects correctly classified as having iron deficiency and 35 iron-deficient subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron deficiency, leading to a 90% sensitivity. Thresholds proposed by the authors of the included studies ranged between 12 to 200 µg/L. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 50. Among non-healthy adults using a fixed threshold of 30 μg/L (nine studies, 512 participants, low-certainty evidence), the pooled estimate for sensitivity was 79% with a 95% confidence interval of (58%, 91%) and specificity of 98%, with a 95% confidence interval of (91%, 100%). The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 140, a relatively highly informative test. Iron overload We included 36 studies (36 records) involving 1927 participants. All studies concerned non-healthy populations. There were no studies targeting either infants, children, or pregnant women. Among all populations (one threshold for males and females; 36 studies, 1927 participants, very low-certainty evidence): for a sample of 1000 subjects with a 42% prevalence of iron overload (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 65% specificity, there would be 332 iron-overloaded subjects correctly classified as having iron overload and 85 iron-overloaded subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron overload, leading to a 80% sensitivity. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 8.

Authors' Conclusions

At a threshold of 30 micrograms/L, there is low-certainty evidence that blood ferritin concentration is reasonably sensitive and a very specific test for iron deficiency in people presenting for medical care. There is very low certainty that high concentrations of ferritin provide a sensitive test for iron overload in people where this condition is suspected. There is insufficient evidence to know whether ferritin concentration performs similarly when screening asymptomatic people for iron deficiency or overload.

### Extreme hyperferritinaemia; clinical causes [^355b1a52]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

There are many causes of raised serum ferritin concentrations including iron overload, inflammation and liver disease to name but a few examples. Cases of extreme hyperferritinaemia (serum ferritin concentration equal to or greater than 10 000 ug/l) are being reported in laboratories but the causes of this are unclear. We conducted an audit study to explore this further. Extreme hyperferritinaemia was rare with only 0.08% of ferritin requests displaying this. The main causes of extreme hyperferritinaemia included multiple blood transfusions, malignant disease, hepatic disease and suspected Still's disease.

### Causes of ferritin elevation… [^8f9c443f]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

In Reply Dr Lippi raises the important point that an elevated serum ferritin level may also be associated with underlying malignancy; it is true that ferritin may be elevated in a broad variety of other disease processes, as we noted in our JAMA Diagnostic Test Interpretation article. Elevated serum ferritin levels are commonly encountered in general practice and many elevations may be due to non–iron overload conditions. The patient described was a relatively healthy middle-aged man who was unexpectedly noted to have a markedly elevated ferritin level. The cited investigation by Moore et al1 retrospectively studied the underlying etiology of markedly elevated serum ferritin levels in a large group of patients at a tertiary care medical center, including patients with a range of cancers, infections, inflammatory conditions, and renal diseases. 1 This study population is distinctly different from the relatively healthy patient described in our article.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^edfdb197]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE) — Screening should be considered in all patients with abnormal AST/ALT levels and include an iron panel to determine transferrin saturation and serum ferritin; if the transferrin saturation is 45% or higher, or the serum ferritin is elevated, consideration should be given for HFE gene mutation analysis. Because ferritin is an acute phase reactant, an elevated ferritin in acute hepatitis likely does not indicate iron overload. The presence of a homozygous C282Y mutation confirms HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis, whereas compound C282Y/H63D heterozygotes rarely manifest chronic liver disease from iron overload. In patients with homozygous C282Y or compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D mutations who have elevated AST/ALT levels or ferritin > 1,000 μg/l, or in non-HFE hemochromatosis, liver biopsy should be considered to stage liver fibrosis and quantify hepatic iron overload to guide therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^0281f098]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — liver biopsy indications and ferritin-based risk in C282Y homozygotes: Serum ferritin helps triage biopsy; "Several studies have demonstrated that C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin > 1000 μg/L are at an increased risk of cirrhosis, with a prevalence of 20%-45%". In contrast, "fewer than 2% of C282Y homozygotes with a ferritin level < 1000 μg/L at the time of diagnosis has cirrhosis or bridging fibrosis". A study of "more than 670 asymptomatic C282Y homozygotes" performed biopsy "in 350 subjects" (cutoff "500 μg/L"), with cirrhosis "in 5.6% of all males and 1.9% of all females", and "All subjects with cirrhosis had a hepatic iron concentration (HIC) > 200 μmol/g of weight". Diagnostic performance showed "A serum ferritin level > 1000 μg/L had 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity for identification of cirrhosis", and "No subject with a serum ferritin level < 1000 μg/L had cirrhosis". Accordingly, "liver biopsy does not need to be performed when ferritin is < 1000 μg/L, in the absence of excess alcohol consumption and elevated serum liver enzymes". For non-C282Y homozygotes, "Patients with elevated serum iron studies, but who lack C282Y homozygosity, should be considered for liver biopsy if they have elevated liver enzymes or other clinical evidence of liver disease".

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^58cfbe93]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — diagnosis and treatment algorithm: In patients with suspected hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) based on symptoms, elevated liver enzymes, or family history, the suggested initial screening tests should be transferrin-iron saturation (TS) and serum ferritin (SF) level; if TS is < 45% and SF is normal, further evaluation is not necessary, whereas if TS is ≥ 45% and/or SF is elevated, HFE gene testing should be performed. All patients who are C282Y homozygotes should proceed to phlebotomy; if SF is > 1,000 μg/L, liver biopsy is suggested for fibrosis staging, and patients with cirrhosis should undergo screening for hepatocellular carcinoma; a liver biopsy can also be considered before initiating phlebotomy in C282Y homozygotes with elevated liver enzymes to rule out additional causes of liver disease. For patients who are not C282Y homozygotes, evaluation for other causes of elevated iron indices should be performed, including liver and hematologic disorders; if other causes of iron overload have been ruled out, hepatic iron concentration (HIC) should be assessed by liver biopsy or MRI, and patients with elevated HIC and SF of > 1,000 μg/mL should proceed to therapeutic phlebotomy.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^67700779]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Serum ferritin — assessment in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes threshold-based interpretation and important caveats: the WHO and American Academy of Pediatrics definitions note iron deficiency at ferritin levels below 12 and 15 μg/L in otherwise healthy children, while in adult IBD guidance serum ferritin levels below 30 μg/L are highly suggestive of iron deficiency and levels above 100 μg/L are unlikely; values between 30 and 100 μg/L may still indicate iron deficiency with inflammation, and post–intravenous iron ferritin may be misleading for up to 8 weeks. Interpretation requires consideration of inflammatory markers because ferritin is an acute phase reactant and can be altered by non–iron-related conditions.

### Hyperferritinemia screening to aid identification and differentiation of patients with hyperinflammatory disorders [^b4422dcc]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

The ferritin alert system also facilitated longitudinal assessment of patients with chronic hyperferritinemia, enabling an anecdotal assessment of the utility of biomarker trends. We found that intermittent assessment of IL-18 over a patient's clinical course was a useful residual disease activity marker, with elevation showing active or imminent flares and improvement/normalization predicting durable response (or lack thereof) to treatment (Figure S1). Thus, IL-18 may be useful both diagnostically and in assessing minimal residual disease activity in Stills disease.

In this study, IHF detection did not trigger any specific clinical intervention and members of the IHF screen review team did intervene with screened patients (other than to seek informed consent) based on alerts. Preliminary evidence suggests earlier involvement of HLH/cytokine storm specialists may improve patient outcomes. This aligns with our anecdotal clinical experience and recent international consensus guidance efforts in highlighting the likely utility of ferritin in sepsis order sets and institutional HLH/MAS response teams/pathways.

Multi-analyte panels typically use the same sample dilution for all analytes measured, rendering both antibody- and aptamer-based platforms susceptible to hidden hook effects, particularly at analyte levels above what assay developers might encounter in healthy and common disease controls. In a 96-plex "immuno-oncology" assay of 80 curated serum samples, our "positive control" analyte (IL-18) failed to distinguish Stills patients. Given prior experience, we suspected and subsequently identified a strong hook effect at high total IL-18 concentrations. We found similar hook effects for very high total IL-18 and CXCL9 levels in separate cohorts containing Stills and HLH patients. Though we did not observe a "hook effect" for CXCL9 or IL-18BP in an aptamer-based assay, the scarcity of very high CXCL9 or IL-18BP levels in that cohort precludes making any generalizations. These observations suggest that "proteomic" multi-analyte panels carry significant Type II error, and investigators should be cautious making any "failure to detect" conclusions from such data without proper controls.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on haemochromatosis [^90052cea]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, more specifically with respect to MRI, EASL 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain MRI to quantify hepatic iron concentrations and to assess extrahepatic organ involvement in patients with an unclear cause of hyperferritinemia, biochemical iron overload (increased transferrin saturation and ferritin), or positive liver iron staining.

### Haemophagocytic lymphohisticytosis-an underrecognized hyperinflammatory syndrome [^a6901007]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing HLH

HLH causes a constellation of non-specific findings, including persistent fever, altered mental state, rash, cytopenias affecting all cell lines (often with thrombocytopenia initially), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and transaminitis. Typically patients have hyperferritinaemia (highly elevated ferritin > 10 000 μg/l may be pathognomic of HLH in some contexts) with elevated triglycerides and decreasing fibrinogen. However, often one or more of these abnormalities is not seen.

Key to early detection of HLH before the 'tipping point' into hyperinflammation is interpretation of patterns of results rather than absolute values and recognizing worrying trends (e.g. decreasing ESR in a patient with a known chronic disease).

The absence of haemophagocytosis on bone marrow can be falsely reassuring. The test is not 100% sensitive, and it may not be present in up to 30% of cases or only appear on repeat testing. Furthermore, haemophagocytosis on bone marrow, or in other tissues, is not binary, nor is it sufficient to make the diagnosis of HLH — some degree of haemophagocytosis can be present in the marrow of patients without HLH. Close collaboration with haematologists when managing HLH is therefore essential.

In the paediatric and adult populations, hyperferritinaemia is shown to be both sensitive and specific as a marker for HLH and MAS in 'at-risk' patients and a marker of response to treatment. Diagnostic algorithms have been developed utilizing ferritin, given its wide availability and low cost. Hyperferritinaemia is not specific for HLH in the adult population as a whole, being seen in a number of other conditions including renal failure, liver failure, and iron overload.

pHLH has an established set of diagnostic criteria — the Histiocyte Society's HLH-2004 criteria [see Table 1]. These criteria have been extrapolated to the diagnosis of sHLH; however, there is concern that this leads to underrecognition. For instance, features well recognized in adults [such as elevated LDH and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)] are not included in the diagnostic criteria, and some of the variables measured in the HLH-2004 criteria are not readily available in many hospitals.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^361c0486]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — hereditary hemochromatosis diagnostic evaluation and management emphasize that the increasing use of noninvasive tests such as MRI T2✱ has made quantification of hepatic iron deposition easier and eliminated the need for liver biopsy in most patients, and that serum ferritin of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis remains an important diagnostic test to identify patients with a low risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis and should be used routinely as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation. Genetic testing for other types of HH is available but is expensive and generally not useful in most clinical settings. Serum ferritin may be elevated among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in those with alcoholic liver disease, and these diagnoses are more common than HH among patients with elevated serum ferritin who are not C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes, so a secondary cause for liver disease should be excluded among patients with suspected iron overload who are not C282Y homozygotes. Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of therapy, although emerging novel therapies such as new chelating agents may have a role for selected patients.

AASLD testing recommendations emphasize paired iron studies and conditional HFE testing: "In a patient with suggestive symptoms, physical findings, or family history, a combination of TS and ferritin should be obtained rather than relying on a single test. (1B) If either is abnormal (TS ≥ 45% or ferritin above the upper limit of normal), then HFE mutation analysis should be performed.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) evaluation — guidance statements include: When evaluating a patient with suspected NAFLD, it is essential to exclude competing etiologies for steatosis and coexisting common CLD; in patients with suspected NAFLD, persistently high serum ferritin and increased iron saturation, especially with homozygote or heterozygote C282Y HFE mutation, a liver biopsy should be considered; high serum titers of autoantibodies with other features suggestive of autoimmune liver disease (> 5 ULN aminotransferases, high globulins, or high total protein to albumin ratio) should prompt a work-up for autoimmune liver disease; and initial evaluation should carefully consider comorbidities such as obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and sleep apnea.

### Avoid using hemoglobin to evaluate patients for iron… [^28903829]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron depletion is a progressive process with anemia as the final phase. Thus, screening for iron deficiency using hemoglobin will only identify the most severe cases. Moreover, hemoglobin is not specific for iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide. Prevalence of iron deficiency in U. S. women ages 12 to 49 years rose from 11% in 2003 to 14. 8% in
2010. Pregnant women and young children are also high-risk groups and must be evaluated. Iron deficiency in U. S. toddlers, without anemia, is estimated at 6. 6% to
15. 2%. Serum ferritin is a measure of iron stores and is the most sensitive biomarker to test for early stages of iron deficiency as well as iron deficiency anemia. Sensitivity of ferritin test is 89% for diagnosis of iron depletion compared with hemoglobin, which is only 26%.

Moreover, a ferritin cut off of ≤ 30 ng/mL provides 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity for iron deficiency anemia and is the best screening test for this disorder. Evaluating patients for iron deficiency with ferritin will identify early stage iron deficiency and will potentially result in iron therapy, preventing iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia has been long associated with psychomotor and cognitive abnormalities but even iron deficiency without anemia has been related to negative neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant, and occasionally in inflammatory conditions, ferritin levels may be normal or elevated even in the presence of iron deficiency.

Additional laboratory tests accompanying clinical correlation are also helpful to determine iron deficiency.

### Abnormal ferritin levels predict development of poor outcomes in cirrhotic outpatients: a cohort study [^e51b53ef]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, since low ferritin level was associated with higher incidence of decompensation, it might seem controversial that mortality was associated with higher ferritin levels in the compensated population. As discussed, elevated ferritin level indicates either iron overload, which is toxic to cells, or increased inflammation, caused by either bacterial translocation or a subclinical starting infection. These last two, in return, can lead to overt infections, while inflammation in general and iron-induced toxicity can trigger the progression of HCC and comorbidities ultimately leading to increased overall mortality. Indeed, as Fig. 6 shows, almost every patient with high ferritin level who developed decompensated clinical stage died, and some deceased even without having an AD episode. In contrast, as Fig. 3 demonstrates, no patient with low ferritin level who did not develop decompensated clinical stage died during follow up. Furthermore, approximately 40% of those with low ferritin levels who did decompensate, also survived. The explanation for this difference is not clear, but the decompensation of non-inflammatory mechanisms, indicated by lower ferritin levels, might represent a less severe/more manageable type of AD.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^a5431ea7]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis therapeutic phlebotomy and monitoring — patients with hemochromatosis and iron overload should undergo therapeutic phlebotomy weekly (as tolerated), with target ferritin 50–100 μg/L. In the absence of indicators suggesting significant liver disease (ALT, AST elevation), C282Y homozygotes who have an elevated ferritin (but < 1000 μg/L) should proceed to phlebotomy without a liver biopsy. Patients with end-organ damage due to iron overload should undergo regular phlebotomy to the same endpoints. During treatment for HH, dietary adjustments are unnecessary, and vitamin C supplements and iron supplements should be avoided. Patients with hemochromatosis and iron overload should be monitored for reaccumulation of iron and undergo maintenance phlebotomy, again aiming for a ferritin level of 50–100 μg/L. We recommend treatment by phlebotomy of patients with non-HFE iron overload who have an elevated HIC.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^8c11e931]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of anemia in IBD patients

In humans, multiple factors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, pregnancy, environment and nutrition, influence Hb levels. In general, the WHO defines anemia as a decline in blood Hb according to the reference levels given in Table 1. These cutoff levels apply equally to IBD patients, as the definitions do not vary according to comorbidities. Considering the high prevalence of anemia in chronic inflammatory diseases, the recently published European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) guideline on anemia recommends regular screening, according to disease severity and activity. More specifically, anemia assessment in outpatients with active inflammation (high elevated inflammatory biomarkers or significant endoscopic proof of disease activity) should be performed at least every three months, whereas screening intervals in outpatients who show few signs of systemic inflammation or are in remission can be extended to every six to twelve months. Special attention should be paid to children and adolescents. Common diagnostic markers for anemia assessment may be applied to patients without clinical, endoscopic or biochemical evidence of active disease. In contrast, in IBD patients who have active disease, are receiving ongoing therapy, or have undergone extensive small bowel resection, important parameters for the assessment of anemia, such as erythrocyte indices, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TfS), do not always afford sufficient accuracy. It should be remembered that ferritin is an acute-phase protein that is increased in the context of ongoing systemic inflammation. Furthermore, differentiation between the two most frequent types of anemia in IBD patients, ID and ACD, remains challenging, especially since both conditions frequently coexist.

### Adult onset Still's disease: clinical presentation in a large cohort of Italian patients [^c3a6400f]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To characterise the clinical phenotype of Italian patients with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD).

Methods

Sixty-six subjects who received a definite diagnosis of AOSD were seen and followed-up at our institution from 1991 to 2009. The diagnosis was made by a senior rheumatologist and confirmed by Yamaguchi's criteria for AOSD. Data regarding clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiographic features, and disease course were collected and compared with those reported in other published series of different ethnicity.

Results

The most frequent features were: articular pain (100%), acute phase reactants elevation (100%), elevated serum ferritin (97%), high fever (95%), negative RF and ANA (92%), neutrophilia (82%), skin rash (79%), and overt arthritis (79%). Forty-percent of patients showed a chronic articular disease. Five subjects (8%) experienced severe, life-threatening complications, and 1 patient died. As compared to other North American, North European, Middle Eastern, and Far Eastern cohorts, Italian patients showed significant differences in several epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory features.

Conclusions

Our data show that AOSD is rare in the Italian population, and that its clinical presentation appears to be significantly influenced by the ethnicity of the affected patients. Given its broad differential diagnosis, early recognition of this condition is challenging, but it could become crucial in the setting of severe complications. Beyond the protean manifestations of this disease, a clinical picture of seronegative febrile arthritis and skin rash, concurrent with a marked elevation in serum ferritin should always be mindful of AOSD.

### Anti-MDA5-positive dermatomyositis presenting as fever of unknown origin [^d5ca4386]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Dermatomyositis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory infiltrates in the skin and muscle. The wide variability in clinical and serologic presentation poses a diagnostic challenge for the internist. Appreciation of the clinical variants of dermatomyositis allows for expedient diagnosis and avoidance of diagnostic error. We illustrate these challenges with the case of a 51-year-old Vietnamese-American man who initially presented with fever of unknown origin in the absence of overt skin and muscle manifestations. The diagnosis of dermatomyositis was not evident on several clinical encounters due to the absence of these hallmark symptoms. We review the variable clinical manifestations of a subtype of dermatomyositis associated with an autoantibody against melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (anti-MDA5) and suggest consideration of dermatomyositis as a diagnosis in patients presenting with systemic illness and markedly elevated ferritin, even in the absence of elevated muscle enzymes and classic autoantibodies.

### Best but not perfect: indirect measure of low iron stores [^b03826dc]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Although making the correct diagnosis of iron deficiency is critical for patient care, the use of indirect markers obtained through routine phlebotomy presents a challenge. Low serum iron, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and MCV are characteristic of iron deficiency but can also result from inflammation. In addition, hemoglobin and MCV may be low due to genetic causes and, in the case of hemoglobin, to diurnal variation rather than iron deficiency. Transferrin concentrations tend to increase with iron deficiency and decrease with inflammation, whereas transferrin receptor levels rise with both iron deficiency and inflammation. Serum ferritin is an attractive marker because a very low level (< 10 μg/L) is diagnostic of iron deficiency as documented by absent stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate. However, serum ferritin can be normal or even elevated when iron deficiency is documented by absent bone marrow stainable iron. A recent Cochrane review of 512 adults presenting for medical care at various institutions found that a serum ferritin < 30 μg/L had 98% specificity and 79% sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency as documented by absent bone marrow iron.

Lahtiharju et al make a remarkable contribution by evaluating the relationship of indirect measures of iron status to bone marrow iron stain in 6610 patients and providing evidence that ferritin is the most reliable single biomarker for predicting reduced iron stores. This finding is consistent with studies dated decades ago that established ferritin as a key standalone indicator of iron status. This study also underscores the limitations of ferritin, particularly its low sensitivity. Using a ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L, the specificity rates were impressively high at 97% for females and 99% for males, but the sensitivity rates were only 54% and 35%, respectively. This indicates that while a ferritin of 30 μg/L or lower is highly specific for low or absent bone marrow iron, it is not sensitive enough to detect all cases of low iron stores, especially in patients with comorbid conditions that can increase ferritin levels. It is important to recognize that in this study, there were females with serum ferritin > 1750 μg/L and males with serum ferritin > 4967 μg/L who had low or absent bone marrow iron stores.

### Diagnosing haemophagocytic syndrome [^cc78d744]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Haemophagocytic syndrome, or haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), is a hyperinflammatory disorder characterised by uncontrolled activation of the immune system. It can result from mutations in multiple genes involved in cytotoxicity or occur secondary to a range of infections, malignancies or autoimmune rheumatic diseases. In the latter case, it is also known as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Characteristic features are persistent fever, hepatosplenomegaly, petechial/purpuric rash, progressive cytopenias, coagulopathy, transaminitis, raised C reactive protein, falling erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypertriglyceridaemia, hypofibrinogenaemia and extreme hyperferritinaemia often associated with multi-organ impairment. Distinguishing HLH from systemic sepsis can present a major challenge. Criteria for diagnosis and classification of HLH and MAS are available and a serum ferritin > 10000µg/L is strongly supportive of HLH. Without early recognition and appropriate treatment, HLH is almost universally fatal. However, with prompt referral and advancements in treatment over the past two decades, outcomes have greatly improved.
