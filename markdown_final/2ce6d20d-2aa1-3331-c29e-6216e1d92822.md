## Question

Geriatric anemia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about geriatric anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining anemia in older adults and whether WHO thresholds remain appropriate. Then, I should verify prevalence and epidemiology across settings. Next, I will classify etiologies, including unexplained anemia of aging, and appraise the evidence base. After that, I need to assess clinical consequences and functional impact. Then, I will outline a diagnostic algorithm and evaluate treatment strategies, including iron repletion, ESAs, and transfusion thresholds. Finally, I should consider special populations, perioperative care, and synthesize a practical, stepwise approach with monitoring and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the definition and thresholds. The WHO defines anemia as hemoglobin less than 13.0 g/dL in men and less than 12.0 g/dL in women, and these cutoffs are generally applied to older adults, though some experts argue for a single threshold of less than 13.0 g/dL in both older men and postmenopausal women given observed associations with adverse outcomes even at mild reductions in hemoglobin [^96404757] [^3dc97811]. Wait, let me verify the mortality signal supporting these thresholds: a classic cohort in adults aged 85 and older showed increased mortality with anemia by WHO criteria, supporting their applicability in the oldest old, which reinforces using these thresholds rather than age-adjusted norms [^6357c47a].

> Next, I should review prevalence and epidemiology. I need to check community versus institutional data. In community-dwelling older adults, anemia prevalence is around 10–17% and rises with age, reaching roughly 20–40% in those over 85, with higher rates in men than women and substantially higher prevalence in nursing home residents and hospitalized patients, often approaching 40–50% or more [^eaac8474] [^51c1fc93] [^96404757]. Hold on, I should verify regional variation: globally, anemia prevalence in older adults averages about 24% per WHO estimates, with markedly higher burdens in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, reflecting malnutrition, chronic infections, and limited access to care [^3311dcf7] [^22e694e9].

> I will now examine etiologic classification. The literature consistently divides geriatric anemia into three approximately equal categories: nutritional deficiencies, anemia of chronic inflammation or chronic kidney disease, and unexplained anemia of aging, with the latter accounting for up to a third of cases after appropriate evaluation [^96404757] [^8de138bc]. Let me consider nutritional causes carefully: iron deficiency predominates, often due to occult gastrointestinal blood loss, malabsorption, or medications, while B12 and folate deficiencies are less common but important, particularly in the setting of atrophic gastritis, PPI use, or poor intake [^871c0f7d] [^7fdccceb]. I should double-check the CKD contribution: reduced erythropoietin production and functional iron restriction are key, and anemia prevalence escalates as eGFR declines, aligning with KDIGO diagnostic criteria for CKD-related anemia [^d75e7934] [^d503dd2f].

> But wait, what exactly is unexplained anemia of aging. UAA is a diagnosis of exclusion characterized by mild normocytic anemia without identifiable nutritional, inflammatory, renal, or malignant causes, and it is associated with adverse outcomes despite its modest severity, suggesting age-related hematopoietic stem cell dysfunction, inflammatory milieu, and EPO resistance as plausible mechanisms [^3dc97811] [^aafe417c]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: clonal hematopoiesis and myelodysplastic syndromes must be considered in the differential, and emerging data link somatic mutations to cytopenias in older adults, so I should confirm that appropriate marrow evaluation is reserved for cytopenias, dysplasia, or red flags on smear or counts [^17d23fe2].

> Next, I should review clinical consequences. Even mild anemia correlates with increased mortality, hospitalization, falls, cognitive impairment, depression, and reduced quality of life, with observational data showing a 4-fold increase in impaired executive function and higher all-cause mortality in older adults with anemia, independent of comorbidities [^38594e6e] [^c5111835]. I need to ensure I capture functional impact: anemia is associated with sarcopenia, frailty, and slower gait speed, and in cardiovascular disease, each 1 g/dL decrement in hemoglobin tracks with higher risks of death and major adverse cardiac events, underscoring anemia as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target [^c5111835] [^e0a68b1a].

> Now, I will outline a diagnostic algorithm. Let me first confirm the basics: CBC with indices, reticulocyte count, and a careful peripheral smear review are foundational, followed by iron studies, B12, methylmalonic acid if B12 is borderline, folate, TSH, and renal and hepatic panels, with additional tests guided by MCV and clinical context [^17d23fe2]. I should double-check iron interpretation: ferritin is acute-phase and may read high in inflammation; transferrin saturation less than 20% supports iron-restricted erythropoiesis, and in older adults, absolute iron deficiency may be present with ferritin up to 100–300 µg/L when TSAT is low, so I need to integrate CRP and clinical suspicion [^17d23fe2]. For microcytic or unexplained anemia, I should confirm that gastrointestinal evaluation is appropriate: in men and postmenopausal women, occult GI blood loss is common, and dual pathology occurs in 1–10%, so upper and lower endoscopy or noninvasive alternatives should be individualized based on comorbidity and goals of care [^6a71285d] [^bb17945e].

> Let me consider management of iron deficiency anemia. Oral iron remains first-line, but I need to check dosing strategy: alternate-day dosing and taking iron on an empty stomach improve absorption and tolerability, and lower-dose formulations can reduce GI side effects without sacrificing efficacy in some patients, which is particularly relevant in older adults with constipation or dyspepsia [^cc261f64]. Hold on, I should verify when to use IV iron: intolerance or inadequate response to oral iron, malabsorption, ongoing blood loss, or the need for rapid repletion are appropriate indications, and modern IV agents have favorable safety profiles; importantly, IV iron improves symptoms and quality of life in heart failure with functional iron deficiency, though I must align with cardiology and nephrology guidance in multimorbid patients [^cc261f64] [^67647ef5] [^955fc0c9].

> For anemia of chronic inflammation or CKD, I need to ensure I treat the underlying disease and correct iron deficiency before considering ESAs. KDIGO advises addressing correctable causes first, initiating ESAs when hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL in non-dialysis CKD, and avoiding normalization, with typical targets around 10–11.5 g/dL to balance benefit and cardiovascular risk; I should confirm that hemoglobin is not above 10 g/dL when starting ESAs in non-dialysis CKD [^54214bf9] [^cb6a04cb] [^8c70b6c2]. Wait, let me verify updates: the UK Kidney Association suggests adjusting ESA dosing when hemoglobin is 10.5 g/dL or less or 11.5 g/dL or more, aiming for a population mean near 11.0 g/dL, which operationalizes a conservative target consistent with safety data [^d5a1cc17].

> I should confirm transfusion thresholds. In general, transfusion is not indicated when hemoglobin is 10 g/dL or higher, and 2 units are reasonable when hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL in stable patients, with consideration of a higher threshold around 8 g/dL in older adults with cardiovascular disease or active ischemia; restrictive strategies are supported in trauma and surgical cohorts, though geriatric patients' reduced reserve may necessitate individualized decisions in hip fracture and other high-risk contexts [^63be1734] [^9cd123bb] [^867e52dd]. Hold on, I should verify that we avoid reflexive transfusion in the perioperative setting without addressing the cause, as patient blood management and iron optimization reduce transfusion exposure and improve outcomes [^16610b93].

> Let me think about unexplained anemia of aging. There is no disease-modifying therapy proven to reverse UAA, so management is supportive: treat reversible contributors, monitor for evolution into MDS or other marrow disorders, and prioritize functional preservation, exercise, and fall-risk mitigation; I should confirm that we do not overpromise benefit from ESAs or iron in pure UAA without evidence of deficiency or inflammation [^3dc97811] [^aafe417c]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ESAs might help symptomatic UAA, but I need to correct that: without EPO-responsive biology, ESAs are not indicated for UAA absent CKD or chemotherapy, and trials targeting UAA are limited, so expectations should be tempered and shared decision-making emphasized [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations. In COPD, anemia is common and associated with worse symptoms and outcomes; anemia of chronic disease predominates, but iron deficiency is frequent and should be actively screened and treated when present, with attention to reversible drivers such as medications and renal dysfunction [^6c6b70c2]. In heart failure, functional iron deficiency is prevalent and IV iron improves symptoms and quality of life in selected patients, whereas ESAs have not improved outcomes and may carry harm; I need to ensure coordination with cardiology and adherence to guideline-directed therapy [^67647ef5] [^e331a779]. In the perioperative realm, I should confirm that preoperative anemia screening and optimization with iron, ESAs when indicated, and blood conservation reduce transfusions and complications; geriatric trauma patients often have lower baseline hemoglobin and may require careful, restrictive transfusion strategies balanced against frailty and ischemic risk [^16610b93] [^9cd123bb].

> I will now synthesize a practical approach. First, confirm anemia with repeat CBC and establish chronicity and trajectory. Second, execute a structured evaluation: history for bleeding, diet, medications, and comorbidities; targeted labs including iron studies, B12, folate, TSH, renal and hepatic function; and selective GI evaluation for IDA or high-risk features. Third, classify the etiology and treat reversible causes in sequence, starting with nutritional repletion and inflammation control. Fourth, set individualized goals: aim for hemoglobin above 10 g/dL when feasible, avoid overcorrection, and prioritize symptom relief and functional outcomes. Fifth, monitor response and complications, reassessing for evolving marrow disease if cytopenias progress or new abnormalities appear [^17d23fe2] [^8dd2bbc7]. Hold on, I should verify that we also address polypharmacy, especially antiplatelets and PPIs, and consider medication deprescribing to reduce occult GI bleeding and malabsorption risks in older adults [^6a71285d].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal follow-up and quality metrics. Given the high recurrence of IDA and the possibility of progression in UAA, periodic reassessment of hemoglobin, iron stores, and symptoms is essential; in patients on ESAs, track ESA responsiveness and iron indices to mitigate hyporesponsiveness and adverse effects, and align with updated KDIGO guidance as it evolves [^f941214e] [^3bbec8de]. I should double-check that we also capture patient-reported outcomes and functional status, as these often improve with correction of iron deficiency and may guide the intensity of therapy in multimorbid older adults [^67647ef5].

Geriatric anemia is common and multifactorial, with **prevalence rising to 20–40% in adults ≥ 65 years** and exceeding 50% in those ≥ 85 years or in nursing homes [^eaac8474] [^6a71285d]. It is defined by WHO as Hb < 13.0 g/dL in men and < 12.0 g/dL in women, and even mild anemia is linked to **increased mortality, frailty, cognitive decline, and functional impairment** [^6357c47a] [^c5111835] [^38594e6e]. The main causes are iron deficiency, anemia of chronic inflammation/CKD, and unexplained anemia of aging; evaluation should include CBC, iron studies, B12/folate, renal function, and selective GI evaluation for occult bleeding [^96404757] [^6a71285d]. Management targets the cause: oral or IV iron for deficiency, ESAs for CKD or inflammation-related anemia with caution, and transfusion only for severe symptomatic cases; **restrictive transfusion thresholds are generally safe** in older adults [^8dd2bbc7] [^9cd123bb]. Early detection and cause-directed therapy improve outcomes, but many cases remain unexplained, underscoring the need for individualized, multidisciplinary care [^a3cf1342] [^698424be].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

By WHO criteria, anemia is **Hb < 13.0 g/dL in men and < 12.0 g/dL in women** [^96404757]; these thresholds apply to older adults, though some experts advocate a single < 13.0 g/dL cutoff in older men and postmenopausal women due to adverse outcomes even with mild anemia [^3dc97811]. Severity is categorized as mild (Hb 10.0–12.9 g/dL in men; 10.0–11.9 g/dL in women), moderate (8.0–9.9 g/dL), or severe (< 8.0 g/dL).

---

## Epidemiology

Anemia is highly prevalent in older adults, with **community prevalence around 10–20%**, rising to 20–40% in those ≥ 85 years and > 50% in nursing home residents or hospitalized elders [^eaac8474] [^6a71285d]. Globally, anemia affects approximately 23.9% of adults ≥ 65 years, with higher rates in men, non-Hispanic Blacks, and those with chronic diseases [^3311dcf7] [^e58101b5].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Geriatric anemia is **multifactorial**; the three most common categories are:

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Pathophysiology** |
|-|-|-|
| Nutritional deficiencies | Iron, vitamin B12, folate | - Reduced intake <br/> - Malabsorption <br/> - Chronic blood loss [^6a71285d] [^7fdccceb] |
| Anemia of chronic inflammation/CKD | - CKD <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Malignancy | - Cytokine-mediated iron sequestration <br/> - Blunted erythropoietin response <br/> - Reduced RBC lifespan [^698424be] [^d75e7934] |
| Unexplained anemia of aging (UAA) | Idiopathic | - Stem cell dysfunction <br/> - Erythropoietin resistance <br/> - Clonal hematopoiesis <br/> - Inflammaging [^698424be] [^3fcb900e] |

---

Unexplained anemia accounts for **about one-third of cases** and is associated with adverse outcomes even when mild [^8de138bc] [^3dc97811].

---

## Clinical consequences

Anemia in older adults is associated with:

- **Increased mortality**: All-cause mortality rises with lower Hb, independent of comorbidities [^c5111835].
- **Functional impairment**: Reduced strength, endurance, and mobility; higher fall risk [^38594e6e].
- **Cognitive decline**: Greater risk of dementia and executive dysfunction [^38594e6e].
- **Cardiovascular complications**: Worse outcomes in heart failure, CAD, and CKD [^67647ef5] [^e331a779].
- **Quality of life**: Fatigue, depression, and reduced independence [^e0a68b1a].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **systematic approach** is essential:

- **Initial tests**: CBC with indices, reticulocyte count, iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation), B12, folate, renal function, TSH, and inflammatory markers (CRP/ESR) [^17d23fe2].
- **Additional tests**: Hemolysis labs, bone marrow biopsy, or genetic testing if indicated [^notfound].
- **GI evaluation**: Endoscopy/colonoscopy for occult bleeding in iron deficiency anemia, especially in men and postmenopausal women [^6a71285d] [^bb17945e].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **cause-specific**:

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Oral iron (preferably alternate-day, low-dose) or IV iron if oral intolerance or malabsorption; correct the source of bleeding [^cc261f64] [^6a71285d].
- **Anemia of chronic inflammation/CKD**: Treat underlying disease, optimize iron status, and consider ESAs with caution (target Hb 10–11.5 g/dL) [^8dd2bbc7] [^e331a779].
- **Unexplained anemia**: Supportive care, treat reversible contributors, and monitor for progression [^3dc97811].
- **Transfusion**: Reserved for severe symptomatic anemia (generally Hb < 7–8 g/dL), with restrictive strategies favored in stable patients [^63be1734] [^9cd123bb].

---

## Special considerations

- **Perioperative anemia**: Common in older surgical patients; preoperative identification and optimization reduce morbidity and transfusion needs [^16610b93] [^2557c21c].
- **Multifactorial anemia**: Common in older adults; sequential, individualized management is recommended [^8dd2bbc7].
- **Patient-centered care**: Goals, comorbidities, and preferences guide intensity of evaluation and treatment [^6a71285d].

---

## Prognosis

Anemia is an **independent predictor of mortality, hospitalization, and functional decline** in older adults [^c5111835]. Even mild anemia (Hb 11.0–12.9 g/dL in men; 11.0–11.9 g/dL in women) is associated with adverse outcomes, emphasizing the importance of early detection and management [^3dc97811].

---

Geriatric anemia is common, multifactorial, and clinically significant. A **structured, cause-directed approach** — with careful evaluation, targeted therapy, and individualized transfusion thresholds — improves outcomes, though many cases remain unexplained and require ongoing monitoring and supportive care [^a3cf1342].

Abstract

With the global growing older adult population, clinicians face the common, yet complex challenge of how to evaluate and manage anemia in this population. Older age predisposes to common causes of anemia such as nutritional deficiencies, inflammatory disorders, chronic kidney disease, and hematologic malignancies. Failure to diagnose and appropriately manage anemia may result in decreased quality of life, impaired cognition, impaired mobility, and increased mortality. Anemia diagnosis in older adults presents a diagnostic conundrum because anemia may have a single cause, may be multifactorial, or may have no apparent cause even after an extensive evaluation. We believe a systematic approach to diagnosis ensures appropriate testing and avoids the pitfall of undertreatment and overtreatment. In this article we present our recommended approach through common scenarios for the management of anemia in the older adult.

A rise in the aging population has been predicted, and, as a result, it is expected that the incidence of age-related health conditions will also increase. Although common in the elderly, anemia is often mild and asymptomatic and rarely requires hospitalization. However, untreated anemia can be detrimental, because it is associated with increased mortality, poor health, fatigue, and functional dependence and can lead to cardiovascular and neurological complications. Several factors have been suggested to cause anemia in this population, for example, blood loss or chronic disease. In some cases, the cause is unknown. It has been suggested that this is a result of the presence of comorbid conditions that can mask the symptoms of anemia. Therefore, appropriate diagnosis and management strategies of anemia in the elderly need to be identified, particularly because anemia may indicate the presence of other serious diseases.

Conclusion

Anemia is a common sign with protean causes and manifestations. A systematic approach to evaluation and management of anemia ensures appropriate care that may optimize hemoglobin and potentially ameliorate anemia-related morbidity while minimizing unnecessary testing. Nevertheless, further research is necessary because often anemia in older age has no discernible cause or proven therapy.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^761ab40c]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. What constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, are significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### Medical and functional consequences of anemia in the elderly [^e0a68b1a]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in the elderly, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality in this population. It also has a negative effect on quality of life. Recent findings have shown that anemia can lead to cardiovascular and neurological complications, such as congestive heart failure and impaired cognitive function. In addition, anemia has been implicated in functional impairment and falls. Available data have shown that the successful management of this condition will not only improve patients' quality of life, but may also prevent the anemia from worsening.

### Anemia at older age: etiologies, clinical implications, and management [^698424be]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is quite frequently diagnosed in older individuals and is a key indicator of various reactive and clonal conditions. Many underlying diseases, like myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), develop preferentially in elderly individuals. The prevalence of anemia at older age is increasing, and this is mainly attributable to more frequently applied diagnostics and demographic changes in our societies. The etiology of anemia at older age is complex and ranges from bone marrow failure syndromes to chronic kidney disease, and from nutritional deficiencies to inflammatory processes including inflammaging in immunosenescence. In a smaller number of cases, no clear-cut etiology is identified. These patients are referred to as unexplained anemia or idiopathic cytopenia of unknown significance. In others, somatic mutations in leukocytes are found, but diagnostic criteria for MDS or other hematologic diseases are not fulfilled, a condition termed clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance. Management of anemias at older age depends on (1) the severity of the anemia, (2) underlying condition(s), and (3) patient-related factors, including comorbidities. Even a mild anemia may substantially affect physical and cognitive capacities and quality of life. An underestimated aspect is that because of age-related changes, organ function such as erythropoietin production in the kidney may become suboptimal. Management and treatment of anemia in older patients often require a multidisciplinary approach and detailed investigations of organ function. In this article, we review current concepts around anemias at older age, with special emphasis on etiologies, clinical implications, and innovative concepts in the management of these patients.

Does anemia have adverse effects in older adults?

There have been several studies highlighting the clinical relevance of anemia in older adults. Mild anemia has been associated with poor physical performance, lower muscle strength, and depression and is independently associated with increased mortality. Anemia also increases the risk of falls and hospitalizations and can lead to a decline in activities of daily living and decreased quality of life (QOL). Even in high-functioning older adults, anemia is associated with a 4-fold increase in risk for impaired executive function. In a large population-based study, anemia was associated with impaired health-related QOL and poor survival in older adults aged ≥ 60 years but not in younger adults. In addition, women with hemoglobin levels between 12 and 13 g/dL (above the WHO definition of anemia) also experienced lower health-related QOL. As we have few anemia corrective therapies, evidence that treating mild anemia or UAA attenuates these outcomes is limited.

The objective of this article is to present a case-based approach to management of anemia in the older adult population.

Introduction

Anemia is common in older adults and increases with advancing age. In the United States, up to 17% of individuals aged > 65 years experience anemia. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines anemia as a hemoglobin level of < 12.0 g/dL for women and of < 13.0 g/dL for men. This WHO definition of anemia is a population-based threshold, which may not fully capture clinically relevant changes in hemoglobin. Older adults who do not meet the WHO definition of anemia may still experience declines in hemoglobin that are associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. In older adults, approximately a third of anemia cases are due to nutritional deficiencies, a third are due to anemia of chronic diseases [anemia of inflammation (ACI) (also called anemia of chronic disease) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD)], and a third of cases are unexplained anemia of aging (UAA). As the older adult population continues to grow around the world, a concomitant rise in older-adult anemia suggests clinicians will benefit from a systematic approach to anemia management in older patients.

Causes of anemia in older adults

Definitive determination of a cause of anemia in older adults is difficult; furthermore, anemia may be multifactorial. Potential reasons why anemia is more common in older adults compared with younger adults, are because of hallmarks of aging such as hematopoietic stem cell exhaustion, cellular senescence, and dysregulated nutrient sensing. Older adults are more likely to develop gastrointestinal disorders leading to blood loss and malabsorption that may be compounded by anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents as well as a decline in nutrient intake. Chronic inflammation can be related to established comorbid illnesses (eg, rheumatoid arthritis [RA] and advanced cancer) and to some extent from aging alone. Inflammation leads to dysregulation in iron metabolism and a blunted hematopoietic response to erythropoietin (EPO). There is also a decline in nephron size and number that occurs with age that results in reduced EPO production in individuals with CKD. Age-associated decline in testosterone levels can have negative effects on erythropoiesis, thus, increasing the risk of anemia in older men. Undiagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloid precursor conditions such as clonal cytopenia of unknown significance (CCUS) are increasingly recognized as potential causes of anemia.

### Managing anemia in the cancer patient: old problems, future solutions [^a5efcf50]. The Oncologist (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia and associated symptoms commonly manifest in cancer patients and may have a considerable impact on outcomes. Preliminary studies suggest that overall survival and locoregional control following radiation therapy may be compromised by anemia, and recent preliminary data also suggest that anemia may be related to poorer outcomes following chemotherapy. Health-related quality of life of cancer patients is also significantly reduced by anemia. Treatment of anemia with recombinant human erythropoietin can improve these health-related quality-of-life outcomes. However, despite this knowledge, anemia remains under-recognized and under-treated in the cancer patient population. A number of issues may be determinants of this suboptimal management of anemia. These include limitations of current therapies for anemia, varying practice strategies, and the lack of guidelines on how to treat anemia. Additionally, clinicians may underestimate the importance of health-related quality of life for their patients. It is vital that these issues are addressed, which, together with the development of novel erythropoietic agents, a review of the guidelines for anemia management, and consideration of further outcomes such as survival and cognitive function, may help to ensure that the cancer patient receives the best possible course of supportive care.

### Not so benign haematology: anaemia of the elderly [^f76a00ce]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, are experiencing a change in demographics resulting in the largest proportion of adults over 65years of age that our health systems have ever experienced. As such, haematologists must be prepared to evaluate and treat anaemia in a more complicated patient population, but sufficient evidence-based guidelines are lacking. Critical next steps that must be taken to ensure the best care of this population include the determination of appropriate haemoglobin concentrations for older adults in light of age, gender, race, and comorbidities; the development of interventional trials that address physical performance outcomes in addition to haemoglobin targets; and translational studies which address the molecular pathogenesis of anaemia in older adults with the most advanced scientific approaches.

### Anemia in the elderly: a public health crisis in hematology [^82990e14]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Over 3 million people in the United States aged 65 years and older are anemic. This condition is associated with significant functional impairment and, perhaps, increased mortality. In March 2004, the American Society of Hematology (in conjunction with the National Institute of Aging) convened a "blue ribbon" panel of twenty physicians who are experts on various aspects of this topic. This paper highlights important consensus concepts resulting from that meeting. In particular, four areas of thought are shared. First, the epidemiology of anemia in the elderly is reviewed, including its definition, its expression in different racial groups, and its wide-ranging manifestations. Second, the pathophysiology of anemia in the elderly is reviewed as pertains to three general etiological categories (nutritional, chronic diseases, and so-called "unexplained" anemias). Particular emphasis is given to pathophysiologic mechanisms of anemia that are potentially unique to this age group. Third, a practical approach to the diagnosis and management of anemia for this patient population for the practicing hematologist is provided. Finally, the public health implications of anemia in the elderly for key stakeholder constituencies will be discussed in the oral presentation.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^82eb6e84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Perioperative anemia: prevention, diagnosis, and management throughout the spectrum of perioperative care [^16610b93]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Anemia is common in the perioperative period and is associated with poor patient outcomes. Remarkably, anemia is frequently ignored until hemoglobin levels drop low enough to warrant a red blood cell transfusion. This simplified transfusion-based approach has unfortunately shifted clinical focus away from strategies to adequately prevent, diagnose, and treat anemia through direct management of the underlying cause(s). While recommendations have been published for the treatment of anemia before elective surgery, information regarding the design and implementation of evidence-based anemia management strategies is sparse. Moreover, anemia is not solely a concern of the preoperative encounter. Rather, anemia must be actively addressed throughout the perioperative spectrum of patient care. This article provides practical information regarding the implementation of anemia management strategies in surgical patients throughout the perioperative period. This includes evidence-based recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of anemia, including the utility of iron supplementation and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).

### The definition of anemia in older persons… [^6357c47a]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

and primary cause of death. According to the WHO criteria, anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration below 7. 5 mmol/L in women and below
8. 1 mmol/L in men. Results Compared with persons with a normal hemoglobin concentration, the mortality risk was 1. 60, 1 but for older persons the criteria for anemia may not be as widely accepted as for. hemoglobin concentration and mortality in older persons. We used mortality data to determine whether the WHO criteria for hemoglobin concentration and the WHO definition of anemia are appropriate for persons aged 85 years and older.

We postulated that a low hemoglobin concentration represents underlying disease and supports evaluating the patient for possible causes of anemia. During follow-up, 133 of the 151 persons with anemia had died compared with 390 of the 599 persons with a normal hemoglobin concentration. Malignant neoplasms and infections were more often noted as the primary cause of death in persons with anemia, whereas respiratory diseases were more often noted as the primary cause.
8. 1 mmol/L in men. 1 These hemoglobin concentrations are based on data from young persons, but also were associated with an increased mortality risk in persons aged 85 years and older. Thus, the WHO criteria for anemia are also appropriate for persons aged 85 years and older, and age-dependent criteria are not. for example, by dehydration or obstructive pulmonary disease.

In our study, respiratory diseases were more often noted as the primary cause of death in persons with a normal hemoglobin concentration than in persons with anemia. These disorders will lead both to a higher hemoglobin concentration and an increase in mortality risk. In conclusion, the mortality risk was increased in older. persons with anemia if anemia was defined by the WHO criteria. 1 Thus, the WHO criteria are appropriate for older persons. Anemia in older persons is due to disease and not to aging. Therefore, further clinical investigation is warranted if an older person's hemoglobin concentration is below the WHO normal values — even if the person is without apparent clinical disease.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^6c6b70c2]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Anemia in COPD is frequent with a reported prevalence of 7.5% to 34%, and people with COPD and anemia are generally older with more frequent cardiometabolic comorbidities, greater dyspnea, worse quality of life and airflow obstruction, reduced exercise capacity, an increased risk of severe exacerbations and higher mortality. Anemia due to chronic disease is the most common type seen in COPD, followed by iron deficiency anemia, and is mainly related to chronic systemic inflammation and impaired iron utilization, and other possible reversible factors should be investigated including use of long-term oxygen, theophylline, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor inhibitors, renal dysfunction, and androgens. Although anemia has been established as an important comorbidity in COPD, optimal hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in these patients have not yet been defined, and it is also unclear whether its correction alters outcomes; however, hemoglobin assessment is advisable, particularly in more severely affected patients, and if anemia is diagnosed, a systematic search for a treatable cause is recommended in accordance with appropriate clinical guidelines.

### Prevalence of anaemia and associated factors among geriatric population from rural mangalore: a cross-sectional study [^3311dcf7]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Anaemia is a condition of not having sufficient healthy red blood cells or haemoglobin, which is the primary oxygen-carrying molecule, resulting in reduced oxygen delivery to vital organs. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), a condition with haemoglobin levels lower than 13 g/dL for men and 12 g/dL for women indicates anaemia. On the basis of haemoglobin levels, anaemia falls into categories of mild, moderate and severe. Anaemia prevalence rates of 0–20%, 21–40% and over 40% are classified as a public health issue of mild, moderate and severe significance respectively. Anaemia in elderly individuals is a common morbidity, and its incidence grows with age. A national health and nutrition examination survey conducted in the USA from 2013 to 2016 revealed that anaemia affects 65 years old and older people and increases with age for both men and women. The prevalence of anaemia among men aged 65–74 years was 7.4%, whereas for those aged ≥ 85 years it was 39.5%. As per a WHO report, the global prevalence of anaemia among the elderly population is 23.9%. In South-east Asia, the incidence of anaemia among elderly was 24.6% an the highest incidence (45.5%) of anaemia among elderly individuals was observed in Africa. According to a systematic review conducted in India, the combined prevalence of anaemia among the elderly population was 68.3%. The pathogenesis of anaemia is multifactorial and the greater number of comorbidities in elderly patients often makes it difficult to determine the exact aetiology. A decrease in red blood cell production, increased red blood cell destruction and hemorrhage lead to a reduced hemoglobin concentration or red blood cell count and further cause anaemia. The most common symptom of anaemia is fatigue and other prominent signs are pale skin, cold extremities, fast or irregular heartbeat, dyspnoea, chest pain, headaches, dizziness, syncope and hypotension. Anaemia in elderly individuals is often missed for diagnosis as anaemic symptoms such as weakness and exhaustion are construed to be related to natural ageing process. As anaemia is a clinical sign and not a disease it is important to identify and manage the underlying causes. Management strategies are based on the clinical presentation of anaemia. The severity of anaemia is influenced not only by its cause and extent of haemoglobin reduction but also by the presence of other health conditions, the patient's level of frailty and how quickly anaemia has developed. The factors that contribute to anaemia in older adults include nutritional deficiencies, chronic illnesses, malignancies, and conditions such as leukemia, multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes. Socioeconomic status and comorbidities also strongly influence the development and severity of anaemia in elderly individuals. Anaemia is a modifiable public health problem, hence early detection and management can prevent adverse outcomes like falls, cognitive decline, and functional dependence. Our study aimed to estimate hemoglobin levels, to classify anaemia on the basis of morphological features and evaluate the factors associated with anaemia among the elderly population above 60 years of age residing in rural areas of Mangalore.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^99564ccb]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

Management of uncommon causes of anemia

Management of anemia in older adults with SCD and other inherited red cell disorders includes management of acute and chronic causes. Fortunately, our patient's splenic infarction and LUQ pain resolved. Her hemoglobin returned to her baseline at 9.8 g/dL and LDH level normalized, which were also associated with resolution of her fatigue. She did not require RBC transfusion. We discontinued iron therapy given the improvement in hemoglobin and TSAT. After acute complications are controlled, routine SCD management strategies should be performed. Hydroxyurea has been shown to increase hemoglobin, reduce vaso-occlusive events, and improve survival in individuals with SCD. Voxelotor may also improve chronic anemia in individuals with SCD.

Case 4 educational points

Some older adults with anemia may have uncommon causes, such as undiagnosed hemoglobinopathies or hemolytic anemias. A systematic approach with review of medical history, family history, and laboratory perturbations, inclusive of the peripheral smear, should provide clues to diagnose rarer causes of anemia in older adults. The anemia may be compounded by typical causes of anemia in older adults (eg, nutritional deficiencies, ACI, CKD, and hematologic malignancies); however, these issues may occur earlier in life.

The elderly

28. Iron deficiency is common in the elderly, and is often multifactorial in aetiology (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

29. We recommend that the risks and benefits of invasive endoscopic and alternative investigation(s) are carefully considered in those with major comorbidities and/or limited performance status (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia is common in older people, affecting more than 20% of those over the age of 85 years, and more than 50% of residential/nursing home residents. The aetiologies responsible for anaemia in this age group are complex, and often multiple. Iron deficiency is however a contributory factor in about half of cases, sometimes associated with deficiencies of vitamin B12 and/or folate. Anaemia in older patients has been shown to contribute to worsening of physical performance, cognitive function and frailty.

Iron deficiency in the elderly has many potential contributory causes including poor diet, reduced iron absorption, occult blood loss, medication (eg, aspirin) and chronic disease (eg, CKD, CHF). Blood loss from mucosal lesions may be compounded by concurrent antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy. Older patients are more likely than younger ones to have more than one contributing cause. The diagnosis can be confirmed by measurement of ferritin and transferrin saturation, though the former may be difficult to interpret in the presence of coexisting inflammatory conditions.

Evaluation of the upper and lower GI tract should be considered if IDA has been confirmed, though CT colonography may be a more attractive alternative to colonoscopy for some older individuals. The prevalence of malignancy and of dual unrelated pathology in this age group strengthens the case for imaging both the upper and lower GI tract. However, the potential risks and benefits of invasive investigation should be carefully weighed up in older adults, particularly those who are frail, have significant comorbidities or reduced life expectancy. Furthermore, these considerations should be discussed with each patient and his/her family, taking their views into account.

As in other age groups, the cause of IDA cannot always be established despite thorough investigation. Oral iron administration remains the standard first-line treatment in most patients, but parenteral iron is a convenient and relatively safe alternative if oral iron is not tolerated.

### New horizons in iron deficiency anaemia in older adults [^f7fc4df2]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common in older adults and associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Differentiating iron deficiency from other causes of anaemia is important to ensure appropriate investigations and treatment. It is possible to make the diagnosis reliably using simple blood tests. Clinical evaluation and assessment are required to help determine the underlying cause and to initiate appropriate investigations. IDA in men and post-menopausal females is most commonly due to occult gastrointestinal blood loss until proven otherwise, although there is a spectrum of underlying causative pathologies. Investigation decisions should take account of the wishes of the patient and their competing comorbidities, individualising the approach. Management involves supplementation using oral or intravenous (IV) iron then consideration of treatment of the underlying cause of deficiency. Future research areas are outlined including the role of Hepcidin and serum soluble transferrin receptor measurement, quantitative faecal immunochemical testing, alternative dosing regimens and the potential role of IV iron preparations.

### The hidden burden of anemia in elderly surgical patients: a prospective study on incidence and contributing factors [^2557c21c]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Among elderly surgical patients, anemia is a significant but often overlooked condition that increases mortality, prolongs hospital stays, delays recovery, and heightens perioperative morbidity. This situation leads to substantial medical expenses and negatively impacts patients' quality of life after surgery. Although anemia is common, it is frequently misdiagnosed or inadequately treated during the perioperative period. Early detection and treatment of anemia through nutritional optimization, iron supplementation, and patient blood management techniques can improve surgical outcomes and enhance the cost-effectiveness of care.

Despite considerable evidence linking anemia to poor surgical outcomes in elderly patients, context-specific data regarding surgery are scarce, particularly in resource-limited areas. Understanding the incidence and risk factors of anemia in elderly surgical patients is essential for guiding early interventions, improving perioperative care, and enhancing outcomes for this vulnerable population.

Therefore, the main goal of this study is to examine the incidence of anemia and its risk factors in elderly surgical patients. The findings are expected to support the implementation of targeted preoperative screening and management strategies, identify modifiable predictors, and highlight the burden of anemia in this population, ultimately improving patient safety and reducing healthcare costs.

### Unexplained anemia of aging: etiology, health consequences, and diagnostic criteria [^3dc97811]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Anemia is prevalent in men and women over the age of 65 years and becomes progressively more common with age. Anemia is associated with reductions in functional capacity and quality of life, as well an increased risk of death from all causes. Roughly one third of anemia in older patients is unexplained (UAA). Although the WHO diagnostic thresholds for anemia are most frequently used, evidence supports the use of a single criterion of Hb < 13 g/dl in both older men and postmenopausal women. Even mild anemia (Hb 11.0–12.9) is associated with poor clinical outcomes, lower QOL, and elevated mortality. Although UAA is currently diagnosed by exclusion of identifiable causes for anemia, the diagnostic criteria for UAA are clearly defined, and the UAA patient population experiences significant functional decline, morbidity, and mortality. In part due to the lack of consensus on the etiology of UAA, treatment options are extremely limited at present. Novel therapies are currently in development for the treatment of this highly prevalent condition. Finally, we strongly recommend routine assessment of functional capacity and quality of life in all older patients by healthcare providers, particularly those suffering from anemia, using standardized tools that will help to identify functional deficits and changes in functional capacity in older patients with anemia.

Management of multifactorial anemia

After ascertaining potential causes, we first aim to treat with the most specific agent. For example, potential IDA will be treated first. Uncontrolled comorbid inflammatory illness should be appropriately managed. Anemia can best be ascribed to remaining causes, such as CKD after sequential exclusion or optimal management of other conditions. For residual anemia with CKD, we adhere to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines on hemoglobin threshold and targets for ESA. Importantly, we do not aim for normalization of hemoglobin levels when using ESAs and only initiate at hemoglobin level of < 10 g/dL and avoid exceeding hemoglobin levels of > 11 g/dL to minimize cardiovascular complications.

Because the patient has a history of bariatric surgery, ACI, and anemia of CKD, we continued nutritional optimization with B12 injections, started IV iron to maintain ferritin between 300 and 500 ng/mL, and deferred ESA because of stable hemoglobin at 9.5 g/dL. Symptoms of fatigue and exercise tolerance substantially improved.

Case 3 educational points

Anemia in older adults is often multifactorial and should be evaluated and managed with a sequential approach. Nutritional deficiencies should also be corrected and maintained with special attention to maintaining adequate iron stores in patients treated with ESAs. ACI is managed by treating the underlying chronic inflammatory conditions whenever possible.

### The prevalence and etiology of anemia and the association between anemia and all-cause mortality: a cohort study over a 9-year period [^8d49b7a8]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

From a global perspective, China shares the health challenges related to anemia faced by other countries with rapidly aging populations. China stands out, however, as it already has the world's largest older population, and the burden of anemia among the elderly in China will increase further. Research by Chinese scholars indicates that the prevalence of anemia in the urban community-dwelling elderly population in Beijing is 14.8%, increasing to 24.1% in those aged 80 years and above. Additionally, the anemia diagnostic criteria used in the Chinese healthcare system (hemoglobin concentrations below 120 g/L for men and 110 g/L for women) are lower than the WHO standards, indicating that the number of elderly individuals in China requiring intervention for anemia may be greater than previously reported. Therefore, identifying the risk factors for anemia in the aging population, early identification of at-risk populations, and development of targeted screening and intervention measures are crucial. The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) is an ongoing longitudinal survey that conducts multiple hemoglobin measurements, health function assessments, and long-term follow-ups in cohort populations, providing a valuable opportunity for research on Chinese elderly individuals.

This study analyzes the prevalence and trends of anemia among individuals aged 60 years and above in China on the basis of CHARLS data, explores the risk factors for anemia in elderly individuals, and identifies potential patients with anemia. Through correlational analyses of the prognosis of elderly patients with anemia, this study enhances the understanding of the impact of anemia on the survival of older adults, aiding in the management of anemia in this population and improving their quality of life and life expectancy.

### Cost of anemia in the elderly [^eab73b79]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

As the aging population and the incidence of age-related health conditions increase, the cost of healthcare is also expected to rise. Anemia commonly occurs in the elderly, and is associated with a number of health conditions such as falls, weakness, and immobility. It can also lead to more-serious complications such as cardiovascular and neurological impairments. Consequently, anemia can have a significant effect on healthcare requirements and healthcare expenditure. Research is needed into the opportunity to reduce costs.

Conclusion

Anaemia as defined using WHO criteria is common in older people living in the community, and is higher in the older old and black people. It is particularly common amongst nursing home residents and older people admitted to hospital. The presence of anaemia is associated with a worse prognosis, with increases in morbidity and mortality. Predicted demographic changes will increase the burden and underline the need to understand more about anaemia in older people.

### Unexplained anemia of aging: etiology, health consequences, and diagnostic criteria [^aafe417c]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Up to 15% of people aged 60 and over are anemic, and the prevalence of anemia increases with age. In older men and women, anemia is associated with increases in the risk of death and all-cause hospitalization, poor functional capacity, quality of life, and depression.

Methods and Results

We reviewed the literature describing anemia in aging populations, focusing on the specific diagnostic criteria of anemia and potential causes in older men and women. Even after extensive etiologic workup that involves careful medical history, physical examination, laboratory measurements, and additional studies such as bone marrow biopsy, anemia of aging is unexplained in up to 40% of older patients with anemia. As a result, treatment options remain limited.

Conclusions

The prevalence of unexplained anemia of aging (UAA; also called unexplained anemia of the elderly, UAE), its deleterious impacts on health, physical function, and quality of life, and the lack of effective treatment or therapy guidelines represent a compelling unmet clinical need. In this review and consensus document, we discuss the scope of the problem, possible causes of UAA, diagnostic criteria, and potential treatment options. Because even mild anemia is strongly linked to poor clinical outcomes, it should receive clinical attention rather than simply being considered a normal part of aging.

The fifth limitation was that the target population was limited to the Japanese HD population. Further studies might be required for different countries.

The last limitation is the heterogeneity of the elderly population. The present study treated the elderly and nonelderly populations as a whole. However, clinical common sense suggests that there is a wide variety of patient characteristics in terms of nutrition, physical activity and frailty. Although some of these factors have been adjusted by covariates, some remained unadjusted or were even not investigated. Therefore, the heterogeneities should be considered when applying the present data to the actual population.

### Prevalence of anaemia in older persons: systematic review [^60a78637]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The similar prevalence found in studies published before and after 2000 suggests that significant advances in identifying and/or treating anaemia in older people have not been made in recent years. It is estimated that for between 14% and 50% of cases of anaemia in the elderly, the underlying cause is unexplained. We know little about whether it is preventable, or how much is associated with medications for other medical conditions of older age, except for NSAIDs and perhaps low dose aspirin. There does not appear to be an extensive literature on therapy, and whether therapy improves quality of life and outcomes in older people.

We, as others before, find the limitations of the literature, especially the small number of larger studies in defined communities with defined criteria, limit any methodological considerations without the danger of over analysis. To some extent the unanswered questions are more interesting than those that can be answered – for example about the causes, health and economic consequences, and treatment of anaemia in older people, and the desirability or otherwise of using different action levels than the WHO definitions of anaemia. While the usual call for more research is often rather lame, in this case the extraordinary expected growth in the numbers of older people, coupled with the high prevalence and potentially serious consequences of anaemia, suggest that in this case more research is a sensible conclusion.

### Anemia in older persons [^6d439f4c]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia in older persons is commonly overlooked despite mounting evidence that low hemoglobin levels are a significant marker of physiologic decline. Using the World Health Organization definition of anemia (hemoglobin level less than 13 g per dL [130 g per L] in men and less than 12 g per dL [120 g per L] in women), more than 10 percent of persons older than 65 years are anemic. The prevalence increases with age, approaching 50 percent in chronically ill patients living in nursing homes. There is increasing evidence that even mild anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Anemia warrants evaluation in all older persons, except those at the end of life or who decline interventions. About one third of persons have anemia secondary to a nutritional deficiency, one third have anemia caused by chronic inflammation or chronic kidney disease, and one third have unexplained anemia. Nutritional anemia is effectively treated with vitamin or iron replacement. Iron deficiency anemia often is caused by gastrointestinal bleeding and requires further investigation in most patients. Anemia of chronic inflammation or chronic kidney disease may respond to treatment of the underlying disease and selective use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. The treatment of unexplained anemia is difficult, and there is little evidence that treatment decreases morbidity and mortality, or improves quality of life. Occasionally, anemia may be caused by less common but potentially treatable conditions, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, malignancy, or myelodysplastic syndrome.

KDIGO anemia guideline methods for guideline development and implementation describe the update plan, recommendation structure, benefit–harm assessment, patient preferences, algorithms, and implementation scope. There is no date set for updating, and the need for updating will depend on publication of new evidence with ongoing studies reviewed periodically for potential impact. Each guideline chapter contains recommendations for management of CKD patients at risk for or with anemia, with the strength of the recommendation and the quality of evidence provided in parenthesis within each recommendation. The benefits and harm for each comparison of interventions are provided in summary tables and summarized in evidence profiles, and many recommendations are Level 2 or 'discretionary' which indicates a greater need to help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences. Algorithms are referenced when appropriate with a graphical description of care stages (see Chapter 4). Implementation notes state these recommendations are global, that review criteria were not suggested because implementation is discretionary, and that suggestions were provided for future research. Methodological frameworks cited include the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation criteria, the Conference on Guideline Standardization checklist, and the Institute of Medicine's Standards for Systematic Reviews and Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust, with supplementary appendices describing online search strategies and concurrence with Institute of Medicine standards.

### Prevalence of anaemia in older persons: systematic review [^d75925c0]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The world population is ageing; in 2000 there were 600 million people aged 60 or over, and it is estimated that this figure will double by 2025, and more than triple to 2 billion by 2050. Between 2007 and 2027 the number of people aged 65 years or older in England alone is predicted to increase by 200,000 each year, rising from eight to 12 million over that 20-year period. In the USA numbers aged 65 years or older are predicted to rise from 37 million in 2006 to 63 million by 2025.

The "oldest old", often defined as those aged 85 or older, show the largest increase in numbers. By 2066 it is anticipated that there will be almost a third of a million people aged 100 years or older, in a population of 70 million in the UK. In the USA the prediction is for a third of a million over the age of 100 years by 2020.

This demographic change has obvious implications for individuals and society. It will impact particularly on healthcare provision, especially as longer life does not necessarily mean more years enjoyed in good health. It becomes increasingly important to highlight common medical problems in older people, especially if their extent and potential significance are not generally recognised. We suspected that anaemia might be one such problem.

Anaemia is often defined in terms of the WHO criteria, established in 1968. The WHO definition of anaemia is a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration < 130 g/L in men, and < 120 g/L in women. There has been debate about the use of these values, and in particular, whether they should be used to define anaemia in older people, but there is no widely accepted alternative definition of anaemia in this age group.

### Age and anemia management: relationship of hemoglobin levels with mortality might differ between elderly and nonelderly hemodialysis patients [^61de0358]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Low hemoglobin (Hb) levels have been associated with cardiovascular events, mortality, health-related quality of life or physical activities in many observational studies on hemodialysis (HD) patients, although randomized controlled trials have indicated that normal Hb values were not necessarily associated with better survival among the HD population and predialysis patients. Therefore, anemia control is one of the most important factors in the management of HD patients.

The Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) is an international observational study. The cohort has provided a wide range of information concerning clinical outcomes, practice patterns and HD treatment itself. The DOPPS has included several studies on anemia management, which have indicated that low Hb levels may be associated with adverse outcomes.

The epidemiology of the HD population has been changing worldwide. The elderly HD population is growing. Old people experience a high incidence of cardiovascular complications and reduced level of activity in daily life. It is known that increased Hb does not necessarily improve prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease. Moreover, many elderly patients have low Hb levels despite the high doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) received. Thus, there could be some specific differences in the Hb target for such HD patients.

Therefore, we aimed to elucidate whether the Hb target for optimal anemia control in the elderly population differs from that in the nonelderly HD population.

### Prevalence and outcomes of anemia in geriatrics: a systematic review of the literature [^4eb02d39]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common concern in geriatric health, but its exact incidence and prevalence are unclear. Several studies have addressed this issue with discrepant results. Estimates of anemia prevalence reported in the articles reviewed here range from 2.9% to 61% in elderly men and from 3.3% to 41% in elderly women. This variability is related to a number of factors, including the setting of the study, the health status of the subject population, and the criteria used to define anemia. The criteria set by the World Health Organization (WHO) — hemoglobin level < 120.0 g/L for women and < 130.0 g/L for men — are most frequently, but not universally, used. Even so, their appropriateness in older populations may be questioned. Most existing reports indicate that elderly men have higher rates of anemia than do elderly women, but the threshold values are, in general, higher for men than for women. Incidence of anemia rises with age; some studies report a particularly notable increase in prevalence of anemia in the oldest subjects, those ≥ 85 years of age. Whereas anemia is associated with symptoms ranging from weakness and fatigue to increased falls and depression, and in severe cases can lead to congestive heart failure, few studies have systematically examined functional, clinical, and economic outcomes or patient satisfaction in the elderly with anemia. Future directions for research on anemia should include a more detailed examination of the importance of aging or age-related diseases on the pathogenesis of anemia, an assessment of the importance of anemia on outcomes such as physical function and cognitive function, and an analysis of whether impairments associated with anemia are amenable to correction by improving hemoglobin concentration.

The relationship between Hb levels and survival might differ according to age. Lower Hb levels did not relate to poor prognosis among the elderly population. This reinforces the need for individualizations of anemia management.

Implications for public health policy

The significant incidence of anemia among elderly surgical patients identified in this study highlights a serious and often neglected public health issue, especially in resource-limited settings. The findings emphasize the need for national surgical safety and geriatric care strategies to incorporate regular perioperative anemia screening and management procedures. By integrating standardized anemia assessments into pre-surgical evaluations — particularly for high-risk populations such as those with comorbidities, emergency situations, and substance abuse — it is possible to enhance surgical outcomes, reduce hospital stays, and minimize the risk of postoperative complications.

Moreover, policies that promote access to essential diagnostics (such as hemoglobin and iron studies) and treatments (such as iron supplements and erythropoiesis-stimulating medications) should be prioritized, particularly in public hospitals serving vulnerable elderly populations. Investing in blood conservation technologies and educating medical professionals on perioperative optimization and anemia risk assessment could further reduce costs. Overall, the study confirms that health systems urgently need to identify and address anemia as a modifiable surgical risk factor within broader frameworks for surgical readiness and older adult health.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^cc261f64]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Management of IDA

Management of IDA in older adults includes iron supplementation and addressing the cause of IDA. Repletion of iron using oral iron formulations, typically containing 50 to 65 mg of elemental iron, can be challenging for many older adults because of side effects such as constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping.

A misconception exists that high-dose oral iron, 3 times a day, represents the best way to treat IDA. The absorption of oral iron is optimal when it is taken on an empty stomach (1 hour before a meal or 2 hours after a meal). Alternate day dosing of oral iron also allows better absorption because there is an acute rise in hepcidin for 24 hours after oral iron is ingested. For management of IDA in older adults, 1 study found equivalent hemoglobin response and iron repletion, but with less toxicity, with once daily iron at 15 mg compared with 50 mg or 150 mg of iron daily. Consequently, in patients who do not tolerate formulations with > 50 mg of elemental iron, a switch to low-dose iron formulations should be considered.

IV iron is recommended for patients who have an intolerance or inadequate response to oral iron or malabsorption conditions such as history of gastric bypass. Numerous IV iron formulations exist. Iron replacement has been previously reviewed. From a practical perspective, institutions may have preferred IV iron formulations.

The patient in case 2 was treated with 1 dose of IV low–molecular weight dextran 1000 mg. Her walking endurance improved, and she achieved a normal hemoglobin level. She continued oral ferrous sulfate every other day because of an ongoing need for aspirin for secondary prevention of CAD. We concluded that the patient had occult gastrointestinal bleeding from either gastritis or an occult source. Small-bowel interrogation is a consideration now or in the future. We recommended at least annual monitoring for development of new symptoms or recurrence of IDA.

Case 2 educational points

In older adults with IDA, it is important to determine the cause of iron deficiency and review how the patient is taking oral iron and adherence to iron supplementation and side effects. Counsel patients on methods of taking iron that will promote optimal absorption, such as alternate day dosing and taking it on an empty stomach. IV iron is generally safe for older adults and should be used in patients who are unable to tolerate, or respond inadequately to, oral iron supplementation.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^17d23fe2]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Algorithm for evaluation and treatment of anemia in older adults. The evaluation and management of anemia in the older adult start with a standard anemia evaluation to exclude easily treatable causes such as nutritional deficiencies and thyroid disease. If easily treatable causes are excluded or residual anemia remains after treatment, then continue to evaluate for other causes of anemia. If all other causes of anemia are excluded, then the patient may meet criteria for UAA. ∗Ferritin levels increase with age and patients with conditions such as chronic heart failure or inflammatory disorders may experience absolute iron deficiency at ferritin levels up to 100 μg/L and as high as 300 μg/L if the TSAT is < 20%. ∗∗Folate is an uncommon cause of nutritional deficiencies but can be seen in patients with excessive alcohol use and poor nutrient intake. † Red-flag signs include a MCV of > 96 fL, an absolute neutrophil count of < 1000 cells/μL, platelet count of < 120 × 10 9 /L, a family history of blood cancers, abnormal peripheral smear, significant anemia at < 9 g/dL, and worsening unexplained anemia. †† Overlap exists between UAA and ICUS. UAA is a diagnosis of exclusion, made only in older adults, whereas ICUS may be diagnosed in patients of any age with ≥ 1 cytopenia and clonal hematopoiesis with VAF of ≤ 2%. We favor UAA categorization in cases with mild anemia (often hemoglobin of < 2 g/dL below lower limit of normal), no other cytopenia, no other cause, and if blood and/or BM testing is performed, absence of dyspoiesis or hematologic malignancy. DAT, direct antiglobulin test; MMA, methylmalonic acid.

### Geriatric trauma management [^9cd123bb]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Geriatric trauma — hemoglobin, transfusion, and fluid resuscitation are characterized by lower admission hemoglobin, frequent anemia, and careful fluid strategies. Older adult trauma patients generally have lower admission hemoglobin levels and receive more early and total units of packed RBC transfusions, and about 10% of geriatric trauma patients are anemic at baseline; low baseline hemoglobin could be an independent mortality predictor, and older adult patients also leave the hospital with lower hemoglobin levels. Restrictive transfusion protocols appear to be safe in geriatric trauma patients, and they may be associated with decreased complications and shortened LOS. When shock is due to hemorrhage, limiting crystalloids after hospital arrival is advised because fluid resuscitation may promote coagulopathy by diluting coagulation factors, may also cause hypothermia, and the excessive rise of mean arterial pressure may promote further hemorrhage; optimal fluid type, volume and velocity, endpoints, and perfusion pressure regulation remain controversial and definitive standards are undefined in critically ill patients. For nonhemorrhagic shock states, be cautious regarding iatrogenic fluid overload but do not let this concern delay or prevent resuscitation; combine the repeated administration of 250 mL to 500 mL boluses with frequent patient reassessment to minimize the risk of iatrogenic fluid overload. Older adults often take anticoagulant medication, which increases risk of hemorrhage.

### The hidden burden of anemia in elderly surgical patients: a prospective study on incidence and contributing factors [^cf810a93]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The global population is rapidly aging due to advancements in healthcare and increased life expectancy. Consequently, a growing number of elderly individuals are undergoing surgery. According to the United Nations (UN) World Population Prospects, the number of people aged 65 and older was approximately 727 million in 2020 and is projected to reach 1.5 billion by 2050, with the highest growth occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Currently, individuals over 65 account for 30–40% of all surgeries, presenting unique perioperative management challenges.

Caring for elderly surgical patients poses distinct difficulties for anesthetists, anesthesiologists, and surgeons due to age-related physiological changes, reduced physiological reserves, and altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anesthetic drugs. Additionally, many elderly patients have multiple comorbidities, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and neurocognitive impairments, further complicating perioperative care.

Given the rising prevalence of frailty, cognitive impairment, and multimorbidity among elderly surgical patients, a multidisciplinary approach is essential. Involvement of geriatricians, surgeons, anesthetists, anesthesiologists, and perioperative care teams can enhance outcomes through preoperative optimization, individualized anesthetic planning, enhanced recovery protocols, and blood conservation strategies.

One critical yet often overlooked factor in geriatric surgical patients is anemia, particularly among hospitalized elderly individuals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), anemia affects over 1.6 billion people worldwide, with its incidence among those aged 65 and older ranging from 20 to 40%, depending on the population studied.

For surgical populations, the incidence is significantly higher. Global research indicates that between 30% and 60% of elderly patients admitted for major surgery are anemic, with percentages varying by region, comorbidity, and access to care. A multicenter study conducted in the United States found perioperative anemia in nearly 35% of patients aged 65 and older, and reports from Europe and Asia suggest that anemia rates among elderly orthopedic and cardiac surgery patients exceed 50%.

### Consequences of anemia in geriatric hip fractures: how low is too low? [^867e52dd]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As our society ages, the number of geriatric patients presenting to trauma centers after a fall is ever increasing. Hip fractures are one of the most common injuries sustained in this population accounting for more than 300 000 hospital admissions, annually. Care for these patients is complicated by increased frailty and a higher rate of medical comorbidities which increase the risk of perioperative complications. In addition, the prevalence of anemia is high, resulting in a greater need for perioperative blood transfusions. The adverse sequelae of blood transfusions have been widely documented and include cardiogenic complications, surgical site infection, 30-day mortality, and 1-year readmission. Restrictive transfusion strategies are therefore more widely accepted.

Studies evaluating anemia in geriatric patients with hip fracture have been performed and some advocate for a higher transfusion threshold in this patient population. Geriatric patients have a higher risk of frailty and their physiologic reserve may not tolerate a restrictive transfusion practice. One meta-analysis of restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies in older adults found that liberal transfusion strategies might produce better outcomes in this patient population. A second meta-analysis investigated the effects of transfusion thresholds ranging from 7 g/dL to 10 g/dL in elderly patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. They found that a restrictive policy led to an increased risk of ischemic events or acute kidney injury.

The exact hemoglobin (Hgb) value where the benefit of preventing anemia-related complications outweighs the risks associated with a transfusion remains unclear in the geriatric population. Given this uncertainty, clinicians may be hesitant to comply with restrictive blood transfusion strategies in this patient population. Therefore, our hypothesis was that adverse events are only increased in geriatric patients with hip fracture who sustain Hgb levels less than 7.0 g/dL. We sought to answer this by identifying the Hgb threshold where adverse events were more prevalent.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^bb17945e]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

1. Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

2. IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia affects about a third of the global population and is a major cause of morbidity worldwide. Iron deficiency is one of the dominant causes, and the resulting anaemia (iron deficiency anaemia (IDA)) has a point prevalence of 2%–5% among adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world.

IDA is the most common form of anaemia seen in primary care in the UK. It is estimated to account for more than 57 000 emergency admissions to UK hospitals each year, costing the National Health Service (NHS) more than £55 million per annum.

While menstrual loss is commonly the cause of IDA in premenopausal women, IDA in adult men and postmenopausal women is often due to chronic blood loss from the GI tract. IDA may be the first presenting manifestation of colonic or oesophago-gastric carcinoma, highlighting the importance of swift and complete investigation. There are however many other recognised causes of IDA (table 1) including malabsorption (most commonly from coeliac disease (CD) in the UK), poor dietary intake, blood donation, gastrectomy and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). IDA is often multifactorial, and dual pathology (ie, significant disease in both upper and lower GI tract) is found in 1%–10% of cases — this should be particularly considered in the older patient.

Table 1
Pathological disorders associated with iron deficiency anaemia

IDA may present in primary care, or across a range of specialties in secondary care, and historically the management of IDA was often suboptimal — with investigation being slow, inadequate or incomplete. Over recent years, however, the recognition that IDA may reflect serious underlying GI pathology has resulted in increasing involvement of gastroenterology services. IDA may now account for 10% or more of all gastroenterology referrals, and a typical district hospital unit in the UK with a catchment of 250 000 may have in excess of 400 IDA referrals per annum.

### Anemia in older adults [^f4ad26bf]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

Special situations — young women

IDA is common in young women, and major contributory factors include menstrual losses, pregnancy and poor dietary intake (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
Underlying GI pathology is uncommon in young women with IDA, and so after screening for CD, we recommend that further investigation is warranted only if there are additional clinical features of concern — as detailed in the text (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
If GI investigation in a pregnant woman is deemed necessary prior to delivery, gastroscopy and (after the first trimester) MR enterography are considered safe in pregnancy (evidence quality — low, consensus — 91%, statement strength — strong).

Special situations — young men

Confirmed IDA is uncommon in young men, but when found we recommend that it warrants the same investigational algorithm as for older people (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Special situations — the elderly

Iron deficiency is common in the elderly, and is often multifactorial in aetiology (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that the risks and benefits of invasive endoscopic and alternative investigation(s) are carefully considered in those with major comorbidities and/or limited performance status (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

Special situations — specific comorbidities

Functional iron deficiency (FID) is a common contributory factor to the anaemia associated with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
Iron deficiency is common in chronic heart failure (CHF), and is often multifactorial (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
Parenteral IRT may improve symptoms and quality of life in CHF with FID (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
In the management of iron deficiency associated with CKD or CHF, reference to the appropriate specialist published guidelines is recommended (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
IDA is a common manifestation of IBD, particularly when the disease is active (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
Intolerance and malabsorption of oral IRT can be particular problems in the treatment of IBD-associated IDA, and parenteral IRT may be required (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### The hidden burden of anemia in elderly surgical patients: a prospective study on incidence and contributing factors [^18ba8302]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, the incidence of anemia among older adults is particularly high, often exceeding 45% due to persistent malnutrition, chronic infections, parasitic diseases, and limited healthcare access. Elderly patients in these regions frequently seek surgical care late, arriving with untreated chronic illnesses and poor nutritional reserves, which exacerbates surgical risks.

In Ethiopia, comprehensive data on anemia among elderly surgical patients is lacking. However, evidence from limited hospital-based studies and observational audits indicates that anemia affects 40–60% of elderly patients undergoing surgery. While the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) reports widespread anemia in the general population, there is a critical need for elderly-specific, surgery-focused data to inform local clinical practices and policy decisions.

Unlike younger patients, who often develop anemia due to acute blood loss or specific disorders, anemia in the elderly results from complex interactions among aging, chronic disease, and impaired compensatory mechanisms. Common causes include bone marrow suppression, chronic inflammation, renal insufficiency, and deficiencies in iron, vitamin B12, or folate.

Anemia is an independent risk factor for poor surgical outcomes, including infections, delayed wound healing, and cardiovascular complications. Major surgeries — such as orthopedic, cardiac, and oncologic procedures — exacerbate anemia due to intraoperative blood loss and hemodilution. Elderly patients, with their reduced physiological reserves, struggle to compensate for perioperative anemia, leading to increased reliance on blood transfusions. However, transfusions carry risks such as infections, immunosuppression, and fluid overload. Therefore, optimizing hemoglobin levels before surgery and implementing blood conservation techniques are crucial for improving outcomes.

Anemia significantly impacts surgical outcomes, anesthesia management, and healthcare costs. The reduced oxygen-carrying capacity increases the risk of hemodynamic instability, intraoperative hypoxia, and delayed emergence from anesthesia. Careful fluid management, transfusion planning, and anesthetic agent selection are necessary to minimize cardiovascular stress. Additionally, anemia heightens the risk of perioperative complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and postoperative infections, leading to prolonged hospital stays, extended recovery periods, and higher readmission rates. In high-risk surgeries, such as major abdominal or cardiac procedures, anemia markedly increases the risk of surgical mortality.

### Prevalence of anaemia in older persons: systematic review [^eaac8474]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Ageing populations will impact on healthcare provision, especially since extra years are not necessarily spent in good health. It is important to identify and understand the significance of common medical problems in older people. Anaemia may be one such problem. We report on the prevalence of anaemia in cohorts of elderly people in the general population. The presence of anaemia is associated with a worse prognosis for both morbidity and mortality.

Methods

Electronic searching and reference lists of published reports were used to identify studies that reported on prevalence of anaemia in cohorts of at least 100 individuals predominantly aged 65 years and over living in developed countries, together with criteria used to define anaemia. Studies of anaemia prevalence in specific disease groups or published before 1980 were excluded. Prevalence data for the entire cohort, for men and women separately and for different age bands were extracted.

Results

Forty-five studies contributed data. Thirty-four studies (n = 85,409) used WHO criteria to define anaemia. The weighted mean prevalence was 17% (3–50%) overall, and 12% (3–25%) in studies based in the community (27, n = 69,975), 47% (31–50%) in nursing homes (3, n = 1481), and 40% (40–72%) in hospital admissions (4, n = 13,953). Anaemia prevalence increased with age, was slightly higher in men than women, and was higher in black people than white. Most individuals classified as anaemic using WHO criteria were only mildly anaemic.

Conclusion

Anaemia, as defined by WHO criteria, is common in older people living in the community and particularly common in nursing home residents and hospital admissions. Predicted demographic changes underline the need to understand more about anaemia in older people.

### The prevalence and etiology of anemia and the association between anemia and all-cause mortality: a cohort study over a 9-year period [^9f0fe60c]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Anemia is an important global health issue. Although the clinical manifestations and complications of anemia vary on the basis of its type and severity, anemia can lead to immune dysfunction, gastrointestinal disturbances, cognitive dysfunction and impaired thermoregulation. Additionally, anemia may serve as a risk or prognostic factor for other diseases, such as pulmonary tuberculosis and heart failure.

As the pace of world population growth slows and economic levels rise, the global population suffering from anemia has shown a declining trend. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of anemia (hemoglobin concentrations below 130 g/L for men and 120 g/L for women), the worldwide prevalence of anemia decreased from 40.2% in 1990 to 26.8% in 2019. While there are certain differences in the prevalence of anemia among regions and countries due to factors such as ethnicity, economic level, and dietary habits, the overall trend is one of decline. However, the prevalence of anemia among elderly populations has been increasing annually. In 2013, the overall prevalence of anemia among Americans aged 65 and older was 17%, whereas it was only 10% in 2009. In hospitalized elderly patients, the prevalence of anemia can be as high as 50%. These findings suggest that the factors contributing to anemia in older adults differ significantly from those in younger populations, necessitating tailored health guidance for elderly individuals. Many scholars believe that the increasing incidence of anemia among the elderly may be related to aging-related chronic inflammation, nutritional deficiency and the increased incidence of other diseases that may cause anemia in elderly individuals. The complex etiology of anemia in older adults, along with unique pathological mechanisms and the tendency to be comorbid with multiple diseases, severely impacts the quality of life of elderly individuals and can lead to more severe clinical outcomes. Anemia in older adults stems from multifactorial pathways including chronic inflammation, nutritional deficiencies, and comorbidities, collectively increasing mortality risk through hypoxia-induced organ dysfunction, muscle weakness, and physical frailty. Prospective studies demonstrate that persistent anemia doubles the risk of functional decline complications such as falls and independently elevates cardiovascular mortality by 34%, independent of comorbidities. Notably, it correlates with 28% higher cancer-specific mortality in treatment-resistant malignancies and synergistically increases all-cause mortality by 52% when coexisting with frailty. These persistent associations — despite therapeutic interventions — underscore anemia's critical role as both a prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in geriatric care.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^22e694e9]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults suffering from anemia often experience symptoms like weakness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and reduced productivity in daily activities and work. Among older adults, anemia is known as a risk factor for hospitalization, poor surgical outcomes, and increased all‐cause mortality. This has been particularly observed when moderate to severe anemia is present. Due to these varied causes, pathological anemia prevalence significantly varies by geography: the highest rates can be found in regions such as western sub‐Saharan Africa (47.4%) and South Asia (43.0%), where conditions like malaria and hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease in sub‐Saharan Africa, and thalassemia syndromes in South Asia, are common. These conditions shorten the lifespan of red blood cells, contributing to the higher prevalence of anemia. In South America, anemia presents a variable burden: in countries like Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Honduras, and Argentina, anemia was classified as a mild public health problem, with prevalence rates ranging from 7.6% to 18.7%. In Guatemala, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Bolivia, anemia was considered a moderate public health issue, with prevalence between 21.4% and 38.3%. Panama and Haiti reported the highest prevalence rates at 40.0% and 45.5%, respectively, classifying anemia as a severe public health concern in these countries. In contrast, regions like Australasia and Western Europe have much lower prevalence rates, around 5.7% and 6.0%, respectively.

Persistent high anemia burden, particularly among women of reproductive age and young children, emphasizes the urgent need for a renewed focus on accurately measuring its prevalence and underlying causes. Since these groups include individuals with "physiological anemia" that does not require intervention, it is necessary to develop methods to distinguish "physiological anemia" from "pathological anemia" or "true anemia."

RESULTS

Target population

The total number of patients in the potential population, with J-DOPPS phases 3 and 4 combined, was 3423; phase 3 included 2326 patients, among them 1121 patients continued to be followed into phase 4, while 1097 patients were newly recruited during the phase 4 period (Figure 1). We excluded 82 patients because of missing data on age, sex, years on dialysis and baseline Hb level. Eventually, 3341 patients were included in the further analyses.

Patient characteristics

The baseline characteristics of patients stratified by their Hb values are shown in Table 1. Patients with lower Hb tended to be older, more likely to have diabetic nephropathy as a cause of ESRD, and have fewer years of dialysis and more comorbidities than patients with higher Hb levels. Additionally, a large number of these patients were female. Table 2 lists the baseline data stratified by age group. Based on the cutoff age of 75 years, there were 2651 nonelderly (< 75 years old) and 690 elderly (≥ 75 years old) patients. The elderly group had lower Hb levels, similar ferritin levels and higher epoetin doses compared with the nonelderly group.

### Prevalence of anaemia in older persons: systematic review [^fbbbf80d]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

In general, haemoglobin levels are lower in older than in younger people. The reasons for this are not completely understood. It is unclear whether haemoglobin falls in older people because this is a feature of normal ageing, or whether it is always pathological, even if underlying conditions cannot be identified. In an individual patient it may be that some decline in haemoglobin occurs as part of normal ageing, but that disease may also contribute to the development of anaemia.

Anaemia of chronic disease, or anaemia of chronic inflammation, is the term associated with some chronic medical conditions, such as chronic renal disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Older people who suffer such chronic conditions might be expected to be anaemic, just as younger patients are. However, it is not always appreciated that older patients who suffer other medical problems, for example cognitive impairment, have a worse prognosis if they are also anaemic. It is not surprising that anaemia is associated with heart failure or myocardial infarction or death, but the reasons underlying the association between anaemia and other morbidity are less tangible.

We report on the prevalence of anaemia in cohorts of older people in the general population.

ANEMIA IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY

Anemia is not only more common in older people but is also more likely to be associated with harm. A recent studyin a large cohort of 138,670 subjects demonstrated that in individuals older than 60 years, anemia was associated with elevated mortality and poorer quality of life (QOL), whereas in individuals aged 60 or younger, anemia had no effect on mortality and a very limited impact on health‐related quality of life. In that study, lower QOL resulted from lower physical function subscales. After adjusting for age, sex, type II diabetes, and comorbidity in a population of 17,030 community‐dwelling men and women over 66 years of age, anemia was associated with increased risks of all‐cause hospitalization (HR = 2.16, confidence interval [CI] 1.88–2.48) and death (HR: 4.29, CI 3.55–5.12). Consistent with this, in men and women over the age of 65, anemia is associated with a higher risk of various poor health outcomes, including poor functional capacity, poor QOL, depression, sarcopenia, and poor muscle quality. Similarly, data from the EPESE cohortof older Americans demonstrated that after controlling for age, sex, cognitive status, blood creatinine, and comorbid conditions, individuals with anemia had more disabilities, and poorer functional status than people without anemia. Decline in performance with lower hemoglobin was also observed in people with hemoglobin levels above the WHO clinical threshold for anemia. Of course, factors other than age can exacerbate the risk of anemia; prevalence in older black men and women is substantially greater than that of the general population, with black women 80–85 years old having a prevalence that is 6.4 times greater than the population average.

For older individuals with comorbid disease, the deleterious effects associated with anemia are similarly clear. For example, among patients > 75 years old with stable angina, anemia is associated with elevated rates of death (34% increase for every 1 g/dl decrease in Hb, p < 0.01), increased cardiac death (28% increase for every 1 g/dl decrease in Hb, p < 0.01), and increased major adverse clinical events (23% increase for Hb < 13.3 g/dl).

### Age and anemia management: relationship of hemoglobin levels with mortality might differ between elderly and nonelderly hemodialysis patients [^87a7f5a0]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

There were differences in the effect of Hb on survival between the elderly and nonelderly populations. Nonelderly patients had increased risk if they had Hb < 10 g/dL, whereas only for the < 9 g/dL Hb category among the elderly population. The present study is the first to demonstrate the direct relationship between age and Hb levels from the viewpoints of mortality.

Many of the existing guidelines recommend the same target Hb across all ages. Only the Japanese guideline suggests that a high Hb might be beneficial for young patients with high physical activity.

The current study demonstrated that the relationship between low Hb and poorer survival was lessened in the elderly population.

The reason why low Hb had a weaker link to poorer survival could be related to the reduced activity in the elderly patients. Gait speed or chair-rising time was reportedly slow in the elderly HD population. Oxygen consumption in the elderly population is reported to be lower than that in the younger people, as well as exercise capacity measured by peak exercise oxygen uptake. The sedentary characteristics of this population might be permissive of the reduced oxygen delivery due to low Hb levels. On the other hand, decreased physical activity itself can be related to poorer prognosis. Therefore, the exact reasons require further considerations or investigations. The results of ESA responsiveness indicated that patients with lower Hb levels required relatively higher doses of ESA to maintain Hb levels, which suggested that such patients might have higher ESA resistance compared with those with higher Hb levels. This might offer a clue for elucidating the causes of differences.

KDIGO anemia in CKD — preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) correction criteria state that preoperative transfusions are generally not recommended when the Hb is ≥ 10 g/dl (≥ 100 g/l) in otherwise healthy subjects but should be given when the Hb is less than 7 g/dl (70 g/l). When Hb concentration has fallen to less than 7 g/dl (70 g/l) and the patient is otherwise stable, 2 units of red cells should be transfused and the Hb concentration should be reassessed. High-risk patients (≥ 65 years and/or those with cardiovascular or respiratory disease) may be transfused when the Hb concentration is less than 8 g/dl (80 g/l), and for Hb between 7 and 10 g/dl (70 and 100 g/l) the correct strategy is unclear.

Anemia, defined by the World Health Organization criteria as circulating hemoglobin (Hb) < 12 g/dl in women and < 13 g/dl in men, is common among individuals over the age of 60. The prevalence of anemia increases with age and is particularly common among the oldest and most frail: in a retrospective study of more than 19,000 hospital patients, the incidence of anemia rose from 15% at the ages of 64–69 to 37% in those over aged 90 (Figure 1). Many anemia cases have no clear underlying cause, a population that we will refer to as unexplained anemia of aging (UAA).

### The hidden burden of anemia in elderly surgical patients: a prospective study on incidence and contributing factors [^a616e0c5]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Anemia among elderly surgical patients is high, at 64.8%. Contributing factors include comorbidities, nutritional deficiencies, and perioperative variables. The risk is greater for major surgeries and patients with prior medical disorders. Early intervention with iron supplements, blood conservation strategies, and optimal care is essential.

Strength of the study

This study offers valuable insights into the incidence of anemia in elderly surgical patients and identifies contributing variables such as polypharmacy, emergency surgery, comorbidities, and blood loss.

Limitations of the study and future directions

The study has limitations, including a lack of longitudinal data and the exclusion of regional healthcare variations and treatment alternatives.

Future research should explore the long-term outcomes of anemia treatment methods in elderly surgical populations, utilizing multicenter or population-based cohorts to enhance external validity. A deeper understanding of the complex nature of anemia and its impact on perioperative risk stratification can be achieved through research incorporating biomarker profiling, frailty indicators, and comprehensive nutritional assessments.

Recommendations

Based on our study, we recommend the following

Preoperative anemia screening

Regular preoperative screenings for anemia in elderly surgical patients are essential for early detection and treatment, particularly for those with comorbidities or requiring emergency surgery.

Blood conservation strategies

To reduce the incidence of postoperative anemia, especially in patients undergoing major surgery or experiencing significant blood loss, implement blood conservation techniques such as intraoperative blood salvage, optimal perioperative transfusion regimens, and strategies to minimize blood loss post-surgery.

Management of comorbidities

Prioritize the management of comorbid conditions in older patients, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic renal disease, as these can increase the risk of anemia. Consider early treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, iron supplements, and blood conservation methods.

Polypharmacy review

Conduct regular reviews of prescriptions for elderly surgical patients, focusing on medications that may exacerbate anemia (such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants, and proton pump inhibitors). Reducing unnecessary medications can help lower the risk of anemia.

Postoperative anemia management

Implement post-surgical measures, such as iron supplements or erythropoietin therapy, to promote recovery and prevent complications from anemia, particularly in elderly patients who have undergone major surgery or experienced significant blood loss.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: recognition and management [^7fdccceb]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, various neuropsychiatric symptoms, and other clinical manifestations. Screening average-risk adults for vitamin B12 deficiency is not recommended. Screening may be warranted in patients with one or more risk factors, such as gastric or small intestine resections, inflammatory bowel disease, use of metformin for more than four months, use of proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 blockers for more than 12 months, vegans or strict vegetarians, and adults older than 75 years. Initial laboratory assessment should include a complete blood count and serum vitamin B12 level. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low-normal levels of vitamin B12. Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration for correcting anemia and neurologic symptoms. Intramuscular therapy leads to more rapid improvement and should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or severe neurologic symptoms. Absorption rates improve with supplementation; therefore, patients older than 50 years and vegans or strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B12 or take vitamin B12 supplements. Patients who have had bariatric surgery should receive 1 mg of oral vitamin B12 per day indefinitely. Use of vitamin B12 in patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, or alter cognitive decline.

### Age and anemia management: relationship of hemoglobin levels with mortality might differ between elderly and nonelderly hemodialysis patients [^2cd2d1cb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Naturally occurring higher Hb was reported not to increase mortality. In this study, patients with high Hb values had lower ESA dose as well as ESA responsiveness index values. This might partly be accounted for by the fact that the mortality risks were not significantly higher among the Hb group larger than 12 g/dL except for the results for the younger group by IPTW adjustment.

This study has several limitations. The first is its observational nature. Therefore, the results do not add information on the cause-and-effect relationship between Hb values themselves and prognosis.

The second limitation is the residual effect of unmeasured or measured but excluded confounders. The degree to which the actual delivered doses of ESA could be predicted from clinical values was only 15% (data not shown) in this population. This indicated the existence of uncollected or misclassified clinical conditions, especially differences in the practice pattern of each facility. However, DOPPS collected extremely detailed clinical data. We also attempted to adjust for confounders as extensively as possible, including by means of IPTW methods. In fact, we obtained a significant relationship instead of a null result. Therefore, we believe in the statistical power of this study.

The third limitation was the low mortality rate even in the elderly group. We obviated the reduced power of the present study in two ways. One was the target population, which comprised a combined J-DOPPS phase 3 and 4 population. The other was our use of time-dependent analyses, which increased the sample number of Hb values in the investigated population.

The fourth limitation was the fact that the statistical power might not be sufficient among the patients older than 75 years, which accounted for one-fifth of the entire population. This could be one of the reasons why the relationship between several Hb groups and mortality among the elderly group was not significant. However, the numbers of death were moderately balanced across the groups (Table 3), which could maximize the statistical power of this study.

### Anemia [^3a57a1ea]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia is an enormous problem worldwide that is worse in the developing countries but by no means lacking in developed countries. Women and children are disproportionately affected. Nutritional anemias, mainly caused by a lack of iron and folate, are largely correctable by dietary improvement, but this socioeconomic change may not be readily achieved. The inherited disorders, the hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias, in their heterozygous forms are beneficial to the affected populations. Prevention of the homozygous forms and the serious diseases that result can only be addressed by education. These conditions are seen in all types of medical practice ranging from neonatology to geriatrics and public health and are an ongoing concern to all physicians.

### New horizons in management of heart failure in older patients [^381b7d42]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Heart failure has a high prevalence in older populations, is a common and growing cause for hospital admission and carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Important co-morbidities in older patients with heart failure include atrial fibrillation, renal impairment, hypertension and anaemia. Diagnosing and managing heart failure in older patients are complicated due to atypical presentations, co-morbidities and a relative lack of evidence for commonly used treatments in younger patients. The growing epidemic of heart failure is also under-recognised and resourced in most health systems. Despite potential differences, we recommend that the basic approach to manage heart failure patients with an ejection fraction (EF) of < 40% should be the same in older and younger. These treatments need to be started at low doses and titrated slowly along with the management of co-morbidities. Older patients with EF 40–49% can be treated in a similar manner to those with < 40%, while the treatment of those with EF ≥ 50% is pragmatic in nature based on symptom control and management of co-morbidities although the evidence base for these recommendations is lacking. Overall management must be holistic and continuous based on the patient's social circumstances and ongoing needs. Finally, there is an urgent need for more research, evidence and resources directed towards older populations with heart failure to improve their care and the quality of life.

### Dementia and cognitive impairment in ESRD: diagnostic and therapeutic strategies [^11a75394]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Cognitive impairment, including dementia, is a common but poorly recognized problem among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), affecting 16–38% of patients. Dementia is associated with high risks of death, dialysis withdrawal, hospitalization, and disability among patients with ESRD; thus, recognizing and effectively managing cognitive impairment may improve clinical care. Dementia screening strategies should take into account patient factors, the time available, the timing of assessments relative to dialysis treatments, and the implications of a positive screen for subsequent management (for example, transplantation). Additional diagnostic testing in patients with cognitive impairment, including neuroimaging, is largely based on the clinical evaluation. There is limited data on the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for dementia in the setting of ESRD; therefore, decisions about the use of these medications should be individualized. Management of behavioral symptoms, evaluation of patient safety, and advance care planning are important components of dementia management. Prevention strategies targeting vascular risk factor modification, and physical and cognitive activity have shown promise in the general population and may be reasonably extrapolated to the ESRD population. Modification of ESRD-associated factors such as anemia and dialysis dose or frequency require further study before they can be recommended for treatment or prevention of cognitive impairment.

### Anemia in elderly patients: an emerging problem for the 21st century [^3fcb900e]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is a significant problem in elderly patients. Although many anemic elderly patients can be diagnosed with nutritional deficiency, anemia of chronic inflammation or comorbid diseases that explain their decreased hematocrit, the etiology of anemia in a significant fraction remains obscure. There is evidence to suggest that the hematopoietic stem cell displays increasing erythropoietin (EPO) resistance with age. EPO levels rise in elderly, nonanemic patients, and it is hypothesized that there is an interplay between this rising demand for EPO and the decreasing ability of the aging kidney to produce adequate hormone to meet that need. There is further considerable evidence that aging is associated with increased proinflammatory cytokine expression and that many of these cytokines can contribute to EPO insensitivity. Consequently, genetic variation in the expression of these proinflammatory cytokines may influence the development of anemia in elderly patients, both through induction of hepcidin expression (anemia of inflammation) and through cytokine suppression of erythroid colony formation. The impact of inflammatory mediators, EPO insensitivity, and other factors that may act on the hematopoietic stem cell to decrease erythropoiesis are under active study and should serve to elucidate the pathophysiology of this important cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly individuals. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of anemia in elderly patients should provide critical entry points for interventions that will improve survival and quality of life in the aging population.

PHARMACOECONOMICS: ANEMIA LEADS TO HIGH HEALTHCARE COSTS IN OLDER PEOPLE

Use of healthcare resources and overall medical costs are significantly higher among patients with anemia. Anemia accounts for 2.8 million physician office visits and 890,000 emergency department visits per year in the United States. One‐quarter of patients admitted to the hospital for anemia are readmitted to the emergency department within 30 days, with the likelihood of unplanned readmission increasing with the severity of anemia at first discharge. Following admission, anemia is associated with elevated in‐hospital mortality and longer stays.

These trends are exacerbated in the older people, in whom anemia is associated with up to fourfold greater risk of overall mortality and twofold greater risk of hospitalization. Hospital stays are longer among older patients with anemia,: average length of stay increases 4–5 days in patients with moderate anemia and 7–10 days in the most severe cases. As a consequence of the combined increases in hospitalization, readmission, length of stay, morbidity, and mortality, patients with anemia experience medical costs more than twice as high as those of patients without anemia of comparable age, sex, comorbidities, and insurance status. This holds true for patients overall, as well as for populations with specific comorbidities: greater costs have been reported for patients with anemia and chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseor colorectal disease requiring surgery. Anemia is also strongly associated with frailty in older men and women: an increase in one point of hemoglobin concentration is associated with a 14% risk reduction of being frail (OR = 0.86, 95%IC = 0.79–0.94).

### Anemia management in the cardiorenal patient: a nephrological perspective [^e331a779]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a common condition with increasing prevalence, globally due to progressive aging of the population and several contributing factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or ischemic heart disease. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also a common, progressive, and chronic comorbidity that affects 10% of the population worldwide and with an increasing prevalence. Both conditions are associated with high morbidity and death and frequently coexist. In fact, around 40% of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) also have CKD, while around 30% of patients with CKD also have HF.

The interaction between the failing heart and kidneys in cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) can lead to a dysfunctional state favoring the development of anemia, which sets off a vicious cycle in which HF and CKD induce anemia, which, in turn, worsens both conditions and negatively impacts on morbidity and death.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) anemia guidelines recommend using erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents (ESA) to treat CKD‐associated anemia with the aim of partially correcting anemia once other causes of anemia have been corrected/discarded (with a target hemoglobin level in the range of 10–11.5 g/dL), on the basis of the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta‐analyses that evaluated partial versus full anemia correction with ESA on cardiovascular outcomes in this population. Although the KDIGO anemia guideline recommends such partial correction of anemia, European and US HF guidelines advise against ESA use in patients with HF, on the basis of the results of the RED‐HF (Reduction of Events With Darbepoetin Alfa in Heart Failure) trial (Table 1).

Table 1
Characteristics of the Main Clinical Trials Conducted to Analyze the Efficacy and Safety of Erythropoiesis‐Stimulating Agents in Heart Failure and Chronic Kidney Disease

Iron deficiency (ID) is also common in both patients with HF and patients with CKD and is associated with worse outcomes in these populations, In fact, ID is associated with worse exercise capacity and increased morbidity and death and appears to confer worse prognosis than anemia in patients with HF. Furthermore, the definition criteria of ID and targets of iron repletion with intravenous iron are different in patients with non–dialysis‐dependent CKD and patients with HF across clinical guidelines.

Consequently, patients with CRS are left without clear recommendations on whether and how to treat anemia with ESA and intravenous iron, despite being indicated by the coexistence of CKD, according to the KDIGO anemia guidelines.

### Prevalence of anaemia in older persons: systematic review [^51c1fc93]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

These results confirm that anaemia, as defined by the WHO criteria, is common in older people, affecting 1 in every 7 or 8 over-65s living in the community. Even using more stringent definitions of haemoglobin less than 120 g/L or 110 g/L, anaemia affects 1 in 12 to 1 in 15 older people in the community. In nursing homes, or in older people admitted to hospital, anaemia will be even more common, affecting almost 1 in 2. Higher prevalence occurs at greater age, and in black people.

These broad assertions have limitations. Firstly we have chosen to use the WHO criteria for defining anaemia because they are the most commonly reported. Threshold values are to some extent arbitrary, and WHO values are in the range of haemoglobin levels where the number of individuals captured changes rapidly. Choosing slightly different thresholds can considerably alter the number defined as anaemic. While we recognise the limitations of using thresholds, we have used WHO criteria because that is what is reported in the literature and because they do appear to be relevant, correlating with clinical outcomes.

We know, furthermore, that electronic searching for observational studies identifies fewer than half of studies, so that other methods have to be employed. While we examined bibliographies extensively, it is likely that some information was not identified by our searches. Though we limited our inclusion criteria to studies with at least 100 individuals, Table 1 demonstrates that small studies contributed little to the overall numbers, which were dominated by five studies of more than 5,000 individuals. Overall there was information on prevalence for almost 86,000 individuals, over 60% of whom were in these large studies. This justifies excluding prevalence studies with fewer than 100 subjects; non-inclusion of even 100 trials with fewer than 100 subjects would have contributed a maximum of 10% more to the total, and we found that 50% of the studies included with the smallest numbers actually contributed 8% to the total.

### Anemia and malnutrition in geriatric hospitalized patients: a cross-sectional retrospective study [^52e331a2]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A healthy diet has a positive impact on health throughout the life cycle. Epidemiological studies and clinical trials suggest that the daily diet can influence overall health and help prevent common non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity, which are among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide.

Anemia and malnutrition have a high incidence among geriatric patients, and both conditions are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The question of whether geriatric malnutrition serves as an underlying cause of anemia has been a subject of discussion, particularly in light of established associations between anemia and hypoalbuminemia observed in hospitalized geriatric patients. Presently, deficiencies in micronutrients such as iron, folate, and B12 remain the primary focus of investigations concerning determinants of anemia development. The present study used a comprehensive approach to malnutrition, the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI), and investigated whether there are differences in nutrition-dependent indicators between anemic and non-anemic geriatric patients.

A well-balanced diet entails consuming macronutrients in appropriate proportions to fulfill energy and physiological needs without excess, while also ensuring an adequate supply of micronutrients and hydration to sustain body metabolism and cellular activities. The pivotal role of a well-balanced diet in promoting healthy aging is substantiated by numerous epidemiological studies, clinical trials, and the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013–2020. The WHO Global Action Plan seeks to guide daily food choices to impact health positively, endorse the prevention of prevalent non-communicable diseases, and prevent malnutrition.

Malnutrition, defined as an imbalance in nutrient intake, whether deficient or excessive, or impaired nutrient utilization, is alleviated by a well-balanced diet. Only a well-balanced diet can ensure that individual cells, such as erythrocytes, synchronize their growth rate or proliferation with nutrient availability while maintaining overall body metabolism. Macronutrients, encompassing carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, supply the energy essential for daily cellular processes, while micronutrients, namely vitamins and minerals, are required in smaller quantities for normal growth, development, metabolism, and physiological functioning.

### How I treat anemia in heart failure [^67647ef5]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Anemia is a very common comorbidity in patients with heart failure (HF), affecting ∼30% of stable ambulatory patients and 50% patients with acute decompensated HF. Absolute or functional iron deficiency (ID) is seen in ∼50% patients with HF. Both of these comorbidities often coexist and are independently associated with increased mortality and hospitalizations. These findings led several investigators to test the hypotheses that treatment of anemia and ID in HF would improve symptoms and long-term outcomes. Small studies showed that erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) improve subjective measures of HF. However, a large pivotal outcome trial found that the ESA darbepoetin alfa did not improve long-term outcomes in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction and instead was associated with adverse effects. Studies using IV iron have had somewhat greater success, showing improvements in subjective and some objective measures of HF. However, more research is needed to establish the best treatment options for these high-risk patients. We present 5 common scenarios of patients with HF and anemia and describe our personal approach on how we might treat them based on objective evidence where available. An algorithm that offers guidance in regard to personalized therapy for such patients is also presented.

Table 5
Characteristics of studies worked on the relationship between anemia, cognitive and physical function

This study has a number of potential limitations; first, the cross-sectional nature of this study could not establish cause-effect relationships between Hgb concentration, cognitive function, and physical function. Second, in this study, only memory and verbal aspects of cognitive function were assessed due to the low educational levels of the participants. In contrast, other cognitive contents, e.g. executive speed, attention, and processing function, which might be affected more than the assessed domains by hemoglobin changes, were not evaluated. Second, due to the population-based nature of the study, brain diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's) were only self-reported, and specific diagnostic tests were not performed to evaluate these diseases. Finally, confounding variables such as inflammatory factors (e.g. C-reactive-protein) and nutritional-status (e.g. albumin) were not assessed in this study.

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that anemia is strongly associated with physical function in the Iranian elderly population, whereas its association with cognitive function was not statistically significant. This research raises the question of whether hemoglobin level correction improves cognitive and physical function. Further longitudinal research is required to investigate the etiology and consequences of anemia in the elderly. Despite uncertain mechanism to explain how anemia affects physical performance and cognitive function, according to the results of this study and previous ones, it seems hemoglobin screening not only might be effective in diagnosing the cognitive function and physical activity decline in the early stage but also might play an important role in preventing these conditions. Moreover, the handgrip strength is one of the evaluation indicators of frailty Syndrome. In this study, its strong relationship with anemia has been confirmed; hence, this finding can strengthen the hypothesis of a relationship between anemia and frailty. We suggest that screening and timely treatment of anemia in the elderly should be considered as a strategy to reduce frailty and improve the rehabilitation process. We believe an effective strategy for controlling anemia in older adults might improve function, quality of life, and even lifespan. Designing an interventional healthcare system for managing anemia plays an essential role in this strategy.

### Geriatric syncope and cardiovascular risk in the emergency department [^1673bcd3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness that is caused by a brief loss in generalized cerebral blood flow.

Objective

This article reviews the background, epidemiology, etiologies, evaluation, and disposition considerations of geriatric patients with syncope, with a focus on cardiovascular risk.

Discussion

Although syncope is one of the most common symptoms in elderly patients presenting to the emergency department, syncope causes in geriatric patients can present differently than in younger populations, and the underlying etiology is often challenging to discern. History, physical examination, and electrocardiography (ECG) have the greatest utility in evaluating syncope. Additional testing should be guided by history and physical examination. There are multiple scoring tools developed to aid in management and these are reviewed in the article. Common predictors that would indicate a need for further work-up include a history of cardiac or valvular disease (i.e., ventricular dysrhythmia, congestive heart failure), abnormal ECG, anemia or severe volume depletion (i.e., from a gastrointestinal bleed), syncope while supine or with effort, report of palpitations or chest pain, persistent abnormal vital signs, or family history of sudden death. With advancing age, cardiovascular morbidity plays a more frequent and important role in the etiology of syncope.

Conclusions

The syncope work-up should be tailored to the patient's presentation. Disposition should be based on the results of the initial evaluation and risk factors for adverse outcomes.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^5945ef78]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion of case 1

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (eg, antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review (Figure 1). The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, MDS, and leukemia disorders.

ASCO/ASH ESA guideline update — Clinical Question 9 (management of nonresponse): For adults with chemotherapy-associated anemia who do not respond to ESA therapy, defined as " < 1 to 2 g/dL increase in Hb or no decrease in transfusion requirements," ESAs should be discontinued in patients who do not respond within 6 to 8 weeks, and such patients should be re-evaluated for underlying tumor progression, iron deficiency, or other etiologies for anemia. (Type of recommendation: informal consensus; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).

### Optimizing renal anaemia management – benefits of early referral and treatment [^d5fca871]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Despite clinical practice guidelines for the management of anaemia of chronic kidney disease and a growing literature concerning the treatment of renal anaemia in diverse patient groups, there remain uncertainties over definitions and descriptions for optimal management of renal anaemia. The patients most likely to derive the greatest long-term benefit from correction of anaemia are those with chronic kidney disease who are pre-dialysis. Early intervention to correct anaemia has the potential to impact on the progression of chronic kidney disease and affect patient morbidity, hospitalization rates, quality of life and mortality. This review considers current guidance on anaemia management, the evidence behind the guidance and the data shortfalls in an attempt to provide a topical overview of current understanding and future directions for optimal management of renal anaemia, particularly in high-risk groups.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^955fc0c9]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with comorbidities, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- functional iron deficiency is a common contributory factor to the anemia associated with advanced CKD

- IDA is a common manifestation of IBD, particularly when the disease is active

- iron deficiency is common in chronic HF and is often multifactorial.

### Prevalence of anemia in persons 65 years and older in the United States: evidence for a high rate of unexplained anemia [^8de138bc]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Clinicians frequently identify anemia in their older patients, but national data on the prevalence and causes of anemia in this population in the United States have been unavailable. Data presented here are from the noninstitutionalized US population assessed in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988–1994). Anemia was defined by World Health Organization criteria; causes of anemia included iron, folate, and B(12) deficiencies, renal insufficiency, anemia of chronic inflammation (ACI), formerly termed anemia of chronic disease, and unexplained anemia (UA). ACI by definition required normal iron stores with low circulating iron (less than 60 microg/dL). After age 50 years, anemia prevalence rates rose rapidly, to a rate greater than 20% at age 85 and older. Overall, 11.0% of men and 10.2% of women 65 years and older were anemic. Of older persons with anemia, evidence of nutrient deficiency was present in one third, ACI or chronic renal disease or both was present in one third, and UA was present in one third. Most occurrences of anemia were mild; 2.8% of women and 1.6% of men had hemoglobin levels lower than 110 g/L (11 g/dL). Therefore, anemia is common, albeit not severe, in the older population, and a substantial proportion of anemia is of indeterminate cause. The impact of anemia on quality of life, recovery from illness, and functional abilities must be further investigated in older persons.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^d503dd2f]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend to diagnose anemia in adult and adolescent patients aged ≥ 15 years with CKD based on the hemoglobin concentration < 13.0 g/dL in males and < 12.0 g/dL in females.
