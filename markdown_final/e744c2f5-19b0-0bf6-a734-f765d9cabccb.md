## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which attachment pattern is most associated with child abuse and neglect. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core attachment typology and how disorganized attachment is defined. Then, I should verify the empirical prevalence of each attachment style in maltreated samples versus the general population. Next, I will examine mechanistic links between abuse/neglect and disorganization. After that, I should consider whether avoidant or ambivalent patterns could plausibly rival disorganization in maltreated children. Finally, I will synthesize and confirm the best-supported answer with direct citations.

> Let me first confirm the attachment framework so I don't jump to conclusions. The canonical four-category system includes secure, insecure-avoidant, insecure-ambivalent/resistant, and disorganized/disoriented, with disorganization reflecting the absence of a coherent strategy and behaviors like freezing, contradictory approach-avoidance, or disorientation, especially under stress [^e2938413] [^6b6fc1a3].

> Wait, let me verify the key claim about maltreatment and disorganization. The meta-analytic distribution shows that in maltreated samples, only about 9% are securely attached, whereas 48% are classified as disorganized, compared with roughly 15% disorganized in low-risk populations; this is a marked elevation that points toward a strong association between abuse/neglect and disorganized attachment [^8ff9f7dd].

> I need to check the mechanistic rationale to ensure this isn't just a statistical blip. Disorganization arises when the caregiver is simultaneously a source of comfort and fear, creating an unsolvable paradox that disrupts the child's ability to organize attachment behaviors; this fits the profile of frightening or frightened parental behavior, which is precisely what abuse and neglect often entail, and is repeatedly linked to disorganized attachment in theoretical and empirical work [^e2938413] [^4a391343].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the other insecure styles. Avoidant attachment is associated with consistent rejection or low sensitivity, and ambivalent with inconsistent caregiving; both can occur in adverse environments, but neither captures the simultaneous fear-and-comfort paradox that uniquely characterizes disorganization in the context of maltreatment, which is why disorganization shows the most pronounced elevation in abused/neglected samples [^e2938413] [^8ff9f7dd].

> Let me consider whether any competing evidence suggests another pattern is more strongly linked. I should double-check: meta-analytic and narrative reviews consistently emphasize disorganized attachment as the attachment phenotype most strongly tied to trauma and severe caregiving adversity, whereas avoidant and ambivalent patterns, though elevated in some high-risk samples, do not reach the same magnitude of association with abuse and neglect as disorganization does [^e2938413] [^8ff9f7dd].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the answer clearly. Child abuse and neglect are most associated with disorganized/disoriented attachment, given the markedly higher prevalence of disorganization in maltreated children and the theoretical fit with frightening or frightened caregiving that disrupts coherent attachment strategies [^8ff9f7dd] [^e2938413].

---

The correct answer is **A. disorganized/disoriented**. Child abuse and neglect are most strongly associated with disorganized attachment, characterized by contradictory behaviors (approach-avoidance, freezing, disorientation) and a lack of a coherent strategy for coping with stress [^e2938413]. This pattern reflects the paradox of the caregiver as both a source of comfort and fear, which is common in maltreatment [^e2938413]. Disorganized attachment is linked to later psychopathology, including dissociation, emotion dysregulation, and interpersonal difficulties [^3f06159e] [^0b1f526d]. In contrast, avoidant and ambivalent attachments are more tied to insensitive or inconsistent caregiving rather than direct abuse or neglect [^e2938413] [^442366ef].

## Attachment patterns and their association with child abuse and neglect

Attachment theory identifies four primary patterns: secure, insecure-avoidant, insecure-ambivalent, and disorganized/disoriented [^e2938413]. Each reflects different caregiver behaviors and child coping strategies [^5fcc9d88].

| **Attachment pattern** | **Caregiver behavior** | **Child behavior** |
|-|-|-|
| Secure | Sensitive, responsive, consistent | Comfort-seeking, exploration, trust |
| Insecure-avoidant | Rejecting, emotionally unavailable | Emotional suppression, self-reliance, avoidance |
| Insecure-ambivalent | Inconsistent, unpredictable | Clingy, anxious, preoccupied |
| Disorganized/disoriented | Frightening, abusive, neglectful | Contradictory, disoriented, frozen |

---

Disorganized attachment arises when the caregiver is both a source of comfort and fear, creating an unsolvable paradox that disrupts the child's ability to form a coherent strategy [^e2938413]. This pattern is most strongly linked to abuse and neglect, with maltreated children showing markedly higher rates of disorganization than non-maltreated peers [^8ff9f7dd].

---

## Empirical evidence linking disorganized attachment to abuse and neglect

Multiple studies and meta-analyses show a strong association between disorganized attachment and maltreatment:

- **Van IJzendoorn et al. (1999)**: In maltreated samples, 48% of children were disorganized vs 15% in non-maltreated samples; only 9% were secure in maltreated groups vs 62% in non-maltreated groups [^8ff9f7dd].
- **Main and Solomon (1990)**: Disorganized attachment is linked to frightening or frightened parental behavior, common in abuse and neglect [^e2938413].
- **Carlson et al. (1989)**: Disorganized attachment predicted later dissociation, aggression, and emotion dysregulation, consistent with trauma-related outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and long-term consequences

Disorganized attachment is associated with significant long-term consequences, including:

- **Psychopathology**: Higher risk of dissociation, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and psychosis [^3f06159e] [^877412a4].
- **Emotion regulation**: Difficulties with stress, emotional dysregulation, and interpersonal dysfunction [^d05ad707].
- **Interpersonal relationships**: Problems with trust, intimacy, and peer relationships [^d05ad707].

---

## Comparison with other attachment patterns

While avoidant and ambivalent attachments are linked to insensitive or inconsistent caregiving, they are less strongly associated with direct abuse or neglect than disorganized attachment [^e2938413]. Avoidant attachment reflects emotional suppression and self-reliance, whereas ambivalent attachment reflects anxiety and preoccupation; neither captures the paradoxical fear-comfort dynamic seen in disorganized attachment [^5fcc9d88].

---

## Conclusion

Child abuse and neglect are most strongly associated with **disorganized/disoriented attachment**, reflecting the paradox of the caregiver as both a source of comfort and fear [^e2938413]. This pattern is linked to significant long-term psychopathology and interpersonal difficulties, underscoring the need for early intervention and trauma-informed care [^d05ad707].

Secure and Insecure Attachment Patterns

Attachment theory has been developed by John Bowlby. Research into child attachment took flight when a laboratory procedure was devised: the Strange Situation Procedure (Ainsworth et al.). This procedure was meant to assess the nature of the child's attachment to the main caregiver, and to provide an empirical base to attachment theory. Through this procedure, the child can be classified as secure (Type B), insecure avoidant (Type A), and insecure defensive or insecure ambivalent (Type C). Children with a secure attachment have a good balance between the urge to explore the environment and their attachment behaviors, that is, seeking proximity to the caregiver (Ainsworth et al.). Children with an insecure-avoidant attachment pattern minimize their attachment behaviors as they have experienced rejection or consistent low sensitivity from their caregiver(s). Insecure resistant or ambivalent attached children have experienced inconsistent sensitivity from their caregiver, and maximize attachment behaviors in order to preserve attention from the caregiver (Ainsworth et al.).

Later, it was found that some children could not be categorized according to the three insecure attachment categories. A fourth category of attachment was, therefore, added: disorganized/disoriented attachment (Type D; Main and Solomon). Disorganized attached children perceive their caregivers as a source of both comfort and fear, which is an unsolvable paradox. This fear with no solution prohibits the development of an organized strategy for the use of the attachment figure in case of distress and results in a mixture of different types of insecure behaviors combined with frightening reactions towards the caregiver (Main and Hesse). Children of parents with severe psychopathology and maltreated children often show these disorganized attachment behaviors (Radke-Yarrow et al; Van IJzendoorn et al.). Thus, attachment relationships can be classified as secure, insecure-avoidant, insecure-ambivalent, and insecure-disorganized attachment.

Attachment Variables

All types of attachment styles (i.e. secure, insecure-avoidant, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-disorganized, and a broad insecure category) were significantly associated to depression. The insecure styles were positively associated with depression, the secure style was negatively associated with depression. However, the type of attachment style influenced the strength of the relation. The broad insecure measures yielded significantly larger effect sizes than the secure measures. The effect sizes in the other insecure attachment measures did not differ significantly from the secure attachment measure, although insecure-disorganized attachment almost reached significance (p > .10) for larger effect sizes, compared to the secure measure. Further, smaller effect sizes were found for categorical attachment measures compared to continuous attachment measures. In addition, the type of instrument of the attachment assessment was a significant moderator. Larger effect sizes were found in questionnaire assessments compared to interviews and observations/experiments. Moreover, the informant of the attachment measure moderated the relation between attachment and depression. Larger effect sizes were found in case the child was the informant compared to when an observer was the informant. Finally, the attachment figure (i.e. parents, mothers, fathers, or general attachment representations) did not influence the strength of the correlation between attachment and depression.

Depression Variables

None of the depression variables were significant moderators. The depression measure (symptoms or clinical diagnoses), the depression instrument (questionnaire or interview), and the depression informant (child or parent) did not influence the relation between attachment security and depression.

The distribution of the specific types of attachment relationships has been meta-analytically examined by Van IJzendoorn et al. in the general population, parents of low SES and a number of clinical groups. In the general population, 62% of the young children were securely attached to their primary caregiver, whereas the insecure attachment patterns were less frequently diagnosed in parent–child relationships: insecure avoidant (15%), insecure ambivalent (9%), and disorganized (15%). Notably, in maltreated samples, only 9% of the children were securely attached to their parents, 28% avoidantly attached, 15% ambivalently attached, and a large percentage of 48% of the children were classified as disorganized (Van IJzendoorn et al.).

### Are we any closer to understanding how chronic pain develops? A systematic search and critical narrative review of existing chronic pain vulnerability models [^dc3fd745]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The Attachment-Diathesis Model of Chronic Pain

Attachment theory is one of the most established and supported theories in psychology. This developmental theory states that an infant will develop an internal working model of relationships based on the early interactions they have with their primary caretaker. The internal working model is a mental representation or schema of oneself, others, and the world that will serve as a base for future appraisals, perceptions and behaviours. In general, individuals can be classified in three attachment styles: a secure attachment style, developed in those who encounter positive and sensitive interactions with their main caretaker; and two insecure attachment styles (insecure-avoidant and insecure-anxious ambivalent), for those who receive a less sensitive treatment from their caretakers.

Since attachment style serves as the foundation of the appraisals and perceptions of an individual, the Attachment-Diathesis Model of Chronic Pain makes the following proposal: (1) When an individual is exposed to a painful stimulus the attachment style or internal working model is activated (diathesis). (2) The nature of the attachment style (secure, insecure-avoidant or insecure ambivalent) will then lead the appraisals made about the pain, one's ability to manage it and other´s ability to provide support. (3) These appraisals will, in turn, determine the coping strategies, support-seeking behaviours and emotional states experienced. (4) Finally, these responses to the appraisals made will have an effect on each one's experience and adjustment to pain.

### Understanding the psychosocial effects of WES test results on parents of children with rare diseases [^b5aad207]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2016). Low credibility.

Parents receiving a "possible diagnosis" responded to it with ambivalence: on the one hand, they continued the search for a definitive diagnosis (hope), and on the other hand they made efforts to come to terms with the situation (acceptance). Additionally, in specific cases where a maternally inherited X-linked recessive mutation was mentioned as the potential cause of disease (requiring further familial segregation studies), the possible diagnosis generated led to new worries, uncertainties, and insecurities.

Parents who received no diagnosis varied in their responses. Some were relieved that nothing was found in the genes of their child, but some were also concerned because they still longed for an explanation of their child's symptoms.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder [^a40d6399]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Attachment and its development — attachment formation and assessment in infants and young children are outlined with age-specific milestones and classification systems. Between 2 and 7 months of age infants interact broadly, but at around 7 to 9 months they exhibit stranger wariness and separation protest, and preferred attachments to caregivers may develop after a developmental age of 7 to 9 months; by 12 months of age the quality of an infant's attachment can be assessed. The Strange Situation Procedure describes individual differences in 11- to 20-month-old infants' attachment behaviors in four patterns of attachment — secure, avoidant, resistant, and disorganized; for children 2 to 4½ years old the MacArthur system describes secure, avoidant, dependent (ambivalent), controlling, and insecure/other patterns. Insecure attachment is a risk factor for psychopathology, with stronger links for disorganized or other atypical classifications, and secure attachment is a protective factor; classifications of attachment are not diagnoses and routine clinical use of the Strange Situation Procedure is limited because it was not designed as a diagnostic procedure.

### Attachment disorder and attachment theory-two sides of one medal or two different coins? [^a8b12585]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Currently, attachment quality and attachment disorder exist in parallel, but the mutual association is still insufficiently clarified. For policy makers and clinical experts, it can be difficult to differentiate between these constructs, but the distinction is crucial to develop mental-health services and effective treatment concepts. We aimed to investigate the association between attachment representations (AR) and attachment disorders (AD), including Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED) in children aged between 5 and 9.

Methods

A total of 135 children aged between 5 and 9 years (M = 7.17 years, SD = 1.40, 63% male) and their primary caregivers participated in the study. Children were interviewed with the story stem method to assess AR, and the primary caregiver completed diagnostic interviews and questionnaires on mental disorders, AD, emotional and behavioral problems, and intelligence and development.

Results

The prevalence of AR in children with AD was 28.6% for the 'secure' form of AR, 17.1% for the 'insecure-avoidant' form, 25.7% for the 'insecure-ambivalent' form, and 28.6% for the 'disorganized' form. Prevalences of the various AR forms did not differ statistically significantly, indicating that AR is conceptionally distinct from AD. Children with disorganized attachment scored significantly lower on language and intelligence skills than children with secure attachment. AD was significantly associated with a higher number of comorbidities, emotional and behavioral problems, and lower language skills.

Conclusions

Longitudinal studies using standardized assessment instruments are needed to systematically provide comparable and reliable empirical findings to improve current understanding of AR and AD as well as their etiological models.

### The relation between attachment and depression in children and adolescents: a multilevel meta-analysis [^6592fbd7]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Various attachment variables were coded. First, we coded the attachment figure that was measured (parents, mothers, fathers, or general attachment representation of the child), because mothers and fathers could have unique and different influence on the development of children. Second, because the different attachment styles could influence the strength of the association between attachment and depression, we coded the type of attachment that was measured (i.e. secure, insecure-avoidant, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-disorganized, or a broad insecure measure). Third, we coded whether the attachment measure was a continuous or a categorical measure. Fourth, the type of instrument of the attachment measure (questionnaire, interview, or experiment/observation) was coded, because the different instrument may tap different elements of attachment (Bosmans and Kerns). In addition, questionnaires are more sensitive to socially desirable responding than other attachment measures. Fifth, because previous meta-analyses showed moderating effects of the informant of the attachment measure on the relation between attachment and psychopathology (Colonnesi et al; Madigan et al.), we coded whether the child, parent, or an observer reported on the attachment relationship. In the analyses, only the child and observer categories were included, because in only one study the parent reported on the attachment relationship.

### A learning theory approach to attachment theory: exploring clinical applications [^442366ef]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

When children experience parents to be less consistently available for support or consistently unavailable, they may develop an insecure attachment relationship with them and an insecure IWM about their parents' availability. On the one hand, children may become more ambivalent in their attachment relationships and keep their attention focused on the attachment figure instead of balancing it with exploring the wider social or physical environment. This means that their attention and behavior express anxiety for rejection, and that they continue to seek support even in the absence of distress (Cassidy; Kobak et al.). On the other hand, children may develop more avoidant behavior in an attachment relationship with parents who are consistently ignoring or even rejecting the child's bids for care and protection in times of distress. Insecure-avoidantly attached children try to keep their attention focused on the environment, away from the attachment figure. They minimize the overt signaling of attachment needs during distress presumably in an attempt to avoid potential parental rejection and to keep optimal proximity to a less than optimally protective caregiver (Cassidy; Kobak et al.).

Accumulating research and meta-analyses robustly show that insecure attachment predicts higher levels of internalizing and externalizing problems across the lifespan (e.g. Groh et al.). The effect sizes suggest that insecure attachment is not psychopathology itself. Instead, research shows that insecure attachment provides a context in which risk factors develop that are linked to elevated chances of developing psychopathology. These include, among others, less adequate emotion regulation (Verhees et al.), social skills (Bastin et al.), and maladaptive cognitive schemas about the self and others (Simard et al.). As a result, children may divert their attention away from their caregivers and wait longer to seek their support during distress, or they keep focused on the attachment figure at the cost of exploring the environment, both attentional strategies resulting in higher chances of developing psychopathology (e.g. Dujardin et al.). Insecure attachment has been proposed as a robust, transdiagnostic risk factor, rendering it a valuable target for therapy or intervention.

### Attachment-and emotion-focused parenting interventions for child and adolescent externalizing and internalizing behaviors: a meta-analysis [^d215da53]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Attachment- and Emotion-Focused Parenting Interventions

The most researched "nonbehavioral" parenting interventions involve programs based on (1) attachment theory and (2) emotion socialization theory, which are characterized by a focus on affective processes in the parent–child relationship and understanding the meaning of, and/or emotional needs underlying, child behavior. According to attachment theory, a secure attachment develops when a caregiver sensitively responds to their child's needs and the child can alleviate their distress by seeking proximity to the caregiver (Ainsworth et al; Bowlby). By contrast, when a caregiver inconsistently responds to their child's needs, the child may develop an ambivalent attachment, which is characterized by an approach and resistance pattern of interaction with the caregiver when distressed. Children whose caregivers are consistently unresponsive to or rejecting of their needs are at risk of developing an avoidant attachment wherein they do not seek proximity to their caregiver when distressed (Ainsworth et al.). Of most concern for the development of psychopathology, a disorganized attachment is evident in children who do not develop a coherent strategy to assuage their distress and is linked to fearful and frightening caregiving (Lyons-Ruth & Spielman).

### Variation in the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) moderates the influence of maternal sensitivity on child attachment [^949a72af]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

In sum, consistent with theory and decades of prior research on attachment, we found that variation in maternal sensitivity at 18 months significantly predicted the likelihood that the child would be classified as ambivalent vs. secure at 36 months of age. Critically, however, we also found support for our prediction that the effect of maternal sensitivity on child ambivalence would be moderated by the child's OPRM1 genotype, with the G allele carrying children being significantly more likely to be classified as ambivalent in response to maternal insensitivity. Thus, consistent with earlier non-human animal research, this finding suggests that carrying the G allele predisposes the child to a specific form of insecurity in the face of inconsistent maternal care — one characterized by a heightened emotional reaction to separation, a preoccupation with the mother, and an inability to be soothed by the mother's return. More broadly, these findings provide support for the brain opioid theory of social attachment, which postulates that changes in endogenous opioid activity in response to social separation and social contact mediate the affective experiences of separation distress and social comfort, respectively, and thereby contribute to the regulation of attachment behavior.

### A novel examination of atypical major depressive disorder based on attachment theory [^56d1cef0]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

While a large body of descriptive work has thoroughly investigated the clinical correlates of atypical depression, little is known about its fundamental origins. This study examined atypical depression from an attachment theory framework. Our hypothesis was that, compared to adults with melancholic depression, those with atypical depression would report more anxious-ambivalent attachment and less secure attachment. As gender has been an important consideration in prior work on atypical depression, this same hypothesis was further tested in female subjects only.

Method

One hundred ninety-nine consecutive adults presenting to a tertiary mood disorders clinic with major depressive disorder with either atypical or melancholic features according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I Disorders were administered a self-report adult attachment questionnaire to assess the core dimensions of secure, anxious-ambivalent, and avoidant attachment. Attachment scores were compared across the 2 depressed groups defined by atypical and melancholic features using multivariate analysis of variance. The study was conducted between 1999 and 2004.

Results

When men and women were considered together, the multivariate test comparing attachment scores by depressive group was statistically significant at p < .05. Between-subjects testing indicated that atypical depression was associated with significantly lower secure attachment scores, with a trend toward higher anxious-ambivalent attachment scores, than was melancholia. When women were analyzed separately, the multivariate test was statistically significant at p < .01, with both secure and anxious-ambivalent attachment scores differing significantly across depressive groups.

Conclusion

These preliminary findings suggest that attachment theory, and insecure and anxious-ambivalent attachment in particular, may be a useful framework from which to study the origins, clinical correlates, and treatment of atypical depression. Gender may be an important consideration when considering atypical depression from an attachment perspective.

### Insecure attachment as a factor in hoarding behaviors in a non-clinical sample of women [^78f4128c]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

Hoarding is linked to ambivalence and uncertainty about one's self and others. These notions are close to those constituting attachment representations. Hoarding is also linked to seeking support from objects. Studies concerning attachment and hoarding suggest that attachment representations may impact seeking or possessing objects. Acquiring objects may give people momentary support, normally provided by the attachment figure in cases of stress. This study aims to better understand the links between attachment and hoarding. One hundred and ninety-seven non-clinical women (M = 30.58) completed two self-report questionnaires on attachment and hoarding behaviors. The results show a link between insecure attachment (preoccupied and fearful) and hoarding. Preoccupied and fearful attachments are characterized by a fear of loss and abandonment. Possession and accumulation of objects in hoarding could help insecure people to deal with these fears. Therefore, insecure attachment appears to be a vulnerability factor in the development of hoarding behaviors.

### Anxious solitude and self-compassion and self-criticism trajectories in early adolescence: attachment security as a moderator [^1bb745d9]. Child Development (2017). Low credibility.

Anxious solitude fits under the umbrella term "social withdrawal", which refers to being alone at a high rate relative to peers for any reason. However, AS is distinct from being alone due to unsociability or lack of desire to engage with peers (Asendorpf, 1990; Spangler & Gazelle, 2009). Likewise, AS differs from behavioral inhibited temperament in which children fear the unfamiliar (Gazelle & Rubin, 2010).

AS youth are likely to have insecure representations of attachment to their parents. Evidence indicates that insecure ambivalent attachment predicts anxious solitude (Bohlin, Hagekull, & Rydell, 2000). Insecure ambivalent attachment is linked to inconsistent parenting in which the child sometimes encounters parental availability and responsiveness and sometimes does not. Consequently, the child is uncertain whether he or she is likely to be comforted when distressed. The child may cope with this uncertainty by attempting to draw links between his or her own behavior and his or her parents' response. The child may draw these links in order to try to gain a sense of control in the face of uncertainty, although this strategy may also result in the child feeling badly about him or herself when he or she is not successful in eliciting parental care. The child may feel that he or she is sometimes worthy of care and love and sometimes not. Consequently, he or she may carefully monitor and be critical of his or her behavior to try to prevent poor performance and distress. Consistent with this idea, AS youth have been found to exhibit high self‐criticism and low self‐compassion on average (Peter & Gazelle, 2017). Likewise, they may be vigilant for signs that their parents are not available or responsive to assess the likelihood that they will receive comfort if distressed.

### A learning theory approach to attachment theory: exploring clinical applications [^4757d7a5]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Attachment-Focused Exposure Therapy

The LTA points at exposure therapy as a relevant strategy to interrupt and/or repair insecure cycles because the theory implies that the confusing signals children and parents emit during insecure cycles are equivalent to avoidance behaviors driven by fear. Children fear and avoid the emotional pain linked to being ignored, misunderstood, left alone, or rejected by the parent. The fact that exposure therapy targets avoidance behaviors which underlie attachments could lead one to expect that exposure therapy is only a useful intervention for avoidant attachment-related behaviors. However, the repertoire of behaviors that serve to avoid a feared outcome is much broader than merely avoiding proximity. For exampe, ambivalent attachment behaviors such as protest and persuasion can help avoid feeling unseen (°Sr− or −Sr), or they can stimulate parents to try harder to accommodate the child (+Sr+). This may reduce children's fear that their parents are unavailable (−Sr−). So, the broad spectrum of insecure attachment behaviors can be seen as avoidance behaviors to be targeted in exposure therapy.

Parents, in turn, fear and avoid the emotional pain linked to feelings of failure in their caregiving role. Attachment-focused exposure therapy is expected to be most effective when children and parents are both confronted with care-related interactions because those are the clinically relevant stimuli that elicit family members' attachment-related fears and negative expectations. Although the precise form of the fear eliciting care-related interactions will be different from family to family, the LTA suggests that, at the most abstract level, these interactions consist of the ingredients of the insecure cycle. Thus, function analysis requires to clearly map the elements of the insecure cycle and then design exposure excercises that elicit children's (distorted) attachment signaling which elicits parents' non-supportive responses that feed into the insecure cycle. For corrective learning to occur during exposure, parents are stimulated to abstain from their typical responses and to attend to children's underlying attachment needs in spite of the fears the interaction with their care-seeking child elicit. Children are stimulated to communicate their needs in a more direct manner in spite of their fears that their parents will not understand them.

### Attachment-based parenting interventions and evidence of changes in toddler attachment patterns: an overview [^6b6fc1a3]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

The two most established methods for assessing attachment in young children are the strange situation procedure (SSP) (Ainsworth et al.) and the Attachment Q-Set (AQS) (Waters). The SSP is a standardized, lab-based procedure that comprises a series of 8, 3-min episodes involving separations and reunions between a child (aged 12–18 months), his or her parent, and a 'friendly' stranger. Child behaviors in response to separations and reunions with the parent are observed and used to inform the allocation of 3-way and 4-way attachment classifications (Ainsworth et al.). For the 3-way classification system, a primary classification of 'secure', 'insecure-avoidant', or 'insecure-ambivalent/resistant' is given (with disorganized attachment forced into one of the three organized categories). For the 4-way classification, a primary classification of 'secure', 'insecure-avoidant', 'insecure-ambivalent/resistant', or 'disorganized' is given, with the disorganization classification allocated for children who are observed to lack a coherent strategy of responding to distress associated with the caregiver, e.g. odd, disoriented behaviors; (Main & Solomon). As an alternative to the SSP, the AQS (Waters,) was developed as a 90-item observer Q-sort procedure for use in naturalistic settings. The AQS was designed for use with children aged 12–48 months and is typically scored from a 60–90-min parent–child observation in the family home. It yields a continuous attachment security score ranging from − 1.00 (least like a securely attached child) to + 1.00 (most like a securely attached child).

### Relationship between attachment patterns and personality pathology in adolescents [^216777a0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore the relationship between attachment status and personality pathology in a large clinical sample of adolescents.

Method

Two hundred ninety-four randomly selected psychiatrists and psychologists were each asked to provide data on a patient (aged 14–18 years) in treatment for maladaptive personality patterns. Clinicians completed several measures including a clinician-report attachment questionnaire, several measures of personality pathology, and a clinician-report version of the Child Behavior Checklist.

Results

In both dimensional and categorical analyses, secure attachment was negatively correlated with personality pathology and positively correlated with healthy functioning, whereas disorganized/unresolved attachment was strongly associated with multiple forms of personality pathology. Anxious/ambivalent attachment tended to be associated with measures of withdrawal, internalization, and introversion. Avoidant attachment style was not associated with any single form of personality pathology.

Conclusion

The marked association between unresolved attachment and more severe psychopathology in adolescents, the lack of construct validity of avoidant personality disorder in adolescents, and the broader relations among attachment, personality, and psychopathology are discussed.

### Disrupted affective communication characterizes mothers of infants with disorganized but also ambivalent attachments: an Israeli study [^e9a0b724]. Child Development (2022). Medium credibility.

This study examined whether maternal disrupted communication, which is associated with disorganized infant attachment, also characterizes mothers of ambivalent infants. The study, conducted in Israel, included a Jewish sample (N = 163; 68 Girls) from diverse socioeconomic status, collected between 1991 and 1993 in an earlier study. The sample over-represented ambivalent and disorganized attachments. Attachment was assessed in the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) at 12 months and disrupted communication was coded from the SSP using the Atypical Maternal Behavior Instrument for Assessment and Classification (AMBIANCE; Lyons-Ruth et al., 1999). Mothers of ambivalent infants showed higher disrupted communication than mothers of secure, avoidant, and disorganized infants. The findings shed further light on the correlates of ambivalent attachment and call for research regarding maternal and infant characteristics that differentiate ambivalent versus disorganized attachment.

### Attachment, suicidal behavior, and self-harm in childhood and adolescence: a study of a cohort of Brazilian schoolchildren [^6e67bc8b]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Each drawing was evaluated by two researchers and the disagreements were debated by a judge, who delimited the results. For analysis purposes, the category "non-secure attachment" was constituted as a group of disruptive attachment patterns, that is, the patterns diverging from secure attachment: anxious-resistant/ambivalent, anxious-resistant, disorganized-disoriented. The classification of the mental representation of attachment as "non-secure" was defined by the presence of two or more answers in the high category (score 5 to 7) among the five subscales: vulnerability, role-reversal, emotional distance/isolation, tension/anger, bizarreness/dissociation. In addition to advancing into the specificities of disruptive attachment patterns, we opted for the evolutionary understanding of this deviation in the species' trajectory about suicidal behavior. The term "non-secure" was chosen because some previous classifications used the term "insecure" to specifically group the anxious-resistant/ambivalent and anxious-resistant patterns.

Sociodemographic variables, internalizing problems, and maternal and family variables were also included. The sociodemographic variables considered were collected at the baseline in 2005: biological sex (male or female), age, self-reported skin color (white, black, brown), and social stratum of the family, measured using the Brazil/ABEP Criterion, which evaluates household consumption estimated by the educational level of the parents/guardians and the accumulation of material assets in the household.

The presence of internalizing problems was measured by the ASEBA CBCL and YSR scales in the years 2006, 2008, and 2012, which assess symptoms of retreatment/depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints. Three groups were defined based on the T-score: non-clinical/borderline in all years (T ≤ 63) and clinical in at least one point of the cohort (T > 63). The consideration of the presence of internalizing problems was justified by the association, recognized in literature, between depression and suicide and by the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders in childhood. Cronbach's Alpha for internalizing problems (CBCL, YSR) obtained at the beginning of the study was satisfactory (0.83).

### Development and psychometric properties of the maternal ambivalence scale in Spanish women [^0805132a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

So far, studies reveal three common elements that seem to be involved in the experience of maternal ambivalence. The first refers to the presence of doubts about becoming a mother, about being a good mother, or about one's own will to want to be a mother. Doubts appear in the form of thoughts and feelings of regret or an urge to "back off" or disappear, especially in the weeks just before and immediately after birth, and have been linked to feelings of insecurity or inadequacy, fear of rejection, and fear about the transition to motherhood. The second common element in research into maternal ambivalence is the degree of conviction about becoming a mother. This conviction or confidence about becoming a mother is defined differently across investigations. Some studies focus on the positive meaning attributed to motherhood and the will to be mothers. Other times, conviction is evaluated by means of the losses associated with becoming a mother that affect certainty about being a mother or magnify the lack of it. The third and final component of maternal ambivalence that emerges from the literature is the coping strategy implemented to deal with ambivalence. Coping can be understood as the cognitive and behavioural efforts aimed to solve specific situations that are perceived as threatening and demanding. In the context of motherhood, coping has been conceptualized in a continuum between approach and avoidance. Approach coping strategies are understood as the search for support and information in planning and preparing for motherhood, while avoidance would be represented by efforts to minimize the confrontation of tasks associated with preparing for maternity.

### Attachment style and history of childhood abuse in suicide attempters [^5a87998a]. Psychiatry Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Insecure attachment style has been observed in some people with a history of suicide attempt. Furthermore, some types of abuse in childhood may predict suicide attempt in adulthood. The purpose of this study was to assess the attachment style, history of abuse, demographic information and number of suicide attempts in suicide attempters. This cross-sectional study was performed on 80 suicide attempters in Tehran in 2017. Demographic information, suicide behavior, attachment style and history of childhood abuse were assessed in a psychological interview using the Revised Adult Attachment Scale. Of all, 38.8% had attempted suicide once and 45% had experienced heavy maltreatment in childhood. There was no significant correlation between the number of suicide attempts and the attachment style. History of abuse could predict the number of suicide attempts in 17.3%, which was not significant; 78.8% had avoidant attachment style. The frequency of avoidant and ambivalent attachment styles was higher in suicide attempters who had experienced maltreatment in childhood. Considering the important role of attachment style and history of abuse in attempting suicide, knowledge in this regard is important especially in those at risk of suicide attempt to plan early psychological intervention and prevent suicide.

### Attachment-based parenting interventions and evidence of changes in toddler attachment patterns: an overview [^4a391343]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Attachment Theory

Attachment theory is an ethological theory that seeks to account for the impact of the early parenting environment on a child's social–emotional development and behavior (Bowlby). Originally proposed by Bowlby and further developed in the work of Ainsworth (Ainsworth et al.), attachment theory argues that social, emotional, and cognitive capacities develop and flourish from infancy through the early toddler years in the context of early caregiving that is sensitive and contingently responsive (Lyons-Ruth,), or in other words, caregiving that involves accurately perceiving and interpreting a child's signals followed by prompt, appropriate responding (Ainsworth et al.). Specifically, attachment theory suggests that it is through repeated experiences of sensitive and responsive interactions with the caregiver that the infant or young toddler develops an internal working model of the primary caregiver as a "secure base" from which he or she can explore the environment, and feel assured that comfort and protection will be available when required. Conversely, insecure attachment patterns develop when the child experiences repeated interactions with a caregiver in which his or her bids for parental proximity/emotional support are rejected or met inconsistently. According to attachment theory, children who have experienced this type of caregiving typically develop internal working models of the parent as unavailable or unreliable, and thus they engage in compensatory strategies (attachment avoidance or attachment ambivalence/resistance) to deal with the resulting relational stress. In addition, infants and toddlers who experience abusive, frightening or frightened parenting may fail to develop a coherent or organized attachment strategy. These children typically show odd, disorganized behaviors in the presence of key attachment figures (Main & Solomon).

### Psychiatric diagnosis: the indispensability of ambivalence [^33b1d200]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

In order adequately to attend to these realities, we need to consider diagnosis as classification (the problematic that has characterised, unsurprisingly, most of the DSM–5 debates) and attend to diagnosis as a process. A focus on process allows us to attend to how diagnostic practices are temporally and spatially complex, and have effects at different scales. Psychiatric diagnosis is not best thought of taking place in a single moment in a single place; it is often not something that 'matters' for a diagnosed person in the same way in all the spaces in which she lives her life. Certain psychiatric diagnoses can usher in profound and traumatic events carrying potentially irrevocable consequences (eg, in many countries in Central and Eastern Europe, a diagnosis is used as a 'status' ascription (see Szmukler) in order to deprive people of their legal capacity, which can lead to long-term institutionalisation). Certain diagnoses might well serve as the catalyst for poorer treatment in multiple domains (though this might well be the result of compound effects of multiple forms of discrimination and disempowerment, rather than the effect of the psychiatric diagnosis per se.)While there are many occasions in which dispute about or negotiation around diagnosis (whether by clinicians or by the patient and/or family member) is very common, there are, equally, many other occasions where such negotiation or dispute hardly features. But it is far from clear whether all psychiatric diagnoses always function as the 'master status'that trump other elements of a person's identity. The consequences of psychiatric diagnosis are heterogeneous, as are the manifold reactions to them from people who receive them. Psychiatric diagnoses are engaged and lived with in multiple, ambivalent and often contradictory ways.

### 'The flexible, the rigid and the ambivalent': a latent profile analysis in dementia caregiving regarding ambivalence, guilt, experiential avoidance, and dysfunctional beliefs [^c27f3c92]. Aging & Mental Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Taking care of a relative with dementia is linked to relevant consequences on the physical and psychological status of the caregiver. However, several variables, such as experiential avoidance, ambivalence, and guilt feelings or the presence of rigid beliefs about care, may influence the impact of the stressors derived from caregiving. The objective was to identify caregiving profiles based on these variables and to examine their correlates.

Method

A total of 456 dementia caregivers participated.

Results

The results of latent profile analysis yielded three distinct profiles: (1) flexible, (2) rigid, and (3) ambivalent. The ambivalent profile was mostly composed of younger women who reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, and desire to institutionalize their relative with dementia. The rigid profile showed a lower use of formal resources for caring.

Conclusion

Our findings may help clinicians to identify highly vulnerable profiles in caregiving, which may be defined by being a younger woman, devoting fewer hours to caring, and reporting high stress associated with behavioral problems, and high levels of guilt and ambivalence.

### Attachment, suicidal behavior, and self-harm in childhood and adolescence: a study of a cohort of Brazilian schoolchildren [^1968909f]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The questions about non-suicidal self-injury/suicide attempt and suicidal ideation were grouped under the construct "suicidal behavior/self-harm" based on the low prevalence of the studied phenomena; because these constructs somehow address the same interest group; and because the participants were evaluated in the period between childhood and the first half of adolescence, a time when the boundaries between the studied problems are not always easy to define.

The independent variable of interest is the mental representation of attachment, measured according to the family drawing drawn by the children at the baseline of the research. The technique for evaluating the mental representation of attachment based on the child's family drawing was conceived by Kaplan & Main (1985) and refined by Fury (1996, 1997). Each drawing was evaluated based on the Global Rating Scale of Attachment Relationship, consisting of eight subscales: (i) vitality/creativity and (ii) family pride/happiness, which relate to the feeling of security and are used to assess secure attachment; (iii) vulnerability, which relates to anxious-resistant/ambivalent attachment; (iv) role-reversal, which relates to anxious-resistant attachment; (v) role-reversal, which concerns anxious-resistant attachment; (v) role-reversal) emotional distance/isolation, which relates to anxious attachment- avoidant; (vi) tension/anger, a subscale related to anxious-avoidant attachment; (vii) bizarreness/dissociation, which evaluates disorganized-disoriented attachment; and (viii) global pathology, which seeks to combine the above items and chart an emotional health index for children in the context of the family, assessing feelings of insecurity in general. Each of these subscales is evaluated according to a score ranging from 7 (very high) to 1 (very low). The scores were grouped into three categories: high ('very high', 'high', 'moderately high'), moderate and low ('moderately low', 'low', and 'very low').

### Interbrain substrates of role switching during mother-child interaction [^6eee7ed3]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

It is worth mentioning that during mother–child cooperation, actor‐observer interbrain synchrony was related to the emotional bonding from the actor toward the observer rather than the observer's affection toward the actor. These findings suggest that stronger actor‐toward‐observer emotional bonding in a mother–child relationship seems to have provided a better context for mutual interaction with higher increment of interbrain synchrony.

Several limitations of this study should be mentioned. First, as this is an exploratory study involving many factors, the conclusions remain preliminary and should be further validated by confirmatory studies with a large sample size. Second, the relationship between interbrain synchrony and behavioral traits was only explored with child–mother attachment and interaction quality in daily life but not with the interaction behavior during the task, since participants were asked to minimize unnecessary interaction behavior (such as talking and task‐irrelevant interactive motions) to reduce EEG artifacts. In addition, child–mother attachment and interaction quality in daily life were assessed using parent‐report questionnaires rather than direct observation, which may generate bias. However, the bias was minimized by choosing standardized and widely used instruments. The structure of our attachment questionnaire was also different from widely used attachment assessments like the Experiences in Close Relationships‐Revised and Relationship Scales Questionnaire. These established measures typically separate attachment avoidance from disorganization, whereas our questionnaire does not have a distinct disorganized dimension. This might affect direct comparability with existing literature and standardized measures. Moreover, in our study, the score of SA showed a negative association with ambivalent attachment but not with avoidant/disorganized attachment (Supplementary Table 2). This suggests that SA dimension in our scale appears to capture the ambivalent aspect of insecurity but not the avoidant aspect of insecurity. Or to be more accurate, our findings in attachment pattern are related to secure versus insecure‐ambivalent specifically. Third, the tangram puzzle‐solving game was easy for most of the 3‐year‐old children, and therefore we were not able to detect any association between the task performances of children (e.g. willingness, speed, or accuracy) and the interbrain synchrony. Further studies are strongly encouraged to explore the correlation between concurrent behaviors and interbrain synchrony during interaction. Fourth, channel‐level analysis was not able to find the exact brain regions that were involved in mother–child interaction. Further source‐level study with more channels is needed to get more accurate inferences about the important brain regions. Finally, since previous studies have uniformly found higher interbrain synchrony in cooperative tasks than that in individual tasks (Cui et al; Li, Wu, et al; Miller et al; Nguyen et al; Nguyen, Schleihauf, et al; Reindl et al.), this study only focused on the interbrain synchrony with an increasing trend with interaction degree. There were also some changing patterns of interbrain synchrony that were disordered and difficult to interpret, which is worth future investigation with a larger sample size.

### The significance of insecure and disorganized attachment for children's internalizing symptoms: a meta-analytic study [^388e99b2]. Child Development (2012). Low credibility.

This meta-analytic review examines the association between attachment and internalizing symptomatology during childhood, and compares the strength of this association with that for externalizing symptomatology. Based on 42 independent samples (N = 4,614), the association between insecurity and internalizing symptoms was small, yet significant (d = 0.15, CI 0.06~0.25) and not moderated by assessment age of internalizing problems. Avoidance, but not resistance (d = 0.03, CI -0.11~0.17) or disorganization (d = 0.08, CI -0.06~0.22), was significantly associated with internalizing symptoms (d = 0.17, CI 0.03~0.31). Insecurity and disorganization were more strongly associated with externalizing than internalizing symptoms. Discussion focuses on the significance of attachment for the development of internalizing versus externalizing symptomatology.

### An investigation of whether emotion regulation mediates the relationship between attachment insecurity and suicidal ideation and behaviour [^9c1d08f6]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The findings suggest that those with multiple suicide attempts are more anxiously attached. Anxious attachment style is associated with "hyperactivation" of the attachment system. In response to an inconsistent caregiver, individuals may intensify needs in order to demand love and attention (Mikulincer & Shaver). It could be suggested that multiple suicide attempts are a way of expressing unmet needs, as supported by Adam's theory that suicidal behaviour is an extreme attachment behaviour. However, if the individual's aim at the time of suicide attempt is to activate the attachment system and receive love and care, this contradicts the idea that the individual intended to die. Those with a history of multiple suicide attempts have described ambivalence around the decision to end their life (Bergmans et al.). Research has suggested that there is an association between avoidant attachment and objective suicidal intent but this relationship was not found for anxious attachment (Levi‐Belz et al.). This could indicate that when anxious individuals engage in suicidal behaviours, there is less intent to die or more ambivalence around this, than when avoidant individuals make attempts. In Adam's model, anxious attachment may therefore be placed at the more 'external' end of the internalisation continuum than avoidant attachment, and suicide attempts for anxiously attached individuals may more frequently be in response to interactions that threaten an attachment relationship. Further research is needed in order to evidence Adam's model, but as many studies rely on self‐reports regarding highly emotive experiences, it may be difficult to accurately determine intent to die and the role of relational difficulties at the time of the suicide attempt.

### Emotional, behavioral, and developmental features indicative of neglect or emotional abuse in preschool children: a systematic review [^3a964bdf]. JAMA Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Early intervention for neglect or emotional abuse in preschoolers may mitigate lifelong consequences, yet practitioners lack confidence in recognizing these children.

Objective

To define the emotional, behavioral, and developmental features of neglect or emotional abuse in preschoolers.

Evidence Review

A literature search of 18 databases, 6 websites, and supplementary searching performed from January 1, 1960, to February 1, 2011, identified 22669 abstracts. Standardized critical appraisal of 164 articles was conducted by 2 independent, trained reviewers. Inclusion criteria were children aged 0 to 6 years with confirmed neglect or emotional abuse who had emotional, behavioral, and developmental features recorded or for whom the carer-child interaction was documented.

Findings

Twenty-eight case-control (matched for socioeconomic, educational level, and ethnicity), 1 cross-sectional, and 13 cohort studies were included. Key features in the child included the following: aggression (11 studies) exhibited as angry, disruptive behavior, conduct problems, oppositional behavior, and low ego control; withdrawal or passivity (12 studies), including negative self-esteem, anxious or avoidant behavior, poor emotional knowledge, and difficulties in interpreting emotional expressions in others; developmental delay (17 studies), particularly delayed language, cognitive function, and overall development quotient; poor peer interaction (5 studies), showing poor social interactions, unlikely to act to relieve distress in others; and transition (6 studies) from ambivalent to avoidant insecure attachment pattern and from passive to increasingly aggressive behavior and negative self-representation. Emotional knowledge, cognitive function, and language deteriorate without intervention. Poor sensitivity, hostility, criticism, or disinterest characterize maternal-child interactions.

Conclusions and Relevance

Preschool children who have been neglected or emotionally abused exhibit a range of serious emotional and behavioral difficulties and adverse mother-child interactions that indicate that these children require prompt evaluation and interventions.

### Psychiatric diagnosis: the indispensability of ambivalence [^4cc141cf]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The DSM–5 discussions have tended to be polarised, and have tended to present streamlined accounts of what a psychiatric diagnosis is and whether the DSM–5 taxonomy is normatively good or bad. Within this polarised landscape, diagnosis has commonly been conceptualised as an event that is driven by psychiatry, and that is discrete, punctual, and that 'captures' (for good or ill) the person so designated. In contrast, this article calls for greater attention to the messiness and diversity of reactions to and positions regarding DSM–5, and of the configurations through which psychiatry and mental health are made and remade. I have argued, in particular, that we need to keep in clear view greyer, more ambivalent accounts of psychiatric diagnosis. By this, I mean accounts that attend to how diagnosis comprises processes and practices that are highly mediated across time and across space, and that incur temporally and spatially heterogeneous and ambivalent responses from those who receive them.

Those espousing certainty in relation to psychiatric diagnosis (whichever end of the spectrum they lie) have tended to grab much of the discursive space through which ethical issues surrounding diagnosis might be deliberated, and have created an environment — whether deliberately or not — in which a limited number of concerns are commonly regarded as the central ethical issues concerning psychiatric diagnosis. This is, in itself, a matter of ethical concern. For example, current emphasis (in light of the DSM–5 debates) on diagnosis as classification rather than as process has arguably deflected energy away from focused consideration of if, when, how and by whom negotiation over particular diagnoses does — and indeed should — take place. The underacknowledgement of diagnosis as a highly mediated set of practices has arguably resulted in a lack of critical reflection on how the communication of psychiatric diagnoses takes place (and indeed should take place). If, for example, clinicians are no longer imagined as the primary conduit through which a diagnosis is given — but rather as one node in a complex network of influences, transmitters, and cultural atmospheres that shape understandings of psychiatric diagnosis — how might this affect the role of the clinician in communicating and discussing psychiatric diagnoses? Or if every act of psychiatric diagnosis is understood to be embedded in complex — and very particular — social, legal, clinical, cultural, familial and psychological configurations, how might this affect the act of making normative judgements about whether diagnosis is 'good' or 'bad'?

### Variation in the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) moderates the influence of maternal sensitivity on child attachment [^83f9b1df]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Child attachment

Child attachment was assessed during an in-lab visit at 36 months using the Preschool Separation-Reunion Procedure, a modified version of the Strange Situation developmentally suitable for use with preschool-aged children (see for validation studies). This procedure consists of a 20-minute-long assessment period comprising a sequence of separations/reunions lasting 5 minutes each: (1) separation between mother and child; (2) reunion; (3) second separation, and (4) second reunion. Following standard procedure, the child's behavior (physical contact and/or seeking or maintenance of physical proximity, body position, content and style of speech directed toward the mother, looking behavior directed toward the mother, verbal and non-verbal indices of affect) was coded by trained observers from videotape using the MacArthur Preschool Attachment Coding System (PACS), giving rise to one of four attachment classifications: secure, ambivalent, avoidant, or disorganized. In this coding scheme, a secure attachment style is indicated by the child's effective use of the mother as a secure base for exploration, as well as relaxed, mutually enjoyable interaction between mother and child. Contrastingly, ambivalent attachment is characterized by reduced exploration as well as excessive preoccupation with the mother (e.g. following her around the room, asking to be held), accompanied by heightened distress. Avoidant attachment is marked by avoidance of intimate interaction with the mother. Finally, children who appear to lack a coherent attachment strategy are classified as disorganized. In this sample, there were 129 secure, 32 ambivalent, 13 avoidant, and 49 disorganized classified children. [Note that the percentage of children classified as disorganized is consistent with the rates reported in two recent large meta-analyses of children in pre-school years and infancy (21.5% and 23.5%, respectively).]

### Impact of attachment style on the 1-year outcome of persons with an at-risk mental state for psychosis [^7b253c5d]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Attachment theory provides key elements for understanding the psychosocial vulnerability for and response to the emergence of psychosis. This study examined (1) whether pre-treatment attachment styles are differentially associated with clinical and functional outcome in at-risk mental state (ARMS) for psychosis patients across one year of psychosocial treatment, and (2) whether clinical change is associated with changes in attachment ratings beyond the effect of baseline symptom severity. Thirty-eight ARMS patients (mean age = 16.7, S.D. = 5.9) identified from a psychosocial needs-adapted treatment were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Global Assessment of Functioning, and the Relationships Questionnaire. Lower levels of insecure-avoidant attachment predicted better clinical outcomes, whereas higher levels of secure attachment predicted improvement in functioning. A decrease in preoccupied-anxious attachment was associated with symptom amelioration. The findings suggest that the intensity of insecure attachment plays a significant role in the clinical outcome of ARMS patients involved in psychosocial treatment. Reducing the levels of insecure attachment in the therapeutic setting probably favors a better course in the early phases of psychosis. Furthermore, the finding that negative models of the self and others were associated with symptom outcome is consistent with current psychosocial models of psychosis.

### Adult attachment representations and depressive symptoms: a meta-analysis [^80c069b0]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Attachment theory has long argued that insecure and disorganized attachment representations are associated with vulnerability to psychopathology in general, and depressive symptoms in particular. However, studies assessing the link between insecure and disorganized attachment and depressive symptoms report inconsistent results. The primary aim of this meta-analysis was to examine the extent to which adult attachment representations are associated with depressive symptoms.

Methods

We conducted a literature search for published studies using PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and ProQuest in March 2017, identifying 55 samples (N = 4,386). Eligible studies assessed depression using a well-validated self-report or clinical diagnostic measure of depression and attachment using the Adult Attachment Interview.

Results

Results demonstrated that insecure individuals had higher levels of depression than secure-autonomous individuals (d = 0.21, 95% CI [0.08–0.33]). Specifically, insecure-preoccupied individuals (d = 0.48, 95% CI [0.30–0.65]), but not insecure-dismissing individuals (d = 0.09, 95% CI [-0.03–0.22]), exhibited significantly more depressive symptoms than the secure-autonomous individuals. Additionally, unresolved adults had higher levels of depression than adults with organized attachment classifications (d = 0.29, 95% CI [0.13–0.44]).

Limitations

Due to the nature of the studies reviewed, causal inferences regarding the links found between adult attachment representations and depressive symptoms may not be drawn. Further, the aggregate effect sizes do not solely reflect the magnitude of the association between attachment representations and clinically-diagnosed major depressive disorder.

Conclusions

The results of this meta-analysis have important conceptual and practical implications for attachment-based prevention and intervention efforts, as they suggest that attachment representations, specifically insecure-preoccupied and unresolved, are associated with depressive symptoms in adulthood. Future research using longitudinal and intervention-based designs should examine the extent to which insecure-preoccupied and unresolved attachment lead to increased depressive symptoms, as well as the mechanisms by which these attachment patterns across the life span may increase vulnerability to depressive symptoms in adulthood.

### A self-comfort oriented pattern of regulatory behavior and avoidant attachment are more likely among infants born moderate-to-late preterm [^b18ee86c]. Infancy (2022). Medium credibility.

Infants born preterm (< 37 gestational weeks, GW) are at increased risk for regulatory difficulties and insecure attachment. However, the association between infants' regulatory behavior patterns and their later attachment organization is understudied in the preterm population. We addressed this gap by utilizing a Portuguese sample of 202 mother-infant dyads. Specifically, we compared the regulatory behavior patterns of 74 infants born moderate-to-late preterm (MLPT, 32–36 GW) to those of 128 infants born full-term (FT, 37–42 GW) and evaluated the associations of these regulatory patterns with later attachment. Infants' regulatory behavior patterns (Social-Positive Oriented, Distressed-Inconsolable, or Self-Comfort Oriented) were evaluated in the Face-to-Face-Still-Face paradigm at 3 months, and their attachment organization (secure, insecure-avoidant, or insecure-ambivalent) was evaluated in the Strange Situation at 12 months corrected age. In both samples, the Social-Positive-Oriented regulatory pattern was associated with secure attachment; the Distressed-Inconsolable pattern with insecure-ambivalent attachment; and the Self-Comfort-Oriented pattern with insecure-avoidant attachment. However, compared to FT infants, infants born MLPT were more likely to exhibit a Self-Comfort-Oriented pattern and avoidant attachment. Most perinatal and demographic variables were not related to infant outcomes. However, infants with a higher 1-min Apgar were more likely to exhibit the Social-Positive-Oriented regulatory pattern and secure attachment.

### The significance of insecure attachment and disorganization in the development of children's externalizing behavior: a meta-analytic study [^00a107a1]. Child Development (2010). Low credibility.

This study addresses the extent to which insecure and disorganized attachments increase risk for externalizing problems using meta-analysis. From 69 samples (N = 5,947), the association between insecurity and externalizing problems was significant, d = 0.31 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.40). Larger effects were found for boys (d = 0.35), clinical samples (d = 0.49), and from observation-based outcome assessments (d = 0.58). Larger effects were found for attachment assessments other than the Strange Situation. Overall, disorganized children appeared at elevated risk (d = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.50), with weaker effects for avoidance (d = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.21) and resistance (d = 0.11, 95% CI: -0.04, 0.26). The results are discussed in terms of the potential significance of attachment for mental health.

### Attachment status in children prenatally exposed to cocaine and other substances [^5f7f182e]. Child Development (2004). Low credibility.

Attachment status of children exposed in utero to cocaine, opiates, and other substances was examined at 18 months (n = 860) and 36 months (n = 732) corrected age. Children exposed to cocaine and opiates had slightly lower rates of attachment security (but not disorganization), and their insecurity was skewed toward ambivalent, rather than avoidant, strategies. Continued postnatal alcohol use was associated with higher rates of insecurity and disorganization at 18, but not 36, months of age. Stability of attachment across the 18-month period was barely above chance expectation. Attachment status at 18 months was associated with child temperament and caregiver-child interaction; at 36 months, attachment was associated with child temperament, child behavior problems, and caregivers' parenting self-esteem.

### Linguistic markers and basic self-disturbances among adolescents at risk of psychosis. A qualitative study [^d9c49586]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Cluster C. Metaphors and subordinating conjunctions – indicating deep experiential insecurity and ambivalence

The statements included a conspicuous and extensive use of subordinating conjunctions 'in a way, as if, seems like'. Conjunctions like 'feel like' and 'as if' indicated an ambivalence and deep doubt or insecurity that did not fade away, towards the reality status of their experiences. This element was further explored in analyses of figurative language and the widespread use of metaphors. We noted a fuzzy border between the symbolic and literal meaning of metaphors. Two participants reported that they had daily moments of being slightly uncertain whether they were asleep or awake (not related to waking up or falling asleep) and were anxious when they attended school and were together with family and friends when they had this experience. Hence, we understood 'dream' not only as a simple metaphor but more literally, as an overwhelming experience of unreality, which caused fear and confusion. The accompanying use of conjunctions stresses the ambivalence and therefore an essential contrast to delusional convictions and fixed beliefs manifested in the case of definite psychotic symptoms.

### Measurement of ambivalent and purposeful engagement after aversive social experiences [^cea8ecae]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

We describe two ways that participants may react to their internal experiences subsequent to stressful interpersonal interactions: Ambivalent engagement, consisting of attempts to avoid or dismiss the experiences arising from memories of the situation, and purposeful engagement, consisting of effortful attempts to approach the memories and internal experiences associated with the event. In a series of studies employing undergraduate samples, we evaluate a self-report method of measuring these trait-like constructs. The measure shows promising psychometric properties, including adequate to good factorial validity, good internal consistency, good test-retest reliability, and strong convergent and discriminant validity across a variety of theoretically related measures. This method of measuring ambivalent and purposeful engagement should be useful in investigating whether these constructs are related to the development of such disorders as social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as whether purposeful engagement is related to therapeutic change.

### Mothers seeing their VLBW infants within 3 h after birth are more likely to establish a secure attachment behavior: evidence of a sensitive period with preterm infants? [^3e66a946]. Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Close contact of mother and child in the first hours after birth is essential for the establishment of a secure attachment behavior in term infants. To date, studies investigating whether a 'sensitive period' also exists for very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants are lacking.

Study Design

Attachment patterns of 62 VLBW infants were assessed using the 'strange situation' setting and correlated with the time mothers saw their child for the first time. Furthermore, maternal and infant covariates possibly influencing the attachment behavior were analyzed. As maternal factors the mother's age, social status and pregnancy history were recorded and at three time points (time 1, 2 and 3 (t-1, t-2 and t-3)), a semi-structured interview, a depression and a social support questionnaire were performed. As infant factors neonatal basic data, ventilation time and length of hospital stay were recorded. Disease severity was scored using the clinical risk index for babies, score for neonatal acute physiology (SNAP), SNAP perinatal extension and nursery neurobiological risk score. At time points t-2 and t-3, the infants were examined using the second edition of Bayley scales of infant development.

Results

In all, 53.2% of the children showed a secure, 33.9% an insecure-avoidant, 3.2% an insecure-ambivalent and 9.7% an insecure-disorganized attachment behavior. Preterm infants whose mothers had seen them within 3h after birth had a higher rate of secure attachment than preterm infants with no early contact (76 versus 41%, P = 0.009). Firstborns showed a significantly higher rate of insecure attachment behavior (93 versus 67%, P = 0.01). No influence on attachment behavior was shown for any other maternal or infant factor.

Conclusions

Our results support the hypothesis that the first hours after birth are a 'sensitive period' for the development of attachment behavior in VLBW infants. When a mother is enabled to see her infant shortly after birth, the 'sensitive period' right after birth may be used to help forming an important basis for the secure attachment of the preterm infant.

### Attachment styles and happiness in the elderly: the mediating role of reminiscence styles [^30157d3e]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The current study aims to investigate the relationship between attachment styles and happiness through the mediating role of reminiscence styles in the elderly.

Methods

This was a correlational study of structural equations modelling (SEM) type. The statistical population included all the elderly aged at least 60 years living in Kermanshah province, Iran in 2021, among whom 380 (182 men and 198 women) were selected using convenience sampling method. Participants filled out the questionnaires of Adult Attachment Styles, Oxford Happiness, and Amani et al.'s Reminiscence Styles.

Results

The results indicated that secure attachment style has a positive and negative relationship with positive reminiscence (PR) and negative reminiscence (NR), respectively. However, the opposite held true for both avoidant and ambivalent attachment styles. It was also found that secure attachment style has a positive relationship, and avoidant and ambivalent attachment styles have a negative relationship with happiness. Moreover, participants' gender and age had no moderating effect on the mentioned relationships. The results of SEM indicated that secure and ambivalent attachment styles were associated with happiness through both PR and NR, and avoidant attachment style was associated with happiness only through NR.

Conclusions

The findings emphasize the significance of the development of internal working models based on the kind of parent-child's reminiscences and narratives, and the lifelong effects of these models.

### Attachment-based parenting interventions and evidence of changes in toddler attachment patterns: an overview [^20bb9f21]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Bakermans-Kranenburg et al. investigated 70 studies examining interventions aimed at enhancing attachment security among children younger than 54 months. Results showed aggregate effect sizes of d = 0.20 for improvement in infant attachment security. In addition, this meta-analysis provided evidence showing interventions which were brief (i.e. < 17 sessions), had a behavioral focus, and were conducted after the child was 6 months old, were associated with the greatest improvements in attachment security. Two years later, this same research group completed a meta-analysis of 15 studies reporting results of interventions aimed at preventing disorganized attachment styles (Bakermans-Kranenburg et al.). Results again showed that the most successful interventions targeted children at least 6 months of age and focused mainly on increasing caregiver sensitivity as opposed to providing broader support or changing caregivers' internal representations of attachment. Further, this meta-analysis indicated that interventions were more effective in samples with higher rates of attachment disorganization and in samples of "at-risk" children (e.g. irritable, premature) as opposed to those with "at-risk" caregivers (e.g. poor, socially isolated).

### Attention to faces expressing negative emotion at 7 months predicts attachment security at 14 months [^5f7f76b4]. Child Development (2015). Low credibility.

In the main analyses, logistic regression analysis was conducted to predict secure versus insecure attachment grouping and linear regression was used to predict attachment disorganization (the continuous D scores) on the basis of missing attention shift scores to faces and face‐shaped control stimuli at 7 months of age (with the predictor variables mean centered). The regression analyses were first run with gender and maternal sensitivity included as predictor variables, but as no interactions involving these variables emerged (i.e.g.ender and maternal sensitivity did not interact with missing attention shift scores to predict attachment security or disorganization), they were excluded from the final analyses to reduce the number of predictors and to improve model fit.

The logistic regression model with attachment grouping (secure vs. insecure) as the dependent variable and missing attention shift scores as predictors was significant, χ² = 10.40, p = .034, R² = .15. Attachment grouping was predicted significantly by the proportion of missing attention shifts to neutral (B = − 3.90, SE = 1.79, p = .03) and fearful (B = 3.39, SE = 1.61, p = .035) faces (Figure 2). Separate t tests with the attentional bias scores showed that secure attachment was associated with a larger attentional bias to fearful faces, t (60) = 2.59, p = .012, d = .67, while the bias scores to neutral faces were larger in insecure than secure infants, t (60) = 2.46, p = .017, d = .64. As an exploratory analysis to estimate how these effects manifest in the different insecure subgroups, a multinomial logistic regression with the four‐way attachment classification (A, B, C, D) as the dependent variable and missing attention shift scores as predictors was run. The model was significant, χ² = 23.40, p = .024, R² = .31. Inspection of the parameter estimates (with secure attachment as the reference category) indicated that attachment avoidance was associated with a relatively larger bias to neutral (p = .023) but not fearful (p = .79) faces, whereas both resistant and disorganized attachment were associated with a smaller bias to fearful faces (p s = .039 and.012, respectively), but did not differ from secure attachment in attention to neutral faces (p s = .44 and.15, respectively).

### Practice parameter for the assessment and management of youth involved with the child welfare system [^738d1109]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Principle 7 — clinicians should be aware of special considerations in the evaluation and management of youth involved with the child welfare system, including that evaluations should consider the youth's developmental stage and associated common health, developmental, and mental health issues and evaluators should obtain the youth's lifetime history of maltreatment and trauma, separation effects, developmental trajectory, current functioning, and risk and protective factors in the youth's ecology. The history obtained from informants should include the specific circumstances surrounding the youth's entry into care, the number and qualities of placements, reasons for transitions, youth responses to transitions, and current and longitudinal contact with parents, siblings, and extended family, and the child welfare worker usually provides much of the information. Given the potential multiple viewpoints, motivations, and interests, collecting information from multiple collateral contacts and domains is essential. Trust is a critical component of the therapeutic relationship, and youth with a history of maltreatment, trauma, and disrupted attachments should not be expected to trust their clinicians; clinicians can promote engagement through open and authentic communication and developing youth-identified treatment goals, and alliance-building techniques include attending to nonverbal cues, active listening, validation, warmth, empathy, acceptance, and a nonjudgmental stance. Clinicians should also attend to the youth's perceptions, reactions, emotions, and cognitions related to being involved with the child welfare system, consider typical manifestations of grief, loss, and trauma and the range of reactions to separation from attachment figures, and recognize that youth might feel ambivalent about separation from parents who have maltreated them. Knowledge of normative child and adolescent development, parent–child attachment, and specific trauma-focused training will enhance clinician recognition of the diverse and complex effects of maltreatment, trauma, separation, out-of-home placement, and other aspects of child welfare system involvement.

### Interbrain substrates of role switching during mother-child interaction [^f8ebb88c]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

The Child Attachment Relationship Scale was self‐reported by the mother. This scale was first developed by Liu. It mainly reflects the child's attachment relationship to the mother based on the mother's responses about how the child usually interacts with her. There are 21 items (see Supplementary Table 1 for details) covering three dimensions: secure attachment (SA), avoidant or disorganized attachment, and ambivalent attachment. Each item was scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree) points. Scores of items in each dimension were added, respectively, and the sum was calculated as the value of each dimension. In our sample, the Cronbach's α coefficients for the three dimensions of the scale were 0.66, 0.77, and 0.80, respectively. Children's child–parent attachment was assigned to the dimension with the highest value, and all children in the mother–child group in this study were classified as SA. Therefore, we only included the SA score in further analysis.

### Variation in the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) moderates the influence of maternal sensitivity on child attachment [^f9f7e6db]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We investigated the interactive effects of maternal sensitivity and child OPRM1 A118G genotype on child attachment behavior. We predicted that the more interpersonally sensitive G allele carriers would be more likely than the AA homozygotes to respond to maternal insensitivity with attachment ambivalence. As noted at the outset, attachment insecurity in humans is not a homogenous construct; rather, it can take the form of ambivalence or avoidance. That is, in response to an insensitive caregiver, infants and children cope by either (1) hyperactivating the attachment system — ramping up behaviors like crying, searching, and clinging to secure the elusive caregiver's attention — or (2) deactivating the attachment system — dampening down such attachment related behaviors. Our data indicate that the OPRM1 118G allele predisposes children to the former strategy. This finding parallels earlier work in non-human primates showing an association between an analogous OPRM1 genetic variant and displays of hyperactivated attachment behavior in response to repeated maternal separation. That is, both macaque infants and human children carrying these genetic variants exhibit similar patterns of heightened and more persistent separation distress (crying), clinging to their mothers, and disinterest in exploration (i.e. inability to use the mother as a secure base), particularly after being subjected to inconsistent maternal care. This research is also consistent with other work in humans linking this genetic variant to greater rejection sensitivity, separation anxiety disorder, and attachment insecurity. However, the current work represents an important advance over earlier research on OPRM1 and attachment in humans by being the only study to use extensively validated, objective behavioral measures of both maternal sensitivity and child attachment, as well as longitudinal assessment, thereby increasing reliability, generalizability, and strengthening causal claims.

### Attachment and temperament in the early life course: a meta-analytic review [^f2910cb7]. Child Development (2017). Low credibility.

This meta-analytic review examines the association between early attachment (assessed at 1–5 years) and child temperament (assessed at birth-12 years), and compares the strength of this association with recently documented meta-analytic associations between early attachment and social competence, externalizing behavior, and internalizing symptoms. Based on 109 independent samples (N = 11,440) of diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, temperament was weakly associated with attachment (in)security (d = .14, CI [0.08, 0.19]) but modestly associated with resistant attachment (d = .30, CI [0.21, 0.40]). Temperament was not significantly associated with avoidant (d = .10, CI [-0.02, 0.19]) or disorganized (d = .11, CI [-0.03, 0.25]) attachment. Across developmental domains, early attachment security was more strongly associated with social competence and externalizing behaviors than internalizing symptoms and temperament.

### Relations among perceived parental rearing behaviors, attachment style, and worry in anxious children [^097b26a8]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

The present study extended the findings of Muris et al. [Muris, P. Meesters, C. Merckelbach, H., & Hulsenbeck, P. (2000). Worry in children is related to perceived parental rearing and attachment. Behavior Research and Therapy, 38, 487–497] regarding the relations between perceived parental rearing behaviors, self-reported attachment style, and worry in a community sample to a clinical sample of anxious children. Sixty-four children and adolescents, aged 7–18 years, with a primary anxiety disorder completed (a) the EMBU-C, a questionnaire measuring perceptions of parental rearing behaviors, (b) a single-item measure of attachment style, and (c) an index of worry severity. Findings revealed that child rated parental rearing behaviors, particularly parental rejection, were positively related to child worry. Self-reported attachment style was also related to worry, such that children who classified themselves as ambivalently attached reported higher levels of worry than did children who classified themselves as securely attached. Parenting style and attachment were found to make independent contributions to worry. The results are compared to those from Muris et al.'s community study, and implications for future research are discussed.

### Attachment-based parenting interventions and evidence of changes in toddler attachment patterns: an overview [^14d1493d]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Evidence Base

Kohlhoff et al. evaluated child attachment outcomes following CDI-T phase of PCIT-T in a sample of mother–child dyads (child age range 15–24, M = 19.02, SD = 2.34 months) recruited through a community-based child behavior clinic for treatment of externalizing behaviors. All participants had initially taken part in an RCT study (comparing the CDI-T component of PCIT-T versus a waitlist control condition), following which those in the waitlist condition completed the CDI-T component of PCIT-T. Child attachment was assessed in 16 parent–child dyads who completed the SSP at baseline and then again 6 months later. In this one group of treatment completers, there were no statistically significant differences in the proportions of children who were insecure and disorganized from baseline to follow-up. The authors noted, however, that the odds ratios were in the expected direction, indicating lower odds of showing insecure and disorganized attachment at follow-up than at pre-treatment. The lack of a control group and the sample size were major limitations of this study (attachment outcomes assessed in only 16 of the 66 participants (24%) who were enrolled in the study). While the small sample size meant that the study was underpowered to find effects, the significant attrition rate is also likely to have led to significant sample bias.

Results of Previous Meta-analyses

To date, there have been eight published meta-analyses of studies reporting attachment outcomes following attachment-based interventions for young children, and all of these have included, but were not limited to, toddlers (Bakermans-Kranenburg et al; Facompré et al; Letourneau et al; Van Ijzendoorn et al; Wright & Edginton; Wright et al.). In the earliest of these studies, van Ijzendoorn and colleagues reviewed 16 studies investigating attachment-based interventions targeting maternal sensitivity and attachment security in infants. These authors conducted a meta-analysis of data from 12 studies. Results showed an effect size of d = 0.17 for improving the child–caregiver attachment relationship and suggested that shorter-term interventions and those with narrow foci (e.g. physical contact with infant) were more effective at improving attachment than longer-term interventions with broader foci (e.g. wraparound services).

### Experiences of Brazilian mothers in pain management of children and adolescents with cerebral palsy [^10fbd47d]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To understand the experiences of mothers of children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) regarding the assessment, intervention, and reassessment of their children's pain.

Material and Methods

This is a descriptive-exploratory qualitative study, developed in light of Herbert Blumer's Symbolic Interactionism. Data collection involved interviews with 15 Brazilian women over 18years old who self-identified as literate, had internet access, and were mothers of at least one child or adolescent with CP. Participants were recruited using the snowball sampling technique. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic content analysis.

Results

Three categories emerged: (1) Uncertainties and individualities in the assessment and reassessment of pain; (2) Challenges in seeking interventions for pain relief and (3) " A domino effect, where everything goes wrong ": Impacts of pain.

Conclusion

Mothers report ambivalent feelings of confidence and insecurity in managing their child's pain, especially by characteristics, frequency, and causes of pain. The interventions described are predominantly pharmacological. Mothers perceive healthcare professionals as devaluing their child's pain complaints, rarely seeking care for this symptom. Inadequate pain management can lead to negative outcomes for both children and caregivers.

### A narrative on the neurobiological roots of attachment-system functioning [^dea4edc7]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Development of attachment patterns

Research in humans indicates that individual differences in attachment patterns (secure, insecure-avoidant, insecure-anxious, and disorganized) are consolidated in response to repeated and consistent interactions with attachment figures– support and warmth for security, emotional and spatial distancing for avoidance, uncertainty of care for anxiety, and abuse and neglect in combination with other environmental factors for disorganization.

Studies across species conducted in the recent decade,– suggest that the source of human attachment pattern consolidation may be the epigenetic code – a layer perceived as the dynamic interface between genes and the environment– that directs changes from the cellular level to the psychological level. Epigenetics is the study of partly heritable molecular alterations in Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) and histone proteins that can modify gene expression without changes in the underlying DNA sequence. DNA methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic processes, especially in cross-species attachment research, in which a methyl group attaches to a cytosine nucleotide next to guanine in the DNA at a so-called CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) site. Its function may be compared to that of a dimmer switch: the greater the methylation density on a specific DNA site within a particular cell type or tissue, the greater the repression of the regulatory construct of a related gene. DNA methylation is thought to be influenced by prenataland postnatal life eventsand genetic background, and its state is reversible. Therefore, we predict that the manifestation of human attachment patterns would be directed by epigenetic changes in specific hubs discussed in the current narrative related to attachment behavior.

### Attention to faces expressing negative emotion at 7 months predicts attachment security at 14 months [^d543f493]. Child Development (2015). Low credibility.

Infant–Mother Attachment

Infants and mothers were observed in the SSP (Ainsworth et al. 1978). In accordance with standard procedures, the SSP consisted of seven 3‐min episodes, including two separations from and two reunions with the mother, and interaction with a female stranger. Infants' attachment behaviors were coded from videotapes according to the organized attachment scales by Ainsworth et al. (1978) and the Main and Solomon (1990) coding system for assessing attachment disorganization. On the basis of ratings on 7‐point scales assessing infants' proximity seeking, contact maintenance, resistance, and avoidance during the two reunion episodes, infants were first classified as secure (B), insecure‐avoidant (A), or insecure‐resistant (C). Next, signs of attachment disorganization (D) during each episode when the mother was present were rated using a scale from 1 (no signs of disorganization) to 9 (strong signs of disorganization), with scores higher than 5 receiving a disorganized classification. Infant behaviors contributing to attachment disorganization scoring include contradictory behaviors (e.g. rapid avoidance following a cry for the mother), stereotypical or anomalous behaviors, stilling or freezing, direct signs of apprehension regarding the mother, and misdirected or disoriented behaviors. Intercoder agreement was calculated from 18% of the sample by two coders (authors 1 and 4, both unaware of the maternal sensitivity scores or infants' performance in the eye‐tracking task). For the four‐way ABCD classifications, presence versus absence of secure attachment (i.e. B vs. non‐B), and the presence versus absence of attachment disorganization (i.e. D vs. non‐D), intercoder agreement was 92% (κs = .88,.85, and.81, respectively). Agreement on the continuous D scores was ICC = .91. For the remaining sample, the ABCD classifications were based on a consensus between the first author and expert coders from Leiden University. In the full sample of 73 infants, 46 infants (63%) were classified as securely attached (B), 10 (14%) as insecure‐avoidant (A), 6 (8%) as insecure‐resistant (C), and 11 (15%) as disorganized (D). Within the sample of 62 infants having sufficient eye‐tracking data at 7 months, the distribution was: B = 37 (60%), A = 8 (13%), C = 6 (10%), and D = 11 (17%). These distributions were thus highly concordant with meta‐analytic data on attachment distributions in Western samples (e.g. Van IJzendoorn, Schuengel, & Bakermans‐Kranenburg, 1999), χ² < .58, p = .90. The statistical analyses were conducted using the secure versus insecure grouping and the continuous D scores as dependent variables.

The empirical evidence to support attachment theory is strong. Meta-analytic studies have identified maternal sensitivity as a significant predictor of infant attachment security (Wolff & Ijzendoorn). Numerous studies have documented links between insecure or disorganized attachment measured in infancy and a range of compromised outcomes later in life including externalizing and internalizing behaviors and self-regulation difficulties in middle childhood (Boldt et al; Fearon et al; Madigan et al.), and social, emotional, and mental health difficulties in adolescence and adulthood (Carlson; Girme et al.). Importantly, attachment security has been shown to be protective for children impacted by known risk factors such as poverty (Delker et al.) and parental substance abuse (Edwards et al.).

It should be noted that disorganized attachment (Main & Solomon,) as a hypothesized consequence of experiences of traumatizing fear will be left out of our discussion of attachment implications for therapy and interventions. At this point in time still too many unsettled theoretical and empirical questions limit the possibility of deriving specific clinical implications for disorganized attachment (e.g. see Granqvist et al.).

### Supportive, aversive, ambivalent, and indifferent partner evaluations in midlife and young-old adulthood [^114f2e37]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Age group differences in self-reported supportive, aversive, ambivalent, and indifferent partner relations were examined in a large sample of midlife (aged 40–44 at baseline, n = 1,719) and older (aged 60–64 at baseline, n = 1,675) married and partnered adults assessed on two occasions 4 years apart. Older adults, particularly older men, were more likely to rate their relationship as supportive and less likely to rate their relationship as aversive relative to midlife adults. Midlife adults were more likely to provide ambivalent or indifferent assessments (as opposed to supportive assessments) of their relationship relative to older adults. Results are discussed in the context of possible developmental changes in interpersonal and intimate relations occurring in middle and older adulthood.

### A learning theory approach to attachment theory: exploring clinical applications [^3cce3a05]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4
The Insecure Cycle of mistuned communication between parent and child. This figure shows how mistuned communication between children and parents sets off a negative interaction that feeds into the development of insecure attachment-related expectations, anxious and avoidant defensive strategies that lead to children's distorted signaling of attachment needs to which parents respond in a non-supportive way that further confirms children's insecure attachment expectations

Children's insecure attachment behaviors run the risk of perpetuating insecure cycles instead of triggering protective parenting. This is because the child's attachment signals challenge caregivers' ability to read and respond to their child's needs for protection and support. The child's angry, demanding or withdrawn behaviors may prime parents' own past negative attachment memories or they may reinforce parents' negative view of their child, their child's development, and of themselves as failing in their parenting task or as not being worthy to be loved. These negative expectations bias parents toward reading the child's signals as inappropriate behaviors that need to be stopped. As a result, they miss the child's underlying need for protection and support. Instead, they unintentionally confirm the child's lack of trust in their parents' availability and responsive support. This cycle of children's insecure signals and of parents' misattuned responses might reduce the CS parent − UCS support contingency and promote children's trait-like expectations that parents will not provide care during distress.

### The relationship between adult attachment style and post-traumatic stress symptoms: a meta-analysis [^4651e236]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that adult attachment plays a role in the development and perseverance of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This meta-analysis aims to synthesise this evidence and investigate the relationship between adult attachment styles and PTSD symptoms. A random-effects model was used to analyse 46 studies (N = 9268) across a wide range of traumas. Results revealed a medium association between secure attachment and lower PTSD symptoms (ρˆ = -.27), and a medium association, in the opposite direction, between insecure attachment and higher PTSD symptoms (ρˆ = .26). Attachment categories comprised of high levels of anxiety most strongly related to PTSD symptoms, with fearful attachment displaying the largest association (ρˆ = .44). Dismissing attachment was not significantly associated with PTSD symptoms. The relationship between insecure attachment and PTSD was moderated by type of PTSD measure (interview or questionnaire) and specific attachment category (e.g. secure, fearful). Results have theoretical and clinical significance.

### A narrative on the neurobiological roots of attachment-system functioning [^9343ae1b]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

Attachment behavior and the consolidation of attachment patterns encapsulate complex, multifaceted processes that span the spectrum of animal and human experience. In the present manuscript, we aim to share a comprehensive theoretical framework that integrates the myriad of elements identified across various research domains into a cohesive narrative. This approach aims to deepen our insight into how attachment bonds are formed and maintained among humans and animals and highlight the significant role of epigenetic processes in influencing a wide array of life domains, from threat responses and romantic relationships to psychopathology. Nonetheless, it is essential to acknowledge that, despite its comprehensive scope, any theoretical argument represents a simplification of the many processes occurring across our 37 trillion cells. It nonetheless underscores the complexity of animal and human development and the ongoing challenge of capturing the full spectrum of attachment-related phenomena. Through its ambitious synthesis, we hope that the current work sets the stage for future explorations that promise to unravel further the mysteries of human attachment behavior and development, underscoring the profound impact of these processes on our lives.

### Understanding nuance and ambivalence in intergenerational relationships through fiction [^cee9c681]. The Gerontologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we have shown how fiction can be used to humanize and add nuance to the term "intergenerational relationships". Notably, the novels read by the groups did not explicitly mention intergenerational relationships and made no reference to cohorts such as "boomer" or "millennial". Instead, they presented readers with complex, emotional, and ambivalent examples of relationships between people of different ages that readers could relate to. The paper makes a number of key contributions to how intergenerational relationships can be engaged with more meaningfully, beyond simplistic and reductive dichotomies. First, it expands dominant definitions of intergenerational relationships beyond "fixed, cross-sectional cohorts" of people of different ages alive today, to include relationships that are lived and which transition over time. Second, it identifies greater complexity and ambivalence in the articulation of emotions relating to generations and generational identities relating to environmental crises than is depicted in "conflict/solidarity" discourses. Third, it presents ambivalent desires for, on the one hand, policies that foster greater "meaningful intergenerational interaction", while cautioning against interventions that are "contrived" and "inauthentic".

One disorder or two — Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) was divided in the DSM-IV-TR into two subtypes, whereas the International Classification of Diseases–10th Revision (ICD-10) defined two separate disorders; evidence indicates the two RAD types are actually two distinct disorders. The two disorders arise in similar risk conditions such as social neglect, frequent changes in caregivers, or institutional deprivation, but differ in phenomenology, correlates, course, response to treatment, and vulnerability factors, leading to their definition as distinct disorders in the DSM-5.

Lifecourse Perspective

A central feature of the lifecourse perspective is the principle of "linked lives", which emphasizes relational interconnectedness. That is, individual lives are embedded within and influenced by relationships with others (i.e. family), and shifts in dependence, independence, and interdependence can transform these relationships. For example, in early-stage families, young children are reliant upon their parents to meet most of their daily needs. As families mature, there is an increase in the bidirectional flow of instrumental, financial, and emotional support between adult children and their parents. In late-life families, parents can begin to experience declines in their physical and mental functioning and turn to their adult children for help and assistance. Assuming greater support and responsibility for parents can perpetuate ambivalent and sometimes hostile feelings about the parent–child relationship, particularly if the foundation of the relationship is compromised by past abuse. Asexplained, elder abuse can take the form of "reverse violence", in which adult children who are in a position to help their parents in late life become abusive to "exact revenge" for the poor treatment they received when they were young (p. 186).suggested that unresolved trauma and weak bonds of attachment and emotional closeness between adult children and their parents can also increase the likelihood of elder mistreatment.

### A narrative on the neurobiological roots of attachment-system functioning [^5fcc9d88]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Research has shown that in response to distinct infant-caregiver interaction patterns in times of need, infants develop different personality-like dispositions known as attachment patterns. These patterns are either characterized as organized (i.e. secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-anxious) or disorganized. In humans, infants who establish a secure attachment relationship with their attachment figures generally show distress when separated from them. They seek comfort from their caregivers to cope with distress and utilize them as a stable base to explore their surroundings. Conversely, insecure-avoidant infants are often absorbed in exploring their surroundings and rarely seek physical comfort, sometimes even actively avoiding it (i.e. attachment system deactivation). Insecure-anxious infants frequently become upset even when their attachment figures are present, and they typically cannot be appeased after separation, displaying either passivity or anger (i.e. attachment system hyperactivation). Thus, insecure-anxious infants are less likely to venture and explore their surroundings, even when their attachment figures are present. Lastly, disorganized attachment characterizes infants with mixed, bewildered, or cautious behaviors toward their attachment figures, particularly in highly stressful situations often experienced as part of early adversity. Attachment patterns remain relatively constant from infancy through adolescence, and even into late adulthood, according to studies conducted over periods as long as 59 years. Although the psychological processes relating to developing and maintaining attachment behaviors and interindividual patterns are well-studied, the exact neurobiological processes sustaining them are yet to be elucidated.

### Please don't leave Me-separation anxiety and related traits in borderline personality disorder [^1c2348cf]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In light of the apparent symptomatic resemblance of separation anxiety disorder (SAD) symptoms on the one hand and abandonment fears, anxiousness, and separation insecurity central to borderline personality disorder (BPD) on the other hand, a comprehensive overview of separation anxiety and related traits in BPD is provided.

Recent Findings

Epidemiological, environmental, psychological, and neurobiological data connecting BPD to separation events, feelings of loneliness, insecure attachment styles, dimensional separation anxiety as well as SAD per se suggest a partly shared etiological pathway model underlying BPD and SAD. Differential diagnostic aspects and implications for treatment are discussed, highlighting separation anxiety as a promising transdiagnostic target for specific psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment approaches in BPD. This innovative angle on cross-disorder symptomatology might carry potential for novel preventive and therapeutic avenues in clinical practice by guiding the development of interventions specifically targeting separation anxiety and attachment-related issues in BPD.

### Attachment-based parenting interventions and evidence of changes in toddler attachment patterns: an overview [^5d9d89f6]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

There is strong evidence to show links between attachment security in young children and a range of positive outcomes in social, emotional, and psychological domains. The aims of this review were to provide a narrative summary of (1) the attachment-based interventions currently available for caregivers of toddlers aged 12–24 months and for which research about the impact of the program on child attachment patterns has been reported, and (2) the empirical effectiveness of these interventions at improving attachment security. A number of interventions were shown to be associated with shifts to secure and/or organized attachment, with Child-Parent Psychotherapy and Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up emerging as the interventions with the strongest evidence bases. For most interventions, evidence came from just a single research study, and in some cases from studies that were not randomized controlled trials. In order for clinicians to make informed decisions about the interventions they use with parents and toddlers, it is vital that further research be conducted to test the efficacy of all available attachment-based parenting programs using randomized controlled trial designs, in a range of settings and clinical and cultural groups, and with longitudinal follow-ups.

### A learning theory approach to attachment theory: exploring clinical applications [^b72dc63e]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

The insecure cycle can also be intensified by well-meant advice from therapists and parent management trainers to parents to change their approach to their children. Such advice can activate parents' own memories and representations of past experiences with their attachment figures during which they felt inadequate, insufficient, a failure, or not loved. This can activate anxious or avoidant defensive strategies in the parents' approach to the therapist and can set off an insecure cycle between the therapist and the parents. This may decrease therapy alliance and increase drop-out risk. Hence, working with families' insecure cycles requires therapists to acknowledge the parents' competence (they know their child best) and their desire to be a good parent. Therapists may prevent getting drawn too deeply into insecure cycles by always keeping their focus on the parents' underlying attachment needs and related fears. This allows therapists to become an ad hoc attachment figure fostering parents' positive or corrective attachment learning experiences (Bowlby; Byng-Hall; Verschueren & Koomen).

Finally, it is important to note that the insecure cycle model complements the coercive cycle model of parent–child interactions by adding an affective layer to the reinforcers that explain the maintenance of children's challenging behaviors. A coercive cycle is an interactional pattern that is typically observed in children with behavior problems (Reid et al.). The coercive cycle has been described as an operant conditioning process during which children show increasingly demanding behavior to achieve their immediate goals (e.g. receiving toys or candy) and during which parents increasingly concede to the child's demands to escape from the conflict and stress raised by the child (see left half of Table 2). However, these reinforcers disregard possible underlying attachment-related relational meanings or functions. The right half of Table 2 suggests some possible insecure cycle-related reinforcers that can perpetuate the coercive cycle and that can increase the risk that coercive cycles will repeat in the future.

### An attachment perspective on psychopathology [^dd867c1c]. World Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

In recent years, attachment theory, which was originally formulated to describe and explain infant-parent emotional bonding, has been applied to the study of adolescent and adult romantic relationships and then to the study of psychological processes, such as interpersonal functioning, emotion regulation, coping with stress, and mental health. In this paper, we offer a brief overview of the attachment perspective on psychopathology. Following a brief account of attachment theory, we go on to explain how the study of individual differences in adult attachment intersects with the study of psychopathology. Specifically, we review research findings showing that attachment insecurity is a major contributor to mental disorders, and that the enhancement of attachment security can facilitate amelioration of psychopathology.

### Ambivalence resolution in brief psychotherapy for depression [^6032bc5b]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Ambivalence in the process of psychotherapeutic change should be addressed and resolved if we are to avoid psychotherapeutic failure and promote sustained change. In this context, ambivalence can be defined as the cyclical conflictual relation between two opposed positions of the self: one expressed as an innovation, and a subsequent one expressed in a trivialization or rejection of the innovation (problematic position). This conflict may be resolved in two different ways: (a) the dominance of the innovative position and the consequent inhibition of the problematic one and (b) the negotiation between the innovative and the problematic positions. In this study, we sought to study the evolution of the dominance and the negotiation processes in recovered and unchanged cases; to analyse if different therapeutic models produce different results on the evolution of the dominance and negotiation processes, and finally, to study if these processes are predictive of ambivalence resolution. The complete sessions of 22 clinical cases of depression (6 cognitive-behavioural therapy, 10 narrative therapy, and 6 emotion-focused therapy cases) were independently coded for innovative moments, ambivalence, and ambivalence resolution. Results revealed that recovered cases had a progressively higher proportion of negotiation along treatment, whereas in unchanged cases, negotiation was virtually absent throughout treatment. Both dominance and negotiation were significant predictors of ambivalence reduction, however, negotiation had a higher impact than dominance. Overall, these results did not significantly differ for the 3 therapeutic models. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed, and theoretical derived suggestions for clinicians are presented.

### An investigation of whether emotion regulation mediates the relationship between attachment insecurity and suicidal ideation and behaviour [^f3e4d4e1]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

2.3.2 Attachment

The Experiences in Close Relationships Scale–Revised (ECR‐R; Fraley et al.) is a 36‐item self‐report measure, which assesses adult attachment security across two subscales; anxious attachment and avoidant attachment. A typical item for anxious attachment would be "I often worry that my partner will not want to stay with me" and a typical item for avoidant attachment would be "I am nervous when partners get too close to me". Each item has seven response options, rated on a scale from one (strongly disagree) to seven (strongly agree). Higher scores on each subscale indicate higher attachment insecurity.

2.3.3 Emotion regulation

The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer,) is a 36‐item self‐report measure which assesses difficulties with emotion regulation across with higher scores indicating more difficulties with emotion regulation. Typical items include "I have no idea how I am feeling" and "When I'm upset, I feel out of control". The DERS can be used to derive a global emotional dysregulation score but also six subscale scores; 1. Nonacceptance of emotional responses (Non‐acceptance), 2. Difficulty engaging in Goal‐directed behaviour (Goals), 3. Impulse control difficulties (Impulse), 4. Lack of emotional awareness (Awareness), 5. Limited access to emotion regulation strategies (Strategies), and 6. Lack of emotional clarity (Clarity). We did not make a priori hypotheses regarding the individual subscales but present analyses with the subscales for exploratory purposes.

2.3.4 Betrayal trauma

The Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey (BBTS; Goldberg & Freyd,) is a 12‐item self‐report measure, which assesses traumatic events, distinguishing between events involving mistreatment from someone close to the victim, mistreatment from someone not so close to the victim and non‐interpersonal events. Typical items include "You were deliberately attacked that severely by someone with whom you were very close". For each item there are three responses; "never", "1 or 2 times" and "more than that". Participants respond to each item twice, to indicate the extent of their exposure to trauma before and after the age of 18. Higher scores indicate more exposure to trauma. Within this study, only scores for high betrayal trauma items (items number 3, 5, 6, 8 and 10) were used in the analysis.

### A learning theory approach to attachment theory: exploring clinical applications [^f96cbbf3]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

However, when parents give in after a conflict with the child, this typically comes with more or less explicit emotionally laden negative relational messages, expressing irritation and criticism towards the child and explicit or implicit rejection of the child (e.g. McCarty et al.). Hence, although at first sight the fact that children get what they want seems like a mere positive reinforcement of their unwanted behavior, these parental behaviors are a discriminative stimulus for children (Sd) which activates insecure schemas and fears in children about not being loved and being a failure in the eyes of their parents. This is actually a CR that reflects children's past classical learning experiences during which their parents (CS parent) got paired with negative care-related experiences (UCS rejection). These fears elicit more distorted signaling of attachment needs (e.g. oppositional behavior, R child). This behavior gets reinforced because it shifts the focus away from feelings of loneliness and abandonment (−Sr−), because it prevents those feelings to be activated (°Sr−), or because it elicits parental attention (+Sr+) and the hope that parents might respond more sensitively after this new attempt (+Sr+). However, this in turn becomes a Sd for the parents due to which the insecure cycle continues. We propose that the reinforcers identified in the coercive cycle (reduction of stress in the parent, achieving desired goals in the child) have a stronger immediate impact than the reinforcers identified in the insecure cycle. The latter, however, shape the relational environment for coercive cycles to reoccur as the resulting negative appraisals of each other increase the likelihood for new coercive cycles to set off.

### Adult attachment orientation and automatic processing of emotional information on a semantic level: a masked affective priming study [^bb54c976]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Early adverse social experiences leading to attachment insecurity could cause heightened sensitivity to emotional information. Automatic processing of emotional stimuli conveys information about positive-negative differentiation and the so-called possessor vs. other-relevance of valence. The aim of the present study was to examine automatic processing of emotional and relevance type information on a semantic level as a function of adult attachment avoidance and anxiety. A masked affective priming task, varying valence and relevance of prime and target adjectives, was presented to a sample of 153 healthy adults. The Experiences in Close Relationships scale was administered to assess attachment orientation. Significant priming effects for valence and relevance were observed. Attachment avoidance, but not attachment anxiety, was significantly related to affective priming independently of trait anxiety and depression. Specifically, attachment avoidance was found to be related to affective priming effects based on other-relevant words. It can be concluded that automatic processing of emotional adjectives used to characterize safe or risky social environments is heightened in avoidant individuals. The avoidantly attached processing style has similarities with repressive coping, which is characterized by an enhanced early response to emotion stimuli followed by avoidant biases at a controlled processing level.

### Attachment insecurity predicts worse outcome in patients with eating disorders treated with enhanced cognitive behavior therapy: a one-year follow-up study [^3601c599]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

The direct effect of attachment insecurity in maintaining ED symptoms could be explained considering that CBT‐E does not address attachment issues as specific targets of intervention. In particular, it could be hypothesized that persistence of difficulties in emotion regulation might maintain ED psychopathology in insecurely attached patients treated with CBT‐E (Cortés‐García et al.). In line with this hypothesis, a recent longitudinal study demonstrated that emotion dysregulation was the nexus linking early traumatic experiences and worse response to CBT‐E in patients with AN (Cassioli et al.). Considering the very well‐known association between childhood trauma and attachment insecurity (Liotti; Mikulincer & Shaver,), a similar mechanism might be involved in determining reduced treatment response in insecurely attached patients. Shaver and Mikulincer (Shaver & Mikulincer,) theorized that in the presence of attachment insecurity the so‐called security‐based emotion regulation strategies, which are aimed at alleviating distress through flexible and realty‐attuned means, fail. Therefore, the individual is forced to adopt secondary emotion regulation strategies which can be classified in two different types, namely hyperactivating and deactivating ones, based on the appraisal of proximity seeking as a viable option or not, respectively. The adoption of hyperactivating strategies is a core aspect of attachment anxiety and consists in the enactment of very insistent and energetic efforts to obtain closeness, love, intimacy, and care, as this is the only way to obtain relief from negative emotions (Cassidy & Kobak; Mikulincer et al; Shaver & Mikulincer). On the other side, deactivating strategies characterize attachment avoidance, and consist in the inhibition of the need for support to avoid frustration caused by the unavailability of the attachment figure (Cassidy & Kobak; Mikulincer et al; Shaver & Mikulincer). Hyperactivating strategies might maintain ED psychopathology since the continuous monitoring of potential relational difficulties, as well as the intense fear of rejection and abandonment, might determine a generalized state of alarm and suffering only manageable through the enactment of pathological eating behaviors (Cortés‐García et al.). On the other side, considering that the pursuant of true self‐reliance can never be entirely successful (Main,), in individuals with deactivating emotion regulation strategies the excessive importance attributed to body shape and weight may serve as a way to refocus from attachment needs to more attainable goals (Cole‐Detke & Kobak). Finally, considering that the therapeutic relationship is first and foremost an interaction between human beings, high levels of attachment anxiety or avoidance and the consequent enactment of hyperactivating/deactivating emotion regulation strategies in the context of this relationship might menace therapeutic alliance and, as a consequence of this, treatment response (Skourteli & Lennie).

### The role of attachment and dissociation in the relationship between childhood interpersonal trauma and negative symptoms in psychosis [^cc442a74]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

It is now widely accepted that exposure to trauma in childhood, including abuse (physical, sexual, and emotional), neglect, and bullying, increases the risk of developing psychosis (Matheson et al; van Dam et al; Varese et al.). Negative symptoms have been conceptualized as an adaptive response to adverse childhood experiences (Griffiths & McLeod). However, the relationship between childhood trauma and negative symptoms is less well established than positive symptoms (Bailey et al.).

Insecure attachment is one psychological mechanism that has been implicated in the relationship between trauma and negative symptoms in psychosis (Griffiths & McLeod). Bowlby proposed that interactions with attachment figures during infancy lead to the development of mental representations of the self in relation to others. These internal working models (IWMs) are suggested to manifest as attachment patterns that regulate cognitive, behavioural, and affective responses in future interpersonal relationships. Individuals will develop a secure attachment pattern when they have received warm, sensitive, consistent, and responsive caregiving in childhood (Ainsworth, Blehar, Water, & Wall). Insecure attachment patterns develop when early caregiving experiences are insensitive, rejecting, neglecting, or unreliable (Ainsworth et al.).

An insecure avoidant attachment pattern is suggested to involve negative IWMs of others as uncaring and unavailable, due to consistent neglect or rejection from caregivers (Bartholomew & Horowitz). In adulthood, it has been linked to the overregulation and deactivation of affect, interpersonal distancing, and a lack of trusting and confiding relationships (Fraley). Avoidant attachment is overrepresented in people with psychosis (Gumley, Taylor, et al.) and has been associated with specific negative symptoms, including loss of the ability to experience pleasure (anhedonia; Berry et al; Berry, Wearden, et al.) and social and emotional withdrawal (Korver‐Nieberg et al.). Attachment insecurity predicts poor recovery from negative symptoms (Gumley, Schwannauer, et al.). Negative symptoms have been suggested to involve deactivation strategies related to attachment avoidance, whereby an individual controls their interpersonal behaviour, for example, through social withdrawal, and inhibits the attachment system in response to threats to self‐security (Griffiths & McLeod; Liotti & Gumley).

### Attachment in psychosis: a latent profile analysis of attachment styles and association with symptoms in a large psychosis cohort [^877412a4]. Psychiatry Research (2017). Low credibility.

Attachment has been identified as one of various possible mechanisms involved in understanding models of psychosis, but measures that reliably and validly assess attachment styles in psychosis are limited. The aim of this study was to identify attachment patterns in psychosis and examine demographic and clinical correlates across attachment groups. Latent profile analysis on attachment data from 588 participants who met criteria for non-affective psychosis was used to classify people into attachment classes. Four latent classes of attachment were identified: secure, insecure-anxious, insecure-avoidant and disorganised. Secure attachment was the most common attachment style, suggesting that a significant number of clients with psychosis are inherently resilient. Disorganised attachment was associated with a higher proportion of sexual and physical abuse and more severe positive symptoms compared to other attachment classes. This is not only the largest study to examine attachment styles, their demographic and clinical profile, and the clinical profile of disorganised attachment more specifically, in psychosis, but also the first study to use a validated self-report measure of attachment in psychosis to identify four classes of attachment style. Findings advance developmental models of attachment and psychosis; participants with disorganised attachment report more frequent trauma history and more severe psychotic symptoms.

### Insecure attachment as a transdiagnostic risk factor for major psychiatric conditions: a meta-analysis in bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia spectrum disorder [^61f89748]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Insecure attachment has been suggested as a major risk factor for mental health problems as well as a key element for the development and trajectory of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess whether insecure attachment constitutes a global transdiagnostic risk factor in bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. We conducted a PRISMA-based systematic quantitative review to explore the prevalence of insecure attachment among patients of three representative psychiatric disorders - major depression, schizophrenia spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder - in comparison with healthy controls (HC) from a transdiagnostic point of view. Effect sizes on differences of anxious, avoidant and insecure prevalence were calculated based on 40 samples including a total of n = 2927 individuals. Overall, results indicated a large effect on prevalence of insecure attachment across all disorders compared to HC (k = 30, g = 0.88, I² = 71.0%, p < 0.001). In a transdiagnostic comparison, the only difference was found in avoidant attachment, which was significantly lower (p = 0.04) compared to HC in the schizophrenia spectrum disorder subgroup (k = 10, g = 0.31, I² = 76.60%, p < 0.0001) than the depression subgroup subgroup (k = 12, g = 0.83, I² = 46.65%, p < 0.0001). The lack of further transdiagnostic differences between three distinct psychiatric disorders corroborates insecure attachment as a general vulnerability factor to psychopathology. Our findings warrant further investigations, which should explore the pathways from attachment insecurity towards psychopathology. Insecure attachment likely has implications on assessment, prediction and treatment of psychiatric patients.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder [^a8addb08]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Etiology and risk factors for reactive attachment disorder (RAD) — In the DSM-5, RAD is classified as one of a group of "trauma and stress-related disorders", and the phenotype must have resulted from severely "insufficient caregiving", operationalized as social neglect or deprivation, repeated changes of primary caregivers, or rearing in institutions with high child-to-caregiver ratios. Research has confirmed that children who have experienced adverse, neglectful rearing environments have an increased risk of RAD compared to children raised in lower-risk environments, and the phenotype of RAD has not been reported in young children in the absence of a history of neglect. In large institutions, individual differences in observed quality of caregiving relate to individual differences in signs of RAD even after controlling for other child and environmental characteristics, and individual vulnerability factors have not yet been identified.

### Thinking about children's attachments [^5210f2f1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Disordered parental attachment can commit children to lives characterised by relationship difficulties, behaviour problems, educational failure, and poor self-esteem. It is a major root of trans-generational neglect and abuse and frequently underlies mental health problems, drug and alcohol addiction, homelessness, and crime. Early childhood setting of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis function appears to contribute to these costly difficulties. More broadly, the concept of attachment can contribute to defining and managing the psychosocial dimension of routine paediatric care. The current under-representation of attachment in paediatric education, practice, and research needs to be rectified.

### A learning theory approach to attachment theory: exploring clinical applications [^fad43502]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

To understand the parents' Sd (including the CR or feared emotions elicited by their child's behavior) that activate their avoidance behavior (R parent), the MCAT therapist discusses with the parents the current stressors (including their worsening relationship with the child) in their lives and how they get in the way of being the parent they desire to be for the child. This way, the therapist acknowledges the parents' good intentions and their love for the child, which helps to forge a constructive therapist-parent alliance due to which the parent can experience the therapist as a sensitive ad hoc figure and a model of a sensitive caregiver. Subsequently, the therapist explores transgenerational attachment themes, because these themes feed into the parents' primary emotions elicited by the child's unwanted behavior. This additionally helps the therapist to identify parents' motivation to give their child a better childhood than what they themselves experienced as a child (if their past attachment experiences reflect substantial insecurity) or to give their child the quality of care they themselves experienced during their own childhood (if they experienced substantial security as a child).

### Beyond reactive attachment disorder: how might attachment research inform child psychiatry practice? [^f3fcaf02]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

This article provides an updated review of attachment research with a focus on how comprehensive clinical assessment and intervention informs the care of young children. Child psychiatrists can serve as an important part of care coordination teams working with young children who have histories of early maltreatment and/or disruption in caregiving whether or not the children they are seeing meet criteria for an attachment disorder. Child psychiatrists should be familiar with both comprehensive assessment and the recent attachment-based interventions and appreciate how pharmacotherapy can be a useful adjunctive intervention when intensive therapy alone is ineffective.

### Attachment in schizophrenia – implications for research, prevention, and treatment [^3f06159e]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Attachment is a promising area for elucidating psychosocial mechanisms important for development, prevention, and treatment of schizophrenia. This report gives a short summary of studies of attachment in psychosis. It was found that dismissing and disorganized forms of attachment were over-represented in psychosis. Evidence pointed to associations between a dismissing attachment pattern and positive psychotic symptoms, negative symptoms, and poor engagement with services. Furthermore, insecure attachment was found to predict impaired recovery from negative symptoms. Possible major risk processes in development linking dismissing attachment to symptom development were externalizing and deactivation of affects and poor mentalization. For a disorganized form of attachment, possible risk mechanisms were heightened stress-sensitivity and dissociation. Based on this initial evidence, further research in attachment in psychosis focusing on these risk mechanisms seems warranted. In addition, the evidence supported a focus on attachment-related risk processes to enhance the prevention and treatment of psychosis.

### Earned-secure attachment status in retrospect and prospect [^0a1ef1a2]. Child Development (2002). Low credibility.

Past research with the Berkeley Adult Attachment Interview demonstrates that retrospectively defined earned-secures (who coherently describe negative childhood experiences) parent as effectively as do continuous-secures (who coherently describe positive childhood experiences), but manifest liabilities in the form of depressive symptomatology. This article presents data from a 23-year longitudinal study that replicate and extend prior research, testing a key premise that earned-secures so defined actually have a history of insecure attachments that change over time and/or endure consistently harsh or ineffective parenting in their youth. Discrepant with assumptions, retrospective earned-secures were not more likely than continuous-secures to have been anxiously attached in infancy and were observed in childhood and adolescence to have encountered among the most supportive and structured maternal parenting in a high-risk sample. Prospectively defined earned-secures (operationalized using participants' infant attachment classifications) did indeed go on to have success in their close relationships, many without reporting relatively high levels of internalizing distress in adulthood.

### Creating conditions for a sense of security during the evenings and nights among older persons receiving home health care in ordinary housing: a participatory appreciative action and reflection study [^8752da1d]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

We also learned from the stakeholders that the living environment was important to the older persons' sense of security. Relative: " It is important to live where it is beautiful. " Observations revealed that health care aids, equipment, and other mobility aids were often left in plain sight. When we asked the older persons about this, they remarked that they perceived these things as intrusions in their homes that increased their sense of insecurity. However, they expressed ambivalence about these items, since the aids were also recognized as lifelines that contributed to a sense of security.

The NAs also stated that the older persons should live in a familiar environment that they were used to. They also told us that they had become a part of the older persons' sense of security, where the older person guided them. NA: " They show us how to be their hands and feet, and their contact with the outside world. " Staff continuity was important in creating the conditions for a sense of security for both the older persons and the nurses that is, meeting the same person, a person they knew well. Obstacles to this were nursing staff stress and staffing problems that could lead to lack of continuity.

The older persons found it was a struggle to maintain habits and routines, that is, walking and moving, dressing, or going to the bathroom, because "their bodies did not obey them". Pain could also be an obstacle to their mobility. Older person: " I can't put on my shoes, and that's irritating. In the winter, someone has to help me dress. I don't manage it myself, I have pain; it gives me a sense of insecurity. " The NAs remarked how they saw the older persons' sense of insecurity. NA: " People can become insecure if they can't manage going to the bathroom by themselves. " According to the relatives, the ability to move, to get out, and to feel independent is conducive to a sense of security. Since the older persons had limited mobility, the stakeholders reported that the older persons needed assistance in their struggle to maintain their habits and routines.

### Screening for food insecurity: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^0bf0f5c7]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF recommendation: screening for food insecurity — practice considerations describes potential burden, harms, and current practice. Experiencing food insecurity as a child is associated with obesity, asthma, mental health conditions, and worse oral health, and adults with food insecurity often experience chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. No studies reported on the harms of screening, though potential harms include stigma, fear of involvement in the legal/justice system, and other privacy concerns. Several studies indicate that clinicians and patients believe social risks and/or needs, including food insecurity, should be addressed in health care settings, but estimates of screening vary considerably across providers between 25% and 100%. There is limited research on the appropriate screening interval, and most screening tools do not assess the duration or periodicity of food insecurity and therefore cannot assess whether it is temporary.

### Role of attachment style in the association between childhood adversities and non-suicidal self-injury among young adults: a multigroup structural equation study [^25882f2d]. General Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Insecure attachment is often the result of a harsh upbringing or ACEs, and it can be associated with hyper- or hypoactivation of emotional systems, with emotional dysregulation and/or dissociation, which may lead to dysfunctional coping strategies for emotional distress, including NSSI. However, attachment style (AS) can also be conceptualised as a protective/aggravating factor in response to trauma (for an extensive review, see Marshall and Frazier). Indeed, if, on the one hand, traumatic experiences can interfere with the consolidation of a secure attachment, on the other hand, AS represents an important resilience factor when facing stressful or traumatic experiences. These two perspectives are reflected by models in which AS is a mediator or moderator of trauma on a plethora of outcomes. Indeed, different ASs correspond to significant differences in emotional responses to stress, coping strategies and internal working models. Because of this, AS can shape (ie, moderate) traumatic reactions by selecting different sets of mediators, that is, qualitatively different psychological pathways.

Insecure attachment has been suggested to be a risk factor for developing dissociative symptoms since the individual can use dissociation as a strategy to cope with anxiety and stress associated with insecure relationships. In addition, an insecure attachment may be associated with childhood trauma, such as abuse or neglect, which in turn can increase the risk of developing dissociative symptoms.

Indeed, recent evidence suggests that insecure attachment may moderate the association between traumatic experiences and subsequent dissociation and/or PTSD symptoms. Several studies confirm, in different samples, that the risk of developing PTSD is increased in subjects with insecure attachment. For example, in female subjects, dismissing AS moderates the link between victimisation and PTSD. In another study, attachment anxiety and dependency were found to moderate the relation between intimate partner violence and PTSD symptoms. Sexually abused children with insecure attachment endorse more stress-related symptoms compared with children securely attached to their parents. Among disadvantaged groups, attachment avoidance and anxiety moderate the association between childhood trauma and PTSD.

Insecure ASs are also related to cPTSD. Individuals with insecure ASs can have difficulty forming secure and trusting relationships, making it more difficult for them to cope with traumatic events and leading to a higher risk of developing cPTSD. In addition, individuals who have experienced childhood abuse or neglect, which can lead to insecure attachment, may be at a higher risk of developing cPTSD later in life.

### Exploration of the influence of insecure attachment and parental maltreatment on the incidence and course of adult clinical depression [^e6a3f436]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Both childhood maltreatment and insecure attachment are known to be associated with depression in adulthood. The extent insecure attachment increases the risk of adult clinical depression over that of parental maltreatment among women in the general population is explored, using those at high risk because of their selection for parental maltreatment together with an unselected sample.

Methods

Semi-structured interviews and investigator-based measures are employed.

Results

Insecure attachment is highly associated with parental maltreatment with both contributing to the risk of depression, with attachment making a substantial independent contribution. Risk of depression did not vary by type of insecure attachment, but the core pathways of the dismissive and enmeshed involved the whole life course in terms of greater experience of a mother's physical abuse and their own anger as an adult, with both related to adult depression being more often provoked by a severely threatening event involving humiliation rather than loss. By contrast, depression of the insecure fearful and withdrawn was more closely associated with both current low self-esteem and an inadequately supportive core relationship. In terms of depression taking a chronic course, insecure attachment was again a key risk factor, but with this now closely linked with the early experience of a chaotic life style but with this involving only a modest number of women.

Conclusions

Both insecure attachment and parental maltreatment contribute to an increased risk of depression with complex effects involving types of insecure attachment.

### Disorder-specific attachment characteristics and experiences of childhood abuse and neglect in adolescents with anorexia nervosa and a major depressive episode [^572b464c]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

3.3 Attachment‐related defences and unresolved themes among the different groups

Significant differences were found on all three defences between the clinical and the control groups. The adolescent control group more often remained organized when confronted with stressful attachment situations by demonstrating significantly more markers of deactivation (M = 4.08, SD = 1.80) than the group of patients with AN (M = 3.43, SD = 1.60) and the group of patients with an MDE (M = 3.17, SD = 1.60), F (2, 117) = 3.37, p = 0.038, ηp² = 0.054, d = 0.48, and more cognitive disconnection (M = 6.30, SD = 1.78) than the two clinical groups (group of patients with AN, M = 5.70, SD = 1.42; group of patients with an MDE, M = 5.50, SD = 1.48), F (2, 117) = 5.19, p = 0.007, ηp² = 0.082, d = 0.60). Yet interestingly, the amount of segregated systems did not reach statistical significance between the control (M = 8.62, SD = 5.73) and the clinical groups in general (group of patients with AN, M = 8.73, SD = 6.29; group of patients with MDE, M = 6.80, SD = 5.05), F (2, 117) = 1.20, p = 0.306, ηp² = 0.020, d = 0.29, suggesting that attachment‐related threats can be found in the narratives of patients and controls to the same extent. Therefore, we needed to delve into the unresolved category in more detail to extend our understanding of disorder‐specific nuances related to attachment trauma. Compared with the control group who rather managed to deal with attachment‐related distress, we found that the segregated systems were more often associated to attachment dysregulation in the clinical group, F (2, 117) = 9.27, p = 0.000, ηp² = 0.137, d = 0.80.

### Attachment mediates the link between childhood maltreatment and loneliness in persistent depressive disorder [^7be24132]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A central concept of attachment theory is that early experiences with close attachment figures shape the way we interact with and relate to other social partners throughout life. As such, early experiences of childhood maltreatment (CM) have been suggested as a key precursor of adult insecure attachment representations. As CM has been linked to feelings of loneliness in adulthood, this study examines whether insecure attachment could explain the relationship between CM and loneliness. Also, the moderating role of a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is investigated, a disorder characterized by high levels of CM and loneliness.

Method

60 patients with PDD (DSM-5) and 60 gender- and age-matched non-clinical control participants (NC) completed self-report questionnaires measuring attachment, loneliness, and CM. Mediation analyses (PDD as a moderator) were performed.

Results

PDD patients reported higher levels of CM, attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, and loneliness than NC. CM was positively associated with loneliness in both groups. Mediation analyses demonstrated that the relationship between CM and loneliness was mediated by avoidant, but not anxious attachment, regardless of a diagnosis of PDD.

Limitations

Caution when interpreting these results is crucial as the study lacked a clinical control group, relied on self-report measures, and the cross-sectional design limits the ability to draw causal inferences.

Conclusions

All constructs studied were present to a greater degree in PDD. Above, findings provide initial evidence that avoidant attachment may explain the relationship between CM and loneliness. Potentially, adult avoidant attachment may lead to and maintain feelings of loneliness, regardless of PDD.

### Dr. diamond replies [^267cf0db]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

The Letter to the Editor by Verhees et al. raises interesting questions about how to potentiate the mechanism of change in attachment-focused therapies. 1 The basic assumption of attachment theory is that that children who grow up with insensitive or inconsistent parenting or trauma internalize a view of the world as unsafe and view themselves as unworthy of love and protection. These early relational experiences lay down the foundation of one's view of oneself and expectation of others. This schema, combined with temperament and biology, inform and influence future relationships and experiences. But for Bowlby, because the internal working model is shaped by relational experience, it is continually open for revision if the environment were to change. 2 As psychotherapists, we aim to facilitate that revision.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder [^9dcfbe64]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology of reactive attachment disorder (RAD) — Few data exist about prevalence. In a published community study of 350 Romanian preschool children recruited from pediatric waiting rooms, no cases of RAD were found. In institutional settings, the rate of the emotionally withdrawn/inhibited type in 54-month-old children was only 4.1%, yet as many as 40% of currently institutionalized young children show significant signs of RAD. Beyond these extreme populations, RAD appears to be exceedingly rare; given that RAD reliably improves when children are removed from institutional care, eliminating institutional rearing should be a priority (or improving care in contexts where they cannot be eliminated). Given that the DSM-5 criteria require a history of severely "insufficient care", the diagnosis should be questioned in any case in which a history of social neglect cannot be documented.

### Contextual determinants of psychopathology. the singularity of attachment as a predictor of mental dysfunction [^0129dd70]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

The general aim of this research is to evaluate the singular weight of attachment relationships in psychopathology, to determine the point to which these relationships cannot be subsumed by other variables that are famously related to attachment, such as experience of stressful life events, social support, and coping styles. 172 people treated in mental health centers provided data related to these four aspects and about manifestations of psychopathology. Multiple linear regression analyses determined that 51% of the variance in the level of symptomatology is explained with six variables: two related to adult attachment (fear of rejection and abandonment in romantic relationships, and the degree of similarity to the fearful prototype), one related to social support (family appreciation), one to life events (overall perceived stress), and two to coping style (cognitive restructuring and social withdrawal). Fear of rejection was the variable accounting for the most variance. The findings suggest that adult attachment is a non-redundant individual factor associated with manifestations of psychological dysfunction and highlight the desirability of taking attachment history into account in clinical practice.

### Longitudinal and concurrent relationships between caregiver-child behaviours in the vaccination context and preschool attachment [^72599feb]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This article consists of 2 separate studies in which the overarching aim was to examine the relationships between caregiver-child behaviours in the vaccination context (infant and preschool) and preschool attachment outcomes. It provides for the first time an examination of acute pain behaviours during early childhood and how it relates to a critical aspect of child development (ie, attachment status) at the end of early childhood. Study 1 examined the longitudinal relationships between caregiver-infant behaviours during infants' first routine vaccination (2 months) and preschool attachment (n = 84). Study 2 examined the concurrent relationships between caregiver-preschooler behaviours during the last routine vaccination of preschool (4–5 years) and preschool attachment (n = 117). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used. Although there were several nonsignificant findings, the results revealed that higher caregiver sensitivity and higher proximal soothing 1 minute before the needle during infants' 2-month vaccinations predicted higher levels of preschooler avoidance and lower levels of preschooler ambivalence, respectively. In addition, higher infant pain-related distress at 2 minutes after the needle was related to higher preschooler security and lower preschooler disorganization and controlling-punitive attachments. In terms of concurrent relationships, only caregiver sensitivity was significantly related to preschool attachment outcomes. Specifically, higher caregiver sensitivity at preschoolers' 4- to 5-year vaccinations was related to higher preschooler attachment security. The study findings provide evidence that child-caregiver behavioural patterns during the infant and preschool routine vaccination relate to preschoolers' patterns of attachment. Moreover, it underscores the potential importance of health professionals teaching and supporting attuned caregiving to the child in pain.

### Disorder-specific attachment characteristics and experiences of childhood abuse and neglect in adolescents with anorexia nervosa and a major depressive episode [^cdcf77ed]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

To date, hardly any research paid attention to possible mechanisms relating experiences of child abuse and neglect to AN and depression (Tasca et al. 2013). In this respect, the quality of an attachment relationship to a primary caregiver might play a key role in this association as it affects the way individuals deal with the exposure to childhood trauma (Solomon & George, 2011). A secure quality of attachment usually leads to greater resilience and helps adolescents when confronted with traumatic experiences. On the contrary, an insecure or even an unresolved attachment quality might lead to feelings of helplessness and being caught in these experiences as attachment figures do not help to restore safety or integration of these experiences (Laible, 2007). Therefore, an insecure or unresolved attachment status in adolescents might provide a fertile ground for the development of psychopathology in response to experiences of neglect and abuse in early childhood.

1.2 Attachment characteristics

In the field of AN, numerous studies focusing on attachment issues and family dynamics in ED have been published in the last decades (Gander, Sevecke, & Buchheim, 2015). Among them are some reviews summarizing research findings primarily in adults (O'Shaughnessy & Dallos, 2009; Tasca & Balfour, 2014; Tasca, Ritchie, & Balfour, 2011; Zachrisson & Skårderud, 2010) and also in adolescents (Gander et al. 2015). The majority of studies regarding adolescents are using self‐report measures that assess a person's conscious appraisals of behaviours and feelings in attachment relationships. In sum, these studies found that insecure attachment styles are overrepresented in adolescent girls with AN. Furthermore, they suggest that symptom severity and a worse treatment outcome are significantly associated with an anxious attachment style in adolescent and young adult patients with AN that is characterized by a high sensitivity to relationship loss and rejection, a lot of anger and preoccupation in attachment relationships, and a hyper‐activation of their attachment behaviour (De Paoli, Fuller‐Tyszkiewicz, & Krug, 2017; O'Shaughnessy & Dallos, 2009).
