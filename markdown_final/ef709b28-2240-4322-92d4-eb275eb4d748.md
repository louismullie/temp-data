## Question

If hemoglobin is 10, ferritin is 10 transferrin saturation is 10 what is the diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing iron deficiency anemia from hemoglobin 10 g/dL, ferritin 10 ng/mL, and transferrin saturation 10%. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the hemoglobin meets accepted anemia thresholds. Then, I should verify whether ferritin and transferrin saturation align with iron deficiency. Next, I will integrate the pattern to confirm iron deficiency anemia and consider confounders like inflammation. After that, I should outline the immediate next steps in evaluation and management. Finally, I will double-check guideline nuances and summarize the diagnosis with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the presence of anemia. In adults, anemia is generally defined as hemoglobin less than 13.0 g/dL in men and less than 12.0 g/dL in nonpregnant women, so a hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL is unequivocally anemic across sexes, which establishes the "anemia" component of iron deficiency anemia [^111whJmb] [^1121jFZx].

> Wait, let me verify the iron deficiency markers. Ferritin is the most specific single test for iron stores; a ferritin less than 45 ng/mL in a patient with anemia strongly supports iron deficiency, and a ferritin of 10 ng/mL is far below that threshold, indicating depleted or absent iron stores with high specificity and sensitivity in this context [^116PBzzy] [^116wrM29]. I should also confirm that transferrin saturation supports the diagnosis; a transferrin saturation less than 20% is characteristic of iron deficiency, and a value of 10% is markedly low, reinforcing impaired iron supply for erythropoiesis [^1121jFZx] [^1171wSFX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for confounders. Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and can be elevated with inflammation, potentially masking iron deficiency, but in this case ferritin is very low, which makes a false-normal ferritin unlikely and strengthens the diagnosis of absolute iron deficiency rather than anemia of chronic disease, where ferritin is often normal or high despite low iron availability [^1121jFZx] [^116PBzzy]. I should confirm that the concordant low TSAT further supports absolute iron deficiency rather than a mixed picture, and here both ferritin and TSAT are low, which is classic for absolute iron deficiency anemia [^1121jFZx].

> Let me consider the integrated pattern. The triad of anemia, very low ferritin, and low transferrin saturation is pathognomonic for absolute iron deficiency anemia, and the magnitude of ferritin at 10 ng/mL is so low that it essentially excludes anemia of chronic disease as the sole etiology, which typically shows ferritin greater than 100 ng/mL with low TSAT in inflammatory states [^1121jFZx] [^1162718v]. I should double-check that guidelines endorse using ferritin thresholds around 45 ng/mL in anemia to optimize sensitivity while maintaining specificity, and yes, the AGA recommends a ferritin cutoff of 45 ng/mL in patients with anemia for this reason [^116PBzzy] [^116wrM29].

> Next, I should review immediate next steps. I need to ensure we identify the source of iron loss; in adults, gastrointestinal blood loss is the most common cause, so bidirectional endoscopy with upper and lower GI evaluation is indicated, particularly in men and postmenopausal women, and should be prioritized based on age, sex, and symptoms [^111wbP4h] [^115WmkBo]. But wait, what if the patient is a premenopausal woman with heavy menstrual bleeding? In that subgroup, a therapeutic trial of iron may be reasonable initially, but persistent or recurrent anemia still warrants GI evaluation to exclude occult pathology, so I should tailor urgency to context while not delaying necessary investigations [^115WmkBo].

> I will now examine management principles. I need to ensure iron repletion and confirm the diagnosis with response; oral iron is first-line for most patients, with a typical expectation of a hemoglobin rise of about 1 g/dL within 2 to 4 weeks if iron deficiency is the cause, and failure to respond should prompt reassessment for ongoing blood loss, malabsorption, or alternate diagnoses [^114J4SK1] [^115LH3LE]. Hold on, I should verify when IV iron is preferred; IV iron is indicated for intolerance to oral iron, malabsorption, ongoing blood loss exceeding absorptive capacity, or when rapid repletion is needed, and it is often favored in inflammatory bowel disease or perioperative settings where oral iron is less effective or too slow [^113vJuQi] [^113e6AoE].

> Let me reconsider guideline nuances to avoid overstatement. Some sources still cite older ferritin cutoffs like 15–30 ng/mL, but contemporary high-quality guidance favors 45 ng/mL in patients with anemia to improve sensitivity, and the provided ferritin of 10 ng/mL exceeds even the most conservative thresholds, so the diagnosis remains secure across frameworks [^116PBzzy] [^116wrM29]. I should confirm that the low TSAT adds independent weight; yes, TSAT less than 20% is a core diagnostic feature of iron deficiency and, when combined with very low ferritin, virtually confirms absolute iron deficiency anemia in this scenario [^1121jFZx] [^1171wSFX].

> Final diagnosis: Absolute iron deficiency anemia, confirmed by hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL indicating anemia, ferritin 10 ng/mL indicating absent iron stores, and transferrin saturation 10% indicating impaired iron delivery, with the concordant pattern excluding anemia of chronic disease as the sole etiology and mandating evaluation for occult blood loss and iron repletion [^111whJmb] [^116PBzzy] [^1121jFZx].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **iron deficiency anemia** [^115LH3LE], given hemoglobin 10 g/dL, ferritin 10 ng/mL, and transferrin saturation 10% [^1121jFZx]. This pattern reflects depleted iron stores and reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis [^1121jFZx]. The next step is to **identify the cause of iron loss**, with gastrointestinal bleeding as the most common source in adults [^111wbP4h]; bidirectional endoscopy is recommended [^115WmkBo]. Begin **oral iron therapy** and monitor for a hemoglobin rise of ≥ 1 g/dL in 4 weeks; if there is no response, evaluate for malabsorption, ongoing blood loss, or alternate diagnoses [^113e6AoE].

## Interpretation of laboratory values

| **Laboratory parameter** | **Patient value** | **Reference range** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hemoglobin (Hb) | 10 g/dL | 12.0–16.0 g/dL (women); 13.0–17.0 g/dL (men) | Anemia |
| Ferritin | 10 ng/mL | 15–150 ng/mL (women); 30–300 ng/mL (men) | Iron deficiency |
| Transferrin saturation (TS) | 10% | 20–50% | Iron deficiency |

- **Hemoglobin**: 10 g/dL is below the normal range, indicating anemia [^111whJmb].
- **Ferritin**: 10 ng/mL is low, indicating depleted iron stores [^116PBzzy].
- **Transferrin saturation**: 10% is low, indicating reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis [^1121jFZx].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for microcytic anemia with low ferritin and low transferrin saturation includes:

- **Iron deficiency anemia (IDA)**: Most common cause of microcytic anemia [^notfound].
- **Anemia of chronic disease (ACD)**: Typically normal or elevated ferritin with low transferrin saturation [^1162718v].
- **Thalassemia trait**: Normal ferritin, low MCV, normal or high RBC count [^notfound].
- **Lead poisoning**: Basophilic stippling, history of exposure [^notfound].
- **Sideroblastic anemia**: Ringed sideroblasts on marrow, elevated ferritin [^notfound].

Given the low ferritin and low transferrin saturation, **IDA is the most likely diagnosis** [^116PBzzy].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Confirm iron deficiency anemia

Confirm iron deficiency anemia with **repeat CBC** to confirm anemia and assess MCV/MCH, and obtain iron studies (serum iron, TIBC, transferrin saturation, ferritin) [^1171wSFX]. Consider soluble transferrin receptor or reticulocyte hemoglobin content if inflammation is suspected [^116DvtSE].

---

### Identify the underlying cause

- **Gastrointestinal evaluation**: Bidirectional endoscopy (EGD and colonoscopy) is recommended in adults with IDA to identify sources of bleeding (e.g. ulcers, polyps, malignancy) [^115WmkBo] [^115bHVQo].
- **Non-gastrointestinal causes**: Consider menstrual blood loss, dietary insufficiency, malabsorption (e.g. celiac disease) [^115WmkBo], or chronic blood loss [^111wbP4h].

---

## Management

### Iron supplementation

- **Oral iron**: First-line therapy; ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day [^112oTzg6].
- **Intravenous iron**: Consider if oral iron is not tolerated, malabsorption, or severe anemia [^113e6AoE].
- **Monitor response**: Expect hemoglobin rise ≥ 1 g/dL in 4 weeks; if no response, reassess for ongoing blood loss or malabsorption [^1156qyBS].

---

### Address underlying cause

Treat identified sources of bleeding or malabsorption, and manage chronic conditions contributing to anemia [^115LH3LE].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent with appropriate treatment**; iron repletion and correction of the underlying cause typically normalize hemoglobin and improve quality of life [^115LH3LE].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **iron deficiency anemia**, given hemoglobin 10 g/dL, ferritin 10 ng/mL, and transferrin saturation 10% [^116PBzzy]. The next step is to **identify the cause of iron loss**, with gastrointestinal bleeding as the most common source in adults; bidirectional endoscopy is recommended [^112knLuE]. Begin oral iron therapy and monitor for a hemoglobin rise of ≥ 1 g/dL in 4 weeks; if there is no response, evaluate for malabsorption, ongoing blood loss, or alternate diagnoses [^113e6AoE].

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116PBzzy]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval, 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Should serum transferrin saturation Be included as a therapeutic target in addition to serum ferritin in treating HFE-hemochromatosis? [^113Gvcb6]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In HFE-hemochromatosis, transferrin saturation (TSAT) indirectly reflects plasma non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which drives iron overload and tissue damage. TSAT above ~75% suggests harmful NTBI levels. Despite its clinical relevance, NTBI remains understudied due to the limitations of current assays. High TSAT levels persist during maintenance therapy, yet some guidelines omit TSAT monitoring, though it correlates with symptoms like fatigue and joint pain. Monitoring TSAT may improve outcomes. Randomized trials comparing ferritin-only versus ferritin-plus-TSAT-guided treatment are needed. Consideration should be given to approaches that minimize plasma NTBI in managing and monitoring patients with hemochromatosis. Until reliable NTBI testing has been established, TSAT should be included in the management of HFE-hemochromatosis.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Assessing iron status: beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116DvtSE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and because the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin > 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation < 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common. This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

Interpretation of Laboratory Studies

To assess PCPs' choices for additional laboratory tests to be performed for evaluation of IDA, respondents were presented with a hypothetical scenario of a 65-year-old man reporting generalized fatigue who had a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0) and mean corpuscular volume of 72.3 fL (to convert to μm 3, divide by 1.0). Measurement of ferritin level, the most specific marker of iron deficiency, was the most common laboratory test recommended by respondents (302 of 325 [92.9%]), followed by total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation (278 of 325 [85.5%]).

To assess PCPs' interpretation of iron laboratory studies, respondents were presented with a series of laboratory values and asked to determine whether the anemia resulted from iron deficiency or an alternate cause. For scenarios in which ferritin level and transferrin saturation were concordantly low or normal, respondents correctly identified the cause with more than 93% accuracy: 321 of 325 respondents (98.8%) correctly attributed anemia to iron deficiency in the presence of a low transferrin saturation (6%) and a low ferritin level (11 ng/mL), and 303 of 325 (93.2%) correctly attributed anemia to an alternate cause in the presence of a normal transferrin saturation (30%) and a normal ferritin level (150 ng/mL) (Figure 2). However, in scenarios of discordant ferritin and transferrin saturation values, diagnostic accuracy decreased. For example, in a scenario with a normal transferrin saturation (25%) but low ferritin level (6 ng/mL), 44 of 325 respondents (13.5%) misidentified the cause as something other than iron deficiency even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a ferritin level less than 15 ng/mL is 51.9. In a scenario with a low transferrin saturation (2%) but borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL), 86 of 325 respondents (26.5%) did not consider IDA as the cause even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a transferrin saturation less than 5% is 10.5. In that scenario, 239 of 325 respondents (73.5%) correctly identified the scenario as IDA. There were no statistically significant differences in correct interpretation of these scenarios by academic affiliation status, gender, stage in clinical practice, or practice of ordering ferritin level measurement for anemia evaluation.

### Screening primary care patients for hereditary hemochromatosis with transferrin saturation and serum ferritin level: systematic review for the American College of Physicians [^117BGjYx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Therapeutic phlebotomy for hereditary hemochromatosis is relatively safe and presumably efficacious when offered before cirrhosis develops, so screening primary care patients is of substantial interest.

Purpose

To conduct a systematic review of the evidence on 1) the prevalence of the disease in primary care, 2) the risk for morbid or fatal complications for untreated patients, 3) the diagnostic usefulness of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin level in identifying early disease, 4) the efficacy of early treatment, and 5) whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search from 1966 through April 2004, complemented by reference review of identified original studies and review articles published in English.

Study Selection

PubMed Clinical Queries filters search of prognosis, diagnosis, etiology, or treatment were used depending on the question. Two authors reviewed all titles and abstracts.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently reviewed extracted data.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis was 1 in 169 patients to 1 in 556 patients (n = 3 studies). Uncontrolled, prospective studies of genetic homozygous patients did not consistently identify a link to overt hereditary hemochromatosis. A serum ferritin level less than 1000 microg/L was predictive of absence of cirrhosis. Six studies demonstrated reduced survival in patients with cirrhosis. Diagnostic studies varied with respect to case definition. No blinded, independent comparisons of screening tests with the gold standard (biopsy or results of quantitative phlebotomy) or randomized, controlled trials of phlebotomy were identified. Cost-effectiveness analysis was limited by lack of prospective data on the natural history of the disease.

Limitations

Varied case definition and lack of prospective cohort studies or randomized trials.

Conclusions

The available evidence does not demonstrate that benefits outweigh the risks and costs of screening for hemochromatosis.

Key Points

Question

How is the choice of guideline-recommended cutoffs for ferritin associated with the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses in primary care?

Findings

In this cohort study of 255 351 adult primary care patients, ferritin cutoffs of 15, 30, and 45 ng/mL were associated with incidences of iron deficiency diagnoses of 10.9, 29.9, and 48.3 cases per 1000 patient-years, respectively.

Meaning

The results of this study provide useful components for the evaluation of ferritin testing in high-resource primary care settings and call for harmonization of guidelines for iron deficiency.

### Reticulocyte hemoglobin content: a new frontier in iron deficiency diagnostics for major surgical patients [^117LrehM]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the population and the leading cause of anemia with a prevalence of 23 to 33%. In clinical setting, preoperative anemia is associated with an increased risk for perioperative complications and mortality. Triphaus et al. showed that every second major surgical patients with a hemoglobin (Hb) level below 10 g/dl had ID. Both oral and intravenous administration of iron are effective and low-cost measures to treat anemia. However, it is important to recognize that treatment requires time to show its full effect. Oral iron typically takes three to six months, while intravenous iron can take at least seven days to improve iron levels and erythrpoiesis. Therefore, early detection of ID is crucial to ensure timely and effective management.

The diagnosis of ID is challenging. The cutoff values and measurements to diagnose ID have been rigorously debated in the last decades. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a ferritin cutoff value of < 15 μg/l in healthy individuals and < 70 µg/l in individuals with infection or inflammation for the diagnosis of ID. In the patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure, ferritin values of up to 300 ng/ml and transferrin saturation below 20% are also considered indicative for ID. However, ferritin is an acute phase protein and often elevated if inflammation is present. Therefore, Muñoz and colleagues recommend a simultaneous measurement of ferritin, transferrin saturation and C-reactive protein (CRP) in surgical patients.

The detrimental impact of preoperative anemia has been consistently demonstrated. However, implementing a comprehensive anemia management strategy within clinical routines is complex. The limited time available between preoperative assessment and surgery necessitates a straightforward screening and treatment process to ensure accurate diagnosis and management of ID. Diagnostic accuracy is often challenged by factors such as inflammation or chronic disease, which can obscure true ID. Additionally, the lack of standardized protocols can lead to variability in how ID is screened and managed across different clinical settings. Since performing laboratory analysis for ID is costly, a pre-selection of potentially iron-deficient patients would be beneficial. Resource constraints in some healthcare environments further complicate access to full diagnostic panels, and integrating new diagnostic processes into established clinical workflows can be difficult. Furthermore, patient-specific factors, including comorbidities and nutritional status, add another layer of complexity to the diagnosis and management of ID.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency across indications: a systematic review [^116qgPPz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency (ID) vary widely across indications.

Objective

We reviewed all available guidelines on the management of ID worldwide.

Design

A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE and in main professional association websites, limited to documents published between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2014.

Results

Of 127 guidelines identified, 29 were selected, involving 29 professional associations and issued from the United States (n = 8), Europe (n = 6), Britain (n = 4), Canada (n = 3), international organizations (n = 2), France (n = 2), Poland (n = 1), Australia (n = 1), Mexico (n = 1), and Japan (n = 1). A total of 22 and 27 guidelines provided recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of ID, respectively. To define ID, all guidelines recommended a concentration for serum ferritin. One-half of them (10 of 22) proposed transferrin saturation (TSAT) as an alternative or complementary diagnostic test. To treat ID, most of the guidelines (18 of 27) recommended preferentially the oral route if possible, particularly in children and in women in the pre- or postpregnancy period. Iron supplementation should be administered intravenously according to 13 of 27 guidelines, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 7) and chemotherapy-induced anemia (n = 5). Treatment targets for ID included an increase in hemoglobin concentrations to 10–12 g/dL or normalization (n = 8) and serum ferritin > 100 μg/L (n = 7) or 200 μg/L (n = 4). For the latter, in some situations, such as CKD, ferritin concentrations should not exceed 500 μg/L (n = 5) or 800 μg/L (n = 5). Only 9 guidelines recommended TSAT as a target, proposing various thresholds ranging from 20% to 50%.

Conclusions

It appears that for the diagnosis of ID, a cutoff of 100 μg/L for serum ferritin concentration should be considered in most conditions and 20% for TSAT, except in particular situations, including young healthy women with heavy menstrual flow. New indications of intravenous iron supplementation are emerging.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^1135e9FE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this nationally representative survey study of internal medicine PCPs, we found substantial variation in the management of anemia. Specifically, we found self-reported evidence of both overuse of screening CBCs (76.9% of respondents) and underuse of bidirectional endoscopy in patients with IDA. Certain knowledge gaps also existed in the interpretation of discordant laboratory test results, which may contribute to diagnostic errors. Specifically, 26.5% of respondents misdiagnosed a scenario of IDA as anemia with an alternate cause despite a low transferrin saturation (2%) and a borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL). Several subtle but important nuances in interpretation of these studies may contribute to errors, including the high specificity of a low ferritin level (98% specific for iron deficiency with a ferritin level ≤ 12 ng/mL), the potential for the ferritin level to be normal or elevated in inflammatory states when a patient is iron deficient, and the importance of measuring serum iron level in a fasting state to avoid potential confounders of dietary or supplemental iron. Given the relatively high baseline prevalence of anemia of 5.6% in the US, incorrect interpretation of these laboratory results may lead to a substantial number of missed or delayed diagnoses of IDA and, by extension, potential delays in diagnosis of GI tract malignant neoplasm.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^116kXCsb]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. Whilst low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can be due to multiple different aetiologies, including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. The investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis is not dealt with however and is the subject of a separate guideline.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relationship to other clinical parameters including the patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine, and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^1171wSFX]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus Statements: Diagnosis

All patients with anemia should be evaluated for the cause of anemia — wherever possible, early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful.
It is important to identify iron deficiency, including in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease).
Patients with IDA should be evaluated for the cause of the iron deficiency, whereas patients with anemia and normal iron studies should be evaluated for coexisting causes of anemia (ie, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, and nutrition deficiency).
Evaluation for iron deficiency should include iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin); if available, reticulocyte Hb content and/or serum hepcidin should be considered in inflammatory states.
The most important criteria for defining absolute iron deficiency were ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%; ferritin < 100 ng/mL may define iron deficiency in inflammatory states. If available, either a reticulocyte Hb < 29 pg or a serum hepcidin level < 20 µg/L also suggest the presence of iron deficiency in inflammatory states.

Supporting Evidence: Diagnosis

In a study of 3342 patients undergoing major elective surgery, the overall prevalence of anemia was 36%. Of the patients with anemia, 62% had absolute iron deficiency and another 5% had low iron stores. Therefore, all patients with anemia should be screened for iron deficiency. In some circumstances (eg, planned surgery associated with large blood loss), it may also be appropriate to evaluate nonanemic surgical patients for iron deficiency. Patients with anemia who are not iron deficient should be evaluated for other causes of anemia (eg, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, nutritional deficiencies). Determination of whether anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (in patients with reticulocyte production index < 2) may help identify likely causes. Wherever possible, evaluations should be performed early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful. In patients undergoing urgent/emergency procedures, blood samples for evaluation and classification of anemia should be drawn preoperatively, with the aim of testing promptly (preoperatively if possible).

Results

The study cohort consisted of 255 351 patients (median [IQR] age, 52 [36–66] years; 52.1% female and 47.9% male). Figure 1 summarizes the cohort selection process, and Table 1 summarizes the patient characteristics. The cohort patients were seen by 262 general practitioners with a median (IQR) age of 48 (40–57) years and a median (IQR) workload of 139 (86–230) consultations per working week in 80 practices. During the study period, 72 817 patients (28.5%) received ferritin testing. Of the first ferritin tests during the study period, 7036 (9.7%) were accompanied by iron studies, most commonly serum iron in 6095 (8.4%), transferrin in 5820 (8.0%), and transferrin saturation in 3856 (5.3%). Accompanying hemoglobin and CRP tests were present in 52 499 (72.1%) and 36 136 (49.6%) cases, respectively.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^1121jFZx]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Assessment and diagnosis

The WHO defines anaemia as blood Hb level below 130 g/L in men and 120 g/L in women. In isolated iron deficiency, serum ferritin (the storage molecule for iron) should be less than 30 ug/L. However, ferritin is an acute phase protein and can be increased in the presence of inflammation. Thus, if there is evidence of concomitant inflammation, such as elevated C reactive protein, ferritin less than 100 ug/L is indicative of IDA. Transferrin, the iron transporter, is generally elevated; however, it is a negative acute phase protein and, therefore, can be normal or reduced in chronic inflammatory states. Serum iron and transferrin saturations (TSAT) will be reduced with TSAT less than 20% required for the diagnosis of IDA. See table 1 for the breakdown of diagnostic criteria for IDA. It is crucial to note that iron deficiency should not be excluded in the presence of a normal Hb as a significant amount of iron must be lost before the Hb levels begin to decline. Thus, a low mean corpuscular Hb with a normal Hb or an increase in red cell distribution width signifies mild iron deficiency without anaemia.

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency anaemia

Management

Patients with IDA should be treated with the aim of replenishing iron stores and returning the Hb to a normal level. This has been shown to improve QoL, morbidity, prognosis in chronic disease and outcomes in pregnancy. Iron replenishment can occur via three routes: oral iron, parenteral oral and transfusion of packed red cells. Each route has its benefits and limitations, which will be discussed below in greater detail.

We also assessed requests for additional iron studies accompanying ferritin testing (within ± 1 week), considering iron studies often mentioned in international and local clinical guidelines for iron deficiency,: serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, and soluble transferrin receptor. To further examine concomitant testing, we considered all patients of the study cohort who received ferritin testing during the study period and considered the presence of hemoglobin and CRP accompanying the first ferritin test recorded during the study period as 2 distinct binary outcomes. We fitted mixed-effects logistic regression models using the R package lme4to assess the associations of each outcome with the same determinants and random effects as for ferritin. Associations are expressed as adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with corresponding 95% CIs.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111iUVEE]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — initial diagnostic markers and transferrin saturation (TS) thresholds are outlined: the initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin, and a recent study using fasting samples showed no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes; accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values, and using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, requiring further evaluation.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1149wkcb]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions

3. We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

4. We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

5. We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia

The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines in the UK for suspected lower GI cancer suggest that IDA with an Hb concentration < 110 g/L in men or < 100 g/L in non-menstruating women warrants fast-track referral. These cut-off values will however miss some cases of colorectal cancer, especially in men. It is therefore advised that investigation should be considered at any level of anaemia in the presence of iron deficiency, though the case is stronger in those with more severe degrees of anaemia, as they are more likely to have serious underlying GI pathology.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^116gS2jE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — when to initiate treatment is outlined for HFE genotypes: Treatment should be initiated in C282Y homozygotes with elevated serum ferritin (SF), defined as > 300 ng/mL in men and > 200 ng/mL in women, along with a transferrin saturation (TS) of ≥ 45%. Homozygous patients with a SF within normal limits at diagnosis are unlikely to develop clinically relevant iron overload later in life and therefore can be monitored with serial assessment of liver aminotransferase and SF levels. Although patients with a SF of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis are unlikely to have end-organ damage, we still suggest treatment because between 13% and 35% of men and between 16% and 22% of women will progress to a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL if left untreated. For compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D) the risk of developing clinically relevant iron overload is low; a liver biopsy can be considered to rule out secondary liver disorders or to evaluate NAFLD and cirrhosis, particularly among individuals with a SF above 1,000 ng/mL, and for compound heterozygotes or H63D homozygotes with evidence of elevated hepatic iron concentration (HIC) on biopsy, iron removal can be considered.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^1171Fhyx]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study of more than 255 000 patients, we investigated the determinants and variation of ferritin testing and the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses in Swiss primary care. We observed a substantial association of the choice of ferritin cutoff with the rates of iron deficiency diagnoses, especially nonanemic iron deficiency. In addition, we found a substantial degree of variation in ferritin testing along with interesting associations, such as higher testing rates in postmenopausal women compared with men of the same age and higher testing rates by female and younger general practitioners. We also found gaps in the quality of ferritin testing in terms of a large proportion ordered without accompanying hemoglobin and CRP measurements.

Our most compelling finding regarding the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses was its strong dependence on the choice of the ferritin cutoff, especially for nonanemic iron deficiency. The use of ferritin cutoffs as treatment thresholds has been widely debated, and a recent Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to recommend any specific cutoff in a healthy, asymptomatic population. Even within Switzerland, there are conflicting recommendations. A guideline from a prominent Swiss primary care network emphasizes that iron replacement is not warranted at ferritin concentrations above 15 ng/mL, whereas a local expert panel has recommended diagnosing iron deficiency at ferritin concentrations below 30 ng/mL. Our results show that these controversies affect the management of a considerable number of patients.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Best but not perfect: indirect measure of low iron stores [^115WFgXM]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Although making the correct diagnosis of iron deficiency is critical for patient care, the use of indirect markers obtained through routine phlebotomy presents a challenge. Low serum iron, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and MCV are characteristic of iron deficiency but can also result from inflammation. In addition, hemoglobin and MCV may be low due to genetic causes and, in the case of hemoglobin, to diurnal variation rather than iron deficiency. Transferrin concentrations tend to increase with iron deficiency and decrease with inflammation, whereas transferrin receptor levels rise with both iron deficiency and inflammation. Serum ferritin is an attractive marker because a very low level (< 10 μg/L) is diagnostic of iron deficiency as documented by absent stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate. However, serum ferritin can be normal or even elevated when iron deficiency is documented by absent bone marrow stainable iron. A recent Cochrane review of 512 adults presenting for medical care at various institutions found that a serum ferritin < 30 μg/L had 98% specificity and 79% sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency as documented by absent bone marrow iron.

Lahtiharju et al make a remarkable contribution by evaluating the relationship of indirect measures of iron status to bone marrow iron stain in 6610 patients and providing evidence that ferritin is the most reliable single biomarker for predicting reduced iron stores. This finding is consistent with studies dated decades ago that established ferritin as a key standalone indicator of iron status. This study also underscores the limitations of ferritin, particularly its low sensitivity. Using a ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L, the specificity rates were impressively high at 97% for females and 99% for males, but the sensitivity rates were only 54% and 35%, respectively. This indicates that while a ferritin of 30 μg/L or lower is highly specific for low or absent bone marrow iron, it is not sensitive enough to detect all cases of low iron stores, especially in patients with comorbid conditions that can increase ferritin levels. It is important to recognize that in this study, there were females with serum ferritin > 1750 μg/L and males with serum ferritin > 4967 μg/L who had low or absent bone marrow iron stores.

Most anemias are correctable within 2 to 4 weeks, and anemia management programs decrease the rate of transfusions, complications, and mortality.

Diagnostics

The following parameters were considered necessary for an adequate diagnosis of anemia and iron metabolism: hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), percent hypochromic red cells (%HRC), reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr), serum ferritin (SF), transferrin (TF), transferrin saturation (TSAT), and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR). In addition, folic acid and B12 should be determined if needed.

The following definitions were used:
Iron deficiency (ID): TSAT < 20% or SF < 100 ng/mL
Absolute ID (AID): SF < 100 ng/mL
Functional ID (FID): TSAT < 20%, SF ≥ 100 ng/mL
No ID: TSAT ≥ 20%; SF ≥ 100 ng/mL
Signs of anemic hypoxia: tachycardia, hypotension, ECG ischemia, lactic acidosis
Risk factors: coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular insufficiency

Treatment

Guideline-compliant anemia management was defined by the following criteria:
Restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion policy: Hb ≥ 10 g/dL: no RBC transfusion indicated Hb ≥ 8– < 10 g/dL: RBC transfusion indicated only if there is evidence of anemic hypoxia Hb ≥ 7– < 8 g/dL: RBC transfusion indicated: Yes: in the presence of signs of anemic hypoxia Yes: in the presence of other risk factors/insufficient compensation No: no risk factors and adequate compensation Hb < 7 g/dL: RBC transfusion indicated
Iron replacement and ESAs in patients receiving chemotherapy:

- Oral iron replacement is not recommended and should only be considered in patients with ferritin < 30 ng/mL, non-inflammatory disease (C-reactive protein (CRP) < 5 mg/L) and only in patients in complete remission.
- Intravenous (IV) iron replacement in case of ID. - Absolute ID: IV iron and ESA if Hb remains < 10 g/dL during follow-up. - Functional ID: IV iron and ESA.
- No existing ID.
- ESA and IV iron if ID during follow-up
Iron replacement in patients not receiving chemotherapy:

- Oral iron replacement is not recommended and should only be considered in patients with ferritin < 30 ng/mL, non-inflammatory conditions (CRP < 5 mg/L) and only in patients in complete remission.
- IV iron replacement in case of ID.
- Absolute or functional ID: IV iron. ESAs are only recommended in patients receiving chemotherapy. Appropriate substitution in case of proven vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency.

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^115PFf6Y]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, the serum ferritin is the most able to discriminate iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories will lead to underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women will have no marrow iron stores, so basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest the body physiologic ferritin "cutoff" is 50ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing a readily treatable disorder.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1175qH98]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE) — Screening should be considered in all patients with abnormal AST/ALT levels and include an iron panel to determine transferrin saturation and serum ferritin; if the transferrin saturation is 45% or higher, or the serum ferritin is elevated, consideration should be given for HFE gene mutation analysis. Because ferritin is an acute phase reactant, an elevated ferritin in acute hepatitis likely does not indicate iron overload. The presence of a homozygous C282Y mutation confirms HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis, whereas compound C282Y/H63D heterozygotes rarely manifest chronic liver disease from iron overload. In patients with homozygous C282Y or compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D mutations who have elevated AST/ALT levels or ferritin > 1,000 μg/l, or in non-HFE hemochromatosis, liver biopsy should be considered to stage liver fibrosis and quantify hepatic iron overload to guide therapy.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the world's most common disorder and one of the top five causes of years lived with disability. Whereas low serum ferritin is diagnostic of ID, ferritin-an acute phase reactant-may be elevated in inflammatory states and the first trimester of pregnancy even if ID exists. Consequently, in early pregnancy or chronic inflammation, percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) measurement is the best indicator of iron status. Unfortunately, current guidelines do not recommend routine screening for ID in either pregnant or nonpregnant women in the absence of anemia. This circumstance should be urgently reviewed based on available data. While oral formulations have long been the standard for iron replacement therapy and are widely available and inexpensive, oral iron is frequently associated with adverse gastrointestinal effects for the majority-a major reason for poor adherence, inadequate repletion, and persisting ID symptoms and sequellae. Although safe intravenous iron administration was introduced in the mid-1950s, formulations with cores binding the elemental iron more tightly became available in the 2000s, allowing complete and safe replacement, even in a single setting. Prospectively acquired neonatology evidence reports oral iron's failure to reach the developing fetus when the mother is iron deficient. Consequently, while oral iron remains frontline in the first trimester because of insufficient safety data for intravenous iron, the author recommends that the intravenous route should be the gold standard for second-trimester ID when hemoglobin concentrations are less than 10.5g/dL and for all iron-deficient women in their third trimester.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^115LH3LE]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia — notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.

### High transferrin saturation predicts inferior clinical outcomes in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes [^115zAN36]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal disorders of ineffective erythropoiesis leading to peripheral blood cytopenias and an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion remains a cornerstone of supportive care. RBC transfusion dependence is an independent prognostic factor associated with inferior overall survival (OS) in MDS, and higher transfusion dose density (TDD) is associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS). However, the relative contributions of underlying disease biology versus transfusion-driven iron toxicity are areas of active investigation. Compared to patients with transfusion-dependent (TD) hemoglobinopathies, MDS patients have shorter life expectancies and thus may be less likely to manifest organ damage from iron overload (IO). Rather, it has been hypothesized that IO may lead to oxidative stresswhich further impairs hematopoiesis, accelerates mutagenesis and results in progressive marrow failure leading to disease progression and death.

Serum ferritin level above 1,000 µg/L is associated with increased mortality in MDS. However, underlying inflammation confounds interpretation of ferritin, rendering it an imperfect metric of true IO. Elevated levels of oxidatively damaging non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) and labile plasma iron (LPI) correlate with transferrin saturation (TSAT) > 70% and > 80% respectively, but NTBI and LPI assays are not readily available and lack international standardization. The trajectory of TSAT in MDS patients, and its association with clinical outcomes has not been defined.

Using the Canadian MDS registry, we aimed to describe trends in TSAT, and to determine if elevated TSAT correlates with ferritin level, and/or predicts for clinical outcomes in MDS.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^114G1cVV]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

### Iron deficiency anemia: diagnosis and management [^116BQgD7]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

Hereditary hemochromatosis phlebotomy regimen — initial depletion and maintenance guidance are as follows: One phlebotomy (removal of 500 mL blood) is performed "weekly or biweekly", and each unit removed contains "approximately 200–250 mg iron". Monitoring includes checking serum ferritin "after every 10–12 phlebotomies (approximately 3 months)" early in treatment, with excess iron mobilization indicated when ferritin "drops to between 50 and 100 μg/L". As the "target range of 50–100 μg/L" is approached, testing may be increased; frequent phlebotomy is stopped when ferritin "reaches 50–100 μg/L", and then continued to keep ferritin "between 50 and 100 μg/L". Safety measures include allowing hematocrit/hemoglobin to fall by "no more than 20% of prior level". Treatment burden can be substantial in heavily iron-loaded patients — those with total body iron stores " > 30 g" may require "up to 2–3 years" of therapy — and maintenance needs vary, with some patients requiring phlebotomy "monthly", while others may need "only 1–2 units of blood removed per year".

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^114FbWUC]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, we show in the largest data set to date that ferritin is the best predictor for bone marrow iron stores in a real-life patient population. We studied the most common laboratory variables used for detecting IDA, that is, ferritin, TSAT, sTfR, transferrin, hemoglobin, and MCV, and compared those with bone marrow iron staining in > 6600 patients with hematologic disorders. In ROC analysis, ferritin had the highest AUC in all patient groups, which is congruent with previous studies. Previously, lower cutoffs of 12 to 15 μg/L have been used, but in patients with anemia, the 30 μg/L cutoff has been shown to have higher sensitivity but retain excellent specificity for iron deficiency. Our study has similar excellent specificities with the ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L as previous studies, but the sensitivities in our study were significantly lower. A possible reason for this difference is that hematologic cancers and myeloproliferative disorders and their treatments can affect the diagnostic performance of ferritin. Nevertheless, we show that, even in this patient population, commonly used decision-making thresholds for ferritin in diagnosing iron deficiency are specific. Thus, a low ferritin predicts reliably reduced iron stores, regardless of the patient's diagnoses and older age. However, the clinician cannot rule out iron deficiency with reasonable certainty if ferritin levels are normal.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^114P2My1]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in diabetes mellitus — laboratory assessment and mineral-bone management are specified as follows: persons with CKD in DM should undergo annual or more frequent assessment of electrolytes, blood counts, and calcium, phosphorus, 25(OH) vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurements to assess mineral metabolism. For those with serum bicarbonate level < 22 mEq/L, the addition of oral sodium bicarbonate is recommended to correct the serum bicarbonate level. Anemia, defined as hemoglobin < 13 g/dL in men and < 12 g/dL in women, should be further investigated with iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin, vitamin B12, and folate levels, and deficiencies should be replaced with a transferrin saturation target of ≥ 30% achieved. AACE recommends adequate calcium intake and achievement of 25(OH) vitamin D levels of > 30 ng/dL; supplementing vitamin D2 or D3 may reduce PTH in persons with CKD and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and active vitamin D preparations are usually necessary to keep the PTH level from increasing as eGFR declines. Hyperphosphatemia should be corrected into the normal range with dietary modification and use of phosphate binders.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^111wSktU]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is considered to be present if ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%. It has been considered uncommon in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease), but this may be attributable to difficulties using the usual iron parameters in this setting. Because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant in inflammatory states, ferritin levels are often elevated independent of iron status therefore a higher cutoff (< 100 µg/L) is needed to define IDA in these settings. Also in inflammatory states, serum iron and total iron-binding capacity are generally low, limiting the utility of TSAT for diagnosing IDA. This may be explained by the potential for inflammation to dysregulate iron homeostasis. The key regulator of iron homeostasis is hepcidin, a peptide that is produced primarily by hepatocytes. Increased hepcidin levels decrease iron absorption from the gut and iron release from macrophages and hepatocytes. In inflammatory states, hepcidin levels generally increase as a response to inflammatory cytokines and the net effect is decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis. Patients with inflammatory disorders and iron deficiency exhibit lower levels of hepcidin than those with "pure" anemia of inflammation and, consequently, hepcidin levels can help distinguish between IDA and other anemias where there is no iron deficiency. The serum hepcidin level may be more reliable than ferritin or TSAT for identifying iron deficiency. For example, in patients discharged from the intensive care unit, a low hepcidin level (< 20 µg/L) identified iron deficiency in 37% of patients in contrast to 6% identified by iron tests alone.

Inflammatory bowel disease — iron deficiency anemia screening and treatment: all patients with IBD are at risk for anemia. For laboratory screening, a complete blood count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein should be used. For patients in remission or mild disease, measurements are suggested every 6–12 months, and in active disease it is suggested to repeat screening every 3 months. In the presence of iron deficiency, iron supplementation is advised; intravenous iron is considered more effective and often better tolerated than oral iron, oral iron repletion is reasonable in mild anemia or clinically inactive disease, and dosing is based on baseline hemoglobin and body weight.

### A European patient record study on diagnosis and treatment of chemotherapy-induced anaemia [^113w92fa]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients with cancer frequently experience chemotherapy-induced anaemia (CIA) and iron deficiency. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), iron supplementation and blood transfusions are available therapies. This study evaluated routine practice in CIA management.

Methods

Medical oncologists and/or haematologists from nine European countries (n = 375) were surveyed on their last five cancer patients treated for CIA (n = 1,730). Information was collected on tests performed at diagnosis of anaemia, levels of haemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT), as well as applied anaemia therapies.

Results

Diagnostic tests and therapies for CIA varied across Europe. Anaemia and iron status were mainly assessed by Hb (94%) and ferritin (48%) measurements. TSAT was only tested in 14%. At anaemia diagnosis, 74% of patients had Hb ≤ 10 g/dL, including 15% with severe anaemia (Hb < 8 g/dL). Low-iron levels (ferritin ≤ 100 ng/mL) were detected in 42% of evaluated patients. ESA was used in 63%of patients, blood transfusions in 52% and iron supplementation in 31% (74% oral, 26% intravenous iron). Only 30% of ESA-treated patients received a combination of ESA and iron supplementation. Blood transfusions formed part of a regular anaemia treatment regimen in 76% of transfused patients. Management practices were similar in 2009 and 2011.

Conclusion

Management of anaemia and iron status in patients treated for CIA varies substantially across Europe. Iron status is only assessed in half of the patients. In contrast to clinical evidence, iron treatment is under utilised and mainly based on oral iron supplementation. Implementation of guidelines needs to be increased to minimize the use of blood transfusions.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^1132DZuz]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Questionnaire Design

We developed a survey to assess current PCP practices for the testing and evaluation of IDA. Clinical vignettes provided with the survey questions were used to address 3 sequential domains to elicit physicians' clinical practices and decision-making processes: (1) the practice of obtaining a complete blood count (CBC) for asymptomatic healthy individuals (ie, screening for anemia), (2) PCP ordering and interpretation of iron laboratory studies, and (3) evaluation and management of IDA and referral for GI endoscopy (colonoscopy and/or EGD). For screening, 5 scenarios were used to understand testing practices for 5 hypothetical asymptomatic individuals presenting as new patients: a 35-year-old man, a 35-year-old woman (not pregnant), a 35-year-old pregnant woman, a 65-year-old man, and a 65-year-old woman. For interpretation of iron laboratory studies, a series of 4 combinations of ferritin level and transferrin saturation were presented: low transferrin saturation (6%) and a low ferritin level (11 ng/mL) (to convert to μg/L, multiply by 1.0), normal transferrin saturation (30%) and normal ferritin level (150 ng/mL), normal transferrin saturation (25%) and low ferritin level (6 ng/mL), and low transferrin saturation (2%) and normal to low ferritin level (40 ng/mL). Respondents selected whether the scenario represented anemia due to iron deficiency or another cause.

Four hypothetical patient scenarios were presented for evaluation of management of newly diagnosed IDA to assess use of EGD and colonoscopy: a 35-year-old man, a 35-year-old woman (not pregnant), a 65-year-old man, and a 65-year-old woman. We also developed and included 2 questions regarding general attitudes about diagnostic testing: 1 focused on watching and waiting and 1 focused on laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures. The questionnaire included a subset of questions related to knowledge and application of the 2018 American Cancer Society Colorectal Cancer Screening Guideline, and these questions were analyzed separately. The questionnaire was developed in consultation with a survey development team and iteratively modified based on feedback from 10 PCPs at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The final version of the questionnaire is available in the eAppendix in the Supplement.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^1113uNZt]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Current recommendations for treatment

The 2012 KDIGO guidelines recommend intravenous iron in adult patients with TSAT < 30% and serum ferritin < 500 mg/L if an increase in hemoglobin without starting ESA treatment is preferred or if a decrease in the current ESA dose is wanted. In patients with nondialysis dependent CKD, a 1–3 month trial of oral administration is suggested. In patients with end‐stage CKD on regular dialysis, the oral route is not recommended.

The 2013 European recommendations are similar but with a different threshold for iron supplementation, that is, TSAT < 20% and serum ferritin < 100 ng/ml (absolute ID) or — if an increase in Hb concentration without starting ESA treatment is desired — TSAT < 25% and serum ferritin < 200 ng/ml in nondialysis CKD patients and TSAT < 25% and serum ferritin < 300 ng/ml in dialysis patients. The limit of TSAT of 30% and serum ferritin of 500 ng/ml should not be exceeded in both nondialysis and dialysis CKD patients.

Knowledge gaps

ID in CKD patients is most often, if not exclusively, considered in the setting of anemia. Future studies should evaluate the efficacy of iron therapy in nondialysis CKD patients with ID but without anemia. Long‐term studies with mortality are also needed. There is a relationship between fatigue in CKD patients and the role of iron in ATP production in muscle cells. However, the impact of ID, independent of anemia, on neurological and cognitive disorders in CKD patients is also an insufficiently explored field.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^117M8gX9]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The optimal ferritin cutoffs for the diagnosis of iron deficiency, especially nonanemic iron deficiency, are controversial. Different guidelines suggest widely varying cutoffs ranging from 12 to 15 ng/mL through 25 to 30 ng/mL to 45 to 50 ng/mL in the general population (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). The choice of the ferritin cutoff may have important implications. On the one hand, choosing too low a cutoff could result in withholding therapy from patients affected by the negative health consequences of iron deficiency. On the other hand, choosing too high a cutoff could lead to overtreatment of patients who do not benefit from iron therapy, with potential harm from adverse effects (especially with oral preparations) and an unjustified waste of health care resources.

Although previous studies have estimated incidences of anemic iron deficiency in primary care, they have not evaluated the choice of different ferritin cutoffs, and the incidence of nonanemic iron deficiency has not been investigated. However, appropriate data would be essential for a comprehensive evaluation of ferritin testing in primary care. Furthermore, little is known about the factors associated with ferritin testing. Our study aims to fill these gaps by estimating how the incidence of diagnoses of nonanemic and anemic iron deficiency depends on the choice of ferritin cutoff and by examining the determinants of ferritin testing in Swiss primary care.

### Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in CKD [^114Rx8E2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) 2012 clinical practice guideline for anemia management in patients with chronic kidney disease provides the structural and evidence base for the Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on this guideline's relevancy and application to the Canadian health care system. While in general agreement, we provide commentary on 11 of the 61 KDIGO guideline statements. Specifically, we agreed that a therapeutic trial of iron is appropriate in cases in which a reduction in erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dosage or avoidance of ESA and transfusion is desired, transferrin saturations are > 30%, and ferritin concentrations are > 500 μg/L. However, we concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support an upper target or threshold for ferritin and transferrin saturation levels. We agree with the initiation of ESA treatment when hemoglobin (Hb) level is 90–100 g/L; however, we specifically state that an acceptable range for Hb level is 95–115 g/L, with a target of 100–110 g/L, and add caution to individualization above this range due to concerns regarding the safety of ESAs. We agree that ESAs should be used with considerable caution in patients with active malignancy, history of stroke, or history of malignancy, and we suggest initiating ESA therapy at Hb level of 90 g/L and to aim for a Hb level in the range of 90–105 g/L. The reader is encouraged to note the level of evidence and review the entire KDIGO anemia guideline to interpret the guideline statements and commentary appropriately.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — iron studies for diagnostic evaluation: Transferrin saturation (TS) is the preferred initial screening test, and fasting is not required to accurately determine TS. A TS of greater than 45% identifies 97.9%–100% of C282Y homozygotes, although a small proportion of patients with HH such as young individuals at an earlier stage may have TS of < 45%. Serum ferritin (SF) is an excellent predictor of advanced fibrosis; in C282Y homozygotes, a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL, in combination with elevated aminotransferase levels and/or low platelet count, predicts cirrhosis in more than 80% of patients. A normal SF, defined as less than 200 ng/mL in premenopausal women or 300 ng/mL in men and postmenopausal women, in combination with a TS of < 45%, has a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload. A unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) below 26 μmol/L has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 50% for detecting C282Y homozygosity.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia in the 21st century [^112oTzg6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the single most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide. It accounts for anemia in 5% of American women and 2% of American men. The goal of this review article is to assist practitioners in understanding the physiology of iron metabolism and to aid in accurately diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. The current first line of therapy for patients with iron deficiency anemia is oral iron supplementation. Oral supplementation is cheap, safe, and effective at correcting iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not tolerated by some patients and in a subset of patients it is insufficient. Patients in whom the gastrointestinal blood loss exceeds the intestinal ability to absorb iron (e.g. intestinal angiodysplasia) may develop iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron supplementation. This population of patients proves to be the most challenging to manage. Historically, these patients have required numerous and frequent blood transfusions and suffer end-organ damage resultant from their refractory anemia. Intravenous iron supplementation fell out of favor secondary to the presence of infrequent but serious side effects. Newer and safer intravenous iron preparations are now available and are likely currently underutilized. This article discusses the possible use of intravenous iron supplementation in the management of patients with severe iron deficiency anemia and those who have failed oral iron supplementation.

### Functional and prognostic implications of different iron deficiency definitions in heart failure: insights from HEART-FID [^115A3TZa]. JACC: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency (ID) is common in patients with heart failure (HF), but optimal use of circulating iron indices as diagnostic criteria and for defining treatment targets remain uncertain.

Objectives

This study sought how to determine how individual iron studies, and different definitions of iron deficiency, relate to functional capacity, hemoglobin levels, and outcomes in the largest study to date of iron repletion in HF.

Methods

The HEART-FID (Ferric Carboxymaltose in Heart Failure with Iron Deficiency) trial evaluated ferric carboxymaltose vs placebo in patients with HF with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40% and ID defined as ferritin < 100 ng/mL or < 300 ng/mL with transferrin saturation (Tsat) < 20%. We assessed ferritin levels and alternative definitions of ID (serum iron level < 13 μM, Tsat < 20% in isolation), and continuous measures of iron indices, in relation to functional capacity, hemoglobin levels, and prognosis by multivariable regression.

Results

By trial design, all patients with complete iron studies at baseline (N = 2,951) had ferritin levels < 100 or < 300 ng/mL with Tsat < 20%. Although 89.8% of participants had ferritin < 100 ng/mL, only 59.8% had iron < 13 μM, 40.5% had Tsat < 20%, and 31.1% had ferritin < 30 ng/mL. Tsat < 20% and iron < 13 μM were associated with lower baseline levels of hemoglobin, worse NYHA functional class, shorter 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and worse outcomes. In contrast, these measures differed minimally within ferritin strata. Tsat and iron levels remained associated with hemoglobin levels and 6MWD after multivariable adjustment and changes in Tsat and iron levels over 6 months related to changes in hemoglobin level and 6MWD.

Conclusions

Patients with HF demonstrate wide variability in fulfillment of various diagnostic criteria for ID. Despite ferritin < 100 ng/mL being the most common ID criteria met in HEART-FID, Tsat and iron and their changes over time, more than ferritin, were related to functional capacity, hemoglobin levels, and prognosis. Our results support prioritization of Tsat and iron levels in defining iron deficiency in HF (Randomized Placebo-controlled Trial of FCM as Treatment for Heart Failure With Iron Deficiency and Sub-Study [HEART-FID]; NCT03037931).

CASE DESCRIPTIONS

Existing literature predominantly addresses treatment outcomes in children with IRIDA, while adults have distinct clinical needs and presentations, as illustrated in cases from our iron expertise centre (Figure 2). These cases provide insights into the pathophysiology underlying treatment variability, highlighting the need for individualized approaches in both adults and children.

FIGURE 2
Course of haemoglobin, ferritin and TSAT levels in three female IRIDA patients. The left panels display Hb levels (with CRP for case 3); the right panels show ferritin and TSAT levels. Case 1: Hb and iron metrics over 6 years. This patient initially received IV iron therapy at irregular intervals due to being lost to follow up. At age 26 (6 years post‐diagnosis, time point t = 0), regular IV iron therapy was initiated. Over the subsequent years, she received a cumulative dose of 2500 mg of FCM via five 500 mg infusions, causing a sharp rise in ferritin (> 900 μg/L) and TSAT (up to 25%). Despite persistently high ferritin (> 700 μg/L), Hb only briefly peaked and remained within the lower normal range. Case 2: Hb and iron metrics over 4 years, including two pregnancies (shown by horizontal bars). At diagnosis (t = 0), this 32‐year‐old patient began monthly IV iron therapy. After a cumulative dose of 1700 mg FCM, the patient became pregnant (unaware at last administration). Particularly during the first pregnancy, TSAT remained stable and the Hb decrease was less pronounced than during non‐pregnancy periods. Case 3: Hb, CRP and iron metrics over 20 years. IV iron (totalling 5800 mg FS at 200 mg/dose) was administered every 2 months, maintaining ferritin > 500 μg/L for nearly a decade, with Hb within the reference range. Diagnosis of IRIDA was made at t = 5 when she was 41 years old. Ferritin and TSAT varied widely, likely due to chronic inflammation (CRP ~25 mg/L). In the final years (following t = 15), heavy menstrual bleeding led to a Hb decline, requiring additional IV iron therapy (totalling 1700 mg FCM).

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

DIAGNOSIS OF IRON DEFICIENCY

Serum ferritin is widely recognized as the most specific and cost‐effective biomarker for evaluating iron stores in the body. Establishing standardized ferritin thresholds that align with physiological norms is essential for accurately diagnosing low iron stores. However, current guidelines differ, which may lead to the potential underdiagnosis or overdiagnosis of ID.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines ferritin thresholds as < 12 μg/L for children and < 15 μg/L for women, but these values were based on expert opinion rather than physiological data, and the method used to determine cut‐offs was not detailed. A study analysing data from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) identified a serum ferritin threshold of 25 μg/L for non‐pregnant women aged 15–49 years. This threshold was derived using restricted cubic spline models that assessed the physiological relationship between serum ferritin and both haemoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations in healthy individuals. Data from 62 anaemic individuals with either bone marrow‐confirmed ID (n = 54) or a documented response to iron therapy (n = 8) showed that ferritin < 12 μg/L yielded a sensitivity of only 25% for the diagnosis of ID. In contrast, increasing the threshold to < 30 μg/L significantly improved sensitivity to 92%. The soluble transferrin receptor showed a sensitivity of 92%, outperforming ferritin at the < 12 μg/L threshold and matching the performance of ferritin at the < 30 μg/L threshold. Increasingly, experts recommend a ferritin cut‐off of 30 μg/L for healthy males and females over 15 years.,

Although ferritin is the most reliable marker of iron stores, it can be elevated during inflammation, potentially masking ID. Therefore, measuring C‐reactive protein (CRP) or α1‐acid glycoprotein alongside ferritin helps distinguish true ID from inflammation‐related conditions in relevant cases. Additionally, transferrin saturation and soluble transferrin receptor levels can provide further insights, particularly in cases where ferritin levels may be unreliable due to inflammatory conditions,(Table 1).

Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease — iron deficiency anemia (IDA) management includes trying oral iron first in children with Hb ≥ 10 g/dL and/or quiescent disease, with response to oral therapy determined by repeating Hb in 2 to 4 weeks; adequate response is an increase in Hb ≥ 1 g/dL in 2 weeks or ≥ 2 g/dL in 4 weeks, and reticulocyte response can be observed as early as 4 days with maximal response at 7 to 10 days; parenteral iron is indicated when oral iron is ineffective and/or poorly tolerated, in patients with moderate-severe anemia and/or active inflammation, and according to ECCO guidelines an IV replacement goal of achieving a ferritin level of up to 400 μg/L is more likely to prevent recurrence of anemia, while a transferrin saturation < 50% and serum ferritin of 800 μg/L should not be exceeded.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) phlebotomy regimen and monitoring — Initial treatment is typically done with weekly removal of 500 mL of blood, with larger volumes, usually 1,000 mL, if tolerated, whereas those who do not tolerate weekly phlebotomies may have smaller volumes removed or increased intervals. Hemoglobin should be checked before and during treatment to ensure it is above 11 g/dL. Serum ferritin (SF) should be checked monthly during phlebotomy until a goal SF level of 50–100 ng/mL is reached. After the SF goal is achieved, the goal of maintenance is to maintain SF levels near 50 ng/mL, and phlebotomy frequency typically is 3–4 times per year.

DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW DEFINITION OF IRON-DEFICIENT HF

Given the link between serum iron level ≤ 13 μmol/L and TSAT < 20% with bone marrow stores, it is noteworthy that both thresholds have been shown to have prognostic significance in patients with HF (ie, they each predict the occurrence of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalizations).– In contrast, patients with a serum ferritin level < 100 ng/mL but normal serum iron levels and TSAT are deemed iron deficient by the guidelines, but have a favorable prognosis, presumably because serum ferritin levels of 20 to 100 mg/L lie in the normal range for healthy, iron-replete people. Patients with high serum ferritin levels (≥ 300 μg/L) but low serum iron concentrations (≤ 13 μmol/L), low TSAT (< 20%), or anemia — features commonly seen in functional iron deficiency — are at particularly high risk of adverse HF outcomes,– but they are not considered iron deficient by the guideline definition. Higher serum ferritin levels identify patients at higher risk, because they are indicators of the coexisting inflammatory state that reflects prognostically relevant comorbidities.–

Confounding Effects of Foundational Drugs for HF

To complicate matters further, many of the foundational drugs used for the treatment of HF and a reduced ejection fraction may influence hemoglobin, while simultaneously distorting the levels of iron biomarkers that are used to identify an iron-deficiency state. In randomized controlled trials, treatment of patients with HF with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor has been accompanied by modest decreases in hemoglobin, and carvedilol (a nonselective β-blocker) is more likely to cause small decreases in hemoglobin than metoprolol tartrate (a selective β-blocker). In both instances, the effects on red blood cell counts were seen early in treatment and were sustained for the duration of therapy. These findings are likely the result of the withdrawal of a direct stimulatory effect of angiotensin II and β2 adrenergic receptors on the proliferation of erythroid precursors. The action of neurohormonal blockade to lower hemoglobin can be accompanied by direct or reactive changes in iron biomarkers; α 1 -adrenergic blockade can directly decrease hepcidin synthesis, and angiotensin receptor blockade may increase serum ferritin levels.

### Updates in the management of iron deficiency anemia… [^113e6AoE]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency results from reduced iron intake, absorption, losses or reduced mobilization of iron from bodily stores. Effects of iron deficiency anemia include reduced cognition in children and older adults, as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is generally based on deficient iron stores and anemia. A serum ferritin level of < 45 mg/dL is indicative of iron deficiency, demonstrating an 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold is recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association. In patients with an elevated serum ferritin due to inflammation, alternative markers of iron status such as transferrin saturation may be considered. In adults, evaluation of iron deficiency anemia involves noninvasive screening for celiac disease and. Helicobacter pylori infection.

The AGA guidelines additionally recommend bidirectional endoscopy in men and postmenopausal women with iron deficiency anemia. Endoscopy may also be considered in premenopausal women; however, a trial of oral iron supplementation is a reasonable initial step in these patients in the absence of concerning symptoms. A hemoglobin increase of greater than 1. 0 g/dL over 1 month is considered a successful response and supports the diagnosis. In children, mild iron deficiency anemia may be treated initially with oral iron supplementation for 1 month without additional testing. As in adults, an increase of greater than 1. 0 g/dL of hemoglobin over 1 month is considered supportive of the diagnosis. In those who do not respond to empiric treatment, further evaluation for gastrointestinal bleeding and referral to a gastroenterologist is recommended.

Intravenous iron replacement is typically recommended by the AGA updated guidelines for patients who cannot tolerate oral iron, exhibit poor absorption, or fail to demonstrate improvement with oral iron supplementation. Compared with oral iron, IV iron does not reduce mortality or the need for blood transfusions in adults with iron deficiency anemia, and it may increase the risk of infection, according to a 2022 FPIN Clinical Inquiry.

### Avoid using hemoglobin to evaluate patients for iron… [^11238wtk]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron depletion is a progressive process with anemia as the final phase. Thus, screening for iron deficiency using hemoglobin will only identify the most severe cases. Moreover, hemoglobin is not specific for iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide. Prevalence of iron deficiency in U. S. women ages 12 to 49 years rose from 11% in 2003 to 14. 8% in
2010. Pregnant women and young children are also high-risk groups and must be evaluated. Iron deficiency in U. S. toddlers, without anemia, is estimated at 6. 6% to
15. 2%. Serum ferritin is a measure of iron stores and is the most sensitive biomarker to test for early stages of iron deficiency as well as iron deficiency anemia. Sensitivity of ferritin test is 89% for diagnosis of iron depletion compared with hemoglobin, which is only 26%.

Moreover, a ferritin cut off of ≤ 30 ng/mL provides 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity for iron deficiency anemia and is the best screening test for this disorder. Evaluating patients for iron deficiency with ferritin will identify early stage iron deficiency and will potentially result in iron therapy, preventing iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia has been long associated with psychomotor and cognitive abnormalities but even iron deficiency without anemia has been related to negative neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant, and occasionally in inflammatory conditions, ferritin levels may be normal or elevated even in the presence of iron deficiency.

Additional laboratory tests accompanying clinical correlation are also helpful to determine iron deficiency.

Key Points for Practice
- In anemia, iron deficiency is best diagnosed using a ferritin threshold of less than 45 ng per mL.
- Patients with IDA should receive noninvasive testing for H. pylori and celiac disease.
- Bidirectional endoscopy is recommended in all adults with IDA. Diagnosing Iron Deficiency The AGA defines anemia as a hemoglobin level of less than 13 g per dL in men and less than 12 g per dL in patients who are not pregnant. Serum ferritin testing is commonly used to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with anemia. Based on a systematic review, the AGA recommends using a ferritin threshold value of less than 45 ng per mL for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold has 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for iron deficiency. Without anemia, the ferritin threshold for iron deficiency is uncertain.

Ferritin testing is less accurate in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, and additional tests including serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, and C-reactive protein can help diagnose iron deficiency. Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with iron deficiency caused by atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria, which reduce iron absorption. Treating H. pylori infection improves the benefit of iron supplementation in anemia. After negative bidirectional endoscopy results, the AGA suggests noninvasive testing and treatment for H. pylori in IDA by urea breath testing, although stool antigen testing and serology can also be used. Celiac disease is another common cause of iron deficiency. The AGA suggests serologic testing for celiac disease in patients with iron deficiency, especially those with a family history of the disease, a personal history of autoimmune diseases, or gastrointestinal symptoms.

Small bowel biopsy during endoscopy is recommended only if celiac serology is positive. Editor's Note: Dr. Sonoda is the resident representative for AFP. These guidelines from the AGA add specific recommendations for the workup of IDA. The recommendation to diagnose iron deficiency with a ferritin cutoff of 45 ng per mL is consistent with a previous.
