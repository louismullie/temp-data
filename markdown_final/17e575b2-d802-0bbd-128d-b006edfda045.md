## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the probability that a bug returns to its starting vertex after 10 crawls on a triangular ring, where at each vertex it moves with equal probability to one of the other two vertices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about modeling the movement as a Markov chain on a 3-vertex graph. Then, I should set up recurrence relations for the probabilities of being at each vertex after n steps. Next, I will solve those recurrences, ideally by exploiting symmetry and eigenvalues, to get a closed-form expression. Finally, I will plug in n = 10 and double-check the arithmetic to ensure the answer is correct.

> Let me first confirm the model. The triangle has vertices A, B, and C, and from any vertex the bug moves to either of the other two vertices with probability 1/2 each. This is a discrete-time Markov chain on a 3-node, undirected, regular graph, and I need the probability of returning to the starting vertex after exactly 10 steps, which is a classic random-walk return probability problem on a small graph.

> I will now examine the symmetry to simplify. Because the graph is vertex-transitive, the probability of being at the starting vertex after n steps is the same regardless of which vertex we start at, so I can label the starting vertex as A and define pₙ as the probability of being at A after n steps, with qₙ as the probability of being at either of the other two vertices. By symmetry, the probability of being at B equals the probability of being at C, so qₙ applies to both, and pₙ + 2qₙ = 1 for all n, which I should keep in mind as a consistency check.

> Next, I should derive the recurrence relations. Let me think about one-step transitions: to be at A at step n+1, the bug must have been at B or C at step n and then moved to A, each with probability 1/2, so pₙ₊₁ = (1/2)qₙ + (1/2)qₙ = qₙ. Similarly, to be at B at step n+1, the bug could have been at A and moved to B (probability 1/2), or at C and moved to B (probability 1/2), so qₙ₊₁ = (1/2)pₙ + (1/2)qₙ. Wait, let me verify that last term; if the bug was at C, moving to B is indeed 1/2, and if it was at A, moving to B is 1/2, so the expression is correct [^notfound].

> I should double-check the system. Substituting qₙ = (1 − pₙ)/2 into the first recurrence gives pₙ₊₁ = (1 − pₙ)/2, which is a simple linear recurrence I can solve directly. Alternatively, I can write the coupled system in matrix form and diagonalize, but given the small size, the substitution approach is faster and less error-prone, so I will proceed with pₙ₊₁ = (1 − pₙ)/2 and the initial condition p₀ = 1, since the bug starts at A [^notfound].

> Now I will solve the recurrence. Let me rewrite it as pₙ₊₁ = −(1/2)pₙ + 1/2. This is a first-order linear nonhomogeneous recurrence; the homogeneous part decays as (−1/2)ⁿ, and the particular solution is a constant 1/3, so the general solution is pₙ = C(−1/2)ⁿ + 1/3. Applying p₀ = 1 gives C = 2/3, so pₙ = (2/3)(−1/2)ⁿ + 1/3. I should confirm that this satisfies the recurrence and the initial condition, which it does [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the long-term behavior. As n → ∞, the (−1/2)ⁿ term vanishes and pₙ → 1/3, which matches the stationary distribution on a 3-vertex symmetric graph, where each vertex has equal long-run probability. That consistency check increases my confidence in the closed form [^notfound].

> Finally, I will compute the answer for n = 10. Plugging in n = 10, I get p₁₀ = (2/3)(−1/2)¹⁰ + 1/3 = (2/3)(1/1024) + 1/3 = 2/3072 + 1/3 = 1/1536 + 1/3 = 1/1536 + 512/1536 = 513/1536. Wait, let me simplify that fraction; both numerator and denominator are divisible by 3, so 513/1536 = 171/512. I should double-check the arithmetic: 2/3 × 1/1024 = 2/3072 = 1/1536, and 1/3 = 512/1536, so 1 + 512 = 513 over 1536, which indeed reduces to 171/512, so the probability is 171/512 [^notfound].

---

The probability that the bug returns to the starting vertex after 10 crawls is **171/512**. This is a classic random walk on a triangle, where the bug moves to either of the other two vertices with equal probability. The solution uses a recurrence relation and symmetry to find that the probability of being back at the start after n steps is ([1/3] + [2/3](−[1/2])ⁿ). For n = 10, this evaluates to 171/512 ≈ 0.334.

---

## Modeling the problem

Let the vertices be labeled A, B, and C, and let the bug start at vertex A. At each step, the bug moves to one of the other two vertices with equal probability (1/2). We want the probability that the bug is back at A after 10 steps.

---

## Recurrence relation

Let (Pₙ) be the probability that the bug is at vertex A after n steps, and (Qₙ) be the probability that the bug is at vertex B or C after n steps. By symmetry, the probability of being at B equals that at C, so (Qₙ) applies to either.

We have the following recurrence relations:

- (Pₙ₊₁ = [1/2] Qₙ) (to return to A, the bug must have been at B or C and moved to A)
- (Qₙ₊₁ = [1/2] Pₙ + [1/2] Qₙ) (to be at B or C, the bug could have been at A and moved to B or C, or been at B or C and moved to the other non-A vertex)

Also, since the bug must be somewhere, we have:

Pₙ + Qₙ = 1

---

## Solving the recurrence

Substitute (Qₙ = 1 − Pₙ) into the first recurrence:

Pₙ₊₁ = [1/2] (1 − Pₙ) = [1/2] − [1/2] Pₙ

This is a first-order linear recurrence. Its general solution is:

Pₙ = [1/3] + C(−[1/2])ⁿ

Using the initial condition (P₀ = 1) (the bug starts at A), we find (C = [2/3]), so:

Pₙ = [1/3] + [2/3](−[1/2])ⁿ

---

## Calculating the probability for 10 steps

Plug n = 10 into the formula:

P₁₀ = [1/3] + [2/3](−[1/2])¹⁰ = [1/3] + [2/3] × [1/1024] = [1/3] + [2/3072] = [1024/3072] + [2/3072] = [1026/3072] = [171/512]

---

## Final answer

The probability that the bug returns to the starting vertex after 10 crawls is **171/512**.

Introduction

Network models play a key role in representing and understanding the characteristics of complex connected systems. Networks consist of 'vertices' connected by 'edges' (also termed 'nodes' and 'links', respectively), and networks can be generated in different ways, for example, by randomly, regularly, or semi-randomly – connecting existing vertices to each other. Processes of interest can often be understood using only the connectivity information between vertices; however, additional constraints arise in spatial networks where each vertex is also embedded inside a real or abstract space. Networks can be static or dynamically develop over time, for example, by iteratively branching from an initial seed – as happens with neuronal dendrites, branched organs, or diffusion limited aggregation of particles. Movement in the context of networks is usually discussed in terms of processes occurring on the network, for example, an agent walking over a network, or information or disease spreading through a network. Despite significant work on temporal networks, surprisingly, there appears to be little systematic work on how networks themselves travel through space away from an initial location without a permanently rooted anchor point.

For each basin, we then analysed the exit dynamics in the following way. First, we created a new random walk by selecting as nodes only those within the basin, plus an additional END node. A step from from node i to node j within the basin was assigned the same probability as in the original walk. If, in the original walk, node i allowed steps outside of the basin, then we added an arc from i to END with stepping probability equal to the sum of those original outside steps. The node in the basin with highest steady-state probability (under the original walk) was designated as the START node. We then analysed paths from START to END as in all other examples.

### A multimodal sensing ring for quantification of scratch intensity [^4f5c194e]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We create a force algorithm, shown visually in Fig. 3, to estimate mean force, for each sample. Note that when no contact is sensed by the Sensel Morph, it returns NaN; our method discards these values before calculating mean force usingwhereis the force value for a single timestep from the array of all force values F s for a sample of data, and n is the number of values in the sample.

Calculating average velocity is more involved. As visualized in the velocity algorithm section of Fig. 3, the majority of scratching behavior occurs in one of two ways; either the individual maintains contact with the skin through the entire scratching motion as shown in Example 1 or they lift up their finger off of their skin in between each scratching motion as shown in Example 2. In our human studies, discussed in the Results, we had participants scratch on the Sensel Morph for z s at a time; as an example, in the first human study, we had participants scratch for z = 10 s. At a high level, velocity can be determined through the segmentation of z s of data into distinct scratching motions. These motions are characterized by the finger moving up or down along the y -axis which are identified by detecting peaks and valleys (critical points) in the y -position signal from the Sensel Morph. By calculating the change in distance and the change in time during each of these individual scratching motions, we can obtain the average velocity across each 1-s sample. This process is explained mathematically as follows.

Head lice transmission — mechanisms and relative risks emphasize that lice do not hop or jump and can only crawl, with most cases transmitted by direct contact, most commonly head-to-head contact. Indirect spread via personal items is much less likely; lice on combs are likely injured or dead and a louse is not likely to leave a healthy head unless there is a heavy infestation, with one study finding live lice on only 4% of pillowcases used by infested persons. Control activities should focus on reducing the number of lice on an individual's head and lessening head-to-head contact.

Mesh size

We defined the "mesh size" of a network of lines (branches) as the diameter of the circle that has a 50% chance of intersecting a branch. To measure the mesh size, we randomly generatedcircles with a diameter and randomly placed them within the network. If a circle overlaps with any part of the network, we consider it as a "hit", with number. The hitting probability is. By systematically calculating the hitting probability as a function of the diameter of hitting circles, we determined the mesh size, such that. For very small diameters of the hitting circle, the hitting probability is close to zero. We extensively validated our method using the regular lattices: triangular, square, and hexagonal. As expected, the measured mesh size as a function of sparsity (inverse of length density) for these regular lattices fell on a line with a slope of 2-√2 ≅ 0.59, which can be calculated from the geometry. We also measured the mesh sizes for equal-spaced horizontal lines (expected mesh/sparsity = 0.5), for exponentially-spaced horizontal lines (expected mesh/sparsity = ln2 ≅ 0.69), for Voronoi tessellations and Delaunay triangulation of random points, and minimum spanning trees (MSTs) using the Trees Toolbox, varying the balancing factors (bf) from 0 to 1. Some of these results are plotted in Fig. 3e, along with the mesh sizes of class IV dendrites and simulated dendrites using the one- and three-state models.

Front velocity and front decay length

The arbor diameter was determined by measuring the radius of gyration for each neuron along the AP and LR axes at 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h AEL. We assumed that growth started at 16 h after egg lay from a soma size of 10 µm. The expansion speed was estimated from the slope of the best-fit cubic curve to the diameter data divided by 2. To get an average front profile at 24, 48, and 96 h AEL, dendrite length densities from individual neurons were normalized to and aligned at 10% of their central plateau values. We measured the decay length by fitting an exponential curve to the average dendrite length density from the outermost edge to where the density falls to 25% of its steady state. Standard errors are obtained with bootstrapping.

### A transient contractile seam promotes epithelial sealing and sequential assembly of body segments [^9b8ca061]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Vertex model

The process of dorsal closure was simulated using a 2D vertex model. Epithelial tissues are described as a polygonal mesh, where each cell is represented as a polygon and apical cell–cell junctions as the polygon's edges and vertices (Fig. 1D). We assume that the tissues are in a quasi-equilibrium state at each time point, so we can define an energy function that, when minimized, reflects a stable tissue configuration. This equilibrium is implemented as a force balance at each vertex i, which equals a local energy minimum,

The energy function includes contributions from cell volume conservation, apical surface tension, and cell–cell junctional tension from the cells and edges adjacent to vertex i, whereandare respectively the current and preferred surface area of cell alpha adjacent to vertex i, is the length of the edge connecting vertex i and adjacent vertex j, is the cell perimeter as the sum of lengths of all edges shared by alpha andis the preferred cell perimeter. The latter is calculated in all cases as the perimeter of a circle with a surface area equal to. There is a special case in our model in which the perimeter of a semicircle of the areais used instead, which is the single cell representing the entire AS (see below).andare cell-specific parameters whereasis an edge-specific parameter.

Our vertex model implementation was adapted using Chasteand deviates from the previous instances in two aspects, namely the initial configuration of the polygonal mesh and the type of cell junction rearrangements that are allowed.

Figure 3
Discrete generative model for movement planning. This schematic illustrates the hierarchical discrete state-space generative model that sits above the continuous model shown in Fig. 1. This model generates the hidden causes (v) that are the (imaginary) attracting points and the target locations from the perspective of the continuous model, which effectively induce movement. The discrete (categorical) causes that generate these come in two forms: the alternative attracting points (red spheres) that act as equilibrium points, and which of the three possible target locations is currently specified. These causes are themselves generated by states at a higher level. At the highest level (upper left) we have a set of alternative combinations of trajectories. Each of these is defined in terms of which vertex of a triangle (i.e. target location) is at the start and end of that trajectory. There are three configurations not shown that represent a single vertex of the triangle being the start and end of a trajectory (i.e. a static 'trajectory'). In addition, the higher level includes a replica of the three possible target states (upper right). However, while these are considered static at the timescale of the lower level, the slower dynamics of the higher level allow this to change over time. The key distinction here is the absence of arrows between alternative target configurations at the first level. The C -vector represents the statistics of a prior belief that policies will lead to correct outcomes (i.e. hand and target location match). This ensures sequences of actions that lead to the realization of this goal are more plausible than those that do not. The arrows within a level indicate the allowed transitions (encoded by B) between these configurations. The arrows between levels show the generation of lower level variables by higher level variables. This rests upon generation of a discrete outcome via A (2), which is then used to generate policies [via E (1)] or initial states [via D (1)]. The role of D (2) is to provide a prior belief about the initial states at the higher level. Note that, if we were to extend this model to include further levels, this would also become an empirical prior, recapitulating the role of D (1). However, given that Level 2 is the highest level considered here, D (2) is simply a vector of prior probabilities. This says that the target states may be in any initial configuration with equal probability and that the initial state probability is equally distributed among any of the trajectories that start at the lower-right target.

### Evolutionary dynamics on graphs [^c49db24d]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Evolutionary dynamics have been traditionally studied in the context of homogeneous or spatially extended populations. Here we generalize population structure by arranging individuals on a graph. Each vertex represents an individual. The weighted edges denote reproductive rates which govern how often individuals place offspring into adjacent vertices. The homogeneous population, described by the Moran process, is the special case of a fully connected graph with evenly weighted edges. Spatial structures are described by graphs where vertices are connected with their nearest neighbours. We also explore evolution on random and scale-free networks. We determine the fixation probability of mutants, and characterize those graphs for which fixation behaviour is identical to that of a homogeneous population. Furthermore, some graphs act as suppressors and others as amplifiers of selection. It is even possible to find graphs that guarantee the fixation of any advantageous mutant. We also study frequency-dependent selection and show that the outcome of evolutionary games can depend entirely on the structure of the underlying graph. Evolutionary graph theory has many fascinating applications ranging from ecology to multi-cellular organization and economics.

Results

Model

We represent spatial structure by a weighted, connected, isothermal graphof size. The edge weight between verticesis denoted. Without loss of generality, we scale edge weights so thatfor each vertex. In this way, edge weights may be interpreted as probabilities or frequencies of interaction. Edges are undirected, meaning, and there are no self-loops:for each. Two vertices are neighbors if they are joined by an edge of positive weight; the number of neighbors of vertexis called its topological degree.

Vertices in an isothermal graph may differ widely in the distribution of edge weights among their neighbors (Fig. 1). We quantify these differences using the 'Simpson degree'(Fig. 2), defined for each vertexasIn words, if individualrandomly selects two neighbors, with probability proportional to edge weight, thenis the inverse probability that the same neighbor is selected twice. The Simpson degreequantifies the effective number of contacts of individual, accounting for the time spent with each contact, analogously to how the Simpson index of biodiversityquantifies the effective number of species in a population. If all edges from vertexhave equal weight, then the Simpson degree equals the actual number of neighbors: Otherwise, is less than, and decreases as the distribution of edge weights frombecomes more uneven.

### Climbing favours the tripod gait over alternative faster insect gaits [^ea51fc01]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Notably, these phase lags are used for open loop control of our model. By contrast, insects are thought to depend on a distributed control mechanism whereby the movements of each leg depend on their phases relative to those of other segmental legs (for example, hind leg movements take into account the current state of the middle legs). The advantage of our compressed method for encoding locomotor gaits with only five parameters is that it allows for a more rapid computational search for optimally fast gaits. Alternatively, if we had used existing neuromechanical insect models composed of many free parameters, the time for gait optimization would be have been prohibitively long, it would have been more difficult to analyse the data and it would have been more challenging to extract general principles from the results.

During climbing, in addition to frictional forces, insects rely on adhesive forcesgenerated by biomechanical specializations such as claws and pulvilli on their legs. Frictional and adhesive forces differ in that they act in different directions — tangential and normal, respectively, to the contact surface — and therefore have different effects on the legs: friction reduces slipping, while adhesive forces act against lift-off of the legs. Therefore, in addition to frictional forces, for some experiments we added a contact-dependent adhesion force to the tips of the model's legs. The detailed physics of adhesion can vary depending on whether they originate from interlocking, capillary or dry mechanisms; however, at a higher level of abstraction these all generate normal forces that prevent the foot from lifting. As different adhesion mechanisms for vertical climbing can be modelled using a common template, we did not incorporate fine-scale physical mechanisms for adhesion and substrate-release into our model.

Differences in local structures

To gain deeper insight into the local structural differences between the Bmax10, NAmax10, and Bmin10 groups, we analyzed their associated atomic ring structures. Figure 4 shows the ring structures, including the atoms with the largest Born term (Bmax), largest nonaffine displacement (NAmax), and smallest Born term (Bmin). Rings containing atoms with large Born terms and large nonaffine displacements exhibit numerous vertices and have larger sizes, corresponding to the birth–death pairs with large death radii. By contrast, those containing atoms with small Born terms tend to be composed of small triangles.

Visualization of the ring structures determined by inverse analysis.

Position of each atom is marked by a red sphere. The color of the polygons denotes the corresponding cycle.

To validate the generality of these findings, we identified ring structures in the NAmax10, Bmax10, and Bmin10 groups across 10 samples and constructed histograms of their vertex counts (Fig. 5a). The vertex count reaches 700; however, the range shown in Fig. 5 is limited to 3–200. Rings in the Bmin10 group tend to have substantially fewer vertices than those in the NAmax10 and Bmax10 groups. Similar trends persist regardless of whether we analyze the top 20 or top 50 atoms (Supplementary Fig. 4).

### Climbing favours the tripod gait over alternative faster insect gaits [^b951f66f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To escape danger or catch prey, running vertebrates rely on dynamic gaits with minimal ground contact. By contrast, most insects use a tripod gait that maintains at least three legs on the ground at any given time. One prevailing hypothesis for this difference in fast locomotor strategies is that tripod locomotion allows insects to rapidly navigate three-dimensional terrain. To test this, we computationally discovered fast locomotor gaits for a model based on Drosophila melanogaster. Indeed, the tripod gait emerges to the exclusion of many other possible gaits when optimizing fast upward climbing with leg adhesion. By contrast, novel two-legged bipod gaits are fastest on flat terrain without adhesion in the model and in a hexapod robot. Intriguingly, when adhesive leg structures in real Drosophila are covered, animals exhibit atypical bipod-like leg coordination. We propose that the requirement to climb vertical terrain may drive the prevalence of the tripod gait over faster alternative gaits with minimal ground contact.

Bed bug exposure — recommended protective measures include inspecting the premises: Look carefully for bed bugs on mattresses, box springs, bedding, and furniture, particularly built-in furniture with the bed, desk, and closets as a continuous structural unit; bed bug eggs and nymphs are very small and can be easily overlooked. Travelers who observe evidence of bed bug activity — whether it be the bugs themselves or physical signs (e.g., blood spotting on linens) — should seek alternative lodging. Practice luggage precautions: Keep suitcases off the floor at the destination, keep suitcases closed when not in use, remove clothing and needed items (e.g., toiletry bags and shaving kits) from the suitcase only as necessary, and carefully inspect all clothing and other items before returning them to the suitcase.

### Density-functional fluctuation theory of crowds [^74b408e8]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

A primary goal of collective population behavior studies is to determine the rules governing crowd distributions in order to predict future behaviors in new environments. Current top-down modeling approaches describe, instead of predict, specific emergent behaviors, whereas bottom-up approaches must postulate, instead of directly determine, rules for individual behaviors. Here, we employ classical density functional theory (DFT) to quantify, directly from observations of local crowd density, the rules that predict mass behaviors under new circumstances. To demonstrate our theory-based, data-driven approach, we use a model crowd consisting of walking fruit flies and extract two functions that separately describe spatial and social preferences. The resulting theory accurately predicts experimental fly distributions in new environments and provides quantification of the crowd "mood". Should this approach generalize beyond milling crowds, it may find powerful applications in fields ranging from spatial ecology and active matter to demography and economics.

Termite prevention for homes — according to Potter, homeowners can reduce the risk for termite attack by adhering to the following suggestions: eliminate wood contact with the ground, do not allow moisture to accumulate near the home's foundation, and reduce humidity in crawl spaces. Most building codes state that crawl space area should be vented at a rate of 1 square foot per 150 square feet of crawl space area; this rate can be reduced for crawl spaces equipped with a polyethylene or equivalent vapor barrier to one square foot per 300 to 500 square feet of crawl space area, and vent placement design includes positioning one vent within 3 feet of each building corner with a minimum of two vents per side.

Network properties

Units are numeric and dimensionless:

Network size is represented by the number of nodes (vertices) and/or number of edges (links, connections, degree).

Largest component size is the number of nodes in the largest component, calculated as the subgraph in which any two vertices are connected.

Diameter (numeric) is the largest number of vertices which must be traversed in order to travel from one vertex to another and is calculated by using a breadth-first search like method.

Assortativity coefficientr is a preference for a network's nodes to attach to others that are similar in some way, e.g. the tendency of the nodes to connect with other nodes with similar degree values. The assortativity coefficient (r) is the Pearson correlation coefficient of the degrees at either ends of an edge and lies in the range −1 ≤ r ≤ 1:where e jk is the joint probability distribution of the remaining degrees of the two vertices at either end of a randomly chosen edge, symmetric in its indices on an undirected graph e jk = e kj obeying the rules (i)and (ii)(given that p k is the probability that a randomly chosen node on the graph will have degree k and q k is the normalized distribution of the remaining degree — the number of edges leaving the node other than the one selected).is the variance (standard deviation) of the distribution q k and it is useful when comparing networks in order to normalize.

Clusters are connected components of a graph. The cluster size is the number of connected nodes in a cluster. The cluster number is the number of clusters in a graph.

Clustering coefficient/transitivity, is the the ratio of the triangles and the connected triples in an undirected graph. Let e j (j) denote the number of edges that connect the immediate neighbors of a node j and let k j denote the node degree of j, that is, its number of immediate neighbors, the clustering coefficient is. The clustering coefficient for the whole graph is the average of the local values:

Density is the ratio of the number of edges and the number of possible edges.

Centralization is the network centrality indices which characterize each vertex/edge with respect to their position within the network.

### Adaptive resetting for informed search strategies and the design of non-equilibrium steady-states [^d30abff2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A naive approach would be to simply apply a constant resetting rate within the desired shape and zero resetting rate outside (Equation (S15) in the Supplementary Information). However, using our approach to predict the resulting steady-state, we find that this naive guess leads to a very fuzzy distribution, in which the arrow is barely discernible (see Fig. 5 a). This problem cannot be solved by increasing the resetting rate. The reason is that, for every reasonably complicated NESS, there will be areas that are very hard to reach without crossing regions with a high resetting rate. In our case, the area engulfed by the arrow can only be approached from the right, which significantly lowers its occupation probability, leading to the fuzzy arrow.

Fig. 5
Non-equilibrium steady-state design.

Two-dimensional arrow-shaped non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS). a Predicted from simulations without resetting with a naive r (x, y). b Predicted from simulations without resetting with an improved r (x, y). c Obtained from brute-force simulations with the improved resetting protocol.

Previously, testing different resetting protocols, in a trial-and-error fashion, would have required running thousands of trajectories with resetting for every protocol until the desired steady-state would have been obtained. Instead, using our approach, we can design an improved adaptive resetting protocol (Equation (S16) in the Supplementary Information) that would lead to the desired shape (Fig. 5 b), using the same set of trajectories without resetting that is already available. In the improved resetting strategy, the resetting rate was increased quadratically in the distance from the center of the box, and to the right of the arrow, to prevent the accumulation of density in the box's corners and to the right of the arrow, respectively. Results from simulations with this resetting protocol are given in Fig. 5 c for comparison, showing excellent agreement with our prediction.

### The sex of organ geometry [^d515f58a]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Measurements of proximity

The proximity between meshes was measured in R v.3.6.0. All surface meshes from the organ segmentations were simplified using quadric edge collapse decimation in Meshlab (v.2020.07)to reduce the number of faces to 1%, other than the testes apical tip meshes which contained few faces so were instead reduced to 10%. Mesh vertex coordinates were then read into R and the minimal distance between each vertex on organX and all the vertices on organY was calculated using a nearest neighbour algorithm using the RANN package (v.2.6.1). For reference to the midgut loops of the gut or for plotting along gut length, the centreline coordinates were replotted as 100 equally spaced points using the nat package (v.1.8.18). The centreline is then related to the gut mesh by finding the nearest 20 vertices on the mesh for every centreline point. The minimum distance of these 20 vertices to organY is then assigned to the centreline point for averaging and for plotting. For restricting to midgut loops, the landmarks were used to cut the centreline. Code is available on GitHub through Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.10905446).

For visualization of proximities as shown in figures, the Hausdorff Distance function in Meshlab, was used which samples each vertex of meshX and finds the closest point on meshY to generate a minimal distance value between meshes for each vertex. These minimal distances were then displayed on the mesh as a heatmap in the Paraview software (v.5.10.0).

Crop duct quantifications

The directions of the crop duct leaving the proventriculus and travelling through the thorax to enter the crop were manually recorded from viewing the microCT scans from several planes in ITK-snap. Four different configurations were recorded: passing from left to right in an s-shaped pattern, passing from left to right in a straight line, staying on one side of gut and inverted passing from right to left.

Position of the crop and contact it made with the ovaries was manually scored from viewing the microCT scans in several planes in ITK-snap.

### Quantifying the unknown impact of segmentation uncertainty on image-based simulations [^256f92f6]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Image-based simulation, the use of 3D images to calculate physical quantities, relies on image segmentation for geometry creation. However, this process introduces image segmentation uncertainty because different segmentation tools (both manual and machine-learning-based) will each produce a unique and valid segmentation. First, we demonstrate that these variations propagate into the physics simulations, compromising the resulting physics quantities. Second, we propose a general framework for rapidly quantifying segmentation uncertainty. Through the creation and sampling of segmentation uncertainty probability maps, we systematically and objectively create uncertainty distributions of the physics quantities. We show that physics quantity uncertainty distributions can follow a Normal distribution, but, in more complicated physics simulations, the resulting uncertainty distribution can be surprisingly nontrivial. We establish that bounding segmentation uncertainty can fail in these nontrivial situations. While our work does not eliminate segmentation uncertainty, it improves simulation credibility by making visible the previously unrecognized segmentation uncertainty plaguing image-based simulation.

### Vertex model with internal dissipation enables sustained flows [^bfc40716]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Complex tissue flows in epithelia are driven by intra- and inter-cellular processes that generate, maintain, and coordinate mechanical forces. There has been growing evidence that cell shape anisotropy, manifested as nematic order, plays an important role in this process. Here we extend an active nematic vertex model by replacing substrate friction with internal viscous dissipation, dominant in epithelia not supported by a substrate or the extracellular matrix, which are found in many early-stage embryos. When coupled to cell shape anisotropy, the internal viscous dissipation allows for long-range velocity correlations and thus enables the spontaneous emergence of flows with a large degree of spatiotemporal organisation. We demonstrate sustained flow in epithelial sheets confined to a channel, providing a link between the cell-level vertex model of tissue dynamics and continuum active nematics, whose behaviour in a channel is theoretically understood and experimentally realisable. Our findings also show a simple mechanism that could account for collective cell migration correlated over distances large compared to the cell size, as observed during morphogenesis.

### A space-time tradeoff for implementing a function with master equation dynamics [^57fa10b0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of physical systems, including systems that implement single-valued functions like a computer's update step. However, many such functions cannot be implemented by any master equation, even approximately, which raises the question of how they can occur in the real world. Here we show how any function over some "visible" states can be implemented with master equation dynamics-if the dynamics exploits additional, "hidden" states at intermediate times. We also show that any master equation implementing a function can be decomposed into a sequence of "hidden" timesteps, demarcated by changes in what state-to-state transitions have nonzero probability. In many real-world situations there is a cost both for more hidden states and for more hidden timesteps. Accordingly, we derive a "space-time" tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number of hidden timesteps needed to implement any given function.

### Turbulent coherent structures and early life below the kolmogorov scale [^7d94e0eb]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The results of these Wright–Fisher simulations are shown in Fig. 5. We found that cooperators can do slightly better than parasites for certain values of R int and Da, indicating a positive effect from the flow. As seen in previous work, the well-mixed results are seen at much lower values of R int than those which span the system, with the results already visually indistinguishable from the well-mixed prediction for R int ≈ 0.1.

Fig. 5
Trapping and segregation by coherent structures gives cooperators a boost.

In a two-species Replicase R2, one species (the replicase) plays the role of a cooperator (at no cost, provides a catalytic benefit of size β to all non-self organisms within a radius R int), while the other species plays the role of a parasite. a Chaotic flows generate LCSs with finite lifetimes, which act as traps for particles. Here a six-vortex (teal dots) example is shown with the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) at left and trapping regions (negative FTLE) at right. b In a well-mixed population obeying a Wright–Fisher update rule on constant population size, each species would be equally likely to fix (reflected by P coop, the fixation probability of cooperators shown on the y -axis, equaling 1/2) if they began at equal fractions. To test whether flow-segregation helped replicases, we performed Wright–Fisher simulations on a population of size N = 200 at different R int and Da. Intermediate values of Da show a boost for cooperation at specific values of R int. c Returning to a birth–death process, where the population either goes extinct or grows to infinite size, we tracked the average replicase fraction of the population over 1000 simulations from t = 0 to t = 10, with roughly 50 members of each species at t = 0. We never saw either population go extinct when starting from even such a small size; rather, the population tends to sustain both parasites and replicases, with on average slightly more replicases than parasites.

### Modelling sequences and temporal networks with dynamic community structures [^145b06ca]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We presented a dynamical variation of the degree-corrected stochastic block model that can capture long pathways or large-scale structures in sequences and temporal networks. The model does not require the optimal Markov order or number of groups as inputs, but infers them from data because the underlying arbitrary-order Markov chain model is nonparametric. Its nonparametric nature also evades a priori imposed timescales. We showed that the model successfully finds meaningful large-scale temporal structures in real-world systems and that it predicts their temporal evolution. Moreover, in the Methods section we extend the model to situations where the dynamics take place in continuous time or is nonstationary. In contrast to approaches that force network-formation dynamics into discrete time windows, and require a priori knowledge about the appropriate amount of dynamical memory, our approach provides a principled and versatile alternative.

### Printing ferromagnetic domains for untethered fast-transforming soft materials [^7555a4cd]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Soft materials capable of transforming between three-dimensional (3D) shapes in response to stimuli such as light, heat, solvent, electric and magnetic fields have applications in diverse areas such as flexible electronics 1,2, soft robotics 3,4 and biomedicine 5–7. In particular, magnetic fields offer a safe and effective manipulation method for biomedical applications, which typically require remote actuation in enclosed and confined spaces 8–10. With advances in magnetic field control 11, magnetically responsive soft materials have also evolved from embedding discrete magnets 12 or incorporating magnetic particles 13 into soft compounds to generating nonuniform magnetization profiles in polymeric sheets 14,15. Here we report 3D printing of programmed ferromagnetic domains in soft materials that enable fast transformations between complex 3D shapes via magnetic actuation. Our approach is based on direct ink writing 16 of an elastomer composite containing ferromagnetic microparticles. By applying a magnetic field to the dispensing nozzle while printing 17, we reorient particles along the applied field to impart patterned magnetic polarity to printed filaments. This method allows us to program ferromagnetic domains in complex 3D-printed soft materials, enabling a set of previously inaccessible modes of transformation, such as remotely controlled auxetic behaviours of mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratios. The actuation speed and power density of our printed soft materials with programmed ferromagnetic domains are orders of magnitude greater than existing 3D-printed active materials. We further demonstrate diverse functions derived from complex shape changes, including reconfigurable soft electronics, a mechanical metamaterial that can jump and a soft robot that crawls, rolls, catches fast-moving objects and transports a pharmaceutical dose.

### No extension of quantum theory can have improved predictive power [^47a1b210]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

Given a system and a set of initial conditions, classical mechanics allows us to calculate the future evolution to arbitrary precision. Any uncertainty we might have at a given time is caused by a lack of knowledge about the configuration. In quantum theory, on the other hand, certain properties — for example, position and momentum — cannot both be known precisely. Furthermore, if a quantity without a defined value is measured, quantum theory prescribes only the probabilities with which the various outcomes occur, and is silent about the outcomes themselves.

This raises the important question of whether the outcomes could be better predicted within a theory beyond quantum mechanics. An intuitive step towards its answer is to consider appending local hidden variables to the theory. These are classical variables that allow us to determine the experimental outcomes (see later for a precise definition). Here we ask a new, more general question: is there any extension of quantum theory (not necessarily taking the form of hidden variables) that would convey any additional information about the outcomes of future measurements?

### Three simple rules to ensure reasonably credible subgroup analyses [^d7477e5f]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Table 2quantifies the positive predictive value for statistically significant subgroup findings (that is, treatment subgroup interaction effects) over a wide range of prior probabilities and number of subgroup comparisons. Although we know of no established conventions for acceptable positive predictive values, for illustrative purposes we apply a minimum threshold of an 80% positive predictive value (that is, accepting a one in five chance (20%) of a positive finding being false). As this threshold is arbitrary and should differ depending on context, our results are presented so that readers can choose whatever threshold they wish. These analyses are based on P values of 0.05. When P values for subgroups are lower than 0.05, the positive predictive values will be higher. Like all rules of thumb, these three rules are proposed as only a starting point for thinking through individual cases.

Table 2
Positive predictive values (%)* for significant subgroup findings according to prior probability and number of subgroup comparisons

*Positive predictive values = probability that all reported positives analyses are true positives for a trial reporting at least one positive subgroup effect (that is, no false positives) for a given prior probability and power in the context of conducting one, five, or 10 subgroup comparisons without adjustment for multiple comparisons, assuming α = 5% (0.05). In formal Bayesian statistical analyses, the priors and posteriors are generally presented as probability distributions, but we have represented both as fixed values for simplicity.

### Infants segment continuous events using transitional probabilities [^9029e2ae]. Child Development (2014). Low credibility.

Throughout their 1st year, infants adeptly detect statistical structure in their environment. However, little is known about whether statistical learning is a primary mechanism for event segmentation. This study directly tests whether statistical learning alone is sufficient to segment continuous events. Twenty-eight 7- to 9-month-old infants viewed a sequence of continuous actions performed by a novel agent in which there were no transitional movements that could have constrained the possible upcoming actions. At test, infants distinguished statistically intact units from less predictable ones. The ability to segment events using statistical structure may help infants discover other cues to event boundaries, such as intentions, and carve up the world of continuous motion in meaningful ways.

Results

Analytic setup

For our baseline results presented here, we run 10,000 simulations, each with a distinct NK problem space and a simple torus network of agents with no contagion effect. We group our findings into two major results. For the diversity of ability models, systemic performance improves with increased intermixing and these results are consistent for all time scales. The simulations were run so that each of the five levels of intermixing had identical starting points — for 10,000 starting points. We could thus compare how well each level of intermixing did by comparing their average NK scores across agents for each network and then comparing these average network performances across NK problem spaces.

Diversity of ability

Figure 4 a summarizes the results for the diversity of ability simulations in NK spaces. The y -axis measures the average NK score across problem spaces for each intermixing setup, which are ordered on the x -axis from minimal intermixing on the left to full intermixing on the right. In other words, each of these setups are given the exact same problem space and starting solutions. The only thing that differs among them is how the A and B agents are distributed (i.e. intermixing rate). As soon as each of the five setups reach an equilibrium state (i.e. no more new solutions are being introduced), their final scores are averaged across all of the agents in the network for each round in the simulation. (In the case of equilibrium, all agents have the same solution and, thus, scores.) These values are then averaged across all problem spaces for each intermixing setup. This is represented by the dots and the different colored plots corresponding to rates of intermixing in Fig. 4. The dots in 4 are the average scores for each network setup across 10,000 NK problem spaces. As such, we also include the standard errors from these spaces as error bars in this figure and all subsequent figures. Since Fig. 4a only shows the final average result of these simulation runs, Fig. 4b plots these average NK scores in the same way, but over time, from start to equilibrium (along with the standard errors just as in Fig. 4a).

### Probabilistic alignment of multiple networks [^39aa70ac]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The network alignment problem appears in many areas of science and involves finding the optimal mapping between nodes in two or more networks, so as to identify corresponding entities across networks. We propose a probabilistic approach to the problem of network alignment, as well as the corresponding inference algorithms. Unlike heuristic approaches, our approach is transparent in that all model assumptions are explicit; therefore, it is susceptible of being extended and fine tuned by incorporating contextual information that is relevant to a given alignment problem. Also in contrast to current approaches, our method does not yield a single alignment, but rather the whole posterior distribution over alignments. We show that using the whole posterior leads to correct matching of nodes, even in situations where the single most plausible alignment mismatches them. Our approach opens the door to a whole new family of network alignment algorithms, and to their application to problems for which existing methods are perhaps inappropriate.

### Survival probability of stochastic processes beyond persistence exponents [^12e77d9f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

For many stochastic processes, the probability [Formula: see text] of not-having reached a target in unbounded space up to time [Formula: see text] follows a slow algebraic decay at long times, [Formula: see text]. This is typically the case of symmetric compact (i.e. recurrent) random walks. While the persistence exponent [Formula: see text] has been studied at length, the prefactor [Formula: see text], which is quantitatively essential, remains poorly characterized, especially for non-Markovian processes. Here we derive explicit expressions for [Formula: see text] for a compact random walk in unbounded space by establishing an analytic relation with the mean first-passage time of the same random walk in a large confining volume. Our analytical results for [Formula: see text] are in good agreement with numerical simulations, even for strongly correlated processes such as Fractional Brownian Motion, and thus provide a refined understanding of the statistics of longest first-passage events in unbounded space.

### Multiple tipping points and optimal repairing in interacting networks [^419121d8]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Systems composed of many interacting dynamical networks-such as the human body with its biological networks or the global economic network consisting of regional clusters-often exhibit complicated collective dynamics. Three fundamental processes that are typically present are failure, damage spread and recovery. Here we develop a model for such systems and find a very rich phase diagram that becomes increasingly more complex as the number of interacting networks increases. In the simplest example of two interacting networks we find two critical points, four triple points, ten allowed transitions and two 'forbidden' transitions, as well as complex hysteresis loops. Remarkably, we find that triple points play the dominant role in constructing the optimal repairing strategy in damaged interacting systems. To test our model, we analyse an example of real interacting financial networks and find evidence of rapid dynamical transitions between well-defined states, in agreement with the predictions of our model.

### Climbing favours the tripod gait over alternative faster insect gaits [^b423aebe]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

We computed the frictional forces with the surface according to equation (2):

where the friction coefficient μ = 0.1, leg mass m = 1.42.10 −7 kg and gravitational acceleration g = 9.81 m s −2. The ODE uses a simple Coulomb friction model. Specifically, we use symmetric coulomb friction in Webots and default values for bounce and bounceVelocity. The bounce parameter defines the type of collision (1: elastic collision, < 1: inelastic collision). Our contactProperties node was set to the following — [coulombFriction = 4; bounce = 0.5; bounceVelocity = 0.01; forceDependentSlip = 0]. A friction pyramid (approximation of a friction cone) is used to determine when slipping begins. We use a friction coefficient of μ = 4. This represents an upper bound rather than the classical coulomb friction coefficient. A contact point with a ground reaction force that lies within the friction cone leads to a non-slipping contact. When the ground reaction force moves out of the friction cone, a slipping contact is established. In Webots/ODE the friction cone is approximated by a friction pyramid (that is, apex at the contact point, axis aligned with the normal force direction, base defined by two orthogonal tangential directions of ground plane). To compute the effective friction force, the ODE first assumes that the contact is frictionless and computes the resulting normal force F n. Based on this, the maximum frictional force in either of the two tangential directions is computed as. The ODE then continues to solve the system based on these limits for two cases:
Static friction: the ground reaction force lies inside the friction pyramid. Therefore, the frictional force will be computed to compensate for tangential forces.
Dynamic friction: the ground reaction force lies outside the friction pyramid. Therefore, the frictional force is computed as F t, max.

### Structure and inference in annotated networks [^8fbc66a4]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

For many networks of scientific interest we know both the connections of the network and information about the network nodes, such as the age or gender of individuals in a social network. Here we demonstrate how this 'metadata' can be used to improve our understanding of network structure. We focus in particular on the problem of community detection in networks and develop a mathematically principled approach that combines a network and its metadata to detect communities more accurately than can be done with either alone. Crucially, the method does not assume that the metadata are correlated with the communities we are trying to find. Instead, the method learns whether a correlation exists and correctly uses or ignores the metadata depending on whether they contain useful information. We demonstrate our method on synthetic networks with known structure and on real-world networks, large and small, drawn from social, biological and technological domains.

### Synchronization in collectively moving inanimate and living active matter [^df6cd519]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Whether one considers swarming insects, flocking birds, or bacterial colonies, collective motion arises from the coordination of individuals and entails the adjustment of their respective velocities. In particular, in close confinements, such as those encountered by dense cell populations during development or regeneration, collective migration can only arise coordinately. Yet, how individuals unify their velocities is often not understood. Focusing on a finite number of cells in circular confinements, we identify waves of polymerizing actin that function as a pacemaker governing the speed of individual cells. We show that the onset of collective motion coincides with the synchronization of the wave nucleation frequencies across the population. Employing a simpler and more readily accessible mechanical model system of active spheres, we identify the synchronization of the individuals' internal oscillators as one of the essential requirements to reach the corresponding collective state. The mechanical 'toy' experiment illustrates that the global synchronous state is achieved by nearest neighbor coupling. We suggest by analogy that local coupling and the synchronization of actin waves are essential for the emergent, self-organized motion of cell collectives.

### Navigating the landscape of multiplayer games [^afbe6b72]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Response graphs

The α -Rank response graphprovides the mathematical model that underpins our analysis. It constitutes an analog (yet, not equivalent) model of the invasion graphs used to describe the evolution dynamics in finite populations in the limit when mutations are rare (see, e.g. Fudenberg and Imhof, Hauert et al. Van Segbroeck et al. Vasconcelos et al.). In this small-mutation approximation, directed edges stand for the fixation probabilityof a single mutant in a monomorphic population of resident individuals (the vertices), such that all transitions are computed through a processes involving only two strategies at a time. Here, we use a similar approach. Let us consider a pure strategy profile s = (s 1, …, s K). Consider a unilateral deviation (corresponding to a mutation) of player k from playing s k ∈ S k to a new strategy σ k ∈ S k, thus resulting in a new profile σ = (σ k, s − k). The response graph associated with the game considers all such deviations, defining transition probabilities between all pairs of strategy profiles involving a unilateral deviation. Specifically, let E s, σ denote the transition probability from s to σ (where the latter involves a unilateral deviation), defined aswhere η is a normalizing factor denoting the reciprocal of the total number of unilateral deviations from a given strategy profile, i.e. Furthermore, α ≥ 0 andare parameters of the underlying evolutionary model considered and denote, respectively, to the so-called selection pressure and population size.

The field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement quantum software that could enable machine learning that is faster than that of classical computers. Recent work has produced quantum algorithms that could act as the building blocks of machine learning programs, but the hardware and software challenges are still considerable.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### Actin nano-architecture of phagocytic podosomes [^b028a06d]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Automatic identification of podosomes and phagocytosis sites

Analysis was performed in Python (v 3.7.10) using Jupyter Notebook (v 6.1.4) and the package Scipy (v 1.7.3). For a single actin channel, a uniform smoothing filter was applied based on podosome feature size (typically 0.3 µm, input by the user), and a small amount of noise (Gaussian noise with mean = 0, variance = 0.01) was added for pixel uniqueness (Fig. 3a, b, Supplementary Fig. 2a). Persistent homology was performed on these images using the Dionysus2 (v 2.0.6) Python package. A level-set filtration, is generated to describe the topological features within the smoothed images. These filtrations contain a series of simplicial complexes (vertices, edges, and triangular faces), ordered in a descending manner by their associated values (superlevel-set, Supplementary Fig. 2e). The filtrations are created so that each vertex corresponds to a pixel with a value equal to its intensity. Edges are drawn between nearest neighbor vertices (orthogonal) as well as upper-left and lower-right neighboring vertices (diagonal); triangular faces are drawn within three connecting edges (Freudenthal triangulation). Each edge or face is given a value equal to the lowest corresponding vertex (upper-star filtration). These upper-star, superlevel-set filtrations were then used to generate persistence diagrams (Fig. 3d, e, Supplementary Fig. 2d, e).

Estimation of the number of boundary points for determining T DCM

As shown in Supplementary Fig. 12a, we constructed a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) to connect all points. In graph theory, the degree of a vertex is defined as the number of edges incident to the vertex and each edge connects two vertexes. Based on this law, we can obtain:where deg(v i) represents the degree of vertex v i, V denotes the total number of vertexes, and E represents the total number of edges. In a graph, each triangle has three edges and each edge is shared by two triangles except the outermost edges. Actually, for a TIN that has a single connected component, the total number of boundary points is equal to that of the outermost edges, since all the outermost edges are connected end to end by boundary points and form a closed polygon. This law can be summarized as:where F and B refer to the total number of triangles and boundary points respectively. Meanwhile, 2D Euler's formula can be considered as follows:

By combining these formulas, we can infer the solution of B as follows:

However, the number of initial boundary points in the whole TIN is not equal to the total number of boundary points in the separated clusters. To conduct an accurate estimation, the whole TIN should be treated as multiple sub-networks (Supplementary Fig. 12b). Given C clusters, the number of boundary points in clusters can be solved as follows:where F is the total number of intra-cluster triangles in the multiple separated networks. V is known in a given dataset (i.e. n), but F and C are not. The initial F is the total number of triangles in the whole TIN, which includes the triangles connecting different clusters, i.e. cross-cluster triangles whose three vertices are not all in the same cluster (otherwise is intra-cluster triangle). Using the excessive number of triangles would make the number of boundary points B smaller than the true value. To identify the cross-cluster triangles, we set a judgment rule:where v 1, v 2, v 3 are the three vertices of a triangle, and σ (v i, v j) is an indicator function:

### Multiscale structural gradients enhance the biomechanical functionality of the spider fang [^882d4fdc]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The circular shape of the spider fang indicates that when a moment is applied at the centre of the circle, the tip of the fang is displaced in the circumferential direction, and a penetration force (tangent to the centreline) is generated at the tip. However, the biting mechanism of the spider is more complexand the fang may be displaced in non-circular trajectories. As a result, the tangent penetration force at the tip is then accompanied by two auxiliary perpendicular forces in the radial and out-of-plane directions, which result in scratching of the bitten surface. In the following, we investigate how the fang architecture affects the fang's mechanical properties with regard to these forces. To simplify, a fang-like model with r (θ) = w (θ) = a θ (θ /90)+ a 0 is considered, where a 0 represents the geometry at the tip (θ = 0) and a θ represents the steepness of the conical structure — that is, the structural gradient of the fang. Variations in the fang-like model architecture are addressed by variations in the structural gradient (a θ), with a 0 typically being small (a 0 / R ≪1).

### Node-layer duality in networked systems [^3cfaeb72]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Real-world networks typically exhibit several aspects, or layers, of interactions among their nodes. By permuting the role of the nodes and the layers, we establish a new criterion to construct the dual of a network. This approach allows to examine connectivity from either a node-centric or layer-centric viewpoint. Through rigorous analytical methods and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that nodewise and layerwise connectivity measure different but related aspects of the same system. Leveraging node-layer duality provides complementary insights, enabling a deeper comprehension of diverse networks across social science, technology and biology. Taken together, these findings reveal previously unappreciated features of complex systems and provide a fresh tool for delving into their structure and dynamics.

### Microrobot collectives with reconfigurable morphologies, behaviors, and functions [^ddbacf50]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The second demonstration of contact-free object transport is shown in Fig. 7c where the goal is to move the ball to the arena's bottom right corner. Similarly to the experiments in Fig. 6f, the collective navigates to the right side of the arena and around the bead. As opposed to the demonstration in Fig. 6f where the collective must be aligned adjacent to the bead to transport it, here the collective must encapsulate the bead so there is a significant density of micro-disks around it in all directions. After locomoting to the arena's right side at a high speed through X-chains, the collective switches to static mode so that micro-disks can evenly distribute throughout the bead's perimeter without transferring torque that might send the bead in an undesired direction. The micro-disks begin to spin clockwise to generate a flow that moves the ball towards the left. Because the arena has a center barrier with fluid all around it (rectangular loop design), the ball makes its way to the left side, downward, and then back to the right side where it finishes below its starting point. The cumulative effects of the boundary, the size of the collective, their direction of rotation, and the general arena design dictate the ball's trajectory. This experiment demonstrates the capability of our system to use external factors, like boundaries, to achieve otherwise difficult tasks. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper, the complex interplay between these different parameters offers great opportunities to develop robust, efficient, and real-time control strategies for targeted manipulation of one or multiple objects.

### Cliff or step? Posture-specific learning at the edge of a drop-off [^f7788ba8]. Child Development (2012). Low credibility.

Infants require locomotor experience to behave adaptively at a drop-off. However, different experimental paradigms (visual cliff and actual gaps and slopes) have generated conflicting findings regarding what infants learn and the specificity of their learning. An actual, adjustable drop-off apparatus was used to investigate whether learning to distinguish a step from a cliff transfers from crawling to walking. Experienced 12-month-old crawlers (n = 16) refused to crawl over risky drop-offs but novice 12-month-old walkers (n = 17) stepped repeatedly over the edge. Experienced 18-month-old walkers (n = 18) refused to walk over risky drop-offs but descended using alternative methods. These findings suggest that infants do not acquire generalized responses like fear or wariness of heights. Rather, infants learn to perceive affordances for the experienced action.
