## Question

Signs of fracture in pediatrics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the signs of pediatric fractures and how to interpret them in context, including red flags, imaging, and when to suspect abuse or bone disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical signs that raise suspicion for fracture in children. Then, I should verify which physical findings are most predictive and how age modifies pretest probability. Next, I will review imaging strategies and the role of ultrasound and MRI when radiographs are equivocal. After that, I need to check for red flags suggesting nonaccidental trauma or underlying bone fragility. Finally, I will integrate site-specific nuances and outline a practical diagnostic algorithm with safety checks and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the cardinal clinical signs that should trigger fracture evaluation in children: focal pain, swelling, ecchymosis, deformity, and functional impairment such as refusal to bear weight or use the limb, with crepitus or abnormal mobility being less common but highly specific when present. I should double-check that these remain the foundation across age groups and that neurovascular status is always assessed at the bedside because compromise changes urgency and imaging choices [^1169dSQw] [^1151zP1b].

> Wait, let me verify which signs carry the most diagnostic weight in specific anatomic regions. For suspected orbital fractures, nausea or vomiting, orbital tenderness, swelling or ecchymosis, and limitation of extraocular movement meaningfully increase the likelihood of fracture, and importantly, in the absence of orbital tenderness, swelling, or ecchymosis, operative orbital fractures are exceedingly rare, which helps calibrate imaging thresholds in the ED [^112cqNcQ]. For scaphoid injuries, volar tenderness over the scaphoid tubercle, pain with radial deviation, and pain with active wrist motion increase the odds of an occult scaphoid fracture when initial radiographs are normal, so I should not dismiss these findings even if the first films are unrevealing [^114T7VJF]. For toddler's fractures, inability to bear weight or a pronounced limp with negative initial radiographs should prompt presumptive immobilization and follow-up imaging because a substantial fraction will declare themselves on delayed films [^112RnHsN].

> Hold on, I should verify how age modifies the significance of these signs. In preverbal infants, any long-bone fracture, especially femur or humerus, and any rib fracture should heighten concern for abuse, whereas in ambulatory children, distal radius and clavicle fractures are common and often benign, though mechanism must still be scrutinized for plausibility and consistency with developmental stage [^114ENhH5] [^112a4wbB]. I need to ensure I am not overcalling abuse solely on location; while classic metaphyseal lesions, rib fractures, and femur fractures in nonambulatory infants are highly specific for abuse, any fracture pattern can occur in abuse, so I must integrate history, physical findings, and prior injury patterns rather than relying on a single sign [^114ENhH5] [^112a4wbB].

> Next, I should review imaging strategy. Radiography remains first-line for suspected extremity fractures, but I must remember pediatric pitfalls such as plastic deformation, greenstick and buckle injuries, and growth plate variants that can be subtle or misread as normal, so comparative views and careful scrutiny for cortical buckling or angulation are essential to avoid missed injuries [^113JwqWP] [^115gjtXc]. Let me consider ultrasound when radiation avoidance is desirable and soft-tissue assessment is helpful; in distal forearm fractures, ultrasound shows high sensitivity and specificity and can expedite care, and in elbow trauma, bedside ultrasound demonstrating a posterior fat pad sign or direct cortical disruption can reduce unnecessary radiography while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, though operator dependence and patient factors like obesity can limit performance [^114bqpDy] [^111ehL7m]. But wait, what if radiographs are negative and suspicion remains high; MRI can detect radiographically occult fractures and delineate physeal or soft-tissue injuries, and in suspected hip pathology with negative radiographs, MRI or CT of the pelvis and hips is appropriate to exclude occult fracture or infection, with MRI preferred to avoid radiation when feasible [^113MypKm] [^116jf14t].

> I will now examine red flags that mandate expanded evaluation beyond routine trauma care. Multiple fractures, fractures with minimal or inconsistent trauma, and fractures in nonambulatory infants should prompt a skeletal survey and consideration of bone health disorders and abuse, with repeat skeletal survey in about two weeks to reveal healing injuries and assist with dating and pattern recognition [^111LViCW] [^112CN5vX]. Let me double-check the abuse risk stratification for femur fractures; models incorporating age under 18 months, prior injury, and a suspicious history substantially increase the probability of abuse, and AAOS recommends abuse evaluation for all children under 36 months with a diaphyseal femur fracture, which aligns with best practice for early identification and safety planning [^117Ss9He] [^111yZqF2]. I should confirm that vertebral fractures, even if clinically silent, are a major sign of pediatric bone fragility and warrant spine imaging and bone health assessment, particularly in children on glucocorticoids or with chronic disease, because early detection changes management and prognosis [^113oFkqt] [^11631GYS].

> Let me think about site-specific nuances that can refine suspicion. In the ankle, the magnitude of soft-tissue swelling measured on radiographs correlates with the probability of an occult fracture, so marked swelling on an apparently negative film should lower my threshold for immobilization and follow-up imaging or alternative modalities like ultrasound or MRI when available [^111pykx4]. In the elbow, a posterior fat pad sign on radiograph or ultrasound in the setting of trauma is a reliable indirect sign of an occult supracondylar fracture and should prompt orthopedic evaluation even if the cortex appears intact, given risks of neurovascular injury and the need for close follow-up or stabilization [^114HVaKR] [^116XGcXc]. For toddler's fractures, I should not wait for radiographic confirmation if the clinical picture fits; presumptive casting with reassessment in one to two weeks is appropriate to avoid delayed diagnosis and prolonged disability [^112RnHsN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about bone disease versus abuse. I need to ensure I consider primary and secondary causes of bone fragility when fractures are recurrent, occur with low-energy trauma, or involve the spine, including osteogenesis imperfecta, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, and chronic inflammatory or endocrine conditions, and I should coordinate with pediatric endocrinology or bone specialists for targeted labs, spine imaging, and densitometry interpretation using pediatric Z-scores and fracture history rather than adult T-scores [^112wBQTT] [^113irinL] [^1173Xsuq]. I should double-check that vertebral fracture assessment by DXA is a reasonable lower-radiation alternative to spine radiographs in some settings, but expert interpretation is critical to distinguish true fractures from pediatric variants and to apply validated pediatric criteria for osteoporosis diagnosis [^1133LcuM] [^11631GYS].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic algorithm. Start with a careful history focused on mechanism plausibility, prior injuries, and medical comorbidities, then perform a targeted exam documenting deformity, swelling, ecchymosis, focal tenderness, and neurovascular status, and obtain radiographs for suspected fractures while using clinical decision rules or ultrasound selectively to reduce unnecessary imaging in low-risk presentations such as distal forearm injuries or minor elbow trauma [^111f4cpz] [^114bqpDy]. If radiographs are negative but suspicion remains high, immobilize and arrange follow-up imaging in one to two weeks, or escalate to ultrasound or MRI depending on site and concern for occult fracture, infection, or physeal injury, and if any red flags for abuse or bone disease emerge, expand the workup to include a skeletal survey, head CT when indicated, and specialist referral for bone health or child protection evaluation [^112RnHsN] [^113MypKm] [^111LViCW].

> Finally, I need to ensure my plan addresses follow-up and safety. Pediatric bone has robust remodeling potential, but growth plate injuries and certain patterns like supracondylar humerus fractures carry risks of angular deformity, neurovascular compromise, or growth disturbance, so explicit return precautions for worsening pain, swelling, numbness, pallor, or new deformity and timely orthopedic follow-up are essential parts of discharge planning and parent education [^111NacK4] [^1169dSQw]. I should confirm that families understand the possibility of initially occult fractures declaring later and the importance of adherence to immobilization and activity restrictions to prevent displacement and optimize healing trajectories unique to growing bone [^1169dSQw].

Pediatric fractures present with **pain, swelling, and functional impairment** (refusal to bear weight, limited use of limb) [^notfound] and may show visible deformity or ecchymosis [^1151zP1b]. Buckle (torus), greenstick, and growth plate (physeal) injuries are common and may be subtle on radiographs [^115gjtXc]; **MRI or ultrasound** can help when radiographs are equivocal or to assess soft tissues and growth plates [^116jf14t] [^114bqpDy]. Nonaccidental trauma should be considered with **multiple fractures**, fractures in nonambulatory infants, or inconsistent histories [^111yZqF2] [^112a4wbB]. Prompt recognition and appropriate imaging are essential to avoid missed injuries and complications [^113JwqWP].

---

## Clinical signs and symptoms

Pediatric fractures typically present with the following **clinical features**:

- **Pain**: Localized pain at the fracture site, often severe and exacerbated by movement or palpation [^1113z5Pz].

- **Swelling**: Localized swelling or edema at the fracture site, often appearing within hours of injury [^112cqNcQ].

- **Bruising (ecchymosis)**: Discoloration of the skin due to bleeding beneath the skin, commonly observed at the fracture site [^112cqNcQ].

- **Deformity**: Visible deformity or abnormal alignment of the affected limb or joint [^1113z5Pz].

- **Functional impairment**: Inability or reluctance to use the affected limb, refusal to bear weight, or limited range of motion [^112RnHsN].

- **Tenderness**: Localized tenderness upon palpation of the fracture site [^114T7VJF].

- **Crepitus**: A grating sensation or sound produced by the rubbing of fractured bone ends (less common in children due to the elasticity of pediatric bone) [^notfound].

---

## Unique fracture patterns in pediatrics

Pediatric bone has unique anatomical and biomechanical properties that result in **distinct fracture patterns**:

| **Fracture type** | **Description** | **Common locations** |
|-|-|-|
| Buckle (torus) fracture | Compression injury causing outward bulging of the cortex | Distal radius, distal tibia [^notfound] |
| Greenstick fracture | Incomplete fracture with partial cortical break and bending of the bone | Forearm, clavicle [^notfound] |
| Physeal (growth plate) fracture | Injury involving the growth plate, classified by Salter-Harris system | Distal radius, distal femur, proximal humerus [^notfound] |
| Plastic deformation | Bending of bone without overt fracture, common in pediatric bone | Forearm, clavicle [^notfound] |

---

## Radiographic findings

Radiography is the **primary imaging modality** for pediatric fractures. Key radiographic findings include:

- **Cortical disruption**: Visible break or discontinuity in the bone cortex [^notfound].

- **Angulation or displacement**: Abnormal alignment or displacement of bone fragments [^115tWHMt].

- **Periosteal reaction**: New bone formation indicating healing (typically visible after 7–10 days) [^notfound].

- **Growth plate involvement**: Widening or irregularity of the growth plate, indicating physeal injury [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of radiography

Radiography may miss certain pediatric fractures, particularly those involving the growth plate or subtle cortical injuries. In such cases, **additional imaging modalities** may be required:

- **Ultrasound**: Useful for detecting occult fractures, particularly in distal forearm and elbow injuries, and for assessing soft tissue injuries [^114bqpDy] [^111ehL7m].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Highly sensitive for detecting occult fractures, growth plate injuries, and soft tissue injuries, but limited by availability and sedation requirements [^113MypKm].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Useful for complex fractures, particularly involving the skull, face, and pelvis [^112usc6N].

---

## Clinical signs of nonaccidental trauma (child abuse)

Certain fracture patterns and clinical presentations **raise suspicion for nonaccidental trauma (child abuse)** [^114ENhH5]:

- **Multiple fractures**: Especially in different stages of healing [^notfound].

- **Rib fractures**: Particularly in infants and young children [^1127RoBo].

- **Metaphyseal fractures**: Classic metaphyseal lesions (corner fractures) [^112a4wbB].

- **Inconsistent history**: Mechanism of injury inconsistent with the child's developmental stage or physical findings [^114nugGT].

- **Delay in seeking medical care**: Unexplained delay in presentation [^114nugGT].

---

## Conclusion

Pediatric fractures present with **pain, swelling, bruising, deformity, and functional impairment** [^notfound]. Unique pediatric patterns — buckle, greenstick, and physeal injuries — require careful clinical and radiographic assessment [^115Z8S22]. Radiography is first-line, but ultrasound or MRI may be needed for occult or growth-plate injuries [^116jf14t]. Nonaccidental trauma should be considered when injuries are unexplained or inconsistent with the history [^111LViCW].

### Effectiveness of ultrasonography performed at the emergency department for pediatric elbow trauma cases [^111ehL7m]. Injury (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Two-way direct radiography is the first-choice imaging method for pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department with elbow trauma. Although, unlike radiography, ultrasonography (US) is not used routinely, studies show that US can be used in the diagnosis of fractures in pediatric patients.

Methods

In this single-center prospective observational study, patients under the age of 18 who presented to the emergency department after sustaining elbow trauma constituted the population of the study. Findings of the posterior fat pad sign using bedside US and the result obtained by seven-point assessment of the bone cortex were compared with the final diagnosis.

Results

Of the 128 patients enrolled in the study, 6 patients were excluded due to various reasons. Seventy (57.4%) patients were male, and median age was 7.7 years. On examining the final diagnosis of the patients at the emergency department, fracture diagnosis was observed in 39 patients (32%). It was determined that fracture diagnosis for 94.9% of the patients included in the study could be achieved using US (in the presence of at least the fat pad sign and/or direct findings of fracture based on the seven-point assessment).

Conclusion

US should be considered as a diagnostic tool in cases of pediatric elbow traumas owing to its high sensitivity and negative predictive value. US, which is reproducible, ionizing radiation-free, and can be performed at the bedside, can considerably reduce unnecessary radiography in low-risk patients when evaluated along with physical examination findings among patients in the pediatric age group presenting with elbow trauma. We believe that the result of our study will contribute to patient care practices.

### Unexplained fractures: child abuse or bone disease? A systematic review [^115RkdQF]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Child abuse is frequently encountered by orthopaedic surgeons, because fracture is the second most common presenting symptom. Although extensive literature has described the injury patterns in abusive versus accidental trauma, there has been a dearth of literature differentiating pediatric fractures caused by bone disease versus CAN; only one article from this decade met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The morbidity and mortality of a missed diagnosis of CAN has been well documented, although the emotional, psychologic, and financial burdens to both the family and child of false CAN accusations (in the context of underlying bone disease) can be presumed high as well. This systematic review sought to answer the following questions. First, what other conditions mimic CAN with enough regularity that they are represented in the literature to warrant a case series? Second, what types of OI are most frequently mistaken for CAN and why? Third, what specific features of underlying bone disease increase the likelihood of mistaken CAN?

The limitations of our study and the literature are not trivial. First, there is no gold standard test for diagnose CAN; it remains a synthesis of history, physical examination, and radiographic findings. In many instances, a physician's own instincts make the diagnosis. Therefore, any study of CAN is fraught with the danger of misclassification. Second, the literature directly comparing bone diseases with CAN is sparse. As such, it is difficult, if not impossible, to describe the data in quantitative terms. Third, the methodology of the papers reviewed does not provide controls for bias confounding or chance; articles were mainly descriptive in nature. As such, our study is simply an observational study of observational studies but does provide an overview of the literature available, which directly compares the two conditions. Weaknesses inherent to the member studies are not improved by aggregating them.

### Diagnosis of osteoporotic vertebral fractures in children [^1133LcuM]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Identifying vertebral fracture is central to the diagnosis of osteoporosis in children. Imaging methods used to detect and analyse vertebral fractures in clinical and/or research practice include conventional radiographs, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (vertebral fracture assessment), CT and MRI. While vertebral fracture assessment is routine in adults, identifying vertebral fracture in children is still mostly from radiographs. However, recent pediatric studies have shown that dual energy x-ray absorptiometry vertebral fracture assessment has similar sensitivity and specificity to radiographs with lower radiation dose; therefore, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry should be considered for vertebral fracture diagnosis in children, when feasible. It is likely that EOS will have an increasing role.

There is no agreed standardised method for diagnosing vertebral fracture in children and it is difficult to be certain of the validity of mild fractures.

### Radiographic timelines for pediatric healing fractures: a systematic review [^114XdtHt]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Skeletal fractures, a common injury in physically abused children, often go undetected and untreated for significant lengths of time and are sometimes incidentally discovered radiographically. Our objective was to review current literature for scientific studies of pediatric fracture healing with associated timelines. We conducted a search of Embase, EBSCOhost, MEDLINE (PubMed), and Web of Science for literature published from the earliest available up to August 2018. We evaluated the included articles for quality, with consideration for use in clinical and forensic settings. Of a total of 313 full-text articles evaluated, 10 met study inclusion criteria. The patient age range among studies was 0–17 years, with children younger than 1 year included in the majority of studies. The fracture locations included in studies were primarily fractures of the upper limb and pectoral girdle, followed by fractures of the lower limb. The radiographic features of healing varied greatly among the studies. Timelines of common fracture healing variables differed significantly among studies. Scientific, radiographic studies of pediatric fracture healing are limited. Gaps in knowledge regarding fracture healing highlight the need for future research and validation studies. Fracture healing timelines derived from existing timelines should be used with caution.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute hip pain-suspected fracture [^113MypKm]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pediatric femoral shaft fracture, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain MRI of pelvis and affected hip without IV contrast or CT of pelvis and hips without IV contrast as the next imaging study for the evaluation of acute hip pain from a fall or minor trauma with negative radiographs and suspected fracture.

### The child with multiple fractures, what next? [^113VFsF5]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Fractures are common during childhood; however, they can also be the presenting symptom of primary or secondary causes of bone fragility. The challenge is to identify those children who warrant further investigation. In children who present with multiple fractures that are not commonly associated with mild to moderate trauma or whose fracture count is greater than what is typically seen for their age, an initial evaluation, including history, physical examination, biochemistry, and spinal radiography, should be performed. In children with bone pain or evidence of more significant bone fragility, referral for specialist evaluation and consideration of pharmacologic treatment may be warranted.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaSuspected physical abuse-child [^111LViCW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The youngest children, particularly in the first year of life, are the most vulnerable to physical abuse. Skeletal survey is the universal screening examination in children 24 months of age and younger. Fractures occur in over half of abused children. Rib fractures may be the only abnormality in about 30%. A repeat limited skeletal survey after 2 weeks can detect additional fractures and can provide fracture dating information. The type and extent of additional imaging for pediatric patients being evaluated for suspected physical abuse depends on the age of the child, the presence of neurologic signs and symptoms, evidence of thoracic or abdominopelvic injuries, and social considerations. Unenhanced CT of the head is the initial study for suspected intracranial injury. Clinically occult abusive head trauma can occur, especially in young infants. Therefore, head CT should be performed in selected neurologically asymptomatic physical abuse patients. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen/pelvis is utilized for suspected intra-abdominal or pelvic injury. Particular attention should be paid to discrepancies between the patterns of injury and the reported clinical history. Making the diagnosis of child abuse also requires differentiation from anatomical and developmental variants and possible underlying metabolic and genetic conditions. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Pediatric open fractures [^115Qne6n]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Open fractures in children are rare and are typically associated with better prognoses compared with their adult equivalents. Regardless, open fractures pose a challenge because of the risk of healing complications and infection, leading to significant morbidity even in the pediatric population. Therefore, the management of pediatric open fractures requires special consideration. This article comprehensively reviews the initial evaluation, classification, treatment, outcomes, and controversies of open fractures in children.

### Diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric nasal bone fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115fgm1e]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

It is also important to emphasize that enhancing the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography can be achieved by incorporating physical signs of a nasal bone fracture. This is demonstrated in the study by Hong et al. where the absence of edema and hypoechoic hematoma is identified as distinguishing features that can differentiate an old fracture line from acute trauma.

While the current meta-analysis provided compelling findings regarding the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasound in detecting nasal bone fractures in children, certain limitations should be acknowledged. Although the reference test across all included studies was physical examination, factors such as the operator's expertise, patient age groups, types of fractures, criteria used for definition of fractures, transducer resolution, adherence to standardized imaging protocols, real-time visualization, interpretation of results during imaging, and the time elapsed from injury to imaging may influence the diagnostic validity of ultrasonography in detecting fractures. These factors serve as potential sources of heterogeneity in the study. However, the limited number of studies on this topic constrained our ability to conduct meta-regression or subgroup analysis to assess the impact of these factors on diagnostic performance. It also remains unclear whether the results of the physical examination and medical history were blinded to the sonography operator in all the studies included in our analysis. Moreover, observer bias is a limitation attributed to the superficial nature of the nasal bone. Ultrasound operators might be influenced by visible deformities when interpreting images, potentially resulting in an overestimation of ultrasound accuracy.

Conducting additional well-designed studies with larger sample sizes and rigorous methodologies is essential. These studies should include blinding sonography operators to physical examination and medical history results, while also comparing various standardized diagnostic protocols and imaging modalities. These investigations should aim to explore the potential impact of the various factors mentioned above on the diagnostic performance of ultrasound in children with nasal bone fractures.

### Frequently missed fractures in pediatric trauma: a pictorial review of plain film radiography [^113JwqWP]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Missed fractures are common in pediatric trauma patients. Pediatric bone differs from adult bone in its composition and response to injury, leading to fracture patterns that may be subtle, radiographically unfamiliar, and challenging to distinguish from normal variation. Familiarity with the unique fracture types of the pediatric skeleton and site-specific injury patterns is critical, because prompt diagnosis can significantly alter clinical management and outcome. This article examines the unique features of pediatric bone contributing to missed fractures, the incidence of missed fractures, common injury types of the pediatric skeleton, and frequently missed site-specific fracture patterns, highlighting problem-solving techniques for challenging cases.

### The emergency evaluation and management of pediatric extremity fractures [^1169dSQw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately one-third of children sustain a fracture before the age of 16 years; however, their unique anatomy and healing properties often result in a good outcome. This article focuses on the diagnosis and management of pediatric extremity injuries. The article describes the anatomic features and healing principles unique to children and discusses pediatric upper and lower extremity fractures and presents evidence-based and standard practice for their management. Finally, the article describes the conditions under which emergency physicians are likely to miss pediatric fractures by highlighting specific examples and discussing the general factors that lead to these errors.

### Treatment of pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures [^111u1MsM]. AAOS (2020). High credibility.

Treatment of pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures — this clinical practice guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies for the treatment of isolated diaphyseal femur fractures in children and aims to provide practice recommendations, highlight limitations, and suggest areas for future research. The goal is to summarize areas where there is good evidence and poor evidence in the treatment of isolated diaphyseal femur fractures in children and identify areas where evidence of any kind is lacking; AAOS staff and the physician work group predetermined specific questions, systematically reviewed the literature, and developed recommendations based on the strength or weaknesses of the results. Intended users are orthopaedic surgeons and all qualified physicians managing pediatric patients, with treatment based on informed decision making between the patient/guardian and the healthcare provider; clinician input based on medical knowledge, conservative management and surgical experience as well as skill influences identification of who will benefit from specific treatment options. The guideline is not intended for use as a benefits determination document. The patient population addressed is children who have not yet reached skeletal maturity with isolated diaphyseal femur fractures, and it is not intended for use in pediatric patients who present with additional coexisting injuries that require formal surgical intervention or other life-threatening conditions that take precedence over the treatment of the diaphyseal femur fracture.

### Toddler's fracture: presumptive diagnosis and treatment [^112RnHsN]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of a toddler's fracture is frequently difficult at the initial evaluation because of negative radiographs. We propose the presumptive diagnosis of toddler's fracture, despite negative radiographs, when the history and physical examination are consistent with the diagnosis. This retrospective study was designed to evaluate how frequently the diagnosis is correct and to determine if there were any differentiating characteristics with respect to history, gait, or physical examination. Thirty-nine children were presumptively diagnosed with toddler's fracture. A total of 16 (41%) toddler's fractures was confirmed on follow-up radiographs. Comparing the children who demonstrated a toddler's fracture with those who did not, no particular characteristic was found that could predict the outcome. To avoid delay in the treatment of toddler's fracture, we recommend a long-leg cast on those children with a history of an acute injury, inability to walk or limp, no constitutional signs, and negative radiographs.

### Femur fractures in the pediatric population: abuse or accidental trauma? [^114TqTkQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Results

A simple model using number of risk factors (age younger than 18 months, physical or radiographic evidence of prior injury, and suspicious history) predicted abuse in this age group. Odds ratios were calculated based on the logistic regression model versus a patient with no risk factors (Table 4).

The logistic regression equation was then solved for each number of risk factors to develop a prediction tool. In our population, patients with no risk factors had a 4% chance of having abuse as the etiology for their femur fracture, patients with one risk factor had a 24% chance abuse was the etiology of their femur fracture, patients with two risk factors had an 87% chance abuse was the etiology of their femur fracture, and patients with three risk factors had a 92% chance abuse was the etiology of their femur fracture (Fig. 1).

### Diagnosis of vertebral fractures in children: is a simplified algorithm-based qualitative technique reliable? [^116uURZp]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical survey

Following Phase 1, a short questionnaire (non-validated) consisting of seven items was developed to determine the perspective of paediatricians on the depth of detail required for the radiologic assessment of vertebral fractures in children and the clinical relevance of the criteria. The survey was sent by e-mail to 14 paediatricians, all members of the British Paediatric and Adolescent Bone Group, a specialist interest group (affiliated with the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health), members of which are actively involved in the clinical care of children and in research and development of new methods of investigation and treatment of children with inherited and acquired disorders of the skeleton.

### Are routine pelvic radiographs in major pediatric blunt trauma necessary? [^111Nvacq]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Screening pelvic radiographs to rule out pelvic fractures are routinely used for the initial evaluation of pediatric blunt trauma. Recently, the utility of routine pelvic radiographs in certain subsets of patients with blunt trauma has been questioned. There is a growing amount of evidence that shows the clinical exam is reliable enough to obviate the need for routine screening pelvic radiographs in children.

Objective

To identify variables that help predict the presence or absence of pelvic fractures in pediatric blunt trauma.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective study from January 2005 to January 2010 using the trauma registry at a level 1 pediatric trauma center. We analyzed all level 1 and level 2 trauma victims, evaluating history, exam and mechanism of injury for association with the presence or absence of a pelvic fracture.

Results

Of 553 level 1 and 2 trauma patients who presented during the study period, 504 were included in the study. Most of these children, 486/504 (96.4%), showed no evidence of a pelvic fracture while 18/504 (3.6%) had a pelvic fracture. No factors were found to be predictive of a pelvic fracture. However, we developed a pelvic fracture screening tool that accurately rules out the presence of a pelvic fracture P = 0.008, NPV 99, sensitivity 96, 8.98 (1.52–52.8). This screening tool combines eight high-risk clinical findings (pelvic tenderness, laceration, ecchymosis, abrasion, GCS < 14, positive urinalysis, abdominal pain/tenderness, femur fracture) and five high-risk mechanisms of injury (unrestrained motor vehicle collision [MVC], MVC with ejection, MVC rollover, auto vs. pedestrian, auto vs. bicycle).

Conclusion

Pelvic fractures in pediatric major blunt trauma can reliably be ruled out by using our pelvic trauma screening tool. Although no findings accurately identified the presence of a pelvic fracture, the screening tool accurately identified the absence of a fracture, suggesting that pelvic radiographs are not warranted in this subset of patients.

### Arcuate sign-fibular head avulsion fracture and associated injuries in the pediatric and adolescent population [^115PSg1V]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe the first "arcuate sign" case series in the pediatric population, radiologic features of the associated injuries, management, and how they compare with the adult population.

Methods

Retrospective study included patients under 18 years of age with a classic "arcuate sign" on radiographs. Data collected included patient demographics, mechanism of injury, and management. Radiographs and advanced imaging (MRI, CT) were reviewed by two musculoskeletal radiologists in a blinded fashion and findings recorded.

Results

Seven patients (4 males, 3 females) with mean age 15 years (range 14–17 years) were included in the study. All 7 injuries were related to sports, 5/7 (71%) being non-contact injuries. Five patients had MRI done-1 LCL injury, MPFL sprain, and MCL sprain were reported; 3 popliteofibular ligament and popliteus sprains were seen; and 3 bone contusions were present on imaging. None of the patients had meniscus or cruciate ligament tears. One patient had an additional fracture of the lateral tibial plateau at the ilio-tibial band attachment and an associated peroneal nerve injury. Five out of seven (71.4%) were treated non-operatively and were able to return back to activity at a mean of 7.2 weeks from injury. Two out of seven (28.6%) needed operative intervention for the fracture but not arthroscopic repair.

Conclusion

Pediatric patients with a radiographic arcuate sign tend not to have ACL, PCL, or meniscal injuries, and treatment is predominantly non-operative in contrast to literature reported in adults.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^114CzmcK]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Screening for indicators of emergency conditions — two high-quality CPGs included recommendations emphasizing screening for more serious neurological or musculoskeletal conditions that may require emergency evaluation and treatment. The use of the Glasgow Coma Scale and the Canadian computed tomography (CT) head rule may be useful to support screening of individuals for brain injury of greater severity than concussion. If patients demonstrate relatively normal mental status at least 4 hours post injury, no severe headache, no focal neurologic deficits, and no signs of skull fracture (eg, Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 13 two hours after injury, evidence of open skull fracture or sign of basal skull fracture, vomiting more than twice, and younger than 65 years of age), then concern for more severe brain injury requiring neurosurgical intervention is low. For patients aged 8 to 18 years presenting within the first 24 hours of head injury, the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) has developed a validated prediction rule to help identify children at very low risk of needing acute-care intervention, and signs that CT imaging and other acute monitoring are not likely needed include normal mental status, no loss of consciousness, no vomiting, nonsevere injury mechanism, no signs of basilar skull fracture, and no severe headache.

### The treatment of pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures [^117BHTgf]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures — outcomes considered state that the work group identified the critical outcomes for each recommendation before the literature searches and addressed a total of 60 unique outcomes; patient-oriented outcomes were included wherever possible, with surrogate/intermediate outcomes considered when patient-oriented outcomes were not available. Surrogate outcome measures are defined as laboratory measurements or other physical signs used as substitutes for clinically meaningful end points that directly measure how a patient feels, functions, or survives, and radiographic results are an example. For outcomes measured with "paper and pencil" instruments (e.g., the visual analogue scale), results using validated instruments are considered the best available evidence; if validated instruments are absent, results using non-validated instruments are considered as the best available evidence and are subject to quality parameters.

### The role of the orthopaedic surgeon in the identification and management of nonaccidental trauma [^112tb8LV]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonaccidental trauma (NAT) has short- and long-term effects on the patient. The importance of identification and management of injuries related to NAT can be vital to the disruption of patterns of abuse and can ultimately save lives. The purpose of this review is to educate the orthopaedic surgeon as the frontline provider in the treatment of these patients. Understanding the risk factors for abuse, sentinel signs on clinical examination, and questionable fracture patterns related to NAT enables providers to better identify and address children at risk of abuse or neglect. Equally as important, understanding pathologic states that can mimic NAT allows the orthopaedic surgeon the tools necessary to address all patients with multiple and/or unexplained fractures. Understanding the legal expectations and protections for practicing orthopaedic surgeons as mandated reporters and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to intervention in these settings will improve patient experiences and outcomes.

### A meta-analysis on the diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures [^114bqpDy]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis extend prior investigations to assess the diagnostic effectiveness of ultrasound in detecting distal forearm fractures in pediatric cases. This study reveals that ultrasonography exhibits a notable sensitivity and a high specificity in the detection of distal forearm fractures in pediatric patients. It proves to be highly accurate in positively identifying cases with fractures and effectively excluding those without. The pooled positive and negative LRs reported further underscore its reliability for both detection and exclusion purposes. These findings position ultrasonography as a valuable tool in clinically assessing distal forearm fractures in pediatrics, aiding healthcare practitioners in making well-informed decisions about patient care.

As an effective diagnostic tool for distal forearm fractures, ultrasonography leverages factors such as good image quality resulting from thin soft tissue and the short distance between the transducer and bone. In contrast to radiography, ultrasonography enables the assessment of soft tissues, including muscle edema, tendons, and joint functions, providing exceptional spatial resolution and multiplanar imaging capabilities. Furthermore, ultrasonography proficiently localizes soft tissue interpositions between fracture fragments. Crucially, it adeptly addresses time constraints in emergency scenarios by facilitating rapid examinations. Ultrasonography eliminates the need for transporting patients to radiology suites and bypasses the subsequent wait for radiologist readings. This expedited process makes a substantial contribution to reducing the overall patient length of stay, effectively mitigating concerns associated with prolonged emergency department wait times. The absence of ionizing radiation, coupled with the opportunity for families to view images during the initial physician visit, underscores the efficiency and patient-centric benefits of ultrasonography in diagnosing distal forearm fractures.

### Traumatic falls in the pediatric population: facial fracture patterns observed in a leading cause of childhood injury [^112KeJrb]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Falls are a leading cause of nonfatal injury in the pediatric population, resulting in numerous hospitalizations. Children may not have fully developed reflexive and balancing abilities, rendering them more susceptible to traumatic falls. Here the authors present their findings regarding patterns of facial fracture and concomitant injury seen in the pediatric population secondary to falls.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed of all facial fractures as a result of falls in the pediatric population in a level 1 trauma center in an urban environment (University Hospital in Newark, NJ). Patient demographics were collected, as well as location of fractures, concomitant injuries, and surgical management strategies.

Results

Fifty-five patients were identified as 18 years or younger and having sustained a facial fracture as the result of a fall. This cohort was compared with 418 pediatric patients with facial fractures due to nonfall etiologies. The mean age was 9.6 years (range, 0–18 years), with a male predominance of 67.3%. There were a total of 70 fractures identified on radiological imaging. The most frequently fractured bones were the orbit (n = 27), nasal bone (n = 15), and mandible (n = 11). Orbital and frontal sinus fractures each occurred more frequently due to falls compared with all other causes of injury. Patients with orbital fractures were significantly more likely to present with an additional facial fracture compared with those without (P < 0.01). The most common concomitant injuries were traumatic brain injury, skull fracture, and intracranial hemorrhage. Patients who suffered a facial fracture due to a fall were significantly more likely to sustain a concomitant skull fracture (P < 0.05) and intra-abdominal injury (P < 0.05) compared with all other etiologies. Fourteen patients required surgical intervention. One patient died.

Conclusions

Pediatric facial fractures are a unique entity. The general plasticity of the pediatric anatomy can predispose patients to significant injury without obvious external signs. A high level of clinical suspicion is required to avoid misdiagnosis and delay of treatment. The authors hope this study can address a preventable issue in child safety, educate caregivers, and provide insight towards fracture management that fosters functional and aesthetic recovery.

### Modern treatment of pathological fractures in children [^1152w1Q9]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

Pathological fractures in children occur from a variety of causes. The clinician has to develop an individual strategy that weighs up the pros and cons of treatment, considering the bone biology and the biomechanics at the fracture site. Determining the lesional pathology is paramount, whether it is in the form of a neoplastic or non-neoplastic entity, so that bone healing can be maximized. Time-efficient protection and reconstruction of the child's musculoskeletal system is the aim of the surgeon's intervention. The whole strategy must be individualized to every situation. Combinations of diseases, fracture sites, and children are many, whereas treatment options are fewer. Options include non-operative management with observation, and intralesional resection with or without bone grafting, and with or without internal fixation. A thoughtful, disciplined, and systematic approach will be successful most often. The goals of treating a child's pathological fracture are all based on establishing a diagnosis. Only after establishing the diagnosis with certainty can a proper treatment strategy be formulated. Fracture management is then based on five points: (a) pain relief and comfort of the child; (b) achieve Local control or containment of the pathological lesion; (c) skeletal stabilization, preservation of growth, and maintain anatomical alignment; (d) fracture union; and (e) restoration of function. Maintaining perspective will facilitate optimal patient care and minimize the confounding variables that seem to plague the treatment of pathological fractures.

### Evaluation of intramedullary fixation for pediatric femoral shaft fractures in developing countries [^116tAA55]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To report the clinical results after treatment of pediatric femoral shaft fractures with the SIGN Fracture Care International (SIGN) pediatric and standard fin nails.

Design

Retrospective review of prospectively collected data.

Setting

Sixteen global SIGN centers from 2003 to 2013.

Patients/Participants

One hundred twelve pediatric patients who sustained a diaphyseal pediatric femoral shaft fracture.

Intervention

Intramedullary fixation with the standard or pediatric SIGN nail.

Main Outcome Measurements

Main outcome measurements include clinical and radiographic healing and postoperative complications.

Results

The mean age of the pediatric fin patients was 9.4 years (4–15) and 11.2 years (4–18) for the standard fin patients. Painless weight bearing was achieved in 94.7% and 94.5% of the patients at the last follow-up. In total, 23 patients had repeat surgery for the removal of implant. Failure of implant with bending of the nail and/or a valgus or varus deformity (> 10 degrees) was noted in 7/57 (12.3%) of the patients treated with the pediatric fin nail, of which 6/7 were > 10 years old. Five of these 7 patients were classified as technical errors attributed to inadequate nail diameter, length, or initial malreduction. No complications were noted at any age in the standard fin nail group.

Conclusions

In resource-poor settings, SIGN pediatric fin and standard fin nails seem to be an effective treatment option for femoral shaft fractures. In patients with larger canals, the surgeon should consider using the standard fin nail for improved stability and to minimize potential complications.

### Describing pediatric fractures in the era of ICD-10 [^115tWHMt]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Childhood fractures are extremely common. The recent trend is to direct certain fracture care from orthopedic specialists to primary care clinicians. However, to confirm an appropriate level of treatment, the initial diagnosis must be accurate, the description precise, and the communication between those caring for the child consistent. This review illustrates descriptors used at one institution that are based on terminology consensually created between radiologists and orthopedic surgeons for common pediatric fracture types and their displacement, and that satisfy the expanded and detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)-10 requirements for successful coding.

### Pediatric orbital fractures [^1155ovCj]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The unique anatomy and physiology of the growing craniofacial skeleton predispose children to different fracture patterns as compared to adults. Diagnosis and treatment of pediatric orbital fractures can be challenging. A thorough history and physical examination are essential for the diagnosis of pediatric orbital fractures. Physicians should be aware of symptoms and signs suggestive of trapdoor fractures with soft tissue entrapment including symptomatic diplopia with positive forced ductions, restricted ocular motility (regardless of conjunctival abnormalities), nausea/vomiting, bradycardia, vertical orbital dystopia, enophthalmos, and hypoglobus. Equivocal radiologic evidence of soft tissue entrapment should not withhold surgery. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for the accurate diagnosis and proper management of pediatric orbital fractures.

### The etiology and significance of fractures in infants and young children: a critical multidisciplinary review [^115bm8hT]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

This paper addresses significant misconceptions regarding the etiology of fractures in infants and young children in cases of suspected child abuse. This consensus statement, supported by the Child Abuse Committee and endorsed by the Board of Directors of the Society for Pediatric Radiology, synthesizes the relevant scientific data distinguishing clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings of metabolic disease from findings in abusive injury. This paper discusses medically established epidemiology and etiologies of childhood fractures in infants and young children. The authors also review the body of evidence on the role of vitamin D in bone health and the relationship between vitamin D and fractures. Finally, the authors discuss how courts should properly assess, use, and limit medical evidence and medical opinion testimony in criminal and civil child abuse cases to accomplish optimal care and protection of the children in these cases.

### Pediatric facial fractures: children are not just small adults [^112usc6N]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Radiologic imaging is essential for diagnosing pediatric facial fractures and selecting the optimal therapeutic approach. Trauma-induced maxillofacial injuries in children may affect functioning as well as esthetic appearance, and they must be diagnosed promptly and accurately and managed appropriately to avoid disturbances of future growth and development. However, these fractures may be difficult to detect on images, and they are frequently underreported. The interpretation of facial radiographs is particularly challenging, and computed tomography (CT) is necessary in many cases to achieve an accurate diagnosis. To keep the radiation dose as low as reasonably achievable, ultrasonography may be used instead of radiography for the initial imaging evaluation when the clinical suspicion of fracture is low; if evidence of fracture is found, CT then may be performed for a more detailed evaluation. Regardless of the modality used, a familiarity with the characteristic imaging features of pediatric facial fractures is necessary for accurate image interpretation. In addition, knowledge of the epidemiologic and anatomic distribution of pediatric facial fractures is helpful. Particular kinds of fracture (nondisplaced, greenstick, displaced, comminuted) tend to occur at specific anatomic sites in children, with the severity and extent of the fracture varying according to the patient's age and the stage of skeletal development. Midfacial fractures and fractures that are severely displaced and comminuted may be accompanied by neurocranial injuries or other complications and should be evaluated at CT with multiplanar reformatting of image data.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^114HVaKR]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures — epidemiology and evaluation note these are common pediatric injuries, accounting for more than half of all pediatric elbow fractures, most commonly occurring in children ages five to seven years old with a similar frequency in males and females. These fractures are typically a result of an extension injury, most often a fall on an outstretched hand, and all patients with these fractures should be evaluated for neuropraxias, vascular injuries, and/or an ipsilateral distal radius fracture. When evaluating potential cases, a thorough physical exam is required, including neurological, vascular, and other osseous assessment, and any radiographic evidence of a supracondylar fracture, including a posterior fat pad sign, should prompt evaluation by an orthopaedic surgeon.

### Femur fractures in the pediatric population: abuse or accidental trauma? [^114nugGT]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Orthopaedic surgeons play a critical role in evaluating potential cases of child abuse because fractures represent the second most common presentation of abuse behind only soft tissue injuries. There are numerous studies that have focused on the characteristics of fractures considered typical of abuse, including fractures of the femur, humerus, tibia, and ribs. Yet, orthopaedic surgeons are less likely than general pediatric and emergency room colleagues to identify abuse as the potential etiology of these fractures, thus causing delay for appropriate multidisciplinary intervention. This is concerning because of the million children annually in the United States who are the victims of substantiated abuse, orthopaedic surgeons are often the first clinicians to evaluate these patients, and if the cause of injury is not recognized, these children will return to an abusive environment with a 50% risk for reinjury and a 10% risk of death. It is therefore essential orthopaedic surgeons not only treat the fractures these children present with, but also recognize the associated etiologic characteristics of the injury that may suggest child abuse.

When examining a fracture in the emergency room, the following questions should arise: What patient characteristics may be indicative of abuse versus accidental trauma? Is the history and mechanism of injury inconsistent with the presenting injury? Does this fracture type, pattern, and location represent potential abuse? Fractures of the femur in young children provide an ideal model to develop a systematic examination process to differentiate an abusive from accidental etiology.

Fracture of the femur in children is the most common musculoskeletal injury requiring hospitalization. Numerous studies describe fractures of the femur in young children, and many of these have attempted to identify fracture characteristics that may indicate abuse. The most common presentation cited is the presence of a femur fracture in a patient occurring either before walking age or before the second birthday. In addition, several authors have classified the radiographic appearance and location of femur fractures as predictors of abuse as well as elements of the history (inconsistent history, inappropriate delay, multiple presentations), physical examination (examination inconsistent with history, head injury or fracture in a child not of walking age), and socioeconomic background. A number of other reports previously examined fracture patterns in children younger than 48 months of age. These studies do not, however, allow a clinician to decide with confidence whether a given femur fracture is likely caused by abuse.

We therefore asked whether femur fractures caused by abusive trauma could be distinguished from those caused by accidental trauma using presumed risk factors in the history, physical examination, and radiographic characteristics. We then built a predictive model based on those factors.

### Comparison of SIGN pediatric and fin nails in pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures: early clinical results [^1116ikhV]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of SIGN Pediatric and Fin nails in treating pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures.

Design

Prospective case series.

Setting

Level I trauma center from 2010 to 2013.

Patient/Participants

Eighteen patients (13 male and 5 female) with pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures who did not achieve skeletal maturity.

Intervention

Femoral nailing was done using either SIGN Pediatric or Fin nail with hand-reaming without using bone-grafting or image intensifier.

Main Outcome Measurements

Patients were evaluated for infection, radiographic parameters, range of movements, time to weight-bearing (partial and complete), revision surgery (if needed), and complications.

Results

The average age of patients was 10.2 (± 2.1) (range: 6–13) years and average time between injury and surgery was 13 (1–112) days. Fin nail was used in 13 patients, and Pediatric nail in 5 patients. There were no infections in either group. The average time for full weight-bearing was 7.07 weeks in the Fin nail group, and 8.4 weeks in the Pediatric nail group. No repeat surgeries were performed, and there was no case of avascular necrosis of femur head, limb length discrepancy, or any other complication.

Conclusions

SIGN Pediatric and Fin nails are an effective treatment modality for pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures with excellent fracture healing with no major complications.

### Pediatric foot fractures: evaluation and treatment [^112C3ML1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

Foot fractures account for 5% to 8% of all pediatric fractures and for approximately 7% of all physeal fractures. A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the child's foot is of central importance when treating these injuries. Due to the difficulties that may be encountered in obtaining an accurate physical examination of a child with a foot injury and the complexities of radiographic evaluation of the immature foot, a high index of suspicion for the presence of a fracture facilitates early and accurate diagnosis. Although the treatment results in pediatric foot trauma are generally good, potential pitfalls in the treatment of Lisfranc fractures, talar neck and body fractures, and lawn mower injuries to the foot must be anticipated and avoided if possible.

### Pediatric orthopedic emergencies [^115Z8S22]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Many well seasoned emergency physicians often find it challenging to assess and treat pediatric patients regardless of the complaint. Because of anatomic and physiologic differences, pediatric patients experience orthopedic injuries that are both unique and specific to this subset of the population. Emergency physicians must be aware of these nuances to properly diagnose and treat these injuries. An understanding of fractures unique to growing bone, such as buckle/torus and greenstick types, will provoke clinicians to have a keener eye when reviewing pediatric radiographs. The Salter-Harris classification provides a proven, generally accepted stratification of injury to describe and properly disposition pediatric fractures. Emergency physicians must also recognize a distal radial fracture, because it is the most common pediatric fracture, and the many complications of the supracondylar fracture. Nursemaid's elbow and ankle injuries are further common presenting complaints that are discussed. Recognition of child abuse and the work-up of the child presenting with a limp are additional areas that the Emergency physician should feel comfortable evaluating.

Fractures are common injuries caused by child abuse. Although the consequences of failing to diagnose an abusive injury in a child can be grave, incorrectly diagnosing child abuse in a child whose fractures have another etiology can be distressing for a family. The aim of this report is to review recent advances in the understanding of fracture specificity, the mechanism of fractures, and other medical diseases that predispose to fractures in infants and children. This clinical report will aid physicians in developing an evidence-based differential diagnosis and performing the appropriate evaluation when assessing a child with fractures.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^111wArAC]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Imaging for extremity vascular injury — key points emphasize pre-imaging stabilization, indications for operative management, computed tomography angiography (CTA) use based on ankle brachial index (ABI), modality specifications, and angiography guidance. Before imaging, reduce the fracture or dislocation, if present, and appropriately splint the patient's limb to fully assess the vascular status. Hard signs of a vascular injury require immediate operative management. In patients with soft signs of vascular injury and ankle brachial index (ABI) less than 0.9, perform CTA. For CTA of the extremity use at least a 64 slice MDCT. Obtaining completion angiography following repair of a vascular injury is strongly advisable. Traditional angiography may be required to evaluate distal vessels of pediatric patients due to significant vasospasm in younger patients. The decision to perform imaging studies to evaluate a potential extremity vascular injury is dependent on the patient's presentation.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: modern diagnostic approach to the child with recurrent fractures [^112wBQTT]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Children and young people presenting with recurrent fractures pose a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Such patients require early referral to a tertiary paediatric centre with bone specialists and a multidisciplinary team taking a comprehensive, modern approach to unravel the underlying causes. Using a guiding diagnostic algorithm, incorporating a thorough medical history, informed clinical examinations, targeted laboratory tests, state-of-the-art imaging and molecular genetic analyses, specialists can expedite the identification of underlying causes of bone fragility in children. The modern diagnostic approach integrates the latest evidence-based guidelines and technological advancements, thus enabling a swift and effective management strategy. This fifteen-minute consultation equips healthcare professionals with the necessary information to optimise history taking and basic case evaluation and provides insights into procedures at tertiary bone centres. Good collaboration among general paediatricians, orthopaedic surgeons and paediatric bone specialists ultimately enhances the care and outcomes for children with recurrent fractures.

### Skeletal health of children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease [^117Abno6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric IBD — vertebral fractures and assessment guidance are summarized as follows: Vertebral fractures are considered "clinically significant" fractures. The ISCD position statement in adults recommends densitometric vertebral fracture assessment in those receiving chronic glucocorticoid therapy (5 mg or more of prednisone daily for 3 or more months) and in men with "low bone mass" by densitometric criteria and a chronic systemic disease, but not in children. At this point, there is not enough evidence to support recommending vertebral fracture assessment with modality in children with IBD without specific symptoms or previous such fractures; however, we recommend considering evaluating children with IBD for vertebral fracture if suggestive symptoms, such as persistent back pain, are present, especially if these children also have low BMD as defined above (z score ≤ −1.0 SD).

### Clinically suspected scaphoid fractures in children [^114T7VJF]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Scaphoid fractures are often missed in children because of their rarity and difficulty with radiographic diagnosis. Children are often treated for clinically suspected scaphoid fractures although there is no radiographic evidence for fracture on initial evaluation. The 2-fold purpose of this study is (1) to determine how many clinically suspected pediatric scaphoid fractures later became radiographically evident fractures and (2) to identify physical examination findings that suggest a scaphoid fracture when present at initial evaluation.

Methods

We performed separate retrospective and longitudinal reviews of children younger than 16 years referred to orthopaedics with traumatic wrist pain from January 1995 to April 2002. A total of 104 cases with high clinical suspicion but no radiographic evidence of scaphoid fracture on initial examination were included. Patients were followed until discharge to determine if they later demonstrated a confirmed fracture. In the longitudinal arm, 7 specific examination findings were recorded. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were used to analyze the data.

Results

Thirty-one (30%) of the 104 wrists with no initial radiographic evidence of fracture had a radiographically evident scaphoid fracture at follow-up. In the longitudinal arm (n = 41), the following 3 findings were statistically significant predictors of scaphoid fracture: volar tenderness over the scaphoid (P = 0.010), pain with radial deviation (P = 0.001), and pain with active wrist range of motion (P = 0.015). Presence of any of these findings was associated with a higher likelihood of scaphoid fracture.

Conclusion

A high percentage (30%) of clinically suspected scaphoid fractures in children became radiographically evident fractures at follow-up. Volar scaphoid tenderness, radial deviation pain, and pain with active wrist range of motion can be used as signs to increase suspicion for eventual fracture. We recommend that all clinically suspected pediatric scaphoid fractures be immobilized with repeat radiographs and a clinical examination at 2 weeks.

### Treatment of pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures [^112ZU7g7]. AAOS (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures — benefits, harms, contraindications, and decision-making: Invasive and operative treatments are associated with known risks, and contraindications vary widely based on the treatment administered; discussion of options should "rely on mutual communication between the patient's guardian and physician, weighing the potential risks and benefits for that patient". The age groups in recommendations are general guides, and other factors such as associated injuries, comorbidities, skeletal maturity, and specific characteristics including obesity, as well as family dynamics, influence choices; for children who border an age group, decisions "should be made on the basis of the individual", and they "will always need to be predicated on guardian and physician communication". After guardians are informed of available therapies and discuss options with the child's physician, "an informed decision can be made", and clinician experience "increases the probability of identifying patients who will benefit from specific treatment options".

### Trends in the treatment of adolescent clavicle fractures: are we listening to the evidence? [^1175zgU4]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Application of adult literature to the pediatric/adolescent population is likely inappropriate because of the timing of clavicle ossification. In contrast to long bones such as the tibia where ossification centers close between 15 and 16 years for female patients and 17 and 18 years for male patients, the medial epiphysis of the clavicle does not completely ossify until 20 years, with the ossification centers often remaining unfused until 25 years. Bone healing potential is greater in the pediatric/adolescent population versus in adults. Although the three basic phases of bone healing occur in both populations, a pediatric bone that is still growing is already in an osteogenic phase while adult bones must return to this phase, leading to slower healing times in adult versus pediatric patients. In addition, pediatric bones that are still growing can more easily correct defects of fracture alignment or angulation, leaving little, if any, signs of a previous fracture. In this study, older children had surgical treatment at a much higher rate, suggesting both pediatric and adult orthopaedic surgeons may be leaning toward adult treatment when taking care of older children.

### Pitfalls in pediatric trauma and microtrauma [^116jf14t]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Fractures are common in children, although accurate diagnosis is confounded by mimics of fractures some of which are unique to the pediatric population. Such fracture mimics include developmental variations of the growth plates, normal anatomic structures that simulate fracture lines, and/or metabolic disorders that alter the pattern of ossification. Although subtle clues on plain radiographs may help to discriminate between a true fracture or injury and a fracture mimic, MR imaging may be helpful to eliminate uncertainty or expedite diagnosis.

### The angled buckle fracture in pediatrics: a frequently missed fracture [^116xbdNM]. Emergency Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Buckle (torus) fractures in childhood are very common, and most assume a typical configuration wherein the trabeculae across the fracture line are compressed and the corresponding cortex bulges outward (unilateral or bilateral). In other cases the fracture merely shows cortical angulation along one side of the bone and classical buckling is not present. These latter fractures frequently are subtle and easily overlooked. However, if one knows what they look like and where they are likely to occur, one is able to detect them with greater frequency and confidence. The purpose of this communication is to bring attention to this fracture, describe the mechanism by which it occurs, and indicate its most common sites.

### Diagnosis of osteoporotic vertebral fractures in children [^111iFNCi]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a generalised disorder of the skeleton with reduced bone density and abnormal bone architecture. It increases bone fragility and renders the individual susceptible to fractures. Fractures of the vertebrae are common osteoporotic fractures. Vertebral fractures may result in scoliosis or kyphosis and, because they may be clinically silent, it is imperative that vertebral fractures are diagnosed in children accurately and at an early stage, so the necessary medical care can be implemented. Traditionally, diagnosis of osteoporotic vertebral fractures has been from lateral spine radiographs; however, a small number of studies have shown that dual energy x-ray absorptiometry is comparable to radiographs for identifying vertebral fractures in children, while allowing reduced radiation exposure. The diagnosis of vertebral fractures from dual energy x-ray absorptiometry is termed vertebral fracture assessment. Existing scoring systems for vertebral fracture assessment in adults have been assessed for use in children, but there is no standardisation and observer reliability is variable. This literature review suggests the need for a semiautomated tool that (compared to the subjective and semiquantitative methods available) will allow more reliable and precise detection of vertebral fractures in children.

### Patterns of skeletal fractures in child abuse: systematic review [^114ENhH5]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Skeletal fractures are diagnosed in up to a third of children who have been investigated for physical abuse. The fractures are often occult, and they occur in infants and toddlers who cannot give a causal explanation. Children who have been physically abused represent a small proportion of the total number of childhood fractures. Most children who sustain fractures do so from falls, motor vehicle crashes, or other non-abusive trauma. In addition, a small group of children are more susceptible to fractures owing to underlying conditions that contribute to bone fragility. All health professionals who see children should be able to recognise the characteristics of fractures resulting from abuse and initiate child protection investigations where necessary, to prevent further injury that could be fatal. In reality, the possibility of child abuse is often overlooked in clinical practice.

We systematically reviewed the published world literature to answer the question "what features differentiate fractures resulting from abuse from those sustained from other causes?" We aimed to identify indicators that can help clinicians to identify cases of suspected child abuse when a child presents with a fracture for which the cause cannot be confirmed. We explore the strengths and limitations of the current evidence base and make recommendations for future research in this field. We anticipate that this review will enable the development of evidence based clinical guidelines. It will also contribute to the knowledge and understanding of the scientific evidence that expert medical witnesses are expected to have to support their opinion in the family and criminal courts.

### Epidemiology and predictors of orbital fractures in children [^112cqNcQ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Data regarding clinical predictors of orbital fractures in children are limited. We sought to describe the epidemiology of pediatric orbital fractures and identify the signs and symptoms of orbital fractures in children.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of children younger than 22 years who underwent a facial or orbital computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate for orbital fracture. We included patients presenting to an emergency department of a tertiary care children's hospital between January 2009 and May 2013. The presence of an orbital fracture was assessed using the final interpretation of the CT by an attending radiologist in the electronic medical record.

Results

Among 326 children who underwent facial or orbital CT during the study period, 133 (41%) had an orbital fracture. The presence of nausea or vomiting, orbital tenderness, swelling, or ecchymosis and limitation of extraocular movement were each associated with the presence of an orbital fracture (P < 0.05 for each). Twenty-two children (6.7% of cohort and 16.5% of children with orbital fractures) underwent surgical repair for an orbital fracture. In the absence of orbital tenderness, swelling, or ecchymosis, there was 1 child with an orbital fracture who underwent operative intervention.

Conclusions

Fewer than half of children undergoing CT have an orbital fracture identified, and fewer than 7% have a fracture that requires operative intervention. In the absence of orbital tenderness, swelling, or ecchymosis, only 1 child had an orbital fracture requiring surgical repair.

### Approach to the child with fractures [^1113AT7D]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the child with fractures is challenging, as no clear guidelines exist to distinguish traumatic from pathological fractures. Although most fractures in childhood are benign, recurrent fractures may be associated with a wide variety of primary skeletal diseases as well as secondary causes, necessitating a careful history and physical exam to guide the evaluation. There is no "gold standard" for the evaluation and treatment of children with fractures and low bone mineral density (BMD); therefore, the diagnosis of osteoporosis in a pediatric patient should be made using a combination of clinical and radiographic features. Interpretation of bone densitometry in growing patients presents a unique set of challenges because areal BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry depends on multiple dynamic variables. Interpretation of pediatric dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry should be based on Z-scores (sd scores compared to age, sex, and ethnicity-matched controls), using normative databases specific to the brand of densitometer and the patient population. Given the skeleton's ability to recover from low BMD through modeling and remodeling, optimizing management of underlying conditions leading to bone fragility is the initial step. Conservative measures including calcium and vitamin D supplementation and weight-bearing physical activity are important interventions that should not be overlooked. The use of bisphosphonates in children and adolescents is controversial due to lack of long-term efficacy and safety data and should be limited to clinical trials and compassionate therapy in children with significantly compromised quality of life. Close monitoring is required, and further study is necessary to assess their long-term safety and efficacy in children.

### Commonly missed subtle skeletal injuries in children: a pictorial review [^115gjtXc]. Emergency Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Children are distinctive as compared to adults when it comes to musculoskeletal injuries. This is due to the relative elasticity of bones and the presence of epiphyseal plates. There are many subtle injuries which will be missed if the radiologist is not aware of them and is not actively searching for them. The common elusive injuries include: (1) plastic bending fractures, (2) sternoclavicular dislocation, (3) epiphyseal-metaphyseal injuries in older child, (4) buckle fractures, and (5) Toddler fracture types I and II. Detection of these injuries needs an accurate history, a good physical examination, and, in particular, a thorough search by the radiologist. In many cases, it is the radiologist who suggests likelihood of the injury and guides management. In this respect, the use of comparative views and, in some cases, additional imaging is warranted. Here, we review the elusive musculoskeletal injuries in children in pictorial form.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^1112S2G9]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric head trauma CT decision guide — children 2 years and older directs that if any of "GCS < 15", "Signs of basilar skull fracture", or "AMS (agitation, somnolence, slow response, repetitive questions)" are present, the pathway directs to "CT" and labels "High Risk – 4.3% risk of ci-TBI". If none are present, assess for "Vomiting", "LOC", "Severe headache", or "Severe mechanism of injury" defined by "Fall > 5 ft", "MVA w/ejection, rollover, or fatality", "Bike/ped vs. vehicle w/o helmet", or "Struck by high-impact object"; if any are present, follow "Observation vs. CT using shared decision-making" with "Intermediate Risk – 0.8%" and use clinical factors "Multiple vs. isolated factors", "Worsening findings during observation (AMS, headache, vomiting)", "Physician experience", and "Parental preference". If none apply, the pathway states "CT not indicated, Observe" with "Low Risk – < 0.05%". The footnote explains "ci-TBI: risk of clinically important TBI needing acute intervention, based on PECARN validated prediction rules".

### Pediatric orbital fractures [^115eQ5Bp]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation and management of pediatric orbital fractures have many unique features that differentiate them from orbital injuries encountered in the adult population. An understanding of the particular anatomic and mechanical properties of pediatric orbital bone and soft tissue helps to explain most of these differences. This article reviews the epidemiology, anatomy, growth implications, pathomechanics, particular clinical features, assessment, and surgical management of pediatric orbital fractures.

### A strategy to optimize CT use in children with mild blunt head trauma utilizing clinical risk stratification; could we improve CT use in children with mild head injury? [^111DdYvK]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

The purpose of our study was to investigate the impact of clinical risk classification on optimization of the rationale of CT scanning in children with mild blunt head trauma. Exposed effective radiation dose values of CT scanning were also evaluated.

Methods

Children with isolated pediatric mild head trauma admitted in a single center over a 5-year period (n = 3102, > 2 years and < 16 years of age) were retrospectively reviewed. The study group comprised 806 patients with a mean age of 7.4 ± 2.1 years (range, 2–15 years). The patients were categorized into low and high risk groups with regard to presence of predefined signs and symptoms. Effective radiation dose values were calculated.

Results

Incidences of the pathologic CT findings related to trauma were significantly different between low (n = 10) 1.9% and high (n = 90) 29.8% risk groups. Certain predefined signs and symptoms (e.g., vomiting, suspected skull fracture and loss of consciousness) were related significantly with pathologic CT findings attributed to trauma. Estimated mean effective dose values were 3.91 ± 0.38mSv for 2–6 year old (n = 557), and 3.33 ± 0.12mSv for 7–16 year old patients (n = 349).

Conclusion

The pediatric victims of mild head trauma patients within high risk group and those with vomiting, suspected skull fracture and loss of consciousness should undergo head CT scanning. The manufacturer settings on the CT scanners for children should be revised to alleviate untoward radiation exposure.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^112CN5vX]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Imaging for intentional injury in children — radiologists need experience and sufficient expertise to interpret pediatric skeletal surveys performed to evaluate intentional injury and contribute to the investigation. When intentional injury is suspected a complete skeletal survey is recommended in all children 24-months of age and younger, and when a high suspicion for intentional injury exists or is documented, perform a skeletal survey on siblings and household contacts who are 24-months of age and younger. When a suspicion of intentional injury exists in children 2-years and older who are able to verbalize areas of injury, focus initial imaging on the body regions of concern. CT of the head without contrast is indicated when children have neurologic signs or symptoms of injury, skull fractures, multiple fractures, spinal trauma, facial injury, or unexplained apnea. Have a low threshold for performing neuroimaging in children with suspected intentional injury, particularly in infants less than 12-months old.

### Evaluating young children with fractures for child abuse: clinical report [^112HCqvh]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Fractures are common injuries in childhood and can be caused by unintentional injury, medical conditions, and child abuse. Although the consequences of failing to diagnose an abusive injury in a child can be grave, the consequences of incorrectly diagnosing child abuse in a child whose fractures have another etiology are also significant. This report aims to review recent advances in the understanding of fracture specificity, fracture mechanisms, and other medical conditions that predispose infants and children to fracture. This clinical report will aid pediatricians and pediatric care providers in developing an evidence-based differential diagnosis and performing appropriate evaluations when assessing a child with fractures.

### Pediatric skull fractures: could suture contact be a sign of abuse? [^112ZGeZ6]. Emergency Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Skull fractures in infants and young children can occur as a result of both accidental trauma and abuse. 1/3 of children with abuse-related head trauma and 1/5 of children with abuse-related fractures were overlooked during the initial evaluation. In this study, we aim to investigate the prevalence of skull fractures that come into contact with the suture in head traumas caused by accidents and abuse, and also to see if contact of the fracture line with the suture could be used as a sign for abuse in the pediatric population.

Methods

Forry-four patients with head trauma were retrospectively assessed between January 2010 and June 2020 and were confirmed to have fractures on a brain CT. Patient age, gender, and head injury type were recorded. The fracture site, location and number, the contact of the fracture line with the suture, the name, and number of the suture it came into contact with were determined.

Results

Twenty-eight skull fractures in 22 children with a diagnosis of child abuse and 25 skull fractures in 22 children due to accidental trauma were evaluated in the same age and gender range. Eighteen (64%) of 28 abuse-related skull fractures were in contact with two or more sutures. Two (8%) of 25 accident-related fractures were related to two or more sutures. Abuse-related fractures had a significantly higher suture contact rate than accident-related fractures (p = 0.007).

Conclusion

Contact with two or more sutures of a skull fracture is a finding related to abuse rather than accident.

### Diagnosis of osteoporotic vertebral fractures in children [^117DzWeK]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

There is no reliable method to assess vertebral fractures in children. This situation may be improved by the development of a software tool for semiautomated vertebral fracture assessment. Such a tool should be specifically designed for paediatric use and encompass normal physiological variation, which almost certainly accounts for some observer variability in diagnosing vertebral fractures in this population.

### Evidence-based review: management of open pediatric fractures [^115gubHQ]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2012). Low credibility.

Open fractures in the pediatric population are rare. As such, recommendations for care based on high-level studies are scarce. Furthermore, most level I and II recommendations come from studies involving open fractures in adults. Although it is generally accepted that open pediatric fractures have better outcomes than open fractures in adults, the lack of quality studies provide ample opportunities to answer questions regarding care of these injuries. This review explores the available literature and gives corresponding recommendations based on the level of evidence.

### Bone densitometry in children and adolescents [^1173Xsuq]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Concerns about bone health and potential fragility in children and adolescents have led to a high interest in bone densitometry. Pediatric patients with genetic and acquired chronic diseases, immobility, and inadequate nutrition may fail to achieve expected gains in bone size, mass, and strength, leaving them vulnerable to fracture. In older adults, bone densitometry has been shown to predict fracture risk and reflect response to therapy. The role of densitometry in the management of children at risk of bone fragility is less clear. This clinical report summarizes current knowledge about bone densitometry in the pediatric population, including indications for its use, interpretation of results, and risks and costs. The report emphasizes updated consensus statements generated at the 2013 Pediatric Position Development Conference of the International Society of Clinical Densitometry by an international panel of bone experts. Some of these recommendations are evidence-based, whereas others reflect expert opinion, because data are sparse on many topics. The statements from this and other expert panels provide general guidance to the pediatrician, but decisions about ordering and interpreting bone densitometry still require clinical judgment. The interpretation of bone densitometry results in children differs from that in older adults. The terms "osteopenia" and "osteoporosis" based on bone densitometry findings alone should not be used in younger patients; instead, bone mineral content or density that falls > 2 SDs below expected is labeled "low for age". Pediatric osteoporosis is defined by the Pediatric Position Development Conference by using 1 of the following criteria: ≥ 1 vertebral fractures occurring in the absence of local disease or high-energy trauma (without or with densitometry measurements) or low bone density for age and a significant fracture history (defined as ≥ 2 long bone fractures before 10 years of age or ≥ 3 long bone fractures before 19 years of age). Ongoing research will help define the indications and best methods for assessing bone strength in children and the clinical factors that contribute to fracture risk. The Pediatric Endocrine Society affirms the educational value of this publication.

### Classification of chance fracture in children using magnetic resonance imaging [^116c4KCv]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

MRI study of pediatric Chance fracture.

Objective

To evaluate bone and soft tissue lesions in pediatric Chance fracture.

Summary Of Background Data

Several descriptions and classifications have been already developed for Chance fracture, but mainly for adult. Furthermore, they are all based only on radiographic studies.

Methods

MRI and radiographs of 18 children with Chance fracture were analyzed before treatment.

Results

On MRI, in all cases, no abnormal signs were noted on the intervertebral disc. Six patients had a bone fracture going through the pedicle and the vertebral body. Twelve patients had a physeal injury located on the superior or on the inferior vertebral endplate. Three types of lesions could be identified according to the location of the lesion in relation to the pedicle.

Conclusion

MRI is useful in the diagnosis of pediatric Chance fracture. It allows physeal injury to be clearly identified from disc injury.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^112a4wbB]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Skeletal injuries — key points for child abuse emphasize that skeletal fractures are a sentinel injury and the second most common presenting sign of physical abuse. Fractures more specifically associated with abuse include rib fractures, classic metaphyseal lesions, or long bone fractures in the pre-ambulatory infant; however, any fracture location or pattern can be accompanied by physical abuse. High suspicion for physical abuse is warranted with a skeletal fracture in younger children, especially infants prior to walking.

### Management and outcomes of clinical scaphoid fractures in children [^117LiNcM]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: Acute wrist trauma with clinical suspicion of a scaphoid fracture, but normal radiographs, is known as a clinical scaphoid fracture. Standard treatment involves immobilization and repeat radiographs in 10 to 14 days. When repeat radiographs are normal but a scaphoid fracture is still clinically suspected, the optimal management in children is unknown. This study retrospectively assessed the management and outcomes of pediatric patients diagnosed with clinical scaphoid fractures. Methods: A retrospective study was performed of all patients over a 2-year period treated for a clinical scaphoid fracture at a tertiary pediatric center. Patients were included if they had clinical signs of a scaphoid fracture and 2 negative x-rays 7 to 14 days apart postinjury. Results: Ninety-one patients with a mean age of 13.2 years (range: 7.8–17.7) were included. Sixteen patients (17.6%) underwent computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a mean time of 10.2 weeks postinjury. Five patients (5.5%) were diagnosed with a scaphoid fracture by x-ray or CT at an average of 4.5 weeks postinjury (range: 3–6). Six patients were diagnosed with other wrist fractures at a mean time postinjury of 3.1 (range: 3–6.5) weeks. Out of 195 total radiographs, the surgeon and radiologist disagreed on 59 (30.2%) images. No patients underwent surgery. Conclusions: Management of clinical scaphoid fractures at our institution was relatively uniform: nearly all patients were immobilized and less than 20% received advanced imaging. Our findings suggest a low but non-zero occult scaphoid fracture rate, discordance in radiologic interpretation, and lack of advanced imaging, providing an avenue for future prospective studies.

### Approach to the pediatric patient with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [^113oFkqt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary and Conclusions

There are a number of GIO diagnostic and management principles that are similar between children and adults across the lifespan, including the importance of vertebral fractures as a major sign of osteoporosis-related morbidity, and the need for timely identification and treatment of osteoporosis in order to prevent downward health spirals (eg, femur fractures in boys with DMD and in the elderly leading to permanent loss of ambulation). As such, GIO management should be viewed along a continuum, with the stage set in childhood for optimization of bone strength across the lifespan. At the same time, there are uniquely pediatric features that require a different approach to clinical care pathways; these are driven by the potential for dramatic densitometric and structural recovery following resolution of risk factors in the presence of residual growth potential. Overall, current evidence affirms the need for proactive approaches in childhood to optimize pediatric outcomes and prevent permanent bone structural damage and BMD deficits later in life.

### Implementation of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules [^111f4cpz]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

A wrist fracture is one of the most common fractures in children, accounting for 20–36% of all pediatric fractures. The incidence of distal forearm fractures is increasing, resulting in an increasing number of emergency department presentations and requested radiographs and, consequently, rising health care costs. An important cause for the rise in health care costs is the increase in the number of requested radiographs.

Today, radiographic imaging in children with wrist trauma is performed routinely, even though only half of these patients sustained a wrist fracture. To be more selective in the request for a radiograph and support physicians, the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules were developed and externally validated. Based on age and a number of clinical variables, the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules calculates the probability of a distal forearm fracture in children. The recommendation to obtain a radiograph is based on this probability. After external validation, the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules have been shown to have an acceptable sensitivity and a reduction in radiographs of 22% without missing any clinically relevant fractures. The Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules can potentially reduce the number of requested radiographs, reduce the length of stay at the emergency department, and thereby potentially reduce health care costs. However, the actual impact of decision rules, such as the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules, should be evaluated in an implementation study.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of implementation of the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules at the emergency department.

### Inter-rater and intrarater reliability of radiographs in the diagnosis of pediatric scaphoid fractures [^113jehnD]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The management of children presenting with a suspected scaphoid fracture is challenging. When a fracture is not readily apparent on plain radiographs, children may be immobilized until symptoms resolve. This may result in overtreatment, unnecessary health care visits, and increased health care utilization. To understand the role that radiographs should play, we examined their reliability in children with suspected scaphoid fractures.

### Identifying maltreatment in infants and young children presenting with fractures: does age matter? [^1127RoBo]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Child abuse is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in preverbal children who cannot explain their injuries. Fractures are among the most common injuries associated with abuse but of themselves fractures may not be recognized as abusive until a comprehensive child abuse evaluation is completed, often prompted by other signs or subjective features. We sought to determine which children presenting with rib or long-bone fractures should undergo a routine abuse evaluation based on age.

Methods

A systematic review searching Ovid, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and CINAHL from 1980 to 2020 was performed. An evidence-based framework was generated by a consensus panel and applied to the results of the systematic review to form recommendations. Fifteen articles were suitable for final analysis.

Results

Studies with comparable age ranges of subjects and sufficient evidence to meet the determination of abuse standard for pediatric patients with rib, humeral, and femoral fractures were identified. Seventy-seven percent of children presenting with rib fractures aged less than 3 years were abused; when those involved in motor vehicle collisions were excluded, 96% were abused. Abuse was identified in 48% of children less than 18 months with humeral fractures. Among those with femoral fractures, abuse was diagnosed in 34% and 25% of children aged less than 12 and 18 months, respectively.

Conclusion

Among children who were not in an independently verified incident, the authors strongly recommend routine evaluation for child abuse, including specialty child abuse consultation, for: 1) children aged less than 3 years old presenting with rib fractures and 2) children aged less than 18 months presenting with humeral or femoral fractures (Level of Evidence: III Review).

### How old is this fracture? Radiologic dating of fractures in children: a systematic review [^115qWWjJ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We conducted a systematic review of the literature to define the evidence for radiologic dating of fractures in children in the context of child protection.

Conclusion

Radiologic dating of fractures is an inexact science. Most radiologists date fractures on the basis of their personal clinical experience, and the literature provides little consistent data to act as a resource. There is an urgent need for research to validate the criteria used in the radiologic dating of fractures in children younger than 5 years.

### Pediatric orthopedic trauma [^111NacK4]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of pediatric orthopedic trauma continues to evolve rapidly. Whereas the strong healing potential of pediatric patients often allows for the nonoperative treatment of most conditions, many injuries require urgent operative treatment to ensure that patients may return to all activities without disability. Some injuries may require additional follow-up and interventions, as complications such as growth arrests or deformity may occur. This article summarizes the most common fractures and orthopedic injuries of the pediatric patient. The keys to diagnosis, acute management, nonoperative and operative treatments, and complications are discussed. The detection and management of nonaccidental trauma are also examined.

### Entrectinib (Rozlytrek) [^1113z5Pz]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3	Skeletal Fractures

ROZLYTREK increases the risk of fractures. In an expanded safety population that included 338 adult patients and 76 pediatric patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials, 5% of adult patients and 25% of pediatric patients experienced fractures [see Use in Specific Population (8.4)]. In adult and pediatric patients, some fractures occurred in the setting of a fall or other trauma to the affected area; in pediatric patients some fractures occurred with no trauma. In general, there was inadequate assessment for tumor involvement at the site of fracture; however, radiologic abnormalities possibly indicative of tumor involvement were reported in some adult patients. In both adult and pediatric patients, most fractures were hip or other lower extremity fractures (e.g., femoral or tibial shaft). In two pediatric patients, bilateral femoral neck fractures occurred. A total of 41 fracture events were reported in 19 pediatric patients, with 13 patients who experienced more than one occurrence of fracture. Among the 19 pediatric patients who experienced fractures, 17 patients were less than 12 years of age. Among the 41 fracture events, 27 fracture events resolved, 4 fracture events resolved with sequelae and 3 events were resolving. The median time to fracture was 3.8 months (range 0.3 to 18.5 months) in adults and 4.3 months (range: 2 months to 28.7 months) in pediatric patients. ROZLYTREK was interrupted in 41% of adults and 16% of pediatric patients who experienced fractures. Five pediatric patients discontinued treatment due to fractures.

Promptly evaluate patients with signs or symptoms (e.g., pain, changes in mobility, deformity) of fractures. There are no data on the effects of ROZLYTREK on healing of known fractures and risk of future fractures.

### A comprehensive review of bone health in a child: from birth to adulthood [^113irinL]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Bone health is critical for growth and development during childhood. Although fractures are common in children, fractures occurring in the absence of trauma should prompt physicians to consider underlying bone health disorders. This article provides an overview of the current definition of osteoporosis in children, highlighting its limitations and the potential for underdiagnosis. It also discusses the timing of screening initiation and various techniques used to assess bone health, along with their respective benefits and limitations. In addition, this article identifies several causes of primary and secondary osteoporosis in children, shedding light on previously overlooked disorders that can contribute to poor bone quality. The article emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to therapeutic management and aims to optimize patient outcomes and improve the overall care of pediatric bone health disorders.

### Radiologic assessment of skull fracture healing in young children [^115rg5vf]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Healing or radiographic resolution of a skull fracture in young children can take months. In this retrospective chart review, those skull fractures with follow-up imaging demonstrated radiographic resolution at or after 10 weeks. Emergency medicine physicians and multidisciplinary teams should be aware of the high variability in skull fracture presentation and the large window to skull fracture resolution when children younger than 24 months present with unexplained or multiple skull fractures.

### A contemporary view of the definition and diagnosis of osteoporosis in children and adolescents [^1138rkDf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The last 2 decades have seen growing recognition of the need to appropriately identify and treat children with osteoporotic fractures. This focus stems from important advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of bone fragility, the natural history and predictors of fractures in chronic conditions, the use of bone-active medications in children, and the inclusion of bone health screening into clinical guidelines for high-risk populations. Given the historic focus on bone densitometry in this setting, the International Society for Clinical Densitometry published revised criteria in 2013 to define osteoporosis in the young, oriented towards prevention of overdiagnosis given the high frequency of extremity fractures during the growing years. This definition has been successful in avoiding an inappropriate diagnosis of osteoporosis in healthy children who sustain long bone fractures during play. However, its emphasis on the number of long bone fractures plus a concomitant bone mineral density (BMD) threshold ≤ -2.0, without consideration for long bone fracture characteristics (eg, skeletal site, radiographic features) or the clinical context (eg, known fracture risk in serious illnesses or physical-radiographic stigmata of osteoporosis), inappropriately misses clinically relevant bone fragility in some children. In this perspective, we propose a new approach to the definition and diagnosis of osteoporosis in children, one that balances the role of BMD in the pediatric fracture assessment with other important clinical features, including fracture characteristics, the clinical context and, where appropriate, the need to define the underlying genetic etiology as far as possible.

### A meta-analysis on the diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures [^113GX9Wh]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

We noted a significant increase in diagnostic accuracy within the subgroup focused on examining radius fractures, with the analysis highlighting notably higher sensitivity in this category. This trend persisted even after the exclusion of an outlier study. However, upon removing this study, the specificity of ultrasound for the ulna subgroup was found to be significantly higher. Consequently, ultrasound demonstrates greater reliability in excluding radius fractures and proves more effective in confirming ulna fractures. This variability may be attributed to anatomical differences, operator experience and training, variability in patient positioning, characteristics of the study population, and differences in equipment/technology. Further investigation into these factors is necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the nuanced reasons behind the observed differences in diagnostic accuracy for fractures in distinct forearm bones in pediatric cases.

Although the current study's findings highlighted the reliability of ultrasonography in detecting pediatric distal forearm fractures, it is crucial to acknowledge that this imaging modality may not be universally suitable, especially in cases involving patients with obesity or other factors affecting image quality. Consequently, clinical judgment should guide the choice of the most appropriate imaging modality for each individual patient. Additionally, it is worth noting that ultrasound operators might have been influenced by visible deformities or physical signs during image interpretation, potentially leading to an overestimation of ultrasound accuracy.

While this systematic review centered on the diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures, questions about its role post-diagnosis — particularly its potential to inform surgical decisions and support follow-up assessments — remain unexplored. Understanding these aspects is crucial for advancing clinical practice and encourages further investigation into the broader utility of ultrasound in managing pediatric distal forearm fractures.

### Probability of occult ankle fracture based on radiograph-measured swelling [^111epftd]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric ankle injuries are a common presentation in the emergency department (ED). A quarter of pediatric ankle fractures show no radiographic evidence of a fracture. Physicians often correlate non-weight bearing and tenderness with an occult fracture. We present this study to predict the probability of an occult fracture using radiographic soft-tissue swelling on initial ED radiographs.

Methods

This is a retrospective study at a Level 1 pediatric trauma center from 2021 to 22. Soft-tissue swelling between the lateral malleolus and skin was measured on radiographs, and weight-bearing status was documented. Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata software.

Discussion

The study period involved 32 patients with an occult fracture, with 8 (25%) diagnosed with a fracture on follow-up radiographs. The probability of an occult fracture was calculated as a function of the ankle swelling in millimeters (mm) using a computer-generated predictive model. False-negative and false-positive rates were plotted as a function of the degree of ankle swelling.

Conclusion

Magnitude of ankle soft-tissue swelling as measured on initial ED radiographs is predictive of an occult fracture. Although weight-bearing status was not a sign of occult fracture, it improves the predictive accuracy of soft-tissue swelling.

### Femur fractures in the pediatric population: abuse or accidental trauma? [^111yZqF2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Child abuse represents a serious threat to the health and well-being of the pediatric population. Orthopaedic specialists will often become involved when child abuse is suspected as a result of the presence of bony injury. Distinguishing abuse from accidental trauma can be difficult and is often based on clinical suspicion.

Questions/purposes

We sought to determine whether accidental femur fractures in pediatric patients younger than age 4 could be distinguished from child abuse using a combination of presumed risk factors from the history, physical examination findings, radiographic findings, and age.

Methods

We searched our institution's SCAN (Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect) and trauma databases. We identified 70 patients in whom the etiology of their femur fracture was abuse and compared that group with 139 patients who had a femur fracture in whom accidental trauma was the etiology.

Results

A history suspicious for abuse, physical or radiographic evidence of prior injury, and age younger than 18 months were risk factors for abuse. Patients with no risk factors had a 4% chance, patients with one risk factor had a 29% chance, patients with two risk factors had an 87% chance, and patients with all three risk factors had a 92% chance of their femur fracture being a result of abuse.

Conclusions

Clinicians can use this predictive model to guide judgment and referral to social services when seeing femur fractures in very young children in the emergency room.

Level of Evidence

Level III, diagnostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### Femur fractures in the pediatric population: abuse or accidental trauma? [^113RmyKT]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

There are several limitations in our study. First, our prediction rule was generated from an urban Level I pediatric trauma center. It is unclear if the prediction rule would be different for pediatric patients presenting to lower-level pediatric trauma centers in nonurban environments and/or in different countries. However, our tertiary referral status allows us to say we attract patients from a broad catchment area, hence enhancing our external validity. Second, it can be argued our assessment of history status (consistent versus suspicious) is subjective. Specifically, arguments for mitigating individual circumstances such as unwitnessed injury could be due to a momentary lapse in supervision; delay in seeking care could be due to lack of health insurance or a child who is not expressing substantial discomfort. However, our criteria for suspicion are consistent with previous reports. In addition, although our "blinded" rater was instructed to look at only the history and physical records to determine the patient history without viewing other aspects of the medical record, she was not strictly "blind" to the SCAN status of the patient because she had access to the medical record. The use of corroborating investigators with a high intraclass correlation coefficient somewhat mitigates this risk. Third, as a result of the fact that child abuse is largely a social diagnosis, there exists no test that can confirm the presence or absence of child abuse with a high level of specificity or sensitivity. Yet, we believe evaluation by independent specialists constitutes the best method available in the current literature. Inclusion in the SCAN database is determined by an independent group of social workers, nurses, and physicians who all have advanced training in child abuse (and are independent from the authors) at the time the child presents to the emergency room, and is also used for a clinical purpose (ie, activating child protective interventions). As with any study of child abuse, the study risks circuitous logic, that is to say, child abuse is often diagnosed by "suspicious history", physical examination findings, and other social factors. However, this could be said about any condition that is a clinical diagnosis; as such, we believe guidelines for diagnosis of this condition are helpful.

### Traumatic extremity fractures and dislocations… [^1151zP1b]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points Musculoskeletal injuries are common in the pediatric population, with fractures being one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries. Pediatric patients have unique fracture and dislocation injury patterns. All injuries should be assessed for neurovascular status, deformity, and whether the skin is intact. Patients with obvious deformity, atypical neurovascular status, and/or break in the skin should be immediately splinted and sent in for emergency orthopedic evaluation. Radiography is the mainstay diagnostic modality. The health care professional should be familiar with risk factors and fracture patterns for child abuse.

Monitoring and Diagnosis

One of the most important lessons arising from the STOPP study was that vertebral fractures are more frequent in GC-treated children than nonvertebral fractures, underscoring the vulnerability of the trabeculae-rich spine to the adverse effects of GCs. Pediatric vertebral fractures are extremely rare in the absence of trauma, but studies have shown that in the 6 years following GC initiation, with vertebral fractures occurred in one-third of children with leukemia and 16% of children with rheumatic conditions and up to 75% of boys with GC-treated DMD. By demonstrating that vertebral fractures defined according to the modified Genant semiquantitative method associated with clinically relevant variables including LS aBMD Z-scores, back pain, second metacarpal percent cortical area, and an increased risk of future fractures, the STOPP Consortium validated that > 20% loss in vertebral height ratio is an acceptable definition of a vertebral fracture in children.

The most compelling observation that validated the use of the Genant semiquantitative method in children arose from the longitudinal study of children with leukemia, where Genant-defined vertebral fractures at diagnosis were a strong predictor of new vertebral and long bone fractures over the ensuing 5 years. Lateral spine imaging by conventional radiography or DXA-based vertebral fracture assessment should be evaluated by a health care professional with trained expertise, including the ability to distinguish vertebral fractures from normal pediatric variants. Figure 6A benchmarks images in this review to a normal spine radiograph in a GC-treated child, and Fig. 6B provides an example of normal anterior physiological rounding in the midthoracic region; such anterior rounding is characteristic of the immature spine and must not be mistaken for a Grade 1 fracture. Figure 7A-7E shows signs of vertebral fractures according to the Genant semiquantitative method; in equivocal cases, qualitative signs of vertebral fractures may aid the clinician in the diagnosis (endplate interruption, anterior cortical buckling, and loss of endplate parallelism). Genant-defined severity grades correspond to the degree of vertebral height ratio loss as follows: Grade 1 (mild) > 20 to ≤ 25%, Grade 2 (moderate) > 25% to ≤ 40%, and Grade 3 (severe) > 40%.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^1164yC18]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Head and spine imaging — suspected intentional injury in children specifies when to use computed tomography (CT). CT of the head without contrast is indicated when children have neurologic signs or symptoms of injury, skull fractures, multiple fractures, spinal trauma, facial injury, or unexplained apnea. Sensitivity for detecting fractures and intracranial hemorrhage is increased by the use of multiplanar reformatted images and 3D volume rendering of the skull. Insufficient evidence supports universal screening with head CT in all cases of suspected intentional injury; however, many cases of intracranial injury are reported in children with suspected intentional injury who have no clinical suspicion of intracranial pathology. The ACR advises clinicians to have a low threshold for performing neuroimaging in children with suspected intentional injury, particularly in infants less than 12-months-old.

### The treatment of pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures [^116XGcXc]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures — We suggest nonsurgical immobilization of the injured limb for patients with acute (e.g. Gartland Type I) or non-displaced pediatric supracondylar fractures of the humerus or posterior fat pad sign, with Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Evidence cited includes a prospective double-cohort study with a total of 40 patients and 20 in each group (collar and cuff versus back slab) and a randomized control trial with a total of 50 patients (27 randomized to a posterior slab group and 23 to a collar and cuff), and both studies found better pain relief within the first two weeks of injury with the posterior splint/ back slab method of immobilization. Critical outcomes for this recommendation included cubitus varus, hyperextension, loss of reduction, and pain.

### Femur fractures in the pediatric population: abuse or accidental trauma? [^112JPeca]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Pediatric femur fractures are the most common musculoskeletal injury requiring hospitalization, and their presence in children raises suspicion for abuse. In fact, it has been proposed that one-third of femur fractures in children younger than age 4 years and 80% of femur fractures in children who are not yet walking have an abusive etiology. Multiple studies have attempted to classify the demographic and fracture characteristics of children whose fracture may have an abusive etiology, including age (particularly before walking age or the second birthday), radiographic appearance and location of the fracture as well as elements of the history, physical examination, and socioeconomic background. Because femur fractures are a common entity that the orthopaedic clinician will evaluate in the emergency room and are linked to child abuse, it is essential for the orthopaedic clinician to be able to differentiate an abusive from an accidental etiology so that proper multidisciplinary action can be initiated to protect children from an abusive environment. In light of this fact, and the fact that one recent investigation suggests fracture pattern may not be as useful in determining fracture etiology, there exists no prediction algorithm with which to help a clinician assign etiology to an injury. We presumed femur fractures resulting from accidental trauma could be differentiated from femur fractures resulting from abuse using history, physical examination, demographic factors, and radiographic findings, and a prediction model based on these parameters can be generated to allow clinicians to more accurately identify victims of abuse and distinguish abuse from accidental trauma.

Back to the Patients

One of the most important concepts that we wish to impart is the expertise that is needed to assess longitudinal spine imaging in children to detect vertebral fractures and to adjudicate changes in vertebral body structure over time according to a standardized approach. The SDI (the sum of the Genant Grades, and therefore a metric of overall spine fracture burden that considers both the number and severity of fractures) is particularly useful in the pediatric setting where static, worsening, and improving vertebral deformity influence management decisions.

Here, we provide examples of quantitative and qualitative signs of vertebral fractures in addition to changes in the SDI over time. These changes run the gamut from spontaneous improvement without bisphosphonate therapy in patient 1 with sJIA, bisphosphonate-assisted vertebral body reshaping while on GC therapy plus ongoing improvement in vertebral dimensions post-GC and postbisphosphonate discontinuation in patient 2 with JDM, and progressive vertebral deformity despite a robust LS aBMD Z-score response and early introduction of bisphosphonate therapy in patient 3 with DMD. The latter is an aggressive form of pGIO, where linear growth is typically affected by the high daily doses and prolonged GC exposure, thereby interfering with growth-mediated vertebral body reshaping.

### Femur fractures in the pediatric population: abuse or accidental trauma? [^111Sug9c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

The use of age, history, physical findings, and radiographic findings to assess for child abuse is not new (Table 5). Although these multiple characteristics are essential in providing a general "picture" of a pediatric patient presenting with child abuse, the question arises as to how these characteristics can be applied in a quantifiable, objective manner to help to reliably predict etiology for a clinician. Whereas other studies have limited their analysis to descriptions of abusive and accidental femur fracture, the prediction model developed from our study allows for research to be translated into clinical action. Of the multiple demographic characteristics in our study, the multiple regression model identified the following three predictors after accounting for other confounders when differentiating abusive from accidental femur fractures in this age group: (1) age younger than 18 months; (2) physical and/or radiographic evidence of prior trauma; and (3) history suspicious for abuse. Clinicians can use this rule in the following fashion: patients with no risk factors have a 4% chance of having a femur fracture stemming from child abuse; patients with one risk factor have a 24% chance; those with two risk factors have an 87% chance; and those with three risk factors have a 92% chance of having a femur fracture stemming from abuse.

It is essential for clinicians to be able to differentiate the etiology of pediatric femur fractures as stemming from abuse or accidental trauma. Not only are femur fractures a common injury seen by orthopaedic clinicians, but identification of the etiology of the injury is vital to ensure proper multidisciplinary intervention can be initiated for the safety of the child. Prediction based on the multiple logistic regression model that was developed in our study can help determine the etiology of pediatric patients presenting with a fractured femur. Although further studies will be necessary to validate the rule prospectively, we believe the rule is a good "common sense" approach to a young patient with a femur fracture. We believe this method will help all clinicians determine whether child abuse occurred and thus enhance their approach to management.
