## Question

how to diagnose pericardial tamponade

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose pericardial tamponade. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the key bedside findings and their diagnostic performance. Next, I will review the role and limitations of ECG. After that, I need to examine echocardiography as the primary imaging modality and its specific signs. Then, I should consider special scenarios like postoperative states, low-pressure tamponade, and dry tamponade. Finally, I will integrate hemodynamic principles, outline a practical diagnostic algorithm, and note pitfalls and exceptions that could change management decisions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability, because tamponade is a clinical syndrome superimposed on a pericardial effusion, and the threshold for suspicion should be high in patients with dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, or a known effusion, especially when the effusion accumulated rapidly or in postoperative or malignant settings [^9e3384c4] [^7e24c92b].

> Wait, let me verify the classic bedside findings before I overinterpret them. Beck's triad of hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure, and muffled heart sounds is specific but insensitive, appearing in a minority of cases, whereas dyspnea, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus greater than 10 mm Hg, and elevated JVP are more common and useful at the bedside; pulsus paradoxus greater than 10 mm Hg in the presence of an effusion meaningfully increases the likelihood of tamponade, while a value of 10 mm Hg or less substantially lowers it [^e678cf85] [^f038b55e] [^9e3384c4].

> I should double-check the ECG's role because I initially thought electrical alternans might be highly sensitive. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Electrical alternans is specific but uncommon, with low sensitivity in malignant effusions, whereas sinus tachycardia and low voltage are more frequent but nonspecific; taken together, certain ECG abnormalities can raise suspicion but cannot exclude tamponade, so a normal ECG does not rule out the diagnosis [^a6e6495d] [^85d86728].

> Next, I should review echocardiography as the first-line imaging modality. Transthoracic echocardiography is recommended emergently when tamponade is suspected, and the key findings include a pericardial effusion with right atrial systolic collapse lasting more than one-third of the cardiac cycle, right ventricular diastolic collapse, a plethoric inferior vena cava with minimal respiratory variation, and exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral and tricuspid inflow velocities; I need to ensure I emphasize that RA collapse is highly sensitive and RV collapse is more specific, and that IVC plethora supports elevated right atrial pressure but can be absent in low-pressure tamponade or with elevated right-sided pressures [^80c2c5cb] [^ec8bf39e] [^3b39675d] [^c74d1aa2].

> Hold on, I should verify the hemodynamic rationale so I don't misattribute findings. Tamponade physiology reflects pericardial pressure exceeding intracardiac pressures in diastole, which restricts venous return and creates ventricular interdependence with respirophasic shifts in septal position and inflow velocities; this explains pulsus paradoxus and the Doppler flow variations, and it underscores why even modest effusions can be hemodynamically significant if they accumulate rapidly [^9e3384c4] [^20a55c1e].

> But wait, what if the patient is postoperative or has a loculated effusion. I need to check for special scenarios where transthoracic echocardiography can miss tamponade due to surgical dressings, mechanical ventilation, or localized collections; in these cases, transesophageal echocardiography, CT, or CMR can be decisive, and several series show that CT or TEE rescued missed diagnoses and guided timely intervention, so a negative TTE should not reassure me if the clinical picture is compelling [^1a355502] [^a29a726d] [^6d8d5b69] [^0b79c626].

> Let me consider low-pressure tamponade, because IVC plethora may be absent when intravascular volume is low. In this scenario, patients may have subtle or atypical signs yet still benefit from drainage, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion in hypovolemic or diuretic-treated patients with effusions and hemodynamic compromise, and not let a non-plethoric IVC falsely reassure me [^e9a63a00] [^b6eb303f].

> I will now examine the concept of dry tamponade, which is compressive tamponade physiology without free-flowing pericardial fluid, typically from organized hematoma or myocardial hemorrhage after PCI. Diagnosis relies on imaging that demonstrates the compressive collection and hemodynamic compromise, and management often requires surgical evacuation rather than simple pericardiocentesis, so I need to ensure I am not anchoring on the absence of a large effusion [^3aae0dc7].

> Next, I should review how to integrate this into a practical diagnostic algorithm. In unstable patients, I should proceed directly to bedside echocardiography and emergent pericardiocentesis if tamponade is confirmed or strongly suspected; in stable patients with suspected effusion, I should obtain TTE urgently, assess for the classic echocardiographic signs, and correlate with vitals and exam; if TTE is nondiagnostic but suspicion remains high, I should escalate to TEE, CT, or CMR depending on availability and patient factors, and consider invasive hemodynamics only when the diagnosis remains uncertain and management hinges on distinguishing constriction or effusive-constrictive disease [^80c2c5cb] [^a29a726d] [^1bff924f].

> Hold on, I should verify pitfalls and exceptions so I don't overgeneralize. Large effusions can be chronic and well tolerated, while small, rapidly accumulating effusions can precipitate collapse; positive-pressure ventilation can blunt respiratory variation and mask pulsus paradoxus; and preexisting pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular hypertrophy can prevent right heart collapse despite tamponade, so I must interpret findings in clinical context and avoid premature closure [^9e3384c4] [^1a355502] [^3b39675d].

> Finally, I need to ensure my documentation and communication are precise. I should explicitly state whether tamponade physiology is present or absent, quantify the effusion, describe chamber collapses and IVC behavior, and note any limitations of the study; this aligns with standardized echocardiography reporting and facilitates timely decisions about pericardiocentesis versus surgical drainage and the need for ongoing surveillance [^da24ba35] [^80c2c5cb].

Pericardial tamponade is a **clinical diagnosis** supported by echocardiography [^9e3384c4] [^ec8bf39e]. The key steps are: **suspect tamponade** in patients with dyspnea, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated JVP, and muffled heart sounds [^e678cf85] [^85d86728]; **confirm with echocardiography** by identifying a pericardial effusion with right atrial systolic collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse, a plethoric IVC with minimal collapse, and exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid inflow (> 30%/ > 60%) [^ec8bf39e] [^61072985]; and **exclude mimics** such as constrictive pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, and acute heart failure [^ccdbc123]. In unstable patients, **do not delay drainage** for imaging; proceed to emergent pericardiocentesis guided by echocardiography or fluoroscopy [^3152b7a0] [^71678922].

---

## Clinical presentation and physical examination

Tamponade often presents with **nonspecific symptoms**, but certain findings are highly suggestive:

- **Dyspnea**: Most common symptom (87–89% sensitivity) [^e678cf85].
- **Tachycardia**: Pooled sensitivity ~77% [^e678cf85].
- **Hypotension**: Part of Beck's triad, though present in only a minority [^e678cf85] [^9e3384c4].
- **Elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP)**: Sensitivity ~76% [^e678cf85].
- **Muffled heart sounds**: Part of Beck's triad, but insensitive [^e678cf85] [^9e3384c4].
- **Pulsus paradoxus**: Inspiratory drop in systolic BP > 10 mmHg; sensitivity ~82% [^e678cf85] [^690190ae].

---

## Electrocardiogram (ECG)

ECG findings are **nonspecific** but may support the diagnosis:

- **Sinus tachycardia**: Common but nonspecific [^a6e6495d].
- **Low voltage QRS**: Sensitivity ~56% in malignant effusions [^a6e6495d].
- **Electrical alternans**: Specific but rare (~23% sensitivity) [^a6e6495d] [^85d86728].

---

## Echocardiography

Echocardiography is the **diagnostic cornerstone** and should be performed emergently when tamponade is suspected [^80c2c5cb] [^ec8bf39e]. Key findings include:

| **Echocardiographic sign** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Right atrial systolic collapse (> 1/3 of cardiac cycle) | 94% | 100% | Highly specific for tamponade [^3b39675d] |
| Right ventricular diastolic collapse | High | Moderate | Specific for tamponade [^ec8bf39e] |
| Plethoric IVC with minimal collapse | High | Moderate | Indicates elevated RA pressure [^c74d1aa2] |
| Exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral (> 30%) and tricuspid (> 60%) inflow | High | Moderate | Reflects ventricular interdependence [^fa193f66] |

---

## Chest radiography

Chest radiography may show an **enlarged cardiac silhouette** ("water bottle" sign) in large effusions, but it cannot distinguish tamponade from other causes of cardiomegaly and is not diagnostic [^e678cf85].

---

## Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

CT and MRI are **not first-line** but can be useful when echocardiography is inconclusive or to define loculated effusions, pericardial thickening, or masses [^a29a726d] [^80c2c5cb]. CT may show pericardial effusion, chamber compression, septal bowing, and venous distension [^b4f46461].

---

## Hemodynamic assessment

Invasive hemodynamics are rarely needed but can confirm tamponade when the diagnosis is uncertain or to distinguish from constrictive pericarditis. Classic findings include **equalization of diastolic pressures across chambers** and a **reduced cardiac output** [^ccdbc123] [^1bff924f].

---

## Differentiating tamponade from other conditions

Tamponade must be **differentiated from**:

- **Constrictive pericarditis**: Similar JVP elevation but fixed pericardium on imaging and tissue Doppler findings [^notfound].
- **Pulmonary embolism**: Acute dyspnea, RV strain, and thrombus on imaging [^notfound].
- **Acute heart failure**: Pulmonary edema, LV dysfunction, and no pericardial effusion [^notfound].

---

## Clinical decision-making and management

Tamponade is a **clinical diagnosis**; echocardiography confirms it and guides drainage [^9e3384c4] [^ec8bf39e]. Emergent pericardiocentesis is indicated for hemodynamic instability or impending collapse, ideally under echocardiographic or fluoroscopic guidance [^3152b7a0] [^71678922]. In stable patients, manage conservatively with close monitoring and treat the underlying cause [^bc490d5b].

---

Pericardial tamponade is diagnosed by integrating **clinical suspicion** with **echocardiographic confirmation** of effusion and hemodynamic compromise, while excluding mimics. Early recognition and **timely drainage** are critical to prevent circulatory collapse and death [^9e3384c4].

### Does this patient with a pericardial effusion have cardiac tamponade? [^e678cf85]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Cardiac tamponade is a state of hemodynamic compromise resulting from cardiac compression by fluid trapped in the pericardial space. The clinical examination may assist in the decision to perform pericardiocentesis in patients with cardiac tamponade diagnosed by echocardiography.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of the history, physical examination, and basic diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search of English-language articles published between 1966 and 2006, reference lists of these articles, and reference lists of relevant textbooks.

Study Selection

We included articles that compared aspects of the clinical examination to a reference standard for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. We excluded studies with fewer than 15 patients. Of 787 studies identified by our search strategy, 8 were included in our final analysis.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed articles for study results and quality. A third reviewer resolved disagreements.

Data Synthesis

All studies evaluated patients with known tamponade or those referred for pericardiocentesis with known effusion. Five features occur in the majority of patients with tamponade: dyspnea (sensitivity range, 87%-89%), tachycardia (pooled sensitivity, 77%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 69%-85%), pulsus paradoxus (pooled sensitivity, 82%; 95% CI, 72%-92%), elevated jugular venous pressure (pooled sensitivity, 76%; 95% CI, 62%-90%), and cardiomegaly on chest radiograph (pooled sensitivity, 89%; 95% CI, 73%-100%). Based on 1 study, the presence of pulsus paradoxus greater than 10 mm Hg in a patient with a pericardial effusion increases the likelihood of tamponade (likelihood ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.8–6.3), while a pulsus paradoxus of 10 mm Hg or less greatly lowers the likelihood (likelihood ratio, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01–0.24).

Conclusions

Among patients with cardiac tamponade, a minority will not have dyspnea, tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, or cardiomegaly on chest radiograph. A pulsus paradoxus greater than 10 mm Hg among patients with a pericardial effusion helps distinguish those with cardiac tamponade from those without. Diagnostic certainty of the presence of tamponade requires additional testing.

### Pericardial tamponade, a diagnostic chameleon: from the historical perspectives to contemporary management [^97d0853b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early postoperative pericardial tamponade is a life-threatening emergency of paramount importance to any cardiac surgeon dealing caring for either acquired or congenital heart disease. Cardiac tamponade, defined by a fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac, is requiring early diagnosis and immediate action. This condition has multiple causes, including postoperative bleeding after cardiac surgery. Cardiac tamponade produces an increase of the intrapericardial pressure, a compression of the heart with cardiac inflow restriction, eventually causing organ failure, shock, and cardiac arrest in extreme cases. In pericardial tamponade, an accurate and rapid diagnosis is critical, but it may take some time before noticeable signs and symptoms develop, especially if the fluid is slowly increasing. Unfortunately, the results of the physical examination are not very conclusive, even in the presence of major pericardial effusion or tamponade.

### Misconceptions and facts about pericardial effusion and tamponade [^4d204c78]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Several common misconceptions can make the clinical diagnosis of subacute pericardial tamponade challenging. Widely known physical findings of pericardial tamponade lack sensitivity and specificity. Interpretation of echocardiographic signs requires good understanding of pathophysiology. Over-reliance on echocardiography may result in over-utilization of pericardial drainage procedures. Awareness of these misconceptions with an integrative approach to both clinical and imaging data will help clinicians to assess the hemodynamic impact of pericardial effusion and the need for drainage.

### What echocardiographic findings suggest a pericardial effusion is causing tamponade? [^02754d51]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pericardial tamponade is neither a clinical nor an echocardiographic diagnosis alone. The echocardiogram carries diagnostic value and should be performed when there is suspicion for tamponade based on the history and physical exam. A pericardial effusion uncovered on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may be mistaken for tamponade and thereby lead to inappropriate and invasive management with pericardiocentesis.

Objective

This narrative review will summarize the echocardiographic findings and associated pathophysiology that support the diagnosis of pericardial tamponade. It will provide a succinct description of the core findings for which emergency physicians should evaluate at the bedside, along with potential pearls and pitfalls in this evaluation. Labeled images and video clips are included.

Discussion

The core echocardiographic findings of pericardial tamponade consist of: a pericardial effusion, diastolic right ventricular collapse (high specificity), systolic right atrial collapse (earliest sign), a plethoric inferior vena cava with minimal respiratory variation (high sensitivity), and exaggerated respiratory cycle changes in mitral and tricuspid valve in-flow velocities as a surrogate for pulsus paradoxus.

Conclusion

The emergency physician must recognize and understand the core echocardiographic findings and associated pathophysiology that suggest pericardial tamponade. Together with the history and clinical exam, these findings can help make the overall diagnosis and determine management.

### Missed cardiac tamponade [^3d65decf]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Cardiac tamponade can have an insidious onset, becoming life threatening when an adequate cardiac output can no longer be maintained. This case provides an example of a presentation where all the classic signs were present but unfortunately they were missed, in this way providing good revision of what these signs are. It gives some anaesthetic and procedure based perspectives for this rare presentation. It is noteworthy for the speed at which symptoms and signs resolved after the tamponade was relieved.

### Low-pressure cardiac tamponade: clinical and hemodynamic profile [^e9a63a00]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Low-pressure cardiac tamponade is a form of cardiac tamponade in which a comparatively low pericardial pressure results in cardiac compression because of low filling pressure. This syndrome is poorly characterized because only isolated cases have been reported. We conducted a study of its clinical and hemodynamic profiles.

Methods and Results

From 1986 through 2004, we evaluated all patients at our institution with combined pericardiocentesis and cardiac catheterization. We identified those patients who fulfilled catheterization-based criteria of low-pressure cardiac tamponade and compared their clinical and catheterization data with those of patients with classic tamponade. A total of 1429 patients with pericarditis were evaluated, 279 of whom underwent combined pericardiocentesis and catheterization. Criteria of low-pressure cardiac tamponade were met in 29, whereas 114 had criteria of classic cardiac tamponade. Patients with low-pressure tamponade less frequently had clinical signs of tamponade, but the rate of constitutional symptoms, use of diuretics, and echocardiographic findings of tamponade were similar in both groups. Patients with low-pressure tamponade showed a significant increase in cardiac output after pericardiocentesis, but they usually had less severe cardiac tamponade compared with patients with classic tamponade. Prognosis was related mainly to the underlying disease.

Conclusions

Low-pressure cardiac tamponade was identified in 20% of patients with catheterization-based criteria of tamponade. Clinical recognition may be difficult because of the absence of typical physical findings of tamponade in most patients. Although some patients are critically ill, most show a stable clinical condition. However, these patients obtain a clear benefit from pericardiocentesis.

### Assessment and management of cardiovascular disease in the intensive care unit [^7e24c92b]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiac tamponade

Cardiac tamponade is acute circulatory failure secondary to compression of the heart chambers by a pericardial effusion. Pericardial pressures exceed intracardiac pressures, impairing diastolic cardiac filling, and ultimately CO. Presentation is often non-specific and dependent on the rapidity of pericardial fluid accumulation. Accordingly, a high index of suspicion should be maintained, particularly in any patient who has had a recent (within 3 weeks) cardiac surgery or myocardial infarction.

Supportive signs include oliguria, low CO in the presence of elevated filling pressures, 'pulsus paradoxus' (an inspiratory decrease in systolic blood pressure > 10 mm Hg) and electrical alternans. Tamponade is a clinical diagnosis confirmed by either transthoracic or transoesophageal echocardiography. Immediate management should include intravascular volume expansion. Vasoactive medications may further temporise physiological decline, but definitive drainage of the pericardial effusion should be sought. The European Society of Cardiology has produced a triage tool to guide the timing of any intervention including referral to a specialist centre. Pericardiocentesis may worsen RV dilatation and function in the context of severe pulmonary hypertension and should be undertaken with caution.

Regarding specific circumstances for pericardial effusion, more specifically with respect to patients with neoplastic pericardial effusion, ESC 2025 guidelines recommend to perform pericardiocentesis in patients with cardiac tamponade to relieve symptoms and establish the diagnosis of malignant pericardial effusion.

### Low-pressure pericardial tamponade: case report and review of the literature [^b6eb303f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) is accurate for determining the presence of a pericardial effusion. Using FoCUS to evaluate for pericardial tamponade, however, is more involved. Many experts teach that tamponade is unlikely if the inferior vena cava (IVC) shows respiratory variation and is not distended.

Case Report

A 53-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe orthostatic hypotension, exertional dyspnea, and hypoxia. The evaluation did not reveal an acute cardiopulmonary etiology, but FoCUS demonstrated a pericardial effusion, with several signs consistent with tamponade. The IVC, however, was not distended. She was believed to be hypovolemic, but fluid therapy provided minimal benefit. The patient's condition improved only after aspiration of the effusion. The patient's presentation was likely a "low-pressure" pericardial tamponade. Patients with this subset of tamponade often do not have significant venous congestion, but urgent pericardial aspiration is still indicated. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Pericardial tamponade may not manifest with IVC plethora on ultrasound. Patients with low-pressure tamponade do not present with the most florid signs of tamponade, but they nonetheless fulfill diagnostic criteria for tamponade. If a non-plethoric IVC is used to rule out tamponade, the clinician risks delaying comprehensive echocardiography or other tests. Furthermore, the potential for deterioration to frank shock could be discounted, with inappropriate disposition and monitoring.

### Management of pericardial effusion [^bc490d5b]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion is a common finding in clinical practice either as incidental finding or manifestation of a systemic or cardiac disease. The spectrum of pericardial effusions ranges from mild asymptomatic effusions to cardiac tamponade. The aetiology is varied (infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, metabolic, and drug-related), being tuberculosis the leading cause of pericardial effusions in developing countries and all over the world, while concurrent HIV infection may have an important promoting role in this setting. Management is guided by the haemodynamic impact, size, presence of inflammation (i.e. pericarditis), associated medical conditions, and the aetiology whenever possible. Pericardiocentesis is mandatory for cardiac tamponade and when a bacterial or neoplastic aetiology is suspected. Pericardial biopsy is generally reserved for cases with recurrent cardiac tamponade or persistence without a defined aetiology, especially when a bacterial or neoplastic aetiology is suspected and cannot be assessed by other conventional and less invasive means. A true isolated effusion may not require a specific treatment if the patient is asymptomatic, but large ones are at risk of progression to cardiac tamponade (up to one third). Pericardiocentesis alone may be curative for large effusions, but recurrences are also common and pericardiectomy or less invasive options (i.e. pericardial window) should be considered with recurrent cardiac tamponade or symptomatic pericardial effusion (either circumferential or loculated). The aim of this paper was to summarize and critically evaluate current knowledge on the management of pericardial effusion.

### Tamponade: hemodynamic and echocardiographic diagnosis [^ccdbc123]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency that can be readily reversed with timely recognition and appropriate intervention. The clinical diagnosis of cardiac tamponade requires synthesis of a constellation of otherwise nonspecific features based on an understanding of the underlying pathophysiological characteristics. Although echocardiographic examination is a central component of diagnosis, alone it is insufficient to establish the physiological diagnosis of hemodynamically significant cardiac tamponade. The hemodynamic diagnosis of cardiac tamponade requires clinical evidence of low cardiac output and stroke volume in the setting of elevated cardiac filling pressures, with evidence of increased sympathetic tone (eg, tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction), and exclusion of other causes of shock as the primary problem (particularly cardiogenic shock). The hemodynamic features of tamponade are revealed by considering the effects of pericardial constraint. Pulsus paradoxus and loss of the normal "y" descent of a jugular venous pressure waveform may be appreciated on clinical examination. When a pulmonary artery catheter is placed, equalization of diastolic pressures across all chambers is observed. Echocardiographic examination confirms the size, location, and other characteristics of the causal pericardial collection. Several echocardiographic features support the hemodynamic diagnosis of tamponade, including early diastolic collapse of the right ventricle, late diastolic collapse of the right atrium, respiratory variation in mitral valve inflow (akin to pulsus paradoxus), and decreased early filling (E wave) of mitral valve inflow (related to loss of the y descent). Echocardiographic examination then supports decisions about the early treatment and drainage of the tamponading effusion.

### Pericardial disease and pericardial tamponade [^b61de7c0]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The pericardium serves many important functions, but it is not essential for life. Pericardial heart disease comprises only pericarditis and its complications, tamponade and constriction, and congenital lesions. However, the pericardium is affected by virtually every category of disease. The critical care physician is thus likely to encounter the patient with pericardial disease in a variety of settings, either as an isolated phenomenon or as a complication of a variety of systemic disorders, trauma, or certain drugs. Echocardiography is the primary tool for diagnosing and quantifying pericardial effusions, and in the context of the clinical presentation, a thorough understanding of M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler findings can help not only to identify patients with impending tamponade, but also to suggest a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. This article reviews the pathogenesis and diagnosis of pericardial heart disease, focusing on the diagnostic utility of echocardiography, with an emphasis on those areas of greatest interest to the intensivist.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for syncope, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria (cardiac syncope, structural), ESC 2018 guidelines recommend to suspect aortic stenosis, obstructive cardiac tumors or thrombi, pericardial tamponade, and aortic dissection as the most probable causes of syncope when the ECG shows the typical features of these conditions.

Recommendations for multimodality imaging and procedures in pericardial effusions and cardiac tamponade — Table 9 — state the following: transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to identify pericardial effusion and assess for cardiac tamponade is Recommended; cardiac computed tomography (CCT)/cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) or transesophageal echocardiogram to confirm diagnosis of pericardial effusion when clinically indicated if TTE inconclusive is Recommended; CCT/CMR to assess for secondary causes of pericardial effusion when clinically indicated is Reasonable; CCT/CMR for routine assessment of cardiac tamponade is Not recommended; transesophageal echocardiogram/CCT to confirm clinical diagnosis of focal cardiac tamponade in cases of high suspicion with unrevealing/equivocal TTE is Recommended; TTE for surveillance of pericardial effusion (at least moderate in size) is Reasonable; pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade is Recommended; pericardiocentesis for pericardial effusion without tamponade is Not recommended; and pericardial window after prior pericardiocentesis for recurrent large pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade is Reasonable. Acronyms on-page are defined as CCT = cardiac computed tomography, CMR = cardiac magnetic resonance, and TTE = transthoracic echocardiography.

### Delayed cardiac tamponade after open heart surgery-is supplemental CT imaging reasonable? [^63e29324]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Diagnostic accuracy of transthoracic echocardiography is limited in patients after open heart surgery, since sensitivity and specificity for detection of cardiac tamponade are limited. Therefore, CT imaging is reasonable for supplemental diagnostic imaging to assess suspected delayed cardiac tamponade in high-risk patients after open heart surgery.

### Pericardial effusions: causes, diagnosis, and management [^20a55c1e]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The presentation of a patient with a pericardial effusion can range from an incidental finding to a life-threatening emergency. Accordingly, the causes of pericardial effusions are numerous and can generally be divided into inflammatory and non-inflammatory etiologies. For all patients with a suspected pericardial effusion, echocardiography is essential to define the location and size of an effusion. In pericardial tamponade, the hemodynamics relate to decreased pericardial compliance, ventricular interdependence, and an inspiratory decrease in the pressure gradient for left ventricular filling. Echocardiography provides insight into the pathophysiologic alterations, primarily through an assessment of chamber collapse, inferior vena cava plethora, and marked respiratory variation in mitral and tricuspid inflow. Once diagnosed, pericardiocentesis is performed in patients with tamponade, preferably with echocardiographic guidance. With a large effusion but no tamponade, pericardiocentesis is rarely needed for diagnostic purposes, though is performed if there is concern for a bacterial infection. In patients with malignancy, pericardial window is preferred given the risk for recurrence. Finally, large effusions can progress to tamponade, but can generally be followed closely until the extent of the effusion facilitates safe pericardiocentesis.

### Cardiac tamponade [^9e3384c4]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency caused by the progressive accumulation of pericardial fluid (effusion), blood, pus or air in the pericardium, compressing the heart chambers and leading to haemodynamic compromise, circulatory shock, cardiac arrest and death. Pericardial diseases of any aetiology as well as complications of interventional and surgical procedures or chest trauma can cause cardiac tamponade. Tamponade can be precipitated in patients with pericardial effusion by dehydration or exposure to certain medications, particularly vasodilators or intravenous diuretics. Key clinical findings in patients with cardiac tamponade are hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure and distant heart sounds (Beck triad). Dyspnoea can progress to orthopnoea (with no rales on lung auscultation) accompanied by weakness, fatigue, tachycardia and oliguria. In tamponade caused by acute pericarditis, the patient can experience fever and typical chest pain increasing on inspiration and radiating to the trapezius ridge. Generally, cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis that can be confirmed using various imaging modalities, principally echocardiography. Cardiac tamponade is preferably resolved by echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis. In patients who have recently undergone cardiac surgery and in those with neoplastic infiltration, effusive-constrictive pericarditis, or loculated effusions, fluoroscopic guidance can increase the feasibility and safety of the procedure. Surgical management is indicated in patients with aortic dissection, chest trauma, bleeding or purulent infection that cannot be controlled percutaneously. After pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy, NSAIDs and colchicine can be considered to prevent recurrence and effusive-constrictive pericarditis.

### Does this patient with a pericardial effusion have cardiac tamponade? [^f038b55e]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context Cardiac tamponade is a state of hemodynamic compromise resulting from cardiac compression by fluid trapped in the pericardial space. The clinical examination may assist in the decision to perform pericardiocentesis in patients with cardiac tamponade diagnosed by echocardiography. Objective To systematically review the accuracy of the history, physical examination, and basic diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. Data Sources MEDLINE search of English-language articles published between 1966 and 2006, reference lists of these articles, and reference lists of relevant textbooks. Study Selection We included articles that compared aspects of the clinical examination to a reference standard for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. We excluded studies with fewer than 15 patients. Of 787 studies identified by our search strategy, 8 were included in our final analysis.

Five features occur in the majority of patients with tamponade: dyspnea, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, elevated jugular venous pressure, and cardiomegaly on chest radiograph. Based on 1 study, the presence of pulsus paradoxus greater than 10 mm Hg in a patient with a pericardial effusion increases the likelihood of tamponade, while a pulsus paradoxus of 10 mm Hg or less greatly lowers the likelihood. Conclusions Among patients with cardiac tamponade, a minority will not have dyspnea, tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, or cardiomegaly on chest radiograph.

A pulsus paradoxus greater than 10 mm Hg among patients with a pericardial effusion helps distinguish those with cardiac tamponade from those without. Diagnostic certainty of the presence of tamponade requires additional testing. © 2025 JAMA+ AI Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Pericardial tamponade: a comprehensive emergency medicine and echocardiography review [^52b7d608]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pericardial tamponade requires timely diagnosis and management. It carries a high mortality rate.

Objective

This review incorporates available evidence to clarify misconceptions regarding the clinical presentation, while providing an in-depth expert guide on bedside echocardiography. It also details the decision-making strategy for emergency management including pericardiocentesis, along with pre- and peri-procedural pearls and pitfalls.

Discussion

Pericardial effusions causing tamponade arise from diverse etiologies across acute and sub-acute time courses. The most frequently reported symptom is dyspnea. The classically taught Beck's triad (which includes hypotension) does not appear commonly. Echocardiographic findings include: a pericardial effusion (larger size associated with tamponade), diastolic right ventricular collapse (specific), systolic right atrial collapse (sensitive), a plethoric non-collapsible inferior vena cava (sensitive), and sonographic pulsus paradoxus. Emergent pericardiocentesis is warranted by hemodynamic instability, impending deterioration, or cardiac arrest. Emergent surgical indications include type A aortic dissection causing hemopericardium, ventricular free wall rupture after acute myocardial infarction, severe chest trauma, and iatrogenic hemopericardium when bleeding cannot be controlled percutaneously. Pre-procedure management includes blood products for patients with traumatic hemopericardium; gentle intravenous fluids to hypotensive, hypovolemic patients with consideration for vasoactive medications; treatment of anticoagulation, coagulopathies, and anemia. Positive-pressure ventilation and intravenous sedation can lower cardiac output and should be avoided if possible. Optimal location for echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis is the largest, shallowest fluid pocket with no intervening vital structures. Patient positioning to prevent hypoxia and liberal amounts of local anesthesia can facilitate patients remaining still. Safe needle guidance and confirmation of catheter placement is achieved using low-depth sonographic views, injection of agitated saline, and evaluation of initial aspirate for hemorrhage. Pericardial fluid should be drained slowly to avoid pericardial decompression syndrome.

Conclusion

An understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, echocardiographic findings, and time-sensitive management of pericardial tamponade is essential for emergency physicians.

### Imaging findings in cardiac tamponade with emphasis on CT [^b4f46461]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition that results from slow or rapid heart compression secondary to accumulation of fluid, pus, blood, gas, or tissue within the pericardial cavity. This condition can be associated with multiple causes including trauma, inflammation, scarring, or neoplastic involvement of the pericardial space among others. The main pathophysiologic event leading to tamponade is an increase in intrapericardial pressure sufficient to compress the heart with resultant hemodynamic impairment, which leads to limited cardiac inflow, decreased stroke volume, and reduced blood pressure. These events result in diminished cardiac output, which manifests clinically as a distinctive form of cardiogenic shock. Although cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis, imaging studies play an important role in assessment and possible therapeutic intervention. Computed tomographic (CT) findings associated with cardiac tamponade include pericardial effusion, usually large, with distention of the superior and inferior venae cavae; reflux of contrast material into the azygos vein and inferior vena cava; deformity and compression of the cardiac chambers and other intrapericardial structures; and angulation or bowing of the interventricular septum. Familiarity with the clinical and pathophysiologic features of cardiac tamponade and correlation with the associated CT findings are essential for early and accurate diagnosis.

### Pericardial tamponade, a diagnostic chameleon: from the historical perspectives to contemporary management [^7ddb0be4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the first days after cardiac surgery, the occurrence of life-threatening situations such as cardiac tamponade must be expected. Especially if the symptoms are atypical, the entire diagnostic armamentarium must be applied to identify the origin of the complaints, which may be cardiac, or non-cardiac (Fig. 5). As demonstrated by the case presented, in which a CT abdomen with contrast medium was crucial in determining cardiac tamponade as the origin of symptoms, the time window to life-threatening deterioration can be very short. Interdisciplinary collaboration is often imperative to successfully treat patients immediately.

### Pericardial windows have limited diagnostic success [^f0ef9400]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A pericardial effusion (PE) is a common finding in patients who have chronic cardiac failure, postoperative cardiac surgery patients, or patients who have certain infectious, benign or malignant diseases. They are often diagnosed either as incidental findings or when its related to systemic or cardiac disease. The clinical spectrum of patients with pericardial effusions ranges from mild asymptomatic effusions to cardiac tamponade. Management is guided by the hemodynamic impact, size, presence of inflammation (i.e. pericarditis), and the etiology. Drainage of the PE is required for cardiac tamponade, symptomatic moderate to large pericardial effusions and when a bacterial or neoplastic etiology is suspected.

Surgical pericardial drainage procedures, "Pericardial Windows", are often requested for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The perceived diagnostic benefit is that it allows for determination of malignancy or infection for patients with PEs of unclear etiology through testing of the pericardial fluid and tissue. The purpose of the study is to determine the diagnostic yield of surgical drainage procedures.

### Diagnosing pericarditis… [^5b5bd425]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

As previously noted, acute, rapid accumulation of fluid in the pericardium causes signs of acute hemodynamic compromise in cardiac tamponade. Patients with this condition develop tachycardia, hypotension, pulsus paradoxus, and distended neck veins. Although these patients appear to be in acute distress, their lungs are clear on auscultation. In cardiac tamponade, the ECG shows electrical alternans as the heart "floats" in relation to the recording leads. Chronic constrictive pericarditis presents with low voltage of the QRS complex and diffuse flattening or inversion of the T waves. Atrial fibrillation occurs in one third of patients with pericardial disease. DOPPLER STUDIES The diagnostic test of choice for large effusions, cardiac tamponade, and constrictive pericarditis is two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography. This imaging modality can demonstrate moderate or large effusions.

In cardiac tamponade, Doppler examination may show the characteristic swinging motion of the heart that gives rise to electrical alternans. Indications for hospitalization include elevated neck veins, tachycardia, hypotension, poor pain control, and elevated cardiac enzyme levels. Patients also should be hospitalized if they have pulsus paradoxus, electrical alternans on the ECG, or a large pericardial effusion. Patients with chronic, large pericardial effusion may be asymptomatic but can develop cardiac tamponade precipitously. Thus, pericardiocentesis is indicated, and pericardectomy should be performed if the effusion recurs after percutaneous drainage. 11 Pericardiocentesis is best performed in a controlled setting by an experienced physician. The patient is placed in a semirecumbent position. The pericardiocentesis needle is introduced into the subxiphoid angle and aimed toward the left shoulder.

Distally, the needle is attached to an ECG monitor. Detection of ST-segment elevation during the procedure suggests injury to the myocardium. In cardiac tamponade, emergency pericardiocentesis can be lifesaving, because drainage of even a small amount of fluid changes the volume-pressure relationship significantly. In certain situations, patients with cardiac tamponade or hemopericardium must go directly to surgery. Needle pericardiocentesis will exsanguinate patients with proximal aortic dissection or cardiac rupture. 3.

### Pericardial tamponade, a diagnostic chameleon: from the historical perspectives to contemporary management [^ca4c3d80]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pericardial tamponade (PT) early after cardiac surgery is a challenging clinical entity, not infrequently misrecognized and often only detected late in its course. Because the clinical signs of pericardial tamponade can be very unspecific, a high degree of initial suspicion is required to establish the diagnosis. In addition to clinical examination the deployment of imaging techniques is almost always mandatory in order to avoid delays in diagnosis and to initiate any necessary interventions, such as pericardiocentesis or direct cardiac surgical interventions. After a brief overview of how knowledge of PT has developed throughout history, we report on an atypical life-threatening cardiac tamponade after cardiac surgery. A 74-year-old woman was admitted for elective biological aortic valve replacement and aorto-coronary-bypass grafting (left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, single vein graft to right coronary artery). On the 10th postoperative day, the patient unexpectedly deteriorated. She rapidly developed epigastric pain radiating to the left upper abdomen, and features of low peripheral perfusion and shock. There were no clear signs of pericardial tamponade either clinically or echocardiographically. Therefore, for further differential diagnosis, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan was performed under clinical suspicion of acute abdomen. Unexpectedly, active bleeding distally from the right coronary anastomosis was revealed. While the patient was prepared for operative revision, she needed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which was successful. Intraoperatively, the source of bleeding was located and surgically relieved. The subsequent postoperative course was uneventful.

Conclusions

In the first days after cardiac surgery, the occurrence of life-threatening situations, such as cardiac tamponade, must be expected. Especially if the symptoms are atypical, the entire diagnostic armamentarium must be applied to identify the origin of the complaints, which may be cardiac, but also non-cardiac.

Central message

A high level of suspicion, immediate diagnostic confirmation, and rapid treatment are required to recognize and successfully treat such an emergency (Fig. 5).

Perspective

Pericardial tamponade should always be considered as a complication of cardiac surgery, even when symptoms are atypical. The full range of diagnostic tools must be used to identify the origin of the complaints, which may be cardiac, but also non-cardiac (Fig. 5).

Postoperative cardiac tamponade — timing, frequency, and diagnostic nuances are described: cardiac tamponade associated with cardiac surgery may occur early (< 24 hours), or late (arbitrarily defined as > 5–7 days). In a "modern era" retrospective survey of > 4,500 postoperative patients, only 48 had moderate or large effusions by echocardiography and, of those, 36 met diagnostic criteria for tamponade; preoperative anticoagulants, valve surgery, and female gender were associated with higher incidence. Because transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) may be difficult postoperatively, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) at the bedside is often helpful, and inflow patterns differ during positive-pressure ventilation, with only minimal respiratory variation when tamponade is present during positive-pressure ventilation.

Cardiac tamponade/perforation is "the development of a significant pericardial effusion during or within 30 days of undergoing an AF ablation procedure"; a significant effusion "results in hemodynamic compromise, requires elective or urgent pericardiocentesis, or results in a 1-cm or more pericardial effusion as documented by echocardiography," and cases "should also be classified as 'early' or 'late' depending on whether it is diagnosed during or following initial discharge from the hospital."

Assumptions and definitions — pericardial entities are defined to guide diagnosis and management: Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium leading to characteristic pleuritic chest pain which can be accompanied by pericardial rub, typical electrocardiogram changes, new or worsening pericardial effusion, and elevated inflammatory markers; pericardial effusion is fluid accumulation in the pericardial space visible on imaging such as echocardiography; cardiac tamponade is compression of the heart by abnormal fluid accumulation causing impaired cardiac output and hemodynamic compromise; constrictive pericarditis is loss of elasticity with often abnormal pericardial thickening that impairs diastolic filling and leads to heart failure symptoms and can be transient/subacute (predominantly inflammatory and reversible) or advanced/chronic (often calcified and irreversible); effusive constrictive pericarditis is persistent constrictive physiology even after drainage of pericardial effusion.

pericardial tamponadeListen to pronunciationA serious condition that occurs when extra fluid or blood builds up in the space between the heart and the pericardium. The extra fluid causes pressure on the heart, which keeps it from pumping enough blood to the rest the body. Pericardial tamponade is life-threatening and can lead to shock and organ failure if not treated right away. It may be caused by cancer, infection, chest injury, heart surgery, radiation therapy to the chest, autoimmune disease, and heart, thyroid, or kidney problems. Also called cardiac tamponade.

### Pericardial effusion impending tamponade: a look beyond beck's triad [^e9fe729a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of chronic or slowly progressing pericardial effusion with impending tamponade remains a challenge, particularly when classical physical signs are subtle or absent. A high index of suspicion should be entertained in such cases in the appropriate setting even when the clinical signs and symptoms are missing. We present two cases where the pericardial effusion was missed in the emergency department due to subtle clinical features or mistaken for a more familiar "look-a-like" presentation. A review of the literature and an analysis of various clinical parameters of published cases were performed. It is pivotal that physicians should not only be aware of the limitations of the traditional clinical signs, but also be familiar with the use of other subtle findings and the importance of other modalities that may potentially enhance the sensitivity in diagnosing chronic pericardial effusion impending tamponade.

### Cardiac tamponade: contrast reflux as an indicator of cardiac chamber equalization [^fa5f8860]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic cardiac tamponade remains a deadly, but rare, reason for presentation to the emergency department. Its main cause in trauma patients is penetrating chest injury (80–90%) and it occurs in only 10% of blunt chest trauma injuries. Thoracic injuries account for approximately 25% of trauma related deaths and are a contributing factor in an additional 25% of deaths in the United States annually. As it is typical for acute trauma, fast and accurate diagnostics are crucial. We present a case of blunt chest trauma including cardiac tamponade revealed by contrast reflux at CT.

### Cardiac tamponade as the initial presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report and review of the literature [^0bac3c15]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The immediate treatment of cardiac tamponade involves withdrawal of pericardial fluid usually by pericardiocentesis, done in all cases except one which was aborted due to a thickened pericardium with adhesions. When compared to surgical drainage, echocardiography guided pericardiocentesis has been associated with lower morbidity and mortality rates. Some cases required placement of a pericardial drain or less commonly surgical pericardiectomy. Medical management consists of anti-inflammatory medication which typically involves high dose corticosteroids, antimalarials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Table 2). Follow-up is essential to exclude recurrent pericardial effusions and pericardial thickening. In this patient both the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level were elevated. While an elevated ESR is common during a flare, CRP is often normal or mildly elevated. Serositis is one of the few manifestations of SLE that causes both an elevated CRP level and ESR.

The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) recently proposed classification criteria addressing perceived weaknesses of the 1997 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria. Using the SLICC criteria, our patient was diagnosed with cSLE. Interestingly, the ACR criteria do not include low serum complement C3 and/or C4 levels as a relevant immunologic criterion. As such, our patient was unable to fulfil 4 out of the 11 ACR criteria for classifying SLE. In recent pediatric series, use of the SLICC criteria for the classification of cSLE, showed better sensitivity and led to fewer misclassifications, but was less specific than the ACR criteria. As seen in our patient, low complement levels have been reported as one of the more frequently seen immunologic factors found at presentation in cSLE. The SLICC criteria have also allowed anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-Sm antibodies and antiphospholipid antibodies to contribute individually to the diagnosis. Atypical presentation is common in cSLE and often leads to major diagnostic delay. By allowing for greater weighting of immunologic criteria the use of the SLICC criteria may be more sensitive for diagnosis in these cases, potentially leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment.

Pericardial disease — An invasive hemodynamic evaluation should be strongly considered for all patients with suspected constrictive pericarditis due to the frequently complex pathophysiology and the need for high diagnostic specificity when considering surgery; invasive studies for constrictive pericarditis should entail examination of the dynamic respiratory criteria; and an invasive hemodynamic study is typically not required for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade.

### Pericardial tamponade, a diagnostic chameleon: from the historical perspectives to contemporary management [^a4c8c6e7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

As the present case also exemplifies, if tamponade is clinically suspected, even if clinical signs and/or echocardiography are inconclusive, further imaging modalities are mandatory, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or even cardiac catheterization.

Sophisticated computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may reveal pericardial effusion, distention of the superior and inferior vena cava, reflux of contrast media into the azygos vein and inferior vena cava, deformity and compression of the cardiac chambers and other intrapericardial structures, and angulation or bowing of the interventricular septum. Multi-phasic CT with high temporal and spatial resolution as well as optimal contrast bolus timing is necessary to prove active extravasation of contrast medium and corresponding blood into the pericardium. Due to the larger field of view compared to echocardiography, additional information is provided, including assessment of the entire chest, abnormalities in the mediastinum, lungs, and adjacent structures. Advanced CT-scanners may also deliver cine CT-images and important information about the function and dynamics of the heart and pericardium. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in particular when regional tamponade is suspected in hemodynamically stable postoperative patients.

Cardiac catheterization is only rarely used as an initial diagnostic test and can reveal equilibration of average intracardiac diastolic pressures (usually between 10 and 30 mmHg) and the inspiratory increase in right-sided pressures and reduction in left-sided pressures.

Failure to recognize the hemodynamic changes in PT or waiting for complete pathognomonic clinical or echocardiographic findings may delay essential treatment and result in serious morbidity and even death from hemodynamic collapse. Timely decompression of PT by echocardiographic or fluoroscopic guided percutaneous pericardiocentesis or subxiphoid thoracotomy or resternotomy may be life-saving.

### Point-of-care diagnosis of cardiac tamponade identified by the flow velocity paradoxus [^bd40ca2d]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The presentation of cardiac tamponade is a spectrum from occult to extreme. The clinical history, physical exam, electrocardiogram, and radiographic findings of tamponade have poor sensitivities and even worse specificities. We use a clinical scenario to demonstrate how point-of-care cardiac ultrasound can diagnose impending cardiac tamponade in a clinically stable patient. The ultrasound finding we recommend is the flow velocity paradoxus, in which respiratory variation causes significant changes in transvalvular inflow velocities, which are exaggerated when tamponade is present. The management of a pericardial effusion depends on its physiologic effect, and point-of-care ultrasound directly measures that effect and expedites patient care.

### Delayed cardiac tamponade after open heart surgery-is supplemental CT imaging reasonable? [^0b79c626]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac tamponade is a severe complication after open heart surgery. Diagnostic imaging is challenging in postoperative patients, especially if tamponade develops with subacute symptoms. Hypothesizing that delayed tamponade after open heart surgery is not sufficiently detected by transthoracic echocardiography, in this study CT scans were used as standard reference and were compared with transthoracic echocardiography imaging in patients with suspected cardiac tamponade.

Method

Twenty-five patients after open heart surgery were enrolled in this analysis. In case of suspected cardiac tamponade patients underwent both echocardiography and CT imaging. Using CT as standard of reference sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of ultrasound imaging in detecting pericardial effusion/hematoma were analyzed. Clinical appearance of tamponade, need for re-intervention as well as patient outcome were monitored.

Results

In 12 cases (44%) tamponade necessitated surgical re-intervention. Most common symptoms were deterioration of hemodynamic status and dyspnea. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of echocardiography were 75%, 64%, 75%, and 64% for detecting pericardial effusion, and 33%, 83%, 50, and 71% for pericardial hematoma, respectively. In-hospital mortality of the re-intervention group was 50%.

Conclusion

Diagnostic accuracy of transthoracic echocardiography is limited in patients after open heart surgery. Suplemental CT imaging provides rapid diagnostic reliability in patients with delayed cardiac tamponade.

### Cardiac tamponade presenting as an apparent life-threatening event [^7a7d3fd6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

The initial emergency department (ED) evaluation of infants with an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) often fails to identify a definitive cause for the event. Many children that present with an ALTE appear normal by the time they arrive to the ED. These factors can desensitize clinicians into prematurely discounting serious underlying causes of the ALTE or being less prompt in their evaluation of these patients. We present the case of a young infant who presented to an ED with an ALTE resulting from cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade has not been reported as an underlying cause of infants presenting to the ED with an ALTE. Previously reported cases of cardiac tamponade in children have occurred as a complication of malignancies, cardiac surgery, trauma, infections, central venous catheter placement, rheumatologic, and autoimmune diseases. This case should serve as a reminder to clinicians to maintain a broad differential diagnosis and promptly evaluate all infants presenting with an ALTE.

### Pericardial tamponade, a diagnostic chameleon: from the historical perspectives to contemporary management [^d45fda1e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiologic mechanism causing tamponade is an increase in intrapericardial pressure sufficient enough to compress the heart. When intrapericardial pressure exceeds end-diastolic ventricular pressure, it results in restricted cardiac inflow, diminished intracardiac volumes, decreased stroke volume, and reduced blood pressure. Substantially reduced stroke volume triggers a cascade of compensatory mechanisms to maintain cardiac output and blood pressure. Stimulation of sympathetic nervous system and catecholamines leads to increased contractility, tachycardia, vasoconstriction and clinically to a typical pattern of cardiogenic shock. The typical clinical signs of rapidly developing PT comprises a patient in shock with dyspnea, cough, chest discomfort, cool legs, arms, ears, and nose, as well as peripheral cyanosis jugular venous distention. The classic "Beck triad" with diminished heart sounds, hypotension, and jugular vein distention may implicate PT but is only rarely seen. The pulse paradoxus, described as pathognomonic, can be missing or difficult to detect. Neither the historical Kussmaul's sign, a distention of jugular veins on inspiration, nor the Friedreich's sign, an excessive drop in diastolic central venous pressure, are conclusive. The sensitivity of these signs can be low since postoperative PT often results from localized adhesions rather than circumferential pericardial changes or fluid accumulation.

As the presented case shows, clinical signs and symptoms have low sensitivity and are often unreliable, and imaging modalities play an important role in assessment PT, particularly echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and cardiac catheterization. Echocardiography is usually the method of choice to detect or exclude pericardial effusion. Classic echocardiographic features of tamponade include right atrial systolic collapse, right ventricular (RV) diastolic collapse, a paradoxical motion of the interventricular septum, a swinging heart and an enlarged, non-pulsatile inferior vena cava, and also a reciprocal variation in ventricular size, trans-mitral and trans-tricuspid doppler-flow velocity paradoxus. However, these classic echocardiographic hallmarks of PT may be absent, particularly in the postoperative patient. The detection of only a small amount of pericardial fluid or the absence of any classical tamponade signs, does not exclude a hemodynamically relevant PT requiring immediate relief.

Imaging in suspected tamponade — modality selection and key echocardiographic findings are outlined: generally, echocardiography is used as the initial imaging in suspected tamponade, whereas computed tomography (CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) are used only for complicated cases; when cardiac tamponade is suspected, 2D echocardiography with Doppler should be obtained emergently because, regardless of effusion size, cardiac tamponade is potentially lethal; the most important findings are the presence of a PEff, a dilated IVC, hepatic venous signs of elevated systemic venous pressure, and a left ventricle with reduced diastolic and end-systolic dimensions with Doppler evidence of reduced stroke volume and cardiac output, with confirmatory "classic" Doppler signs including right heart diastolic chamber collapse when pericardial pressures exceed intracardiac pressure, inspiratory septal "bounce" into the left ventricle, and abnormal respiratory changes in Doppler flow velocities.

AF ablation — cardiac perforation and tamponade: We recommend that cardiac perforation and cardiac tamponade be defined together, and cardiac tamponade/perforation is defined as the development of a significant pericardial effusion during or within 30 days of undergoing an AF ablation procedure; a significant effusion results in hemodynamic compromise, requires elective or emergent pericardiocentesis, or results in a 1-cm or more pericardial effusion as documented by echocardiography, and this complication should be classified as early or late depending on whether it is diagnosed during hospitalization or following discharge.

### Challenges in the diagnosis and management of dry tamponade [^3aae0dc7]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Dry tamponade is a rare complication of percutaneous coronary intervention. It encompasses a heterogenous pathophysiology and is used to describe hemodynamic compromise secondary to a coronary artery perforation, without free-flowing fluid in the pericardium. Tamponade physiology can result from compressive epicardial, intramyocardial, subepicardial hematomas, or dissecting intramyocardial hematomas. The diagnosis of dry tamponade requires hemodynamic derangement in the context of a compressive hematoma as demonstrated by imaging. Although echocardiography can often help identify dry tamponade, additional studies including right heart catheterization, computed tomography, or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can inform the exact mechanism and help guide management. This article describes a case of dry tamponade, reviews the existing literature on the topic, and offers expert recommendations on diagnosis and management.

### Cardiac tamponade or normal respiratory variation? An illustrative case of septal ablation for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^2d056123]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiac tamponade can be a lethal complication in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are particularly vulnerable to the hemodynamic effects of tamponade because of their heightened sensitivity to ventricular load in the generation of forward stroke volume. Cardiac tamponade should be distinguished from the normal effects of respiration on dynamic outflow tract obstruction in these patients. This recognition not only ensures an accurate hemodynamic diagnosis, but it also will expedite timely therapy for patients in need.

### Delayed cardiac tamponade after open heart surgery-is supplemental CT imaging reasonable? [^cb7084c9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pericardial effusion is common in patients after open heart surgery due to postoperative bleeding or postcardiotomy syndrome. Hemodynamic relevant effusion following cardiac surgery leading to tamponade is a potentially life-treatening condition, therefore rapid diagnosis and therapy is essential. Echocardiography is the standard tool to fix diagnosis and assess compromised atrial and ventricular (un)loading. Featuring excellent sensitivity and specifity in patients without previous open heart surgery, postoperative imaging with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is affected by modified anatomy and other issues, i.e. mechanical ventilation. Correspondingly, detection of pericardial effusion in postoperative patients can be less sensitive, and transoesophageal assessment is required. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is fast and easy available in intensive care settings with ventilated patients after cardiac surgery, but represents a semi-invasive diagnostic tool, uncomfortable for spontanous breathing and not-sedated patients. Even if TEE has a high safety profile with low complication rates, an alternative diagnostic tool such as computer tomography (CT) imaging is a valuable option in patients not sufficiently assessed by TTE.

Hypothesizing that delayed and subacute cardiac tamponade is not detected sufficiently by transthoracic echocardiography in patients after open heart surgery, we evaluated patients with suspected non-acute pericardial effusion in regard to hemodynamic tamponade and need for intervention. Diagnostic value of transthoracic echocardiography was compared to thoracic CT scans in patients with suspected pericardial effusion postoperatively. Symptoms leading to cardiac tamponade as well as outcome of patients undergoing re-intervention are reported.

### Pericardial tamponade, a diagnostic chameleon: from the historical perspectives to contemporary management [^596ff351]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Until the development of modern imaging techniques, the diagnosis of pericardial effusion and tamponade was based on clinical diagnosis and several renowned physicians have contributed to the closer characterization of the typical clinical symptoms and signs and almost all important clinicians and pathological anatomists paid attention to pericardial diseases in the first half of the nineteenth century. The Austrian physician, Leopold von Auenbrugger (b. November 19, 1722, Graz; † May 18, 1809, Vienna), who first to introduced percussion in the medical examination in 1761, Joseph Leopold Auenbrugger, also described clinical signs of pericardial effusion ("Auenbrugger's signs"). The German internist and gastroenterologist Adolf Kussmaul (* 22.2.1822 Graben near Karlsruhe, † 20.5.1902 Heidelberg) described in 1873 three patients in whom the pulse disappeared completely at the height of inspiration while the heartbeat remained paradoxically palpable, calling this phenomenon "pulsus paradoxus". The term remains a clinical characteristic of cardiac tamponade to this day but is unfortunately used in an misleading manner. Pulsus paradoxus is actually an augmentation of the physiologic drop in systemic arterial blood pressure during inspiration, rather than, as it implies, a decrease when a rise would be normal. The term "cardiac tamponade" was coined in an 1884 treatise by the German surgeon Edmund Rose (October 10, 1836–May 31, 1914). He presented cases of fatal cardiac injury in which patients did not die from hemorrhage or from the extent of the injury itself, but primarily from compression of the heart by a relatively small amount of blood trapped in the pericardial cavity. In 1935, the American cardiac surgeon Claude Schaeffer Beck (November 8, 1894–October 14, 1971) described the combination of hypotension, an increased venous pressure, and a quiet heart classically associated with acute cardiac tamponade. They are collectively called "Beck's triad". Later studies have demonstrated however that these classic findings are seen in only a minority of patients with cardiac tamponade.

### Follow-up and treatment of idiopathic pericardial effusion… [^b01e92ba]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Patients were considered to have idiopathic pericardial effusion if they met all of the following criteria: the cause of pericardial effusion was undetermined after a complete medical evaluation, including examination of the pericardial fluid or tissue; the sum of the anterior and posterior echo-free spaces exceeded 20 mm at end diastole; the disease did not progress during the observation period; and the effusion persisted for more than three months. Cardiac tamponade was diagnosed if the systolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg, pulsus paradoxus was present and jugular venous pressure had increased. Patients with suspected idiopathic pericardial effusion were prospectively enrolled between 1977 and 1992. The clinical evaluation included a complete medical history, physical examination, electrocardiography, chest radiography and echocardiography; see the accompanying table for features of the laboratory evaluation.

Finally, sputum or gastric aspirates were evaluated for acid-fast bacilli. Patients underwent pericardiocentesis in the cardiac catheterization laboratory with subsequent chemical and bacteriologic evaluation of the pericardial fluid. If the pericardial effusion reappeared, a second pericardiocentesis was done. An anterior pericardiectomy was performed if the pericardial effusion reoccurred and lasted for more than six months. After the initial pericardiocentesis, patients were seen every three months for one year and then annually. Patients who became symptomatic were seen on an acute basis. Thirteen of the patients were initially asymptomatic, seven presented with atypical chest pain and seven were admitted to the hospital with overt cardiac tamponade. The duration of the effusions ranged from six months to 15 years. In all patients, the evaluation of pericardial fluid was normal or nondiagnostic.

Therefore, the authors believe that tuberculosis does not need to be aggressively ruled out in these patients. Pericardial drainage can effectively resolve the effusion in most cases; in this study, 42 percent of patients did not have an initial recurrence. Patients who are asymptomatic after initial evaluation could be followed with serial echocardiography; however, overt tamponade may occur unexpectedly. Thus, pericardiocentesis should be performed in most patients. Anterior pericardiectomy should be considered in patients with recurrence of fluid or those who develop symptoms of tamponade.

Conclusion

Cardiac tamponade as the initial presentation of cSLE is rare. More females than males presented in this way, and common co-existing findings included pleuritis and/or pleural effusion, hematologic abnormalities and low serum complement levels. Physicians must consider cSLE in the differential diagnosis of pericarditis and cardiac tamponade and perform appropriate testing for rheumatologic disease.

### Diagnosis… [^0b1a1a49]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

As previously noted, acute, rapid accumulation of fluid in the pericardium causes signs of acute hemodynamic compromise in cardiac tamponade. Patients with this condition develop tachycardia, hypotension, pulsus paradoxus, and distended neck veins. Although these patients appear to be in acute distress, their lungs are clear on auscultation. In cardiac tamponade, the ECG shows electrical alternans as the heart "floats" in relation to the recording leads. Chronic constrictive pericarditis presents with low voltage of the QRS complex and diffuse flattening or inversion of the T waves. Atrial fibrillation occurs in one third of patients with pericardial disease. DOPPLER STUDIES The diagnostic test of choice for large effusions, cardiac tamponade, and constrictive pericarditis is two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography. This imaging modality can demonstrate moderate or large effusions.

In cardiac tamponade, Doppler examination may show the characteristic swinging motion of the heart that gives rise to electrical alternans. Indications for hospitalization include elevated neck veins, tachycardia, hypotension, poor pain control, and elevated cardiac enzyme levels. Patients also should be hospitalized if they have pulsus paradoxus, electrical alternans on the ECG, or a large pericardial effusion. Patients with chronic, large pericardial effusion may be asymptomatic but can develop cardiac tamponade precipitously. Thus, pericardiocentesis is indicated, and pericardectomy should be performed if the effusion recurs after percutaneous drainage. 11 Pericardiocentesis is best performed in a controlled setting by an experienced physician. The patient is placed in a semirecumbent position. The pericardiocentesis needle is introduced into the subxiphoid angle and aimed toward the left shoulder.

Distally, the needle is attached to an ECG monitor. Detection of ST-segment elevation during the procedure suggests injury to the myocardium. In cardiac tamponade, emergency pericardiocentesis can be lifesaving, because drainage of even a small amount of fluid changes the volume-pressure relationship significantly. In certain situations, patients with cardiac tamponade or hemopericardium must go directly to surgery. Needle pericardiocentesis will exsanguinate patients with proximal aortic dissection or cardiac rupture. 3.

### Rapid fire: pericardial effusion and tamponade [^96ca2bfa]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

One of the most common causes of pericardial effusion in the Western world is malignancy. Emergency physicians must maintain vigilance in suspecting pericardial effusion and tamponade in patients with known or suspected malignancy who present with tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypotension. Diagnosis can be expedited by key physical examination, electrocardiogram, and sonographic findings. Unstable or crashing patients with tamponade must undergo emergent pericardiocentesis for removal of fluid and pressure to restore cardiac output.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Echocardiography — Right atrial (RA) and right ventricular (RV) diastolic chamber "collapse" on 2D imaging is usually seen in cardiac tamponade and is particularly important for low-pressure tamponade; the duration of RA collapse that exceeds one third of the cardiac cycle is nearly 100% sensitive and specific for clinical cardiac tamponade. RV diastolic collapse generally occurs with moderate pericardial pressure elevations when cardiac output has decreased by about 20%, initially seen only during inspiration and then throughout the respiratory cycle as tamponade worsens. The absence of any cardiac chamber collapse has a > 90% negative predictive value for clinical cardiac tamponade. Right heart diastolic collapse may occur only at higher pericardial pressures or not at all when right-sided chamber pressures were elevated beforehand, as with right ventricular hypertrophy, severe pulmonary hypertension, or coexisting severe left ventricular dysfunction.

Study End points and Definitions

The primary goal was to identify predictors of the composite adverse outcome (tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, failure of treatment, clinical recurrences, or death) in a large cohort of patients with acute pericarditis. Secondary aims were to provide an overview of the pericarditis causes and to compare clinical and laboratory profiles among subgroups (eg, with or without adverse outcomes).

Patients were identified as having an acute event if they met the 2015 ESC guideline criteria for acute pericarditis. A recurrent episode requires new signs and symptoms of pericardial inflammation after a symptom-free interval of 4 to 6 weeks. Subacute pericarditis was defined as an event developing in an interval from 6 weeks to 3 months. Constrictive pericarditis was defined by the development of hemodynamic diastolic impairment due to a chronic inflammation or thickening of the pericardium diagnosed at echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, or surgical biopsy. Tamponade was identified as a pericardial effusion, resulting in hemodynamic compromise, diagnosed with echocardiographic criteria. We considered failure of treatment as the persistence of symptoms regardless of antiinflammatory treatment for > 4–6 weeks. A severe pericardial effusion during an echocardiogram was defined as the presence of an echo-free space > 20 mm according to the classification of Imazio et aland Weitzman et al. Heart failure at presentation was defined as having signs and symptoms of volume overload, or the need to initiate treatment with a loop diuretic. Meeting any of the following constituted the composite end point of adverse outcomes ("composite outcome"): failure of treatment, recurrence of pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, or death.

Pericardiocentesis — indications, sequencing, and approach — states that "Pericardiocentesis is therapeutically performed in cases of impending or established cardiac tamponade, especially in urgent or emergency settings with echocardiography guidance, and diagnostically when there is concern for specific causes, such as bacterial, tuberculous, or malignant etiologies", while "In patients with an inflammatory pericardial effusion and no concern for tamponade, anti-inflammatory therapy should be pursued prior to pericardiocentesis". Approaches are outlined as "Anatomical approaches to pericardiocentesis include subxiphoid, apical, and parasternal. In an emergency, a subxiphoid or apical approach is preferred", with image guidance where "Echocardiography, fluoroscopy, and/or computed tomography may be utilized to guide the pericardiocentesis procedure", and escalation that "Surgical creation of a pericardial window is considered in select patients with recurrent large pericardial effusions and/or cardiac tamponade despite prior pericardiocentesis" and "In certain rare cases, radical pericardiectomy surgery may be indicated for recurrent pericardial effusions, even following the creation of a pericardial window, especially when there is concomitant medically refractory constrictive pericarditis or pericarditis".

Conclusion

CPE is a rare clinical condition with presentations ranging from asymptomatic to emergent cardiac tamponade. Literature on this topic largely comprises case reports. CPE management is complex and requires a multidisciplinary team. A subset of patients may fail medical therapy, thereby necessitating surgical intervention. While CPE mortality is low, morbidity associated with the disease is high. Therefore, sufficient consideration should be taken during diagnosis and management of patients.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^eb7e7ba8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pericardial effusion is a relatively common complication associated with inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases. The primary etiology of this condition could be considered when choosing therapeutic options and factors such as effusion size and its hemodynamic consequence. In most cases, small to moderate pericardial effusions can be managed with observation and anti-inflammatory medications unless the effusion develops rapidly. However, in a small proportion of patients, large effusions lead to impaired cardiac filling with hemodynamic compromise and cardiovascular collapse due to cardiac tamponade. The rate at which fluid accumulates is the primary determinant of hemodynamic impact and thus guides the choice of treatment, irrespective of the effusion's size. Severe cases are typically treated with pericardiocentesis with echocardiographic guidance. More aggressive treatments may be necessary for cases due to purulent or malignant etiologies. These cases may require a pericardial window to allow for long-term drainage of the pericardial fluid. This comprehensive review focuses on the epidemiology of pericardial effusion and discusses pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic options for different causes of secondary pericardial effusions.

Cardiac tamponade is defined as an accumulation of fluid within the pericardial sac that is large enough to impair the diastolic filling of the ventricles. There are numerous causes, including cardiac disease, malignancy, and trauma (penetrating, blunt, and iatrogenic). With increasing complexity of percutaneous endovascular interventions, interventional radiologists must learn to recognize the preexisting and iatrogenic presence of cardiac tamponade during procedures and be familiar with its treatment. Two cases of pericardial tamponade complicating central venous interventions are described. In addition, the clinical condition is discussed and its diagnosis and treatment are reviewed.

Pericardial disease in oncology — imaging approach and diagnostic priorities: Pericardial disease in oncologic patients is relatively common and may be secondary to cardiac metastasis or a consequence of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Transthoracic echocardiography is the method of choice for the initial evaluation of suspected pericardial disease; in most cases, it allows not only diagnosis but also guidance of pericardiocentesis. Echocardiographic findings in pericarditis can be entirely normal or show pericardial effusion, and the pericardial effusion should be quantified and graded according to recognized methods to allow comparison in subsequent evaluations. Evaluation of cardiac tamponade should be performed according to published guidelines, and echocardiographic signs of constriction should be explored according to published guidelines. Additional imaging such as computed tomography or CMR can complement echocardiography, and CMR is particularly useful for late gadolinium enhancement to identify transient constriction that may benefit from aggressive anti-inflammatory regimens rather than pericardiectomy. CMR should be considered in evaluation of primary tumors of the heart with or without compromise of the pericardium or when the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis remains uncertain after a careful echocardiographic evaluation.

Cardiac tamponade

When the intrapericardial pressure exceeds right heart filling pressure (diastole), impaired filling of the chambers results in tamponade. A pericardial effusion is usually readily identified by echo, although size is no guide to the presence of tamponade. Fluid in the pericardial space is generally easy to differentiate from a pericardial fat pad or a pleural effusion. The crucial echo findings in RACE establishing the presence of tamponade and the need for rapid drainage are either right atrial wall systolic collapse for longer than one-third of the cardiac cycle, right ventricular wall diastolic collapse, and a dilated IVC.

Doppler interrogation across the valves by the advanced user can be used for added diagnostic support. Normal respiratory variation results in an increase of tricuspid flow during inspiration and decrease during expiration with reciprocal changes occurring with mitral valve flow. Increases in peak tricuspid velocity are usually < 25% and peak mitral velocity < 15%, whereas with tamponade the variation is much greater.

Echo is the investigation of choice in suspected cardiac tamponade, with the diagnosis generally easy to make when aligned with clinical findings. It also assists with urgent pericardiocentesis.

Dynamic LVOT obstruction

The true incidence of dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction in critically ill patients is unknown. It requires advanced echo Doppler expertise and in the past has usually gone unrecognized. Left ventricular wall hypertrophy classically has alerted the clinician to the possibility of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and searching for LVOT obstruction would be seen as standard practice.

Dynamic LVOT obstruction can be present in the aged ambulatory population in the absence of wall hypertrophy. Factors that make the critically ill population more susceptible, apart from age, include tachycardia, hypovolemia, and inotropes. 2D echo examination reveals close approximation of lateral wall and septum, plus systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet. TEE examination often supplements the TTE approach. Color Doppler will reveal turbulent flow through the LVOT with continuous wave Doppler picking up high velocities indicating obstructive and subsequent pulsed-wave Doppler identifying exactly where that obstruction occurs. A classic spectral Doppler pattern is the so‐called "dagger" shape LVOT flow. Treatment includes re‐establishing an adequate intravascular volume, reducing heart rate to enhance diastolic filling time, and ceasing inotropes (Fig. 4).

### Variations in current clinical practice of postoperative pericardial effusion: a questionnaire study [^467fe174]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative pericardial effusion (PPE) is an excess amount of fluid in the pericardial space and is encountered in 3%–64% of patients after cardiac surgery. This incidence varies widely due to some studies reporting all effusion, while most only report symptomatic collections. Typically, PPE is observed by clinically indicated or routine transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and can either resolve over time or progress into cardiac tamponade requiring intervention. This potentially lethal condition frequently necessitates urgent and invasive treatment, elongates hospital stay and is associated with increased mortality.

However, detection of PPE or even cardiac tamponade after cardiac surgery can be challenging. Classical symptoms of cardiac tamponade (like dyspnoea, malaise, dizziness and fatigue) can be frequently obscured or coincide with transient complaints during regular postoperative recovery. Additionally, some patients lack typical signs of cardiac tamponade or even stay asymptomatic. Previous studies have reported an asymptomatic clinical course in up to 66% of the patients with an echocardiographically diagnosed late cardiac tamponade eventually requiring drainage. Unfortunately, echocardiographic signs to predict tamponade have not been validated extensively, especially regarding loculated effusions. Also, there is no clear relationship between the clinical manifestation of PPE and the amount seen on TTE. As such, large-sized PPE can occur on routine echocardiography without clinical symptoms and echocardiographic signs of tamponade, especially when developing gradually. It is therefore a matter of debate whether to drain asymptomatic effusions or treat them conservatively.

When symptomatic PPE has been identified, varying strategies exist regarding its treatment. There is general consensus to perform surgical re-exploration for early-onset tamponades (within 24–48 hours postoperatively). However, there is increasing evidence suggesting the outcome of percutaneous evacuation is comparable with that of surgical approaches for subacute and late-onset tamponades.

This ambiguity in the manifestation of PPE and corresponding management can result in challenging decision making. Unfortunately, no guidelines are available on this subject, possibly leading to unwarranted care variations in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the preferred clinical management of PPE and evaluate variation between centres and clinicians in the Netherlands. We hypothesised that contemporary management differs widely between healthcare professionals and between centres.

We report 2 cases of localized pericardial tamponade occurring soon after cardiac surgery, in which the diagnosis could not be made with transthoracic echocardiography. Computed tomography and transesophageal echocardiography, respectively, were necessary, and this underlies the importance of alternative imaging modalities when this condition is suspected. A high index of suspicion is crucial for reaching the correct diagnosis.

Focused cardiac ultrasound — pericardial effusion evaluation notes that studies have shown a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in the detection of pericardial effusions in both medical and trauma patients using FOCUS, and imaging in multiple views or windows provides the most accurate detection of pericardial effusion; pericardial tamponade is a clinical diagnosis that includes the visualization of pericardial fluid, blood, or thrombus, in addition to clinical signs including hypotension, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, and distended neck veins; when small or focal effusions are difficult to recognize with FOCUS, a comprehensive echocardiogram or other diagnostic imaging testing is indicated whenever the clinical suspicion for the presence of effusion is high and the FOCUS could not demonstrate it; when emergency pericardiocentesis is indicated, ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis in the critically ill patients has been shown to have fewer complications and a higher success rate than if done without ultrasound guidance, and injection of agitated saline may be helpful in localizing needle placement during this procedure.

Pericardial disease in oncologic patients — Pericardial disease can be associated with cardiac metastasis or be a consequence of chemotherapy/radiotherapy, and pericardial effusion should be quantified and graded according to standard methods. Echocardiographic and Doppler signs of cardiac tamponade should be investigated, particularly in malignant effusions, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) should be considered for primary tumors of the heart with or without pericardial compromise or when constrictive pericarditis remains uncertain after careful echocardiographic evaluation.

Cardiac tamponade — right atrial and right ventricular chamber indentation or collapse on subcostal imaging occurs during relaxation when chamber pressure is lowest and transiently falls below pericardial pressure; atrial indentation occurs near the top of the QRS complex, whereas right ventricular indentation occurs in early diastole.

Tamponade in LVAD patients — Clinically, pericardial or thoracic cavity tamponade may mimic RV failure and result in a low-flow alarm. Because the LVAD is generally the primary determinant of mitral inflow and significantly influences outflow, there may not be an exaggerated flow paradox across any valves despite increased intracardiac pressure in cases of tamponade. Therefore, clinical suspicion of tamponade should be high if pericardial effusion or a suspected hematoma is visualized in conjunction with low-flow alarms and small LV and/or RV chambers; in these scenarios, the RVOT cardiac output will be decreased and will fail to vary as expected with pump speed changes.

Cardiac tamponade — two-dimensional imaging demonstrates large pericardial effusion with right atrial systolic collapse, which may occur in diastole or systole and whose longer duration during the cardiac cycle increases specificity for tamponade; in the apical four-chamber view the largest collection (~5 cm) of fluid is at the apex and pericardiocentesis can be performed from this approach, while a subcostal view shows RV dC and helps gauge effusion size and the distance from the transducer and liver when considering pericardiocentesis using the subxiphoid approach.

### Pericardium: the forgotten space during acute myocardial infarction [^5cfa7ffe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute pericardial pathologies, such as pericardial effusion, pericarditis, and cardiac tamponade, have been reported rarely in patients presenting as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We present a series of 3 patients with STEMI, where an undiagnosed pericardial effusion led to pericardial tamponade and subsequent cardiocirculatory collapse.

Case Reports

This is a case series of 3 patients, all women, aged 72, 64, and 54 years who presented to the emergency department with chest pain or syncope and were found to have STEMI with hemodynamic instability. They were taken to the catheterization laboratory for urgent coronary revascularization requiring mechanical circulatory support (intra-aortic balloon pump or impella). During catheterization, all 3 patients were diagnosed with large pericardial effusion using hemodynamic parameters and bedside transesophageal echocardiogram. Commonly ignored, pericardial tamponade and acute large pericardial effusion can be the cause of cardiocirculatory collapse. Two of the 3 patients survived with aggressive interventions requiring pericardial drains, long-term mechanical circulatory support, and effective postoperative rehabilitation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? It is important for treating clinicians, including emergency physicians, intensivist, and cardiologist, to consider the differential of a cardiac tamponade due to a pericardial effusion as a potential cause for hypotension in patients with an acute STEMI.

Cardiac tamponade — subcostal inferior vena cava (IVC) findings show a dilated IVC measuring 2.5 cm, with M‑mode used to calculate inspiratory reduction; in tamponade the inspiratory decrease in IVC diameter is characteristically < 50% and is often minimal, and dilation of the hepatic veins is noted.

Echocardiography — An inspiratory bulge or "bounce" of the interventricular septum into the left ventricle on 2D imaging is a common tamponade finding corresponding to reciprocating RV and LV dimensions on M-mode, characterized by increased RV dimension and decreased LV dimension due to septal movement toward the LV free wall. Unlike the normal situation, in which left-sided filling changes minimally during normal inspiration (< 5%), left heart filling decreases abnormally in cardiac tamponade, producing reduced stroke volume and pulsus paradoxus. This inspiratory septal bulge or "bounce" is not specific for cardiac tamponade and can also be seen with marked dyspnea due to metabolic disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary embolism.

### Cardiac tamponade as a manifestation of severe dermatomyositis [^047a7adb]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

In connective tissue disorders, the incidence of pericardial disease and pericardial effusion can be up to 58%, and if untreated, it can lead to cardiac tamponade which can be fatal. Physicians must have a high index of suspicion for this disease as diagnosis can be delayed while evaluating more common causes of tachycardia and hypotension in the immunosuppressed (ie, sepsis). We present a 55-year-old woman with a severe case of dermatomyositis, marked by significant weight loss, a bedridden state and hallmark cutaneous findings. On evaluation of interstitial lung disease, a pericardial effusion was incidentally noted. Serial examination revealed increasing fluid accumulation and progressive tachycardia, and diagnosis of cardiac tamponade was made on echocardiography. After initial pericardiocentesis, the effusion rapidly re-accumulated requiring a pericardial window. In severe presentations of rheumatic disease, cardiac tamponade should be considered as a cause of tachycardia, with or without associated hypotension.

Echocardiography in myopericarditis and pericarditis is characterized by possible segmental left ventricular wall hypokinesis suggesting myocardial involvement, and pericarditis may show increased pericardial brightness or pericardial effusion with or without tamponade physiology, although some patients may have normal echocardiographic findings.

Echocardiography may also identify pericardial effusions, while simultaneously evaluating for hemodynamic effects (ie, tamponade), and guiding management and intervention. Pericardial effusions appear as an echo-free space, darker than pericardial fat, and external to the myocardium but anterior to the descending aorta. Although tamponade is a clinical diagnosis, echocardiographic features include diastolic dysfunction, dilated (noncollapsing) inferior vena cava (IVC), exaggerated respiratory variation of mitral and tricuspid valve E-wave inflows (> 30% and > 60%, respectively), and chamber collapse. Right atrial chamber inversion duration of > 1/3 of the cardiac cycle has 100% specificity and 94% sensitivity of 94% for tamponade, with right ventricular (RV) diastolic inversion having lower accuracy. The pattern of impaired diastolic ventricular filling also differs between tamponade and constrictive pericarditis, with filling impaired throughout diastole in the former and predominantly early in diastole in the latter.

CMR has greater diagnostic sensitivity than echocardiography for identifying pericarditis, and so should be considered when clinical signs are suggestive but echocardiography is normal.CMR is also able to assess physiology and identify acute inflammation, protocols should be comprehensive in order to assess both the pericardial thickening, the physiological effects and perform tissue characterisation for identifying inflammation and calcification. Black-blood T1 weighted turbo spin echo imaging with the addition of a fat-saturation prepulse permits differentiation of pericardial fat from the thickened pericardium, allowing accurate pericardial measurement. T2-weighted imaging using the short-tau inversion-recovery sequence highlights areas of increased free water seen with inflammatory edema; hence, increased pericardial signal is seen with acute pericarditis. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging will identify edema and fibrosis, common with acute pericarditis. Recently, a criterion for grading the severity of pericardial disease based on LGE has been proposed, although this has not been validated in the context of radiotherapy. Real-time gradient echo cine imaging during deep free breathing in the 4-chamber view and mid-short axis slices can assess for ventricular interdependence, with ventricular septal shift towards the LV on inspiration suggestive of constrictive physiology (Figure 5). Assessing for concomitant myocarditis with T2 short-tau inversion-recovery, T2 mapping, and LGE imaging should also be performed, with diagnosis made according to the Lake Louise Criteria.

### Usefulness of oximetry paradoxus to diagnose cardiac tamponade [^fc648769]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Although echocardiography is usually diagnostic of cardiac tamponade, it may not be readily available at the point-of-care. We sought to develop and validate a measurement of respirophasic variation in the amplitude of pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveforms as a diagnostic tool for cardiac tamponade. Pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveforms were recorded, and the ratio of maximum-to-minimum measured amplitude of these waveforms from one respiratory cycle was calculated by blinded observers. Ratios from 3 consecutive respiratory cycles were then averaged to derive an "oximetry paradoxus" ratio. Cardiac tamponade was independently confirmed or excluded according to a "blinded" objective interpretation of echocardiography or right heart catheterization. Seventy four subjects were enrolled (51% men; mean age 54 ± 15 years); 19 of whom had cardiac tamponade. Oximetry paradoxus area under the curve for diagnosis of cardiac tamponade was 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.84 to 0.97); its diagnostic performance was superior to sphygmomanometer-measured pulsus paradoxus (area under the curve difference = 0.16, p = 0.022). In a derivation cohort (n = 37; tamponade, 9 cases), 3 diagnostic oximetry paradoxus thresholds were identified and validated in an independent validation cohort (n = 37; tamponade, 10 cases): 1.2 (100% sensitivity, 44% specificity), 1.5 (80% sensitivity, 81% specificity), and 1.7 (80% sensitivity, 89% specificity). Furthermore, oximetry paradoxus was significantly reduced after draining pericardial fluid. In conclusion, we defined and validated oximetry paradoxus as a simple and ubiquitous point-of-care test to diagnose cardiac tamponade using respirophasic changes in pulse plethysmography waveforms. This test can aid in identifying patients with cardiac tamponade, thus expediting confirmatory testing and life-saving treatment.

Cardiac arrest

The most extreme presentation of cardiogenic shock is cardiac arrest. International evidence-based guidelines recommend the use of echocardiography to diagnose or exclude some of the causes of arrest. However, echocardiography should not affect the delivery of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and specific training in advanced cardiovascular life support is required, even for experienced practitioners. As images are obtained and recorded only during the pulse/rhythm check, studies performed during cardiac arrest are strictly time-limited, and therefore are dissimilar to comprehensive studies that use only focused 2D imaging aimed at diagnosis or exclusion of potentially reversible causes in a simple, binary manner. The pathology leading to arrest is likely to be extreme (tamponade, massive pulmonary embolism, severe LV and/or RV dysfunction, myocardial infarction/ischaemia, hypovolaemia, or tension pneumothorax) and fairly easy to diagnose without more sophisticated echocardiographic techniques. Whether the use of echocardiography in cardiac arrest (and as part of care after resuscitation) can improve outcomes is unknown, but its application in the prehospital setting has been found to change management strategies in up to 60% of patients.

Cardiac tamponade — roles of computed tomography (CT), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and additional imaging are as follows: "Two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler is the test of choice for suspected cardiac tamponade." "Neither cardiac CT nor CMR has a role in life-threatening acute cardiac tamponade requiring urgent pericardiocentesis," though CT may help when subacute tamponade is due to a loculated or complex effusion to determine feasibility of percutaneous versus surgical drainage. CT signs include a "flattened heart," septal angulation/bowing, dynamic visualization of abnormal interventricular septal motion and chamber collapse, and indirect findings such as superior vena cava and inferior vena cava enlargement with the IVC diameter "greater than twice that of the adjacent abdominal aorta," reflux of contrast into the IVC or azygos vein, and enlargement of hepatic and renal veins. On CMR, imminent tamponade has been documented incidentally with diastolic chamber collapse, and dynamic MR may show a "swinging heart" and inspiratory septal bounce. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) "may be useful in the postoperative or postcardiotomy setting to assess regional tamponade."

### Role of a 12-lead electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade as diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography in patients with malignant pericardial effusion [^a6e6495d]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies have looked at the utility of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in diagnosing cardiac tamponade in malignant pericardial effusion (PE). The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 12-lead ECG in diagnosing cardiac tamponade in PE.

Hypothesis

Abnormalities on a 12 lead ECG can be used to diagnose or exclude cardiac tamponade in patients with malignant PE.

Methods

Using echocardiography as the gold standard for diagnosis of cardiac tamponade, we determined the Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV for individual and combinations of the 3 ECG abnormalities (low-voltage complexes, electrical alternans, and sinus tachycardia).

Results

For PEs of all sizes, the Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV for detecting cardiac tamponade were: low-voltage complexes (56%, 74%, 81%, 46%), electrical alternans (23%, 98%, 95%, 39%), and sinus tachycardia (76%, 60%, 79%, 56%), respectively. Presence of all 3 and any of the 3 ECG abnormalities had a Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV of 8%, 100%, 100%, 36% and 89%, 47%, 77%, 69%, respectively, for cardiac tamponade. The odds ratios for cardiac tamponade in PE were 3.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.65–8.30) for low-voltage complexes, 12.3 (95% CI: 1.58–95.17) for electrical alternans, and 4.9 (95% CI: 2.22–10.80) for sinus tachycardia. Presence of any of 3 ECG abnormalities had an odds ratio of 7.3 (95% CI: 2.9–18.1) for cardiac tamponade.

Conclusions

In malignant PE, combination of ECG abnormalities can supplement clinical examination in the diagnosis of echocardiographic cardiac tamponade. Due to its low NPV, 12-lead ECG cannot be used as a screening tool to exclude cardiac tamponade with malignant PE.
