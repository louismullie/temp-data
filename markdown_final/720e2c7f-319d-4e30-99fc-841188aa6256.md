---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the definition, pathophysiology, clinical course, risk factors, and prognosis of heat-related illness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching definition and classification framework. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology from thermoregulatory failure to multiorgan injury. Next, I will examine the clinical course across the severity spectrum. After that, I need to stratify risk factors by modifiability and evidence strength. Finally, I will appraise prognosis and return-to-activity principles, making sure to double-check areas where temperature thresholds and diagnostic criteria are commonly misapplied.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't anchor on outdated thresholds. Heat-related illness is a continuum from minor entities like heat edema and heat cramps to life-threatening heat stroke, with heat exhaustion as an intermediate syndrome; heat stroke is defined by core temperature typically at or above 40°C with central nervous system dysfunction, and is subclassified into classic (nonexertional) and exertional forms, though I should note that relying solely on a numeric temperature cut-off is problematic because athletes may be hyperthermic without CNS impairment, so CNS dysfunction plus hyperthermia is the key diagnostic signal rather than temperature alone [^116ZZ8UL] [^11359QL1] [^116SjYNd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about temperature measurement either. I need to ensure we use rectal temperature as the gold standard for core assessment because peripheral and tympanic measures are unreliable in heat stroke, and I should double-check that empiric active cooling should start immediately when heat stroke is suspected even if the exact core temperature is unknown or below 40°C, because time is tissue and delays worsen outcomes [^114CfXTX] [^111AKQz1] [^114Uk5ij].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology and make sure I capture both the thermoregulatory and systemic inflammatory arms. Initially, heat production outpaces dissipation, core temperature rises, and cardiovascular compensatory mechanisms redistribute blood flow to the skin while reducing splanchnic and renal perfusion; as hyperthermia persists, endothelial injury, systemic inflammatory response, and coagulopathy emerge, culminatingating in multiorgan dysfunction including liver, kidney, brain, and cardiovascular systems, with direct cytotoxicity and protein denaturation contributing to organ failure [^116ZZ8UL] [^112CrYzE] [^112fPGv8].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical course across the spectrum so I don't overgeneralize. Minor forms such as heat edema, heat cramps, and heat syncope are generally self-limited and respond to rest, hydration, and simple measures, whereas heat exhaustion presents with inability to continue activity, fatigue, thirst, dizziness, and core temperature that may be normal or mildly elevated but less than 40°C; if unrecognized or untreated, heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke, which features marked hyperthermia with CNS changes and multiorgan involvement, requiring aggressive cooling and supportive care [^113jbNZE] [^1156dCaX] [^114uJVZC].

> I should confirm the risk factor taxonomy and distinguish modifiable from nonmodifiable elements. Environmental contributors include high ambient temperature and humidity, solar load, and lack of wind, with wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) as the preferred metric for risk assessment; individual factors include age extremes, low fitness, inadequate acclimatization, high BMI, chronic disease, and prior heat injury; medication and substance risks include diuretics, anticholinergics, beta-blockers, stimulants, and alcohol; behavioral and organizational pressures to perform without adequate acclimatization also amplify risk, and importantly, a history of heat illness confers a several-fold increased risk of recurrence in the ensuing years [^113EFFQx] [^117T86NR] [^114KFW37] [^1175CQm3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to cite a 27% mortality figure for exertional heat stroke broadly, but I should double-check the context. That high mortality estimate comes from a specific cohort and is not representative of all settings, whereas contemporary large-scale summaries report overall case fatality near 5% with markedly higher mortality in classic heat stroke and when hypotension is present, so I need to correct that overstatement and align with population-level data and guideline summaries [^112CrYzE] [^116WcJ9x] [^116ZZ8UL].

> Let me consider prognosis and recovery timelines carefully. Rapid, on-site cooling within about 30 minutes is consistently associated with excellent outcomes, whereas delays increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, hepatic failure, coagulopathy, and persistent neurologic deficits; survivors may face long-term cardiovascular and neurologic sequelae, and recovery can be complicated by persistent heat intolerance that may be temporary or prolonged, necessitating staged, supervised return to activity with objective reassessment of organ function and heat tolerance [^114uJVZC] [^116ZZ8UL] [^11347MqK] [^116dzgAX].

> I should confirm return-to-activity principles and the role of heat tolerance testing. After exertional heat stroke, hold activity for at least 7 days after medical clearance, then progress gradually over 2 to 4 weeks with acclimatization and monitoring. If heat tolerance fails to normalize within 4 to 6 weeks, consider formal heat tolerance testing in a controlled setting, and ensure that organ-specific labs have normalized before advancing intensity, recognizing that muscle and liver markers may remain elevated for days to weeks after the acute event [^114sxouC] [^111CVViH] [^116J4kjU].

> But wait, what if the patient collapses and we're unsure whether this is heat stroke or benign exercise-associated collapse? I need to ensure we don't delay cooling. Collapse with altered mental status in a hot environment warrants empiric active cooling while obtaining a rectal temperature, because relying on a specific core temperature threshold can miss or delay treatment; similarly, in suspected heat stroke, prioritize high-efficacy cooling methods such as ice-water or cold-water immersion and avoid first-line use of low-yield devices like cooling blankets or endovascular systems when faster modalities are available [^111AKQz1] [^116QoYnC] [^111P57zb].

> Finally, I should review prevention and risk mitigation so the clinical framing is actionable. Use WBGT to guide activity modification, implement a 10 to 14 day heat acclimatization protocol, maintain euhydration with drink-to-thirst strategies to avoid excessive fluid loss, screen for high-risk medications and comorbidities, and employ work-rest cycles matched to metabolic load and environment. These measures reduce incidence and severity across athletic, occupational, and military settings and are emphasized in contemporary guidelines [^113EFFQx] [^111U7eJA] [^112asq24] [^113LLtgE].

Heat-related illness is a **preventable spectrum** of conditions caused by heat stress, ranging from mild (heat cramps, heat exhaustion) to life-threatening heat stroke. Heat stroke is defined by **core temperature ≥ 40°C with CNS dysfunction** and requires immediate rapid cooling to prevent multiorgan failure and death [^112VCsRA] [^116QoYnC]. Risk increases with high heat/humidity, exertion, dehydration, obesity, older age, chronic disease, and certain medications; prognosis depends on rapid cooling and organ support, with mortality up to 10–33% if delayed or complicated [^115vD9jR] [^117T86NR].

---

## Definition and classification

Heat-related illness spans a **spectrum of severity**, with heat stroke as the most severe form:

| **Category** | **Definition and clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Heat cramps | - Painful muscle spasms <br/> - Associated with exertion and electrolyte loss [^113jbNZE] |
| Heat exhaustion | - Mild-to-moderate illness <br/> - Core temp < 40°C <br/> - Fatigue, dizziness, nausea, headache <br/> - No CNS dysfunction [^11359QL1] |
| Heat stroke | - Severe illness <br/> - Core temp ≥ 40°C with CNS dysfunction (delirium, seizures, coma) [^112VCsRA] |

---

Heat stroke has two forms: **classic (non-exertional)** — passive exposure to extreme heat, common in older adults and those with chronic illness — and **exertional** — vigorous activity in hot environments, often in younger, healthy individuals [^116ZZ8UL].

---

## Pathophysiology

Heat-related illness arises from a **failure of thermoregulation**, driven by environmental heat load, metabolic heat production, and impaired heat dissipation [^112fPGv8]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Thermoregulatory failure**: Inability to dissipate heat leads to hyperthermia and cellular injury [^112SEcMJ].
- **Systemic inflammatory response**: Cytokine release and endothelial injury cause multiorgan dysfunction [^116pzSGV].
- **Coagulopathy**: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is common and worsens organ failure [^116pzSGV].
- **Direct cellular injury**: Heat denatures proteins, disrupts membranes, and causes oxidative stress [^notfound].

---

## Clinical course

The **clinical course** varies by severity:

- **Mild forms**: Heat cramps and exhaustion present with fatigue, thirst, dizziness, and muscle cramps; core temperature is normal or mildly elevated [^113jbNZE].
- **Heat stroke**: Rapid progression to CNS dysfunction, hypotension, tachycardia, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hepatic injury, and respiratory distress [^112VCsRA].
- **Recovery**: With prompt cooling and supportive care, most recover fully; delays increase risk of permanent neurologic injury or death [^116dzgAX].

---

## Risk factors

Risk factors are **multifactorial** and include:

- **Environmental**: High temperature/humidity, heat waves, lack of acclimatization [^116WcJ9x].
- **Individual**: Age (older adults, children), obesity, poor fitness, chronic illness (cardiovascular, diabetes, renal), dehydration [^116WcJ9x].
- **Medications**: Diuretics, anticholinergics, beta-blockers, stimulants, antidepressants [^116WcJ9x].
- **Behavioral**: Intense exertion, inadequate hydration, alcohol use, protective equipment [^116WcJ9x].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on **severity, comorbidities, and timeliness of care**:

- **Mild forms**: Excellent with supportive care; rare sequelae [^114uJVZC].
- **Heat stroke**: Mortality 10–33% if cooling is delayed or complications occur; rapid cooling within 30 minutes improves outcomes [^114uJVZC] [^115vD9jR].
- **Long-term sequelae**: Neurologic deficits, renal dysfunction, hepatic injury, and increased recurrence risk [^116ZZ8UL].

---

Heat-related illness spans mild to life-threatening forms; **rapid recognition and cooling are critical** to prevent morbidity and mortality, and prognosis hinges on prompt, aggressive management [^112SEcMJ].

Exertional heat stroke (EHS) recurrence risk and multiple-hit factors — Athletes with an EHS episode are at higher risk for a subsequent event. In an 11.4-km warm-hot weather road race, the relative risk of a second EHS was 3.3 in the 2 years following the initial episode and the relative risk dropped to 1.3 in the 3 to 5 years following the episode based on a total of 333 EHS patients among 174,853 finishers. Studies of French and U.S. military personnel show an association between hospitalization for EHS following a previous episode, and among active-duty soldiers, those with a prior serious exertional heat illness (EHI) event had four-fold greater odds of experiencing a mild EHI event and those with a prior mild EHI had a 1.8-fold greater risk of having a serious EHI event at a future date. An important risk factor for EHS is extrinsic pressure to perform beyond the level of acclimatization or fitness, leadership plays an important role in the evolution and prevention of EHI and EHS, and the presence of a predisposing factor on a particular day increases the risk of heat stroke in subsequent days and sets up the "multiple-hit hypothesis".

The following constitutes key background information on burn injury:

- **Definition**: Burn injuries are defined as damage to the skin or other body tissues caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, or radiation.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of burn injuries involves the destruction of skin layers, which triggers an immune and inflammatory response, metabolic changes, and potentially distributive shock.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of burn injury in the US is estimated at 140 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: The risk factors for burn injuries include self-inflicted injuries or abuse/neglect, lack of social support resources, inadequate housing and food resources, and substance use disorders, including alcohol.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, burn injuries present with redness, blistering, and skin damage. The severity of these symptoms can vary depending on the depth and extent of the burn. Superficial burns may only cause redness and pain, while deeper burns can lead to blistering, skin necrosis, and even systemic symptoms such as shock.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of burn injuries can vary widely, depending on factors such as the severity and extent of the burn, the patient's overall health, and the presence of complications. Burns involving a large percentage of the body surface area or those that result in inhalation injury can have a poor prognosis.

### ACSM expert consensus statement on exertional heat illness: recognition, management, and return to activity [^112fPGv8]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

Exertional heat illness (EHI) definition and pathophysiology — EHI is characterized by organ damage and dysfunction in the presence of hyperthermia without central nervous system changes seen in exertional heat stroke (EHS), may follow delayed recognition and/or inadequate cooling of EHS, and can lead to dysfunction that may persist for several weeks; during exercise in the heat, cardiac output is increased to support high skin and muscle blood flow at the expense of renal and splanchnic blood flow, and when compensatory responses are insufficient, skin, muscle, and even brain blood flow are compromised; as ambient temperature rises, sweating increases and sweat evaporation becomes the primary heat transfer mechanism, and unreplaced sweating fluid losses reduce plasma volume, elevate physiological strain, impair work capabilities, and increase the risk of exertional heat illness; more severe illness can result in liver or kidney failure requiring organ transplantation for survival.

Environmental considerations and monitoring — The body exchanges heat with the environment via conduction, evaporation, thermal radiation, and convection, and as environmental temperature increases evaporation becomes the only cooling mechanism; the vaporization of 1.7 mL of sweat consumes 1 cal of heat, but evaporative cooling is less effective in highly humid environments. The wet-bulb globe temperature index (WBGT) is a composite index of temperature, humidity, and solar radiation that expresses total thermal strain, and WBGT should be used for the assessment of heat risk (1A).

### Heat-related illness [^112SEcMJ]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Heat-related illness is a set of preventable conditions ranging from mild forms (e.g., heat exhaustion, heat cramps) to potentially fatal heat stroke. Hot and humid conditions challenge cardiovascular compensatory mechanisms. Once core temperature reaches 104°F (40°C), cellular damage occurs, initiating a cascade of events that may lead to organ failure and death. Early recognition of symptoms and accurate measurement of core temperature are crucial to rapid diagnosis. Milder forms of heat-related illness are manifested by symptoms such as headache, weakness, dizziness, and an inability to continue activity. These are managed by supportive measures including hydration and moving the patient to a cool place. Hyperthermia and central nervous system symptoms should prompt an evaluation for heat stroke. Initial treatments should focus on lowering core temperature through cold water immersion. Applying ice packs to the head, neck, axilla, and groin is an alternative. Additional measures include transporting the patient to a cool environment, removing excess clothing, and intravenous hydration. Delayed access to cooling is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with heat stroke. Identification of at-risk groups can help physicians and community health agencies provide preventive measures.

### Management of heat-related illness and injury in the ICU: a concise definitive review [^1139c6TX]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The increasing frequency of extreme heat events has led to a growing number of heat-related injuries and illnesses in ICUs. The objective of this review was to summarize and critically appraise evidence for the management of heat-related illnesses and injuries for critical care multiprofessionals.

Data Sources

Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched from inception through August 2023 for studies reporting on heat-related injury and illness in the setting of the ICU.

Study Selection

English-language systematic reviews, narrative reviews, meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, and observational studies were prioritized for review. Bibliographies from retrieved articles were scanned for articles that may have been missed.

Data Extraction

Data regarding study methodology, patient population, management strategy, and clinical outcomes were qualitatively assessed.

Data Synthesis

Several risk factors and prognostic indicators for patients diagnosed with heat-related illness and injury have been identified and reported in the literature. Effective management of these patients has included various cooling methods and fluid replenishment. Drug therapy is not effective. Multiple organ dysfunction, neurologic injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation are common complications of heat stroke and must be managed accordingly. Burn injury from contact with hot surfaces or pavement can occur, requiring careful evaluation and possible excision and grafting in severe cases.

Conclusions

The prevalence of heat-related illness and injury is increasing, and rapid initiation of appropriate therapies is necessary to optimize outcomes. Additional research is needed to identify effective methods and strategies to achieve rapid cooling, the role of immunomodulators and anticoagulant medications, the use of biomarkers to identify organ failure, and the role of artificial intelligence and precision medicine.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of heat illness: 2019 update [^1156dCaX]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Heat illness definitions — 2019 Wilderness Medical Society guidelines categorize hyperthermia, heat edema, heat cramps, heat syncope, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke with explicit features and temperature thresholds. Heat exhaustion is defined as mild to moderate illness due to high environmental heat or strenuous exercise with symptoms including intense thirst, weakness, discomfort, anxiety, dizziness, and syncope; core temperature may be normal or slightly elevated > 37°C (98.6°F) but < 40°C (104°F). It results from exposure to high ambient temperature or strenuous exertion and may progress to heat stroke in a hot environment if untreated. Heat stroke is severe heat illness characterized by a core temperature > 40°C (104°F) with central nervous system abnormalities and is traditionally defined as a core temperature above 40°C (104°F) with central nervous system involvement; it is divided into classic heat stroke from passive heat exposure and exertional heat stroke during strenuous exercise. The guideline cautions that absolute temperature thresholds should not be routinely applied to asymptomatic individuals because studies of asymptomatic runners found 15 to 56% with core temperatures ≥ 40°C and 11% ≥ 42°C. Additional category definitions include hyperthermia as a rise in body temperature above the hypothalamic set point when heat-dissipating mechanisms are impaired or overwhelmed, heat edema as dependent extremity swelling due to interstitial fluid pooling, heat cramps as exercise-associated painful involuntary muscle contractions during or immediately after exercise, and heat syncope as transient loss of consciousness with spontaneous return to normal mentation.

Temperature measurement and empiric cooling — assessment of suspected heat stroke: Accurate measurement of core temperature is an important step in differentiating heat stroke from less severe heat illness, as altered mental status with a core temperature below 40 °C should not be attributed to heat stroke; initial assessment and aggressive cooling should be implemented based on clinical suspicion, regardless of the degree of hyperthermia or mode of measurement. When assessing heat illness, we recommend using rectal temperature as the preferred measure for core temperature (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence), and in a hyperthermic patient with an altered sensorium and a presentation suspicious for heat stroke, we recommend the empiric use of active cooling even if the core temperature is unknown or measured and below the diagnostic threshold of 40 °C (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Identification of individual-level clinical factors associated with increased risk of death during heatwaves: a time-stratified case-crossover study using national primary care records in england [^111gRzML]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Heatwaves pose a significant risk to health. In England, heat-related deaths have been increasing since 2016. In summer 2022, England experienced its first 40°C heatwave and associated level 4 Heat-Health Alert, resulting in 2985 excess deaths. Following the major European heatwave in 2003, many countries introduced Heat-Health Actions Plans (HHAPs), which outline a framework for the health sector to respond to these events. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) launched the revised HHAP for England, the Adverse Weather and Health Plan (AWHP) in 2023 which aims to prevent avoidable harm to health during periods of adverse weather, including extreme heat. A key action for health and social care providers recommended in the AWHP is to 'establish methods to identify, alert and monitor individuals most vulnerable to heat-related illnesses on your caseload'. This recommendation is not widely implementedand one reason is the absence of an evidence-based process through which healthcare professionals can identify individuals most at risk of dying in a heatwave.

The pathophysiological mechanisms of ill health during periods of heat generally result from impaired thermoregulatory (eg, vascular dilation and sweating) or behavioural responses. At the population level, subgroups identified as at risk include older adults, children, those with chronic conditions, including mental health conditions, those prescribed certain medication and those unable to adapt their own behaviours or environments. Epidemiological studies exploring individual heat risk factors have generally used routine mortality and emergency hospitalisation data to characterise important chronic conditions. However, these studies provide limited evidence to support action and clinical decisions. Results from these studies are not specific to the English population leading to uncertainty about the generalisability of the findings. The use of emergency admissions data may not account for individuals receiving treatment or care within the community who do not enter the hospital system prior to death so these studies are likely biased towards individuals with more severe disease. This is especially relevant as a large proportion of deaths during heatwaves occur in the home. Nor do they include information about ongoing treatment, such as prescribed medication. All of these may play a significant role in an individual's overall risk and may underestimate the effects of these risk factors.

### ACSM expert consensus statement on exertional heat illness: recognition, management, and return to activity [^116J4kjU]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

Exertional heat illness — biomarkers and follow-up for return to activity: Current RTA strategies are largely based on anecdotal observations, with most guidelines requiring full symptom resolution at rest and normal laboratory findings for organs most often affected by EHI or EHS before reintroducing activity; a follow-up evaluation about 1 wk after the incident is suggested for a physical examination and laboratory testing or diagnostic imaging, and validated instruments to accurately predict continuing tissue or organ damage are not available. In a retrospective review of 2,529 EHS episodes, indicators of acute kidney injury peak on the day of the injury and normalize within 24 to 48 h, while muscle damage and liver function–associated markers peak within 4 d and can persist outside the reference ranges for 2 to 16 d, with biochemical recovery from EHS complete within 16 d for most casualties.

### Health effects of hot weather: from awareness of risk factors to effective health protection [^112ZFKz9]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Because of the increasing concerns about climate change and deadly heatwaves in the past, the health effects of hot weather are fast becoming a global public health challenge for the 21st century. Some cities across the world have introduced public health protection measures, with the timely provision of appropriate home-based prevention advice to the general public being the most crucial point of intervention. In this Review, we report current epidemiological and physiological evidence about the range of health effects associated with hot weather, and draw attention to the interplay between climate factors, human susceptibility, and adaptation measures that contribute to heat burdens. We focus on the evidence base for the most commonly provided heat-protection advice, and make recommendations about the optimum clinical and public health practice that are expected to reduce health problems associated with current and future hot weather.

Exertional heat illness can be a serious consequence of sports or exercise in hot environments. Participants can possess intrinsic or face extrinsic risk factors that may increase their risk for heat-related illness. Knowledge of the physiology and pathology of heat illness, identification of risk factors, and strategies to combat heat accumulation will aid both the practitioner and the participant in preparing for activities that occur in hot environments. Through preparation and mitigation of risk, safe and enjoyable wilderness adventure can be pursued.

Return to activity after serious exertional heat illness highlights that RTA (return to activity and play) decisions are challenging because understanding of recovery from EHS/EHI is incomplete; key considerations include assessing organ system recovery and physical function in warm or hot conditions; most individuals recover completely within a few weeks when promptly recognized and cooled, but some experience long-term complications; a progressive increase in exercise intensity and duration in warm/hot conditions can be used to assess recovery, and if pre heat injury exercise tolerance and expected performance are gradually regained, return to play is usually safe and advancing training/competition is acceptable.

### Evaluation and treatment of heat-related illnesses [^111BffKC]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The body's ability to regulate core temperature depends on both host (internal) and environmental (external) factors. Although athletes are commonly thought to be most at risk for heat illnesses, children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. Heat cramps, which are caused by fluid and electrolyte imbalances, are treated with massage, and fluid and electrolyte replacement. Heat exhaustion occurs both as water- and sodium-depleted types, with associated symptoms such as malaise, vomiting, and confusion. Treatment involves taking the affected person to a cool environment and replacing fluids and electrolytes if needed. In more serious cases, intravenous hydration may be necessary, although monitoring of serum sodium levels is important to prevent cerebral edema. If not treated promptly, heat exhaustion may evolve into heatstroke, a deadly form of heat illness. Heatstroke occurs in classic and exertional forms and is present when the core body temperature exceeds 40 degrees C (104 degrees F). The patient may experience cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, serum chemistry abnormalities, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death. Heatstroke is a medical emergency that should be treated immediately with temperature-lowering techniques such as immersion in an ice bath or evaporative cooling. Fluid resuscitation is important but should be closely monitored, and renal function may need to be protected with mannitol and diuretics. It is important to be vigilant for heat illnesses because they occur insidiously but progress rapidly.

Individual factors — acclimatization and fitness: As few as three exposures of 90 min duration over the course of one week can reduce physiologic strain by approximately 20%, benefits are 75–80% complete after 7 days of moderate exertion, and additional heat-exposed exertion for 1–2 h per day for 10–14 d further reduces strain, with adaptations persisting for up to a month; a bout of heat stroke may acutely reset these adaptations and elevate risk for subsequent heat injury for months, and individuals with high cardiopulmonary fitness tolerate more activity in high heat strain and acclimatize more rapidly.

### Prognostic factors in non-exertional heatstroke [^1138MHb3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To identify the prognostic factors associated with mortality in heat-related illness.

Methods

Multi-center observational cohort-study in 16 emergency departments (ED) belonging to the teaching hospital network of the Paris area. The cohort comprised all patients admitted to one of the EDs during the August 2003 heat wave in Paris and having a core temperature > 38.5 degrees C. Baseline clinical and biological data in ED, patient's course and 1-year survival rate were recorded. Potential prognostic factors associated with death were assessed by Cox proportional-hazards analysis.

Results

A total of 1,456 patients were included. Mean age was 79 ± 19 years. Critically ill conditions were noted in 391 patients (27%), but only 72 (5%) were admitted into an intensive care unit. The survival rate was 57% at 1 year as compared to an expected 90% (P < 0.001). Nine independent prognostic factors were identified: previous treatment with diuretics, living in an institution, age > 80 years, cardiac disease, cancer, core temperature > 40 degrees C, systolic arterial pressure < 100 mmHg, Glasgow coma scale < 12 and transportation to hospital by ambulance. We defined three risk groups: low, intermediate and high risk, with a 1-year survival rate of 85, 61 and 18%, respectively.

Conclusions

We observed a low survival rate and developed a risk score based on easily obtained variables that may be useful to clinicians managing casualties from future heat waves.

### Heat-related illnesses [^113txkWj]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

There is a growing incidence of heat-related illnesses due to rising global temperatures. Heat-related illnesses range from mild to severe, with heat stroke being the most critical. The wet bulb global temperature index considers humidity and solar intensity; its use is recommended to estimate heat stress on an individual and mitigate risk. Efficient cooling methods, such as cold water immersion, are essential in severe cases. Prevention is through hydration, appropriate clothing, recognition of high risk medications, and awareness of environmental conditions. Recognizing heat-related illnesses early in the clinical course and implementing rapid cooling strategies reduces morbidity and mortality.

### Effects of extreme heat on physiology, morbidity, and mortality under climate change: mechanisms and clinical implications [^115jqhgT]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Climate change is escalating the frequency and severity of extreme heat events, significantly augmenting disease burden through heat exposure. However, understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains insufficient, hindering the development of targeted interventions for heat related illnesses. This review summarizes the multifaceted mechanisms by which heat exposure induces systemic and organ specific damage. It elucidates how heat stress not only triggers systemic physiological dysfunction but also exacerbates specific organ injuries, thereby increasing morbidity and mortality risks across populations. These mechanisms drive shifts in disease profiles toward acute heat related illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, renal disorders, and other conditions, particularly affecting vulnerable groups. Susceptibility to heat exposure spans the entire life course, from prenatal stages to old age, and is amplified by socioeconomic disparities. The review proposes initiatives to reduce negative health outcomes and advocates for the integration of heat exposure into clinical practice guidelines, to safeguard public health in an era of unprecedented thermal challenges.

### Heat-related illnesses [^114uJVZC]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Heat-related illnesses comprise a spectrum of syndromes resulting from disruption of thermoregulation in people exposed to high environmental heat. Symptoms range from heat edema and exercise-associated muscle cramps to exercise-associated collapse, heat exhaustion, and life-threatening heat stroke. Athletes, outdoor laborers, and military personnel are at greatest risk. Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors increase the risk of heat-related illness, including medical conditions, environmental factors, medication use, and inadequate acclimatization. Proper recognition and treatment are effective in preventing adverse outcomes. Management of the mildest forms of heat-related illness (e.g., heat edema, exercise-associated muscle cramps) is largely supportive, and sequelae are rare. Heat exhaustion is characterized by cardiovascular hypoperfusion and a rectal core temperature up to 104°F without central nervous dysfunction. Mild cooling, rest, and hydration are recommended. Heat stroke is a medical emergency in which patients present with rectal core temperature of 105°F or greater, multiorgan damage, and central nervous dysfunction. Ice water or cold water immersion is recommended. Patients adequately cooled within 30 minutes have excellent outcomes. Patients with heat stroke generally require hospitalization to monitor for medical complications despite rapid cooling. People diagnosed with heat stroke or severe heat-related illness should refrain from physical activity for at least seven days after release from medical care, then gradually begin activity over two to four weeks. Acclimatization, adequate hydration, and avoidance of activities during extreme heat are the most effective measures to reduce the incidence of heat-related illnesses.

### Exertional heat stroke: pathophysiology and risk factors [^112CrYzE]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Exertional heat stroke, the third leading cause of mortality in athletes during physical activity, is the most severe manifestation of exertional heat illnesses. Exertional heat stroke is characterised by central nervous system dysfunction in people with hyperthermia during physical activity and can be influenced by environmental factors such as heatwaves, which extend the incidence of exertional heat stroke beyond athletics only. Epidemiological data indicate mortality rates of about 27%, and survivors display long term negative health consequences ranging from neurological to cardiovascular dysfunction. The pathophysiology of exertional heat stroke involves thermoregulatory and cardiovascular overload, resulting in severe hyperthermia and subsequent multiorgan injury due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome and coagulopathy. Research about risk factors for exertional heat stroke remains limited, but dehydration, sex differences, ageing, body composition, and previous illness are thought to increase risk. Immediate cooling remains the most effective treatment strategy. In this review, we provide an overview of the current literature emphasising the pathophysiology and risk factors of exertional heat stroke, highlighting gaps in knowledge with the objective to stimulate future research.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^116vsX8x]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

We propose that prognosis can now provide the framework in which clinicians and researchers organise evidence and information to support decisions about management. This extends calls for a risk-centred approach to many syndromes and chronic conditions and parallels proposals that public health should be organised around achievable outcomes rather than disease categories. Such a framework shifts the focus of clinical practice to improving outcomes for patients in their total biological, psychological, and social environment and away from an exclusive and narrow focus on underlying disease as the determinant of outcome.

Although biomedical diagnosis is often a crucial driver of treatment selection, especially in acute life-threatening illness such as infection and trauma, diagnostic labelling and subgrouping for many ill people is about providing prognostic information to support decisions about targeted individual long-term care. A broader prognostic framework could integrate such information with evidence about other pathophysiological, psychological, behavioural, and environmental factors that affect patient outcomes, to avoid overdiagnosis and support doctors and their patients in probability-based decision-making in clinical practice.

Prognosis is not a panacea for all the problems we have discussed in relation to diagnosis, and there must be continuing debate about the benefits, value, limits, harms, and costs of medicalization and medical care. However, because prognostic classification incorporates a much wider range of information than diagnosis and disease factors alone, and because such information is expanding rapidly in volume and availability, prognosis can provide a realistic, practical, and useful framework for clinical and public health practice.

### Heat-related illness in athletes [^114YFJkC]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Heat stroke in athletes is entirely preventable. Exertional heat illness is generally the result of increased heat production and impaired dissipation of heat. It should be treated aggressively to avoid life-threatening complications. The continuum of heat illness includes mild disease (heat edema, heat rash, heat cramps, heat syncope), heat exhaustion, and the most severe form, potentially life-threatening heat stroke. Heat exhaustion typically presents with dizziness, malaise, nausea, and vomiting, or excessive fatigue with accompanying mild temperature elevations. The condition can progress to heat stroke without treatment. Heat stroke is the most severe form of heat illness and is characterized by core temperature > 104 degrees F with mental status changes. Recognition of an athlete with heat illness in its early stages and initiation of treatment will prevent morbidity and mortality from heat stroke. Risk factors for heat illness include dehydration, obesity, concurrent febrile illness, alcohol consumption, extremes of age, sickle cell trait, and supplement use. Proper education of coaches and athletes, identification of high-risk athletes, concentration on preventative hydration, acclimatization techniques, and appropriate monitoring of athletes for heat-related events are important ways to prevent heat stroke. Treatment of heat illness focuses on rapid cooling. Heat illness is commonly seen by sideline medical staff, especially during the late spring and summer months when temperature and humidity are high. This review presents a comprehensive list of heat illnesses with a focus on sideline treatments and prevention of heat illness for the team medical staff.

Rapid cooling for exertional heat illness (EHI) and exertional heat stroke (EHS) — best outcomes require rapid on-site body cooling, which prevents delays from transport and serves to reduce organ and tissue temperatures and support tissue perfusion; the primary goal is to rapidly lower body temperature into the normal range to reduce the area under the cooling curve, and while a minimum effective cooling rate is not established, cooling rates above 0.08°C·min−1 appear acceptable and rates > 0.15°C·min−1 are desirable.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of heat illness: 2024 update [^113jbNZE]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Heat cramps, heat edema, heat syncope, and heat exhaustion — definitions and clinical features — are summarized as follows: Heat cramps are involuntary diffuse large muscle contractions associated with exertion in hot environments; dehydration and electrolyte disturbances are associated but causation is not clearly established, and exercise-associated muscle cramps (EAMC) are potentiated in heat with a unifying hypothesis that altered neuromuscular control is the underlying mechanism. Heat edema is a benign self-limiting condition with interstitial fluid accumulation in dependent extremities due to hydrostatic pressure, vascular leak, and cutaneous vasodilation. Heat syncope is a transient loss of consciousness with a rapid return to normal neurologic baseline during heat exposure; contributing factors can include peripheral vasodilatation, orthostatic pooling, prolonged standing, advanced age, dehydration, medications, dietary supplements, and coexisting conditions reducing cardiac output such as ischemic heart disease; it generally resolves with rest and rehydration at comfortable ambient temperatures, and exercise-associated collapse is a differential consideration. Heat exhaustion results from high ambient temperature or strenuous exertion, presents with symptoms that may limit continued exercise in the heat (weakness, fatigue, thirst, headache, nausea, dizziness, muscle aches), and is a mild-to-moderate heat illness that may progress to heat stroke if untreated in a hot environment.

Field treatment of heat illness — prehospital priorities: The method and aggressiveness of cooling in the field depend on the type of heat illness encountered (Table 3), and removal from the heat and rapid cooling is critical because the extent of morbidity is directly related to both the degree and duration of hyperthermia. All treatment in the field is first directed to stabilization of the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation before proceeding to more specific cooling therapy, and if no life-threatening complications exist, the implementation of on-site cooling before evacuation should be implemented. In transitioning patient care to emergency medical service providers, it is important to communicate any cooling techniques begun in the field and to emphasize continued cooling of the patient by best available means en route to the destination.

### Are young military personnel at a disproportional risk of heat illness? [^113YKuSi]. BMJ Military Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Humans aim to maintain core body temperature (T core) around a set-point of 37.0°C ± 1.0°C. Attaining thermal equilibrium relies on both behavioural (eg, seeking shade, modifying body orientation) and autonomic (eg, sweating, blood flow redistribution) responses that regulate bidirectional heat transfer with the environment. In most land-dwelling circumstances encountered by humans, these thermoregulatory processes are highly effective. However, the development of heat illness (HI) can be rapid if the compensatory limits for heat dissipation are exceeded, either due to high environmental heat stress (classic heat illness (CHI)) and/or sustained vigorous physical activity (exertional heat illness (EHI)). Despite anecdotal records of HI dating back millennia, a universal medical definition is still lacking, with most classifications describing a broad continuum of progressively severe conditions where patients become incapacitated following uncompensable heat stress. These include relatively mild conditions like heat exhaustion, where T core is said to be increased but < 40°C without central nervous system dysfunction; and more severe conditions such as heat stroke where T core is increased > 40°C with evidence of central nervous system dysfunction.

Military training and operations present an environment where personnel are frequently exposed to well characterised physical (eg, low fitness, febrile illness), behavioural (eg, dehydration, excessive motivation) and environmental (eg, high ambient temperature/humidity, non-permeable clothing) risk factors for HI diagnosis. Although international military policies outline stringent recommendations to reduce the risk of HI to as low as reasonably practicable, annual prevalence of severe HI (ie, heat stroke) has remained between 50 and 700 cases per 100 000 personnel in both the UKand USArmed Forces over recent years. Of these cases, the vast majority (~95%) occurred during arduous physical exertion (ie, EHI) and many outside of the warmer summer months. HI is a pertinent problem to the military, that has a substantial health (eg, medical discharge, reduced life expectancy), financial (eg, medical treatment, sick leave, compensation) and operational (eg, recruit wastage, casualty evacuation, increased risk of other military hazards) burden. Furthermore, given global predictions of increased wet bulb globe temperature and more frequent extreme weather events, the threat of HI is only anticipated to worsen in future.

### ACSM expert consensus statement on exertional heat illness: recognition, management, and return to activity [^116SjYNd]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

ACSM expert consensus — exertional heat stroke (EHS) is defined as a life-threatening condition with central nervous system disturbances and hyperthermia, usually > 40°C rectal temperature; EHS is usually associated with body temperature > 40°C with multisystem distress. A presenting core temperature ≥ 40°C alone is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of EHS, and core temperature values ≥ 40°C have been documented during high-intensity physical activity in both warm and hot weather with no apparent adverse effects on performance or health. Signs and symptoms suggesting EHS include persistent mental status changes, delirium, loss of ambulatory function (ataxia), seizure, coma, and high rectal temperature, > 40°C (> 104°F). Clinical management following EHS may require critical care interventions for organ and tissue damage induced by hyperthermia and sequelae, including systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).

Incidence of exertional heat stroke

The precise incidence of EHS is underestimated, but large incidence is observed among warfighters, athletes, labourers, and those engaging in recreational exercise. Problems with classification of the disorder contributes to the lack of a clear reported incidence. Most studies include EHS under the umbrella term of exertional heat illness. Exertional heat illness is classified as a spectrum of severity and includes heat exhaustion, heat injury, and heat stroke, which can be severe if untreated and are all characterised by hyperthermia. To differentiate heat injury from heat exhaustion, tissue or organ injury must be present, although it might quickly resolve in patients that are rapidly treated. A recent systematic review performed in a military cohort reported incidence of exertional heat illness ranging from 0.2 to 10.5 per 1000 person years and prevalence ranging from 0.3% to 9.3%. In addition, long distance road races reported an EHS incidence ranging between 1.6 and 2.13 per 1000 finishers without mortality.

Another factor that interferes with the precise incidence of EHS is the criteria often used to define the disorder clinically. Previous definitions of EHS have used the cut-off core temperature of > 40°C. The use of a threshold core temperature to define the disorder is considered inaccurate. Athletes can collapse at a wide range of core temperatures, and the measurements can be inaccurate if taken at peripheral body sites or after cooling has already occurred. The use of a threshold core temperature can lead to a misdiagnosis, suggesting that reliance on other pathological manifestations (ie, CNS dysfunction) is warranted and likely more accurate. Immediate cooling, regardless of core temperature, should always be the main priority on collapse because reliance on a specific core temperature could delay (or fail to prescribe) medical intervention and cause long term organ damage. Although less likely, false positive cases are possible because core temperatures > 40°C can occur without CNS impairment. Thus, CNS dysfunction is likely to define EHS with more sensitivity or specificity.

Exertional heat illness — heat tolerance definition and course: Heat tolerance is the ability to sustain physical activity in warm to hot conditions and is partly dependent on an individual's physical conditioning and heat acclimatization status; heat intolerance may be linked to changes in the acclimatization process, prior illness or injury, and certain inherent or genetic characteristics, and post-EHS heat intolerance may be temporary or permanent and can last from a few weeks to several years.

### The role of platelets in heat-related illness and heat-induced coagulopathy [^116pzSGV]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Heat-related illness is becoming more problematic due to ongoing global warming. Heat-related injury causes systemic inflammation and coagulopathy, due to leukocyte, platelet, and vascular endothelial cell activation and injury. Hyperthermia directly modulates platelet function and can induce cellular damage. Meanwhile, heat also affects platelet function via activated coagulation, excess inflammation, production of cytokines, and heat shock proteins. Aberrant hyperthermia-induced interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells are also involved in platelet regulation. Heat-induced coagulopathy commonly progresses to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leading to multiple organ failure and in some cases enhanced bleeding. Consequently, platelet count, prothrombin time, and DIC score are useful for evaluating the severity of heat-related illness in addition to other organ damage markers such as Glasgow Coma Scale, creatinine, and bilirubin. Despite the increasing risk, therapeutic modalities targeting platelets are limited and no established therapy exists. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the role of platelets in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of heat-related illness.

Exertional heat illness risk reduction — heat acclimatization is an adaptive physiological and perceived exertion change that occurs with repeated exposure to exercise heat stress, and a period of 1 to 2 wk of heat acclimatization is recommended to induce most physiological adaptations, which optimize performance and reduce the risk of exertional heat illness.

Climate change is anticipated to continue to adversely affect public health, with heat stress the predominant threat. Accordingly, heat-related illness is predicted to increase as extremely hot days become more frequent. Heat stroke, the most serious heat-related illness, is a medical emergency that may be fatal if it is not promptly recognized, addressed with early and rapid cooling, and accompanied by multidisciplinary supportive care as clinically indicated. Heat stroke is a preventable illness that occurs in 2 distinct forms-classic and exertional-that have distinct demographic profiles and clinical courses but similar management paradigms.

Minor heat illness — supportive care and condition-specific measures include that generalized heat cramps can be relieved with oral salt solutions or electrolyte replacement that may be isotonic or hypertonic, while exercise-associated muscle cramps that occur with repetitive movement and neuromuscular fatigue seem to be better relieved with passive stretching. Heat edema can be relieved by extremity elevation or wearing of compression stockings, and diuretics are ineffective for treating heat edema and may worsen volume depletion. Heat syncope is self-limiting; individuals at risk for heat syncope should move often and flex their larger leg muscles to prevent peripheral pooling of blood caused by cutaneous vasodilation, and an individual with heat syncope may benefit from further acclimatization, though no studies provide clear guidance for return to activity. For heat exhaustion, mild cases are generally resolved by removing the patient from the hot environment, cessation of physical activity, and rehydration with oral isotonic fluids, whereas severe heat exhaustion may require intravenous replacement of fluids as well as conductive and convective cooling; without proper cooling techniques patients can progress to heat stroke, and heat exhaustion or acute heat stress can precipitate EKG changes, symptomatic arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest with features of underlying Brugada syndrome. Recommendations state that for a patient's first occurrence of minor heat illness, we recommend supportive care, including rest in a cool area and replenishment of basic fluid and nutritional needs (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Exertional heat stroke: pathophysiology and risk factors [^117H8sXU]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Heat stroke is classified into two separate endotypes, referred to as classic heat stroke and exertional heat stroke (EHS). Classic heat stroke is induced by heat exposure in the absence of physical exertion.EHS is induced by vigorous physical activity performed normally, but not always, in hot or humid environments. The term "heat stroke" suggests the presence of stroke-like symptoms associated with warm environments and hyperthermia (normally characterised by increases greater than 2.5°C from resting values). EHS is characterised by central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction (eg, delirium, convulsions, or coma) with the possibility of follow-on organ or tissue damage in people with hyperthermia. The prevention of EHS is currently more effective than any treatment strategy.

Understanding the pathophysiology and the risk factors that lead to EHS is important for the correct diagnosis and the choice of mitigation strategies. Here, we provide an overview of the pathophysiology of the disorder and discuss the potential risk factors that contribute to its incidence.

Exertional heat illness — graduated return to activity and staging: Following EHI or EHS, a medical evaluation is completed every week until all symptoms, signs, and abnormal laboratory values have resolved, and activities of daily living are the only "exercises" allowed for 2 wk; after resolution of symptoms and signs, low to moderate intensity physical training can be gradually increased to 60 min·d−1, then a heat acclimatization plan can be started, with release to unsupervised sport-specific activity if no symptoms of heat intolerance or abnormal blood work values are seen. The authors of this consensus statement recommend a staged process to guide return to activity after serious exertional heat illness, noting that each stage is individualized but may require up to 2 wk to complete in EHS victims and that if an athlete is unable to appropriately advance from stages 3 through 6, additional evaluation, which may include heat tolerance testing (HTT), may be needed; it is important that incremental elevations in both exercise intensity and heat stress be incorporated.

Exertional heat stroke (EHS) rapid recognition — collapse during or immediately after activity with heat stress prompts evaluation, with a broad differential; self-limiting postexertional collapse from venous pooling typically resolves in less than 30 min with leg elevation and rest, whereas a missed EHS diagnosis or delayed whole-body cooling may lead to organ failure or death; to optimally establish a diagnosis and manage exertional collapse, the entire clinical picture including history, mental status, vital signs including rectal temperature, available point of care laboratory results, and regular reassessments should be considered.

### ACSM expert consensus statement on exertional heat illness: recognition, management, and return to activity [^114sxouC]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

ACSM return-to-activity (RTA) considerations after exertional heat stroke (EHS) or exertional heat illness (EHI) state that a detailed history and physical examination including unique intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors, the timing of treatment, and the rate of cooling must be considered in the RTA decision. The athlete should refrain from exercise for at least 7 d after release from initial medical care, at which time the clinician will address the clinical course of the heat stroke incident and carefully assess the status of end-organ function. The clinician should carefully address any intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors associated with the EHS event. When medically eligible for RTA/RTP based on the return of normal end organ function, an individual can begin exercise in a cool environment and gradually increase the duration, intensity, and heat exposure over 2 to 4 wk to initiate environmental acclimatization, improve fitness, and demonstrate heat tolerance. If return to vigorous activity and evidence of the patient's ability to adapt to exercise-heat stress over several days is not accomplished within 4 to 6 wk, consider referral to a physician with experience in heat related disorders for further evaluation that may include HTT in a controlled setting. An athlete may be allowed to resume full competition between 2 and 4 wk after demonstrating sports-specific exercise acclimatization and heat tolerance with no abnormal symptoms or test results during the re-acclimatization period.

Previous illness

When an organism has an immunological challenge, the innate and adaptive immune systems are activated. Innate immunity represents non-specific immunological defenses that are activated immediately after antigens appear. Adaptive immunity is an antigen specific immune response that requires recognition of the antigen and development of immune cells specific to destroying that antigen. Heat stress and EHS have been shown to degrade gut integrity and stimulate the immune system. The degradation in gut integrity is implicated in a catastrophic immune response known as systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Heat exposure induces a set of proteins that modulate the immune response to resolve systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Cytokines are immune modulators that have a dynamic nature and have been associated with fatalities from heat stroke. However, as previously mentioned with interleukin 6, some cytokines have been implicated in both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions, which could be a function of their concentration or the surrounding milieu in which they are functioning. Because of the vast array of cytokines and their diverse functions, understanding which specific set of cytokines can reduce or accentuate the effects of EHS has been difficult, and is likely to involve a coordinated response among several different cytokines. Another important set of immunological cells involved in heat stroke are lymphocytes. In classic heat stroke, T regulatory cells have been shown decrease in number and in immunosuppressive function. When lymphocyte production is compromised, heat stroke severity is exacerbated. Other factors might also come into play when determining how EHS or heat stress modulate the immune response, such as thermosensors, pre-existing conditions, previous illnesses, and epigenetic consequences.

Innate immunity is altered in individuals with comorbidities and pre-existing conditions, thus increasing the potential for exertional heat illness and, if left untreated, death. Diabetes mellitus has been shown to disrupt immune responses that are critical to staving off fungi, toxins, parasites, viruses, and bacteria. The mechanisms that are suppressed in patients with diabetes mellitus include dysfunction of immune cells, decreases in cytokine production, dysfunction in phagocytosis, and a decreased ability to eliminate microbials. These effects are prevalent owing to the hyperglycaemic environment in patients with diabetes mellitus. In terms of heat stress, hyperglycaemic environments are strongly associated with reductions in skin blood flow and sudomotor function, potentially incapacitating evaporative heat loss. Another deleterious effect of hyperglycaemic is the loss of nitric oxide availability, contributing to vascular complications. Based on the available evidence, a possible interplay could exist between the cardiovascular system, immune system, and diabetes — which complicates how to treat this condition and determine who is most vulnerable and why.

Minor and moderate heat illness treatment strategies: Heat cramps are relieved with oral salt solutions or electrolyte replacement that may be isotonic or hypertonic, and heat edema is reversed by extremity elevation or wearing of compression stockings, whereas diuretics are ineffective and may worsen volume depletion. Heat syncope by definition is self-limiting; after consideration of other causes or trauma, treatment consists of ensuring replacement of vascular volume with isotonic oral fluids and rest in a cool environment, and individuals at risk for heat syncope should move often and flex their larger leg muscles to prevent peripheral pooling of blood from cutaneous vasodilation; an individual with heat syncope is likely underacclimatized to the heat, and caution is warranted before immediate return to regular activity. Heat exhaustion results from both cardiovascular and thermal strain; mild cases generally resolve with removing the patient from the hot environment, cessation of physical activity, and rehydration with oral isotonic fluids, while severe heat exhaustion may require intravenous replacement of fluids as well as conductive and convective cooling, and because heat exhaustion can lead to cessation of activity and collapse, it is important to actively reverse the process, which can progress to heat stroke without proper cooling techniques.

### Management of heatstroke and heat exhaustion [^114NSMx6]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Heat exhaustion and heatstroke are part of a continuum of heat-related illness. Both are common and preventable conditions affecting diverse patients. Recent research has identified a cascade of inflammatory pathologic events that begins with mild heat exhaustion and, if uninterrupted, can lead eventually to multiorgan failure and death. Heat exhaustion is characterized by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, headache, and nausea. Treatment involves monitoring the patient in a cool, shady environment and ensuring adequate hydration. Untreated heat exhaustion can progress to heatstroke, a much more serious illness involving central nervous system dysfunction such as delirium and coma. Other systemic effects, including rhabdomyolysis, hepatic failure, arrhythmias, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and even death, are not uncommon. Prompt recognition and immediate cooling through evaporation or full-body ice-water immersion are crucial. Physicians also must monitor electrolyte abnormalities, be alert to signs of renal or hepatic failure, and replace fluids in patients with heatstroke. Most experts believe that physicians and public health officials should focus greater attention on prevention. Programs involving identification of vulnerable individuals, dissemination of information about dangerous heat waves, and use of heat shelters may help prevent heat-related illness. These preventive measures, when paired with astute recognition of the early signs of heat-related illness, can allow physicians in the ambulatory setting to avert much of the morbidity and mortality associated with heat exhaustion and heatstroke.

ACSM expert consensus on exertional heat illness — exertional heat stroke (EHS) is described as a true medical emergency with potential for organ injury and death, and identifying suspected cases early, stopping activity, and providing rapid total body cooling are essential for survival, emphasizing that time is tissue. Exertional heat illness can develop in athletes and occupational laborers performing stressful activity in warm to hot environments, sometimes with heavy equipment or protective clothing, and may occur in conditions starting as low as 15°C. Based on national catastrophic sport injury data, deaths in athletes from EHS have averaged 3 per year since 1995, mainly in high school football players, and recent literature reveals little to no change in the annual number of EHS deaths among athletes; the prevalence across all sports is not known. A systematic review of 62 epidemiological studies reported the highest incidence of exertional heat illness in American football, running, cycling, and adventure races, while marathon running and triathlons report the highest number of hospitalizations.

### Accidental hypothermia [^1156teEf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on accidental hypothermia:

- **Definition**: Accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional decline in the core body temperature to < 35 °C due to environmental exposure.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of accidental hypothermia involves a combination of heat loss and impaired thermoregulation. Heat loss can occur through radiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation. Impaired thermoregulation can result from factors such as sepsis, which can disrupt the body's normal temperature control mechanisms.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, accidental hypothermia is responsible for at least 1,500 deaths each year. The incidence of accidental hypothermia in the Netherlands is estimated at 1.1 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of accidental hypothermia can vary depending on the severity. Mild hypothermia may present with shivering and altered mental status. As the condition worsens, patients may exhibit detectable vital signs even with core temperatures < 24 °C. Severe hypothermia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, hypoventilation, and in extreme cases, cardiac arrest.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The overall mortality rate of accidental hypothermia is significant. In a study conducted in Japan, the overall proportion of cases resulting in in-hospital death was 24.4%.

### Classic and exertional heatstroke [^116ZZ8UL]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2022). High credibility.

In the past two decades, record-breaking heatwaves have caused an increasing number of heat-related deaths, including heatstroke, globally. Heatstroke is a heat illness characterized by the rapid rise of core body temperature above 40°C and central nervous system dysfunction. It is categorized as classic when it results from passive exposure to extreme environmental heat and as exertional when it develops during strenuous exercise. Classic heatstroke occurs in epidemic form and contributes to 9–37% of heat-related fatalities during heatwaves. Exertional heatstroke sporadically affects predominantly young and healthy individuals. Under intensive care, mortality reaches 26.5% and 63.2% in exertional and classic heatstroke, respectively. Pathological studies disclose endothelial cell injury, inflammation, widespread thrombosis and bleeding in most organs. Survivors of heatstroke may experience long-term neurological and cardiovascular complications with a persistent risk of death. No specific therapy other than rapid cooling is available. Physiological and morphological factors contribute to the susceptibility to heatstroke. Future research should identify genetic factors that further describe individual heat illness risk and form the basis of precision-based public health response. Prioritizing research towards fundamental mechanism and diagnostic biomarker discovery is crucial for the design of specific management approaches.
