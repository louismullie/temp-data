## Question

Can nephrotic syndrome elevate BUN

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether nephrotic syndrome can elevate blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of nephrotic syndrome and how it affects renal hemodynamics and tubular handling of urea. Then, I should verify the incidence and risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI) in nephrotic syndrome, since AKI would directly raise BUN. Next, I will examine metabolic contributors unique to nephrotic syndrome that could increase urea generation. After that, I should review clinical evidence showing elevated BUN in nephrotic patients across different scenarios. Finally, I will consider confounders and how to interpret BUN in this context, including the BUN/creatinine ratio and guideline-based monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the core pathophysiology. Nephrotic syndrome is defined by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and often hyperlipidemia, driven by glomerular permeability defects and podocyte injury, which can be primary or secondary to systemic diseases or toxins, and this protein-losing state sets the stage for complications including AKI and thrombosis [^116tdvXf] [^1164vFry]. Hold on, I should verify the AKI risk specifically: large cohort data show AKI occurs in roughly 28% of patients with primary nephrotic syndrome, and BUN elevation is a recognized risk factor for AKI in this population, which mechanistically explains why BUN can rise when kidney function acutely declines in nephrotic syndrome [^111Di2eP] [^116qmkap].

> Now, I will examine the hemodynamic mechanisms that raise BUN. Wait, let me verify the volume physiology. The underfill hypothesis posits that severe hypoalbuminemia lowers plasma oncotic pressure, triggering intravascular volume depletion, neurohormonal activation (RAAS, SNS, ADH), and enhanced proximal tubular urea reabsorption, which disproportionately elevates BUN relative to creatinine and yields a high BUN/creatinine ratio, a classic prerenal pattern that can occur in nephrotic flares with intravascular contraction [^117CA5Rz] [^113GXEgH]. But hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the overfill hypothesis also applies in some adults, where primary renal sodium retention expands plasma volume, so the BUN/creatinine ratio must be interpreted alongside clinical volume status and FeNa/FeUrea to avoid misclassification [^111xZWrL] [^114BiPT6].

> Next, I should review direct tubular injury as a cause of BUN elevation. Let me consider the evidence: nephrotic-range proteinuria itself can provoke tubulointerstitial inflammation and epithelial injury, impairing tubular secretion and function and thereby increasing BUN. Case series document acute tubular injury superimposed on minimal change disease with rising urea and creatinine requiring temporary dialysis, and experimental glomerulopathy models show that proteinuria correlates with cortical cholesterol loading and tubular dysfunction, supporting a causal link between heavy protein traffic and tubular injury with azotemia [^113fwTJa] [^112XgtZf]. I should double-check that this aligns with clinical teaching: yes, nephrotic syndrome is a recognized cause of AKI in both children and adults, and AKI directly elevates BUN as GFR falls [^113GXEgH] [^111Di2eP].

> I will now examine metabolic contributors unique to nephrotic syndrome that can increase urea generation. Let me verify the catabolic state: severe nephrosis is associated with protein-energy wasting and increased muscle protein catabolism, which augments urea production and can raise BUN even when kidney function is preserved. Observational data show higher blood urea in severe nephrotic patients compared with controls matched for creatinine, with a negative correlation between BUN and lean tissue mass, supporting a catabolic urea source in active nephrosis [^114PfBhu]. Hold on, I should confirm that this mechanism is distinct from CKD uremia. Indeed, the authors emphasize different pathobiology of PEW in nephrotic syndrome versus CKD, yet both can manifest elevated BUN through increased generation and/or reduced excretion [^114PfBhu].

> Next, I should review clinical evidence across scenarios. Case reports repeatedly document marked BUN elevations in nephrotic patients with AKI: a diabetic patient with nephrotic syndrome had BUN 69 mg/dL with oliguria, consistent with prerenal/azotemic physiology; an anti-GBM overlap case showed BUN 36.1 mg/dL with severe renal impairment; and a Kimura disease–associated MCD case progressed to dialysis with elevated urea that subsequently improved with disease-directed therapy, illustrating reversibility when the nephrotic process is controlled [^1153g84D] [^114ayDVu] [^113fwTJa]. Let me also check pediatric and special contexts: a child with COVID-19–associated nephrotic syndrome had BUN 20 mg/dL at presentation, and drug-induced MCD cases (e.g., pembrolizumab) show BUN in the 70–80 mg/dL range with AKI, reinforcing that BUN elevation is a consistent feature when nephrotic syndrome is complicated by renal dysfunction or profound underfilling [^114dbwVZ] [^117CP32X].

> But wait, what if BUN is high and creatinine is normal; does that still implicate nephrotic physiology? I need to ensure I interpret the BUN/creatinine ratio correctly. A BUN/creatinine ratio greater than 20:1 supports increased urea reabsorption from prerenal factors or enhanced catabolism, both plausible in active nephrotic syndrome, whereas a lower ratio suggests intrinsic renal disease; however, I should confirm confounders such as GI bleeding, high protein intake, and corticosteroids, which can independently raise BUN and must be considered in the differential and in counseling about interpretation [^113GXEgH]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse using BUN in this way; KDIGO materials and nephrology references commonly use the BUN/creatinine ratio to phenotype AKI, which is directly applicable when nephrotic patients develop azotemia [^113GXEgH].

> Next, I should review guideline-based monitoring to ensure this aligns with standard care. Pediatric and general nephrology guidance recommend measuring urea/BUN alongside creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes, and albumin in children with nephrotic syndrome, reflecting the need to track renal function and volume-responsive azotemia during active disease and relapses; this reinforces that BUN is a clinically meaningful analyte that can rise in nephrotic syndrome and should be trended [^116n7kXf] [^116goRQp]. Let me reconsider whether adults differ; while adult pathways are less prescriptive, the same principle applies: BUN is part of routine kidney function assessment and will rise with AKI or prerenal physiology in nephrotic adults as well [^111qAJ71].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, nephrotic syndrome can elevate BUN through multiple mechanisms: prerenal hemodynamics with enhanced proximal urea reabsorption, intrinsic tubular injury from proteinuria with AKI, and increased urea generation from catabolism. Clinically, BUN elevation is common when nephrotic syndrome is severe, hypovolemic, or complicated by AKI, and the magnitude can be substantial, occasionally reaching ranges associated with uremic symptoms in the setting of marked underfilling or renal failure, though isolated BUN thresholds alone should not dictate dialysis decisions without clinical correlation [^111Di2eP] [^1153g84D] [^113fwTJa] [^114PfBhu] [^112ZkkL9].

Nephrotic syndrome can cause **elevated BUN** through two main mechanisms: **hypovolemia-induced prerenal azotemia** from low oncotic pressure and third-spacing of fluid [^113C58g4], and **acute kidney injury (AKI)** from renal hypoperfusion or tubular injury, both of which increase BUN independently of creatinine [^113GXEgH]. BUN elevation is common in nephrotic syndrome, especially with severe hypoalbuminemia, intravascular volume depletion, or AKI, and may be disproportionate to creatinine due to enhanced urea reabsorption [^111Di2eP] [^114XRVou]. Clinicians should interpret BUN alongside creatinine, eGFR, and the BUN/creatinine ratio to distinguish prerenal from intrinsic renal causes and guide management [^113GXEgH].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of elevated BUN in nephrotic syndrome

### Hypovolemia and prerenal azotemia

- **Hypoalbuminemia**: Reduced plasma oncotic pressure shifts fluid into the interstitium, causing relative intravascular volume depletion and prerenal azotemia [^113C58g4].

- **Neurohormonal activation**: RAAS and sympathetic stimulation increase proximal tubular urea reabsorption, raising BUN disproportionately to creatinine [^117CA5Rz].

- **BUN/creatinine ratio**: Often > 20:1 in prerenal states, reflecting enhanced urea reabsorption [^113GXEgH].

---

### Acute kidney injury (AKI)

- **Incidence**: AKI occurs in ~28% of primary nephrotic syndrome and is a key driver of BUN elevation [^111Di2eP].

- **Mechanisms**: Renal hypoperfusion, tubular injury from proteinuria, and interstitial edema reduce GFR and increase BUN [^113C58g4].

- **Risk factors**: Hypoalbuminemia, infections, and nephrotoxic drugs increase AKI risk and BUN [^111Di2eP].

## Clinical evidence of elevated BUN in nephrotic syndrome

Multiple studies and case reports document **elevated BUN** in nephrotic syndrome:

| **Study/case report** | **Clinical context** | **Bun elevation** |
|-|-|-|
| Reversible acute renal failure in diabetic nephrotic syndrome | Diabetic nephrotic syndrome with AKI | BUN 69 mg/dL |
| Nephrotic syndrome with AKI | Primary nephrotic syndrome with AKI | BUN ≥ 6.5 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) |
| Kimura's disease with nephrotic syndrome | Nephrotic syndrome with AKI | BUN 12.55 mmol/L (35 mg/dL) |
| Anti-GBM disease with nephrotic syndrome | Nephrotic syndrome with AKI | BUN 36.1 mg/dL |
| Pembrolizumab-induced nephrotic syndrome | Drug-induced nephrotic syndrome with AKI | BUN 78.9 mg/dL |

---

These data show that **BUN elevation is common** in nephrotic syndrome, particularly with AKI or hypovolemia.

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Monitoring**: Regular BUN and creatinine monitoring helps detect AKI or prerenal azotemia early [^116goRQp].

- **Interpretation**: Use BUN/creatinine ratio and clinical context to distinguish prerenal from intrinsic renal causes [^113GXEgH].

- **Management**: Address hypovolemia, treat AKI, and manage complications such as infections and thrombosis to reduce BUN [^116tdvXf].

---

## Conclusion

Nephrotic syndrome can cause **elevated BUN** through hypovolemia-induced prerenal azotemia and AKI; BUN may rise disproportionately to creatinine due to increased urea reabsorption. Recognizing and managing these mechanisms is essential to prevent progression and improve outcomes.

Introduction

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a glomerular disease characterized by severe proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. NS can cause various complications, such as dyslipidemia and coagulation disorders. These complications can be mostly explained by the compensatory increase in protein synthesis in the liver in response to a loss of various proteins, including albumin (Alb) into the urine, although the details of its pathophysiology remain uncertain.

Cholinesterase (ChE) is one of the enzymes produced in the liver and belongs to the family of serine hydrolases. Clinically, ChE is widely measured as a valuable marker for evaluating liver function, particularly protein synthesis. In contrast, this enzyme can also increase in NS. A study has reported that almost all patients with NS had hypercholinesterasemia (HC). However, the evidence of HC in NS has not been fully elucidated.

To resolve this issue, we investigated the clinical value of HC in NS.

Conclusions

In summary, we have found that the incidence of AKI in PNS patients is 28.05%, and for PNS patients with diabetes, pulmonary infection, albumin ≤ 24 g/L, serum creatinine ≥ 90 μmol/L, blood urea nitrogen ≥ 6.5 mmol/L, uric acid ≥ 390 μmol/L, renal tubular casts, they may have higher risk of AKI. Patients with PNS should actively control pulmonary infections and diabetes, and correctly choose a reasonable treatment plan is vital to reduce the occurrence of AKI.

In children, KDIGO recommends use of the modified Schwartz formula or Full Age Spectrum formulas. We agree with the KDIGO guideline highlighting that all eGFR formulas, including non–race-based or cystatin C–based formulas, have not been established or validated in patients with glomerular disease, and equations based on serum creatinine (Scr) may overestimate eGFR in the nephrotic syndrome with hypoalbuminemia.

### Association and risk of blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio with congestive heart failure in critically ill COPD patients [^115PRfHa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent respiratory disorder attributed to prolonged exposure to harmful particles or gases. COPD sufferers often exhibit systemic inflammation, hypoxemia, endothelial dysfunction, heightened sympathetic activation, as well as aortic stiffness, all of which can lead to microvascular damage, proteinuria, and renal function impairment. As an intricate and heterogeneous disease, COPD is frequently correlated with multiple comorbidities, which contribute to higher morbidity and mortality rates compared to those caused by the respiratory disease alone. COPD commonly coexists with heart failure (HF), and the risk of both conditions rises with age. Several studies have reported an elevated incidence of cardiac diseases among adults hospitalized for pulmonary diseases. The COPD-HF syndrome has gained increasing attention due to its critical impact on key health outcomes. Therefore, identifying risk factors associated with the prevalence of COPD and HF is essential for ameliorating the prognosis of these patients.

Renal involvement is a common complication in chronic respiratory conditions in clinical settings. A higher incidence of renal failure was noted in patients suffering primary pulmonary diseases, particularly in those with COPD. Therefore, monitoring renal function in COPD patients may be crucial for prognostic evaluation. The blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio (BCR) is a widely utilized marker for evaluating kidney function, particularly in cases of suspected renal impairment. An elevated BCR may indicate worse renal function, as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) tends to accumulate when kidney function is impaired, while creatinine (Cr) levels may decrease as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) drops, so BCR possibly indicates renal function deterioration. Given the complex pathophysiological relationship between COPD and HF, BCR serves both as an indicator of renal function and a valuable tool for assessing fluid balance, cardio-renal interactions, and chronic disease management, providing reliable support for comprehensive clinical evaluation and the development of individualized treatment strategies.

Despite established associations between COPD and HF, and the recognized role of BCR in evaluating renal function, the relationship between BCR and congestive heart failure (CHF) in critically ill COPD patients remains inconclusive. There is a need to investigate whether BCR can serve as an effective prognostic stratification marker for critically ill COPD patients with CHF, thereby offering deeper insights into disease progression and outcomes. To address this issue, we analyzed data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database and constructed a linear regression model for offering insights into the prognosis and monitoring of patients with this combined syndrome.

Background

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a rare clinical condition caused by glomerular filtration barrier damage due to glomerulopathy and is characterized by proteinuria exceeding 3.5 g/day, resulting in hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and oedema.

Pathophysiological studies have indicated that nephrotic syndrome is associated with a hypercatabolic state expressed as an exacerbated degradation of muscle mass, however, the clinical significance of this phenomenon has not yet been investigated.

Pathophysiology of protein metabolism and its regulation in nephrotic syndrome has been studied in detail since the 1950s. It has been found that aside from urinary loss of albumin, an increased fraction of this protein is catabolized in renal tubular cells. The intensified hepatic synthesis is insufficient to counterbalance the overall deficit and the hypoalbuminemia is present until the proteinuria ameliorates. Thus, it has been established that due to a loss of a large amount of protein, a decrease in the general body protein pool is observed in nephrotic patients. As muscles are the main source of amino acids, necessary substrates for hepatic synthesis of lost plasma proteins, the catabolic state existing in nephrotic patients is manifested by a reduction in lean tissue. However, the problem of hypercatabolism and malnutrition seems to be neglected in this population. This is probably due to the low incidence of glomerulopathies, estimated at 1–2 people per 100,000 (for primary glomerulopathies) with only about 50% of them displaying clinical signs of nephrotic syndrome and an even lower frequency with a severe course of the disease.

### Protein energy-wasting associated with nephrotic syndrome-the comparison of metabolic pattern in severe nephrosis to different stages of chronic kidney disease [^117Ue4Sw]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia and hyperuricemia have been other well-known indicators of hypercatabolism. It has been noted in nephrotic children, that hyperphosphatemia (hPi) is attributed to active nephrosis. Feinstein et al. suggested that urinary excretion of insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and its influence on increased tubular phosphate retention, may be a possible mechanism of increased phosphorus concentration in this group of children. Thus, hPi has been presumed to be a consequence of hormonal disturbances accompanying massive proteinuria. However, an enhanced catabolism of cellular mass (nucleic acids, adenosine triphosphate – ATP) may be another source of serum phosphate, similarly observed in rhabdomyolysis or tumour lysis syndrome. We suppose that hypercatabolism may be an additional mechanism responsible for hyperphosphatemia in severe NS. Similarly, hPi as an effect of increased catabolism has been described by Rozentryt et al. in patients with heart failure. It is probable that the same pathogenetic way is associated with hyperuricemia in nephrotic patients. Hyperuricemic phenomenon has not yet been emphasized in nephrotic syndrome.

In our study, patients with severe NS were divided into two subgroups according to serum concentration of Pi and UA. The subgroup of nephrotic patients with elevated Pi and/or UA levels presented about 5.6 kg lower LTM and 3.7 kg lower BCM with increased blood urea levels and lower serum prealbumin concentration. This may reflect the greater dynamics of muscle tissue catabolism. Considering the fact that patients with a short NS history (and MCD diagnosis) predominated in the hypercatabolic group, the dynamics of NS development may be pivotal.

In our study, patients with severe NS showed a significantly lower lean amount, and features of hypercatabolism (higher Pi, UA and blood urea concentration) in comparison to the control group. In terms of nutritional status, they were more similar to patients with advanced CKD than those with eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73m 2. However, the mechanisms of protein-energy wasting syndrome in CKD (PEW) and NS were significantly different.

Case presentation

We report the case of a 23-year-old male patient admitted to our hospital in June 2018. The patient had a 4-month history of foamy urine prior to admission. His medical report revealed proteinuria (+++), mild edema of the lower limbs, elevated serum creatinine (259 μmol/L) levels, and mild hypertension (145/78 mmHg). The patient had no prior history of renal problems.

The patient was hospitalized due to nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. Laboratory testing revealed the following: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 7.1 mmol/L; serum creatinine (Scr), 282 μmol/L; urine albumin/creatinine (UACR), 2701.53 mg/g; urine protein/creatinine (UPCR), 3360 mg/g; urinary protein quantitative (24 h), 6.678 g; serum albumin, 34.3 g/L; serum uric acid, 561 μmol/L; total cholesterol, 7.63 mmol/L; low density lipoprotein, 5.18 mmol/L; hemoglobin (Hb), 130 g/L; anti-PLA2R, negative; parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 135.79 pg/mL; and homocysteine (HCY), 22.23 μmol/L. Interventricular septal thickness was found to be 12 mm using cardiac ultrasound. As renal ultrasound revealed renal cortex thinning and an unclear boundary of the renal cortex and medulla, renal biopsy was not performed.

5.2 Glomerulonephritis and Renal Toxicity

TEGSEDI can cause glomerulonephritis that may result in dialysis-dependent renal failure. In Study 1 [see Clinical studies (14)], glomerulonephritis occurred in three (3%) TEGSEDI-treated patients vs. no patient on placebo. In these patients, stopping TEGSEDI alone was not sufficient to resolve manifestations of glomerulonephritis, and treatment with an immunosuppressive medication was necessary. One patient did not receive immunosuppressive treatment and remained dialysis-dependent. If glomerulonephritis is suspected, pursue prompt diagnosis and initiate immunosuppressive treatment as soon as possible.

Cases of glomerulonephritis were accompanied by nephrotic syndrome. Possible complications of nephrotic syndrome can include edema, hypercoagulability with venous or arterial thrombosis, and increased susceptibility to infection. TEGSEDI-treated patients who develop glomerulonephritis will require monitoring and treatment for nephrotic syndrome and its manifestations.

Accumulation of antisense oligonucleotides in proximal tubule cells of the kidney, sometimes leading to increased tubular proteinuria, has been described in nonclinical studies. Urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 15% of TEGSEDI-treated patients, compared to 8% of patients on placebo. Increase from baseline in serum creatinine greater than 0.5 mg/dL occurred in 11% of TEGSEDI-treated patients, compared to 2% of patients on placebo.

Follow recommended monitoring and treatment recommendations for renal parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. TEGSEDI should generally not be initiated in patients with a UPCR of 1000 mg/g or greater. If acute glomerulonephritis is confirmed, TEGSEDI should be permanently discontinued [see Contraindications (4)].

Use caution with nephrotoxic drugs and other drugs that may impair renal function. Because immunosuppressive treatment is necessary for the treatment of glomerulonephritis, avoid using TEGSEDI in patients for whom immunosuppressive treatment is not advised.

### Experimental glomerulopathy alters renal cortical cholesterol, SR-B1, ABCA1, and HMG CoA reductase expression [^112XgtZf]. The American Journal of Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Previous studies indicate that acute tubular injury causes free cholesterol (FC) and cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation within renal cortex/proximal tubules. This study assessed whether similar changes occur with glomerulopathy/nephrotic syndrome, in which high-circulating/filtered lipoprotein levels increase renal cholesterol supply. Potential adaptive changes in cholesterol synthetic/transport proteins were also assessed. Nephrotoxic serum (NTS) or passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats. Renal injury (blood urea nitrogen, proteinuria) was assessed 2 and 7 days (NTS), or 10 and 30 days (PHN) later. FC and CE levels in renal cortex, isolated glomeruli, and proximal tubule segments were determined. SR-B1 (a CE influx protein), ABCA1 (a FC exporter), and HMG CoA reductase protein/mRNA levels were also assessed. FC was minimally elevated in renal cortex (0 to 15%), the majority apparently localizing to proximal tubules. More dramatic CE elevations were found (approximately 5 to 15x), correlating with the severity of proteinuria at any single time point (r ≥ 0.85). Cholesterol increments were associated with decreased SR-B1, increased ABCA1, and increased HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR) protein and its mRNA. Tubule (HK-2) cell culture data indicated that SR-B1 and ABCA1 levels are responsive to cholesterol supply. Experimental nephropathy can increase renal FC, and particularly CE, levels, most notably in proximal tubules. These changes are associated with adaptations in SR-B1 and ABCA1 expression, which are physiologically appropriate changes for a cholesterol overload state. However, HMGCR protein/mRNA increments can also result. These seem to reflect a maladaptive response, potentially contributing to a cell cholesterol overload state.

When making the decision to start RRT, consider the broader clinical context, conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests — rather than single blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine thresholds alone (Not Graded). Discontinue RRT when it is no longer required because intrinsic kidney function is adequate to meet patient needs or because RRT is no longer consistent with the goals of care (Not Graded).

### Nephrotic syndrome in adults: diagnosis and management… [^111xZWrL]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

4 Although the more intuitive "underfill" mechanism of edema from reduced oncotic pressure caused by marked proteinuria may be the primary mechanism in children with acute nephrotic syndrome, edema in adults may be caused by a more complex mechanism. Massive proteinuria causes renal tubulointerstitial inflammation, with resulting increased sodium retention that overwhelms the physiologic mechanisms for removing edema. 5 Patients may have an "overfilled" or expanded plasma volume in addition to expanded interstitial fluid volume. This may be clinically important if over-rapid diuresis leads to acute renal failure from reduced glomerular blood flow, despite persistent edema. Nephrotic-range proteinuria is typically defined as greater than 3 to 3. 5 g of protein in a 24-hour urine collection; however, not all persons with this range of proteinuria have nephrotic syndrome.

Although a urine dipstick proteinuria value of 3+ is a useful semiquantitative means of identifying nephrotic-range proteinuria, given the logistic difficulties of collecting a 24-hour urine sample, the random urine protein/creatinine ratio is a more convenient quantitative measure. The numeric spot urine protein/creatinine ratio, in mg/mg, accurately estimates protein excretion in g per day per 1. 73 m. 2 of body surface area, so a ratio of 3 to 3. 5 represents nephrotic-range proteinuria. 6 Low serum albumin levels and severe hyperlipidemia are also typical features of nephrotic syndrome. In one study of persons with nephrotic syndrome, 53 percent had a total cholesterol level greater than 300 mg per dL and 25 percent had a total cholesterol level greater than 400 mg per dL.
7. 10 The relative risk of pulmonary embolism was
1. 4 and was especially high in persons 18 to 39 years of age.

Renal venous thrombosis is a possible complication of nephrotic syndrome, but was uncommon in this case series. Membranous nephropathy and serum albumin levels less than 2. 0 to
2. 5 g per dL seem to confer an increased risk of DVT. Arterial thrombotic complications can occur, but are rare. 9.

### Screening with blood urea nitrogen before intravenous contrast [^112LmUzo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

In some settings, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values are available well in advance of creatinine values. We wanted to determine whether BUN values can be used to screen for renal insufficiency for the purpose of intravenous contrast administration. From laboratory records, we derived and validated cutpoints for BUN values to detect creatinine values ≥ 2.0 mg/dL. "Sensitive" and "high-yield" cutpoints were derived using records from 5000 consecutive patients and validated using a random set of 2000 patients. BUN ≥ 15 mg/dL, the "sensitive" cutpoint, had sensitivity of 0.997 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.987–1.0) and specificity of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54–0.59). BUN ≥ 20 mg/dL, the "high-yield cutpoint", had sensitivity of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95–0.99) and specificity of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69–0.73). Negative likelihood ratios for these cutpoints were 0.005 and 0.03, respectively. BUN values < 15–20 mg/dL provide strong evidence against renal insufficiency.

Regarding medical management for nephrotic syndrome in children, more specifically with respect to management of edema, IPNA 2023 guidelines recommend to administer albumin infusions of 0.5–1 g/kg of 20% or 25% albumin over 4–6 hours in patients with severe edema, and add furosemide (1–2 mg/kg IV over 5–30 minutes) in the middle and/or at the end of the infusion, provided there is no marked intravascular volume contraction or hyponatremia.

### Diuretics alone for volume expanded nephrotic syndrome patients… [^114BiPT6]. publications.aap.org (2009). Low credibility.

All study patients were treated with sodium restriction, fluid restriction, and prednisone. An initial observational study demonstrated that a FeNa > 0. 2% identified a group of patients who, at admission, had significantly lower serum BUN and BUN/creatinine ratios, and higher serum and urine sodium concentrations. This group was defined as volume expanded while those subjects with a FeNa < 0. 2% were considered volume contracted. During the interventional portion of the study, VE subjects were treated with twice-daily furosemide and twice-daily oral spironolactone while VC subjects were treated with twice-daily infusions of 25% albumin followed by intravenous furosemide. The interventional study included 20 patients, with nine in the VC group and 11 in the VE group.

Prior to treatment, VC patients had significantly higher levels of antidiuretic hormone, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone as well as significantly higher serum BUN/creatinine ratios, lower urine sodium, and higher urine osmolality. The VE and VC groups had no significant differences in therapeutic outcome or duration of hospitalization. One patient in the VE group who initially received furosemide alone was switched to furosemide plus 25% albumin due to a rise in serum creatinine and fall in serum sodium. Another patient in the VE group had a mild, transient rise in serum creatinine that resolved with discontinuation of furosemide. The management of edema in children with nephrotic syndrome is challenging and controversial. 1 There are two theories of the mechanism of edema in nephrotic syndrome.

2, 3 The underfill hypothesis contends that hypoalbuminemia decreases plasma oncotic pressure, which leads to intravascular volume depletion, stimulating renal sodium and water retention. The overfill hypothesis postulates that excessive renal sodium retention leads to intravascular volume expansion and subsequent overflow of sodium and water into the interstitial space. Use of a diuretic alone in children with nephrotic syndrome and intravascular volume. Comments.

### Non-respiratory presentations of COVID-19, a clinical review [^11353W1t]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) is a highly infectious viral syndrome currently threatening millions of people worldwide. It is widely recognized as a disease of the pulmonary system, presenting with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, a number of extrapulmonary manifestations have been described in the literature.

Objective

In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive summary of the hematologic, gastroenterological, renal, dermatologic, neurologic, and psychiatric manifestations of COVID-19.

Discussion

Hematological presentations of COVID-19 include laboratory abnormalities such as decreased total lymphocyte count, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), elevated d-dimer, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Several of these findings are associated with increased mortality among infected patients. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Furthermore, presence of viral RNA in patient stool suggests the possibility of additional testing modalities for COVID-19. Nephrological findings such as proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated BUN and creatinine levels have been observed. Additionally, several studies demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 who developed acute kidney injury (AKI) had a greater risk of mortality. The virus can also present with cutaneous symptoms such as erythematous rashes, urticaria, and chicken pox-like lesions. Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been described in the literature, and patients can exhibit findings consistent with viral encephalitis, cerebral vascular disease, peripheral nerve disorders, and psychosis.

Conclusion

Although COVID-19 does usually present primarily with respiratory symptoms, the extra-pulmonary manifestations of the virus are unpredictable and varied. Better understanding and awareness of these symptoms can lead to more efficient diagnosis, rapid treatment, isolation, and decreased spread of the disease.

### Nephrotic syndrome associated with kimura's disease: a case report and literature review [^113fwTJa]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment and follow-up

The patient's volume load did not respond to diuretics, and his urine output decreased. Furthermore, increases in the patient's urea and creatinine levels were observed. Therefore, hemodialysis was initiated to improve the patient's edema and kidney function. The renal biopsy demonstrated the presence of MCD combined with acute renal tubular injury. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with KD associated with MCD and acute renal tubular injury. The patient subsequently received 40 mg/day methylprednisolone for 3 weeks. Urinary protein and renal function were monitored during treatment, which decreased the patient's serum creatinine level to 62.3 μmol/L, increased the eGFR to 103 mL/min/m 2, increased the serum albumin concentration to 15.6 g/L and significantly increased urine output compared with pre-treatment values. However, the patient's proteinuria increased to7.02 g/day.

The patient withdrew from hemodialysis and continued taking 40 mg/day prednisolone after discharge, but returned to our hospital after 6 weeks. At that time, urinalysis revealed 1+ proteinuria. The serum albumin concentration was 37.5 g/L, the serum creatinine concentration was 69.4 μmol/L, the BUN concentration was 12.55 mmol/L, and the eGFR was 97.8 mL/min/m 2. The changes in the patient's laboratory indexes are shown in Fig. 3.

### Resolved: normal glomeruli filter nephrotic levels of albumin [^1114UUZJ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The glomerular filtration barrier has long been thought largely impermeable to albumin. Startling new data suggest it may not be especially important in this process. Much of the argument hinges on whether charge selectivity really exists, how feasible it is for enormous quantities of albumin to instead be reclaimed by the proximal tubule, and the technical merits of previous experiments. Three experts in the field debate the merits of this argument.

### Lipid-lowering agents for nephrotic syndrome [^114wkvsk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nephrotic syndrome is the collective name given to a group of symptoms that include proteinuria, lipiduria, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema, hypercholesterolaemia, elevated triglycerides, and hyperlipidaemia. Hyperlipidaemia is thought to aggravate glomerulosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels in the kidneys) and enhance progression of glomerular disease. Studies have established that reduction in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular diseases. In 2011, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia recommended use of statins as first-line agents in the management of nephrotic dyslipidaemia. However, the effectiveness and safety of statins for people with nephrotic syndrome remains uncertain. Furthermore, the efficacy of second-line lipid-lowering drugs, such as ezetimibe and nicotinic acid, has not been proven in patients with nephrotic syndrome who are unable to tolerate statin therapy.

Objectives

This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of lipid-lowering agents in adults and children with nephrotic syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 18 March 2013) through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at participants with nephrotic syndrome that compared any lipid-lowering agent to placebo, no treatment or other lipid-lowering agents, given for not less than four weeks, were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model. Dichotomous results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous measures mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) where different scales had been used.

Main Results

We included five RCTs enrolling a total of 203 participants. Of these, four studies compared statins with no treatment or placebo, and one compared fibrates with placebo. We found no published studies comparing second-line agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and nicotinic acid with placebo or no treatment. Our assessment of the risk of bias found that one study was judged overall to be at low risk of bias and the remaining four were judged to be at high risk of bias. Most outcomes were supported by single study data. One study reported significantly increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol among participants in the statin arm compared with the no treatment group (MD 5.40 mg/dL, 95% CI 2.31 to 8.49). Another study reported higher serum albumin in the statin group compared to those who received no treatment (MD 0.60 g/dL, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06). No serious adverse events, such as rhabdomyolysis, were reported, however some minor events occurred. One study reported no significant difference in the number of participants with elevated liver enzymes (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52); three studies reported liver enzymes remained within the normal range (no data provided). Four studies reported creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). One study indicated that CPK values fluctuated in both the simvastatin and placebo groups (no data provided); the remaining three studies reported CPK either stayed within the normal range (one study) or there was no significant difference between the lipid lowering agents and placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

None of the included studies reported patient-centred outcomes including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or non-fatal myocardial infarction; only single studies reported cholesterol (HDL, LDL and total cholesterol), triglycerides, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, liver enzymes, and protein (serum, urine). High quality RCTs need to be conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of lipid-lowering drugs for people with nephrotic syndrome.

### Response to combined ipilimumab and nivolumab after development of a nephrotic syndrome related to PD-1 monotherapy [^117CP32X]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 68-year old male was diagnosed with stage IV melanoma (cM1c (0) AJCC 2017, BRAF wild type) with iliac lymph node, adrenal and splenic metastases (Fig. 1). Anti-PD-1 monotherapy with pembrolizumab was initiated (2 mg/kg q3w) as first-line therapy. Eighteen days after the first application of pembrolizumab, the patient reported a weight gain of 10 kg within 7 days and massive peripheral edema. Laboratory tests revealed an acute renal failure with nephrotic syndrome (creatinine 2.86 [0–1.17] mg/dl, urea 78.9 [10–50] mg/dl, potassium 5.2 [3.5–5] mmol/l, calcium 1.7 [2–2.7] mmol/l, cholesterol 399 [130–220] mg/dl, total protein 4.2 [6.6–8.7] g/dl, albumin 1.6 [3.5–5.5] g/dl). Prior to pembrolizumab, renal function tests were normal and proteinuria was absent. The patient was hospitalized and a kidney biopsy was performed. Light microscopy showed a tubular damage (presumably due to a preexistent hypertensive nephropathy) without signs for interstitial nephritis. Amyloidosis, the presence of immune complexes or complement-mediated glomerulonephritis were ruled out by immunohistochemistry. Ultimately, electron microscopy showed findings consistent with a minimal change disease. Based on these findings, an acute renal failure with nephrotic syndrome due to a minimal change disease related to pembrolizumab was diagnosed. Other risk factors for a minimal change disease (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were not evident. Treatment with oral corticosteroids (100 mg prednisolone qd) and diuretics was initiated. Renal function recovered to creatinine levels around 1.5 mg/dl and proteinuria decreased to 329 mg/l (Fig. 2). Prednisolone was tapered over approximately 6 weeks, diuretic treatment with torasemid was reduced to a maintenance dose of 25 mg qd.

### Nephrotic syndrome in adults: diagnosis and management [^116njoBU]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome may be caused by primary (idiopathic) renal disease or by a variety of secondary causes. Patients present with marked edema, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and often hyperlipidemia. In adults, diabetes mellitus is the most common secondary cause, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranous nephropathy are the most common primary causes. Venous thromboembolism is a possible complication; acute renal failure and serious bacterial infection are also possible, but much less common. There are no established guidelines on the diagnostic workup or management of nephrotic syndrome. Imaging studies are generally not needed, and blood tests should be used selectively to diagnose specific disorders rather than for a broad or unguided workup. Renal biopsy may be useful in some cases to confirm an underlying disease or to identify idiopathic disease that is more likely to respond to corticosteroids. Treatment of most patients should include fluid and sodium restriction, oral or intravenous diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Some adults with nephrotic syndrome may benefit from corticosteroid treatment, although research data are limited. Intravenous albumin, prophylactic antibiotics, and prophylactic anticoagulation are not currently recommended.

### A patient with nephrotic-range proteinuria and focal global glomerulosclerosis [^117Dfxy8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

A young male is evaluated for nephrotic-range proteinuria, hypercalciuria, and an elevated serum creatinine. A renal biopsy is performed and shows focal global glomerulosclerosis. The absence of nephrotic syndrome suggest that glomerulosclerosis was a secondary process. Further analysis of the proteinuria showed it to be due mainly to low-molecular weight proteins. The case illustrates the crucial role of electron microscopy as well as evaluation of the identity of the proteinuria that accompanies a biopsy finding of focal and global or focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis.

### The exacerbated hypokalemia in membranous glomerulonephritis due to proximal tubular injury: a neglect issue from a case report and literature review [^112cGWPc]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 65 year-old female attended to our emergent department for progressive lower leg edema after taking 15-h of flight. The patient had been diagnosed with hypertension and she was under clinics following-up in Canada. No previous diuretics or other antihypertensive medication exposure was noted before this episode although hypertensive history was told. According to the patient's clinician, no previous serum potassium disorder was documented because the patient did not take routine examination. On 2018 11/15, bilateral lower leg edema developed after she landed off in Taiwan and then persisted for 2 days. Beyond the edema, the patient denied other associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, decrease in urine output, fever, nausea, vomiting, bloody or tarry stool or palpable nodule within breast or neck, etc. No other exposure history to drug or substance was mentioned. Therefore, the patient was referred to emergent department. High blood pressure (185/97 mmHg) with normal sinus rhythm was noted at ER. Table 1 illustrated the serial laboratory change. The laboratory data revealed profund hypokalemia (Potassium: 1.66 mEq/L). and elevated serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine (27 mg/dL/1.90 mg/dL). Elevated creatin-phospho-kinase (7683U/L) was noted without associated elevation of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase or glutamic pyruvic transaminase were also occurred at the same time. The urine analysis demonstrated the positive glucose (3 +), urine protein (4 +), urine RBC without dysmorphic change (3 +), and negative for cast (not found). The blood gas analysis didn't demonstrate acidosis or alkalosis. Hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipidemia were both noted, and 24-h urinary total protein was up to 17,950 mg/day. Under the impression of nephrotic syndrome with hypokalemia, the patient was admitted. TTKG was 12. 8, and the serum levels of autoimmune disease (including Anti-nuclear antibody, C3, C4), aldosterone, plasma renin activity, Hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C antibody, paraprotein, were negative. No hyper-or hypothyroidism was noted. Serum magnesium was within normal limit. The patient's hypokalemia was refractory to intravenous potassium supplement with dosage of 140 mEq/day since 2018/11/22. Abdominal computer tomography was performed and there was no adrenal lesion. After spironolactone 25 mg twice daily use, valsartan 80 mg once daily use were given, the serum potassium was stabilized (K: 3.1 mEq/L). Kidney biopsy was performed due to nephrotic syndrome. Figure 1 illustrated the diffuse membranous thickening within the glomerulus with abundant optically clear intracytoplasmic vacuoles, which ranged from predominantly large and coarse to fine, involving both the proximal tubular epithelial cells under light microscopy demonstrated. No crescents, fibrins or necrosis within glomerular Bowman's space was noted. Large irregular-sized, coarse vacuoles in the cytoplasm of tubular epithelial cells were noted. 20% of interstitial fibrosis and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates was noted. Immunohistochemical stain revealed positive stain for PLA2-R receptor antibody and IgG4. The immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated diffuse global granular capillary loop staining for IgG (3 +), C3 (2 +), C4 (1 +), C1q (1 +). Figure 2 illustrated the eletromicroscopy. The electron microscopy demonstrated subepithelial immunocomplex deposits with spike formation. Visceral foot process effacement was noted. Lipid droplets and lysosomal vacuoles in tubular epithelial cells were also noted. Intracytoplasmic electron lucent vacuoles (arrow) of various sizes in the proximal tubular epithelial cells were found. Besides, the vacuoles with lipid droplet (arrowhead, with crescent-like content) also presented within the vacuoles. Based on the pathologic finding, membranous glomerulonephritis was confirmed. Renal wasting hypokalemia was also confirmed. Figure 3 illustrated the patient's maintenance medication along with the variation of serum creatinine, potassium and mean arterial blood pressure. The patient received tacrolimus 2 mg twice daily, amlodipine 2.5 mg once daily, olmesartan 20 mg once daily, atorvastatin 20 mg once daily, carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily as maintenance treatment. In 2019/12, the patient's serum BUN/Cr was 30/mg/dL/2.3 mg/dL. The serum potassium level was 3.60 mEq/L. The daily urinary total protein excetion was 14,337.54 mg/g. In 2022/2, the patient started to receive maintenance hemodialysis.

Initial corticosteroid regimen history and duration evidence — pediatric nephrotic syndrome: In the 1960s and 1970s, a consensus initial corticosteroid regimen was 60 mg/m^2/d for 4 weeks followed by +40 mg/m^2/d for 3 consecutive days per week for 4 weeks, with the follow-up dose later changed to every other day corticosteroids for ease of administration and no head-to-head comparisons available. While some early randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed a benefit of longer corticosteroid treatment (12–24 weeks) versus 8 weeks on risk of relapse, more recent studies have not consistently shown a benefit for extending the initial treatment course beyond 12 weeks.

### Molecular stratification of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome [^1164vFry]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) describes a group of pathologies of the renal glomerulus that result in the classic triad of heavy proteinuria, oedema and hypoalbuminaemia. The disease has historically been defined by evidence of distinctive histological changes in the absence of clinical evidence of a distinct pathological driver. However, the current classification is not based on any systematic mechanistic understanding of biological processes, and therefore current treatment regimens are broad, iterative and nonspecific. Over the past 20 years delineation of the underlying biology of the target cell in INS - the glomerular podocyte - has transformed our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to breakdown of the glomerular filtration barrier and the development of INS. It is increasingly clear that nephrotic syndrome caused by monogenic mutations is distinct from immune-driven disease, which in some cases is mediated by circulating factors that target the podocyte. The combination of systems biology and bioinformatics approaches, together with powerful laboratory models and ever-growing patient registries has potential to identify disease 'signatures' that reflect the underlying molecular mechanism of INS on an individual basis. Understanding of such processes could lead to the development of targeted therapies.

The clinical calculator "BUN/Creatinine Ratio" for diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, anemia of chronic kidney disease, anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, hepatorenal syndrome, immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis, infection-related glomerulonephritis, kidney transplantation and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is a clinical calculator used in the field of nephrology and internal medicine. BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen, a waste product generated in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, while Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle metabolism and also excreted by the kidneys.

This ratio is primarily used to differentiate between prerenal and renal causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). A high BUN/Creatinine ratio (> 20:1) is typically suggestive of a prerenal cause such as dehydration or decreased blood flow to the kidneys, while a low ratio (< 10:1) is more indicative of intrinsic renal disease or postrenal obstruction.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is applicable to patients with suspected kidney disease or injury, or those with known renal conditions where monitoring of renal function is necessary. It is also used in the evaluation of patients with altered mental status or suspected metabolic disorders.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the BUN/Creatinine ratio, but it should be interpreted with caution in patients with liver disease, malnutrition, or those on certain medications that can affect BUN or creatinine levels. It is also important to note that this ratio is

Introduction

Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, surpassed only by cardiovascular disease, and poses a substantial threat to public health and societal development. Paraneoplastic syndromes, which manifest clinically in approximately 7–10% of cancer patients, often precede detection of an occult malignancy, and their consequences may be more serious than those of the primary tumor. Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a rare but recognized paraneoplastic disorder. Patients with this syndrome have a group of clinical manifestations that include massive proteinuria, hypoproteinemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema, which could indicate a paraneoplastic process or be a result of chemotherapy. Paraneoplastic nephrotic syndrome (PNS) often presents a diagnostic challenge for physicians because it can be difficult to differentiate from idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, which is encountered more frequently, and the adverse effects of treatment for cancer. A prompt and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management of NS and any associated malignancy.

Numerous studies have established a definitive temporal association between the onset of NS and clinical emergence of tumors in patients with PNS. Typically, remission of the underlying malignancy correlates with a marked decrease in proteinuria, while a resurgence or metastasis of the cancer often precipitates an increase in proteinuria. Tumor antigens and/or antitumor antibodies are frequently detected in the podocyte/subepithelial interstitial spaces during a renal biopsy. Among the hematological malignancies, Hodgkin's lymphoma is the one most frequently associated with NS, generally by minimal change nephropathy (MCN). The pathogenesis of NS in Hodgkin's lymphoma appears to stem from the deleterious effects of tumor lymphocyte byproducts on the glomerulus as opposed to accumulation of immune complexes within the glomerulus. However, solid malignancy-associated NS has not been systematically reviewed, and the pathophysiology remains unclear.

In this study, we systematically reviewed the clinical features, histopathology, relevant laboratory tests, treatment approaches, and prognosis for 128 published cases of NS associated with solid malignancy with the aim of informing the clinical management of PNS.

### Nephrotic syndrome [^115vmNyw]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by edema, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. Minimal change disease, the most common cause in childhood, generally responds to corticosteroids, although most patients experience disease relapses. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is usually resistant to corticosteroids and carries a significant risk of kidney failure, necessitating renal transplantation. Nephrotic syndrome may also be secondary to gene mutations and systemic diseases such as lupus. Clinical evaluation involves distinguishing primary and secondary causes and monitoring for disease complications, including blood clots and serious infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Immunosuppressive medications are used to prevent relapses and treat corticosteroid-resistant disease.

Redux: brought back, resurgent (Wikipedia free dictionary). This essay traces the history of the concepts that led to the usage of the term 'nephrotic syndrome' beginning ∼90 years ago. We then examined the various definitions used for this syndrome and modified them to conform to contemporary standards. Remarkably, only minor modifications were required. This analysis of a common clinical entity may be helpful in ensuring appropriate evaluation of patients suffering from nephrotic syndrome and nephrotic-range proteinuria.

Renal dysfunction — acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal findings in COVID-19 include that a meta-analysis of COVID-19 patients (n = 1,558) found no correlation between an elevated risk for COVID-19 and renal disease; AKI developed in 5% to 15% of those infected with the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and initial reports of AKI in COVID-19 patients stated rates of 3% to 9%; in a study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 59), 34% developed massive albuminuria on the day they were admitted and 63% developed proteinuria over the course of their hospital stay; in 27% of COVID-19 patients blood urea nitrogen levels were abnormally high and BUN was elevated in two- thirds of patients who died of COVID; COVID-19 may complicate care for patients on dialysis, since these patients are already at elevated risk for infection, and dialysis patients must continue with their treatments.

### Calycosin ameliorates albuminuria in nephrotic syndrome by targeting notch1 / snail pathway [^116ZitzU]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Heavy proteinuria is an important hallmark for kidney disease including nephrotic syndrome. Astragali Radix, a traditional Chinese herb, holds the potential to alleviate nephrotic syndrome; however, the underlying mechanism has not been completely clarified. The study aimed to explore the role of calycosin (C 16 H 12 O 5), a major active component of Astragali Radix, in regulating adriamycin-induced proteinuria.

Methods

A rat model of nephrotic syndrome was established through two adriamycin injections within two weeks (4 mg/kg for the first week and 2 mg/kg for the second week). After the induction of renal injury, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg calycosin was intraperitoneally injected into rats for four weeks. Before euthanasia of rats, urine and blood samples were collected, and body weight was recorded. Then, 24 h urine protein content, kidney index, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), as well as renal function indicators including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCR), and urine albumin excretory rate (UAE) were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin staining for renal cortex tissues was performed to evaluate glomerular structural damage. TUNEL assay was performed to evaluate renal cell apoptosis. Western blotting was conducted to measure protein levels of podocyte-specific markers (podocin and nephrin), Notch1, and Snail in rat renal tissues.

Results

Calycosin reversed adriamycin-induced increase in proteinuria content, kidney index, and concentrations of renal function indicators. Calycosin ameliorated glomerular structural damage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and basement membrane thickening in model rats. In addition, calycosin rescued the suppressive impact of adriamycin on renal cell apoptosis and protein levels of podocyte markers. The activated Notch1/Snail signaling in model rats was suppressed by calycosin intervention.

Conclusion

Calycosin exerts a protective role against adriamycin-induced nephrotic syndrome via inhibition of the Notch1/Snail signaling.

Primary membranous nephropathy (MN) treatment initiation and supportive care are delineated as follows: Practice Point 3.3.1 states that "All patients with primary MN and proteinuria should receive optimal supportive care", and "Immunosuppressive therapy should be restricted to patients considered at risk for progressive kidney injury (Figure 31)". Practice Point 3.3.2 specifies that "Immunosuppressive therapy is not required in patients with MN, proteinuria < 3.5 g/d, serum albumin > 30 g/l by bromcresol purple (BCP) or immunometric assay, and eGFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2". Practice Point 3.3.3 adds that "Immunosuppressive therapy is not required in patients with MN, nephrotic syndrome, and normal eGFR, unless at least one risk factor for disease progression is present or serious complications of nephrotic syndrome (e.g. AKI, infections, thromboembolic events) have occurred".

### Assessment of volume status and appropriate fluid replenishment in the setting of nephrotic syndrome [^115jYJmH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

When the permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier increases, leading to proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome (NS) occurs. First episodes or relapses of NS can be concurrent with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) infections. This condition can cause further deterioration of the hypovolemic state, as intravascular water is lost through both AGE-related vomiting/diarrhea and NS-related fluid shifting into the interstitium. In this case report, we wish to raise the issues about the difficult management of children presenting with both NS and AGE.

Case Report

We report two cases characterized by concurrence of NS and AGE. Despite our intervention, case #1 required dialysis, whereas in the case #2 we restored the patient's liquid homeostasis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? No guidelines helping general physicians in the management of children presenting with both NS and AGE are available in the literature. However, it is common for these patients to seek the first line of treatment at emergency departments. In these patients, restoring the liquid homeostasis is a challenge, but some key points can help the physicians with first-line management: 1) carefully evaluate the signs of hypovolemia (edematous state can be misleading); 2) bear in mind that-in hypovolemic, severely hypoalbuminemic (serum albumin levels < 2 g/dL) NS children-initial fluid administration should be followed by a 20% albumin infusion if oligoanuria persists; intravenous 4.5% albumin may be a valid alternative as a first-line therapy instead of crystalloid and 20% albumin; and 3) pay attention when using furosemide; it should only be administered after albumin infusion or after hypovolemia correction.

### Attending rounds: an older patient with nephrotic syndrome [^1129Ax6w]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome in older adult patients is a common clinical conundrum. Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a lesion frequently found to underlie the nephrotic state in such patients. Determining with reasonable certainty whether the nephrotic syndrome and MN is primary (idiopathic) or due to an underlying disease such as neoplasia can be a daunting clinical challenge. By way of a presentation of an illustrative case and a focused review of the relevant literature, the approach to evaluation of such patients, with an emphasis on the putative causative role of neoplasia in MN, is analyzed and a potential contemporary pathway for acquiring the correct diagnosis is offered.

### Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children [^116tdvXf]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The incidence of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) is 1·15–16·9 per 100000 children, varying by ethnicity and region. The cause remains unknown but the pathogenesis of idiopathic NS is thought to involve immune dysregulation, systemic circulating factors, or inherited structural abnormalities of the podocyte. Genetic risk is more commonly described among children with steroid-resistant disease. The mainstay of therapy is prednisone for the vast majority of patients who are steroid responsive; however, the disease can run a frequently relapsing course, necessitating the need for alternative immunosuppressive agents. Infection and venous thromboembolism are the main complications of NS with also increased risk of acute kidney injury. Prognosis in terms of long-term kidney outcome overall is excellent for steroid-responsive disease, and steroid resistance is an important determinant of future risk of chronic or end-stage kidney disease.

### The rationale and design of insight into nephrotic syndrome: investigating genes, health and therapeutics (INSIGHT): a prospective cohort study of childhood nephrotic syndrome [^114PMY7S]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is a commonly diagnosed kidney disease in childhood and treatment resistant forms can result in scarring of the kidney, eventually progressing to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and/or end stage renal disease (ESRD). Nephrotic syndrome occurs when changes in the permselectivity barrier of the glomerular capillary wall can no longer restrict the loss of protein to a minimal level, thus resulting in massive protein loss through the urine. Nephrotic syndrome can result in lethal infections, thrombosis, and pulmonary edema as a result of the significant protein loss. The estimated incidence of nephrotic syndrome is between 2–7 per 100,000 children worldwide, with higher rates reported among those with African and South Asian ancestry. The specific causes of nephrotic syndrome are disputed, but are considered to be immune-mediated based on the evidence that steroids treat the underlying disease, and on observed associations of nephrotic syndrome with atopy. Prior to the initiation of steroid treatment in the 1960s, the risk of morbidity and mortality was extremely high. Most common clinical protocols provide at least 12–16 weeks of steroid therapy at diagnosis, followed by second line agents if the child is deemed steroid resistant, steroid dependant, or a frequent relapser. Current clinical convention is that the initial response to steroids will determine the long-term risk of disease progression; however, approximately 20% of children with nephrotic syndrome will not respond to steroids among those with European ancestry, and the rates of steroid treatment resistance are reported to be significantly higher among those with African (≈16–27%) and Asian (≈27–54%) ancestry (Table 1).

### Diabetic nephropathy with marked extra-capillary cell proliferation: a case report [^111u626s]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The patient was a male in his 50 s who presented with a chief complaint of dyspnea and edema of the lower legs.

One year prior to admission, the patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The patient was then observed without medication. Two months before admission, gradually worsening edema of the lower legs appeared, accompanied by dyspnea. The patient was then admitted to another hospital. Nephrotic syndrome and bilateral proliferative retinopathy were found, and the patient was transferred to our hospital approximately one week later.

On admission, a physical examination revealed a weight gain of approximately 30 kg, hypertension of 160/90 mmHg, and SpO 2 of 98% with 1 L of oxygen inhalation. Respiratory sounds were diminished in both chests, and a Levine II systolic murmur was heard at the third intercostal space of the left sternum border. The abdomen was distended. Edema and stasis dermatitis were observed in both lower legs.

The laboratory findings on admission are shown in Table 1. The patient had nephrotic syndrome with a serum albumin level of 1.5 g/dl and urinary protein excretion of 9.21 g/gCr, accompanied by microscopic hematuria and renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15.81 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Mild elevation of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and C-reactive protein levels were noted, but antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody, and cryoglobulin were negative. Chest radiography revealed bilateral pleural effusion. Both kidneys were normal in size on computed tomography.

Laboratory findings

Urine analysis revealed 3+ proteinuria with no blood (Table 1). Spot urine protein was greater than 2 g/dL and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio greater than 12 mg/mg, which suggested the presence of nephrotic-range proteinuria. The patient had mild hyponatremia with serum sodium of 133 mmol/L. Serum creatinine was 0.27, and BUN was 20. Serum albumin was 2 g/dL, total cholesterol elevated at 307 mg/dL, elevated triglycerides at 644 mg/dL, with normal complements C3 and C4 at 87 mg/dL and 21 mg/dL, respectively. Our patient's blood work was also notable for elevated D-dimer 2.49 (normal < 0.4 Ug/mL) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 39.1 (25.6–32.4) seconds. She had a mildly elevated TSH (5.6 IU/mL) with a normal free T4 (0.9 ng/dL), a low 25-hydroxy vitamin D level, and a low ferritin of 29. Of note, the surveillance COVID-19 testing (RT-PCR, performed via nasopharyngeal swab), which was performed as part of the general hospital admission process during the time of this case report, returned positive for SARS-CoV-2, and further immunoglobulin (Ig) testing was positive for both IgM and IgG antibodies. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test was performed using the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay (approved for emergency use authorization by the US FDA), and the SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin testing was performed on the Abbott Architect i1000 platform (approved for emergency use authorization by the FDA).

### Hypoalbuminemia and acute kidney injury: a meta-analysis of observational clinical studies [^113EEv8M]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The results in HRS also illustrate the apparent capacity of albumin to improve kidney function even in the presence of pre-existing renal impairment. Further supporting this concept is a randomized crossover trial of patients with nephrotic syndrome, in which albumin increased urine output and sodium excretion.

Taken together, this meta-analysis provides evidence for hypoalbuminemia as an independent risk factor for AKI and for post-AKI death. Currently available data support a causal role for serum albumin in maintaining kidney integrity and function. Hence, controlled clinical studies are warranted to evaluate the effects on renal function of interventions aimed at correcting hypoalbuminemia. Further evaluation of serum albumin in identifying patients at increased risk for AKI and for death after AKI would also be justified.

### Association between the blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio and the risk of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease: a cohort study [^117CA5Rz]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

In CKD patients, the decline in renal function often leads to elevated BUN levels, while hypoalbuminemia can result from inflammation, malnutrition, and protein metabolism disorders. Research has demonstrated that in the ICU, BUN was associated with in-hospital mortality in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Additionally, previous studies identified a close association between hypoalbuminemia, inflammation, and malnutrition in CKD patients. The inflammatory status and malnutrition in CKD patients were associated with an increased mortality risk. Evidence indicated that hypoalbuminemia was significantly linked to higher mortality rates in CKD patients, potentially related to systemic inflammation. Therefore, an increase in the BAR effectively reflected the patient's prognostic risk, and our results validated the significant association between BAR and prognosis in critically ill CKD patients. Nonetheless, once BAR surpassed a certain threshold, the risk of death stabilized and ceased to rise significantly. Further investigation into this phenomenon is essential for future research.

In critically ill CKD patients, the mechanism underlying the association between elevated BAR and increased mortality risk is not fully elucidated, but several biologically plausible explanations exist. On the one hand, factors such as renal hypoperfusion, infection, and surgery can activate the neurohumoral systems such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the sympathetic nervous system, and antidiuretic hormone, which promote passive reabsorption of BUN in the renal tubules and enhance protein catabolism, leading to elevated BUN levels. On the other hand, albumin plays a critical role in maintaining plasma colloid osmotic pressure, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, platelet activation, and the transport of molecules and drugs. Existing studies have confirmed the protective effects of albumin on the heart and kidney due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Low serum albumin levels can impair toxin clearance, reduce intravascular volume, leading to renal hypoperfusion, and worsen kidney injury. Moreover, Low albumin has been associated with increased platelet aggregation and an elevated risk of thrombotic events. Therefore, the elevation of BAR may be the result of multiple pathophysiological processes, reflecting disease severity, and thus being associated with poor prognosis.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^111mmo9a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children — urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and albumin thresholds: The substitution of spot UPCR for the 24-hour urine collection has been established as the standard of care for children, with nephrotic-range proteinuria defined as first morning UPCR of ≥ 2 g/g. Whereas the 2012 KDIGO guideline maintained albumin ≤ 2.5 g/dL, the current guideline suggests serum albumin ≤ 3 g/dl; however, we suggest continuing to use the definition of nephrotic syndrome for children in the absence of evidence to support a change to a higher cutoff. It is unknown whether children with nephrotic-range proteinuria and less severe hypoalbuminemia (albumin of 2.6–2.9 g/dL) have similar pathology or treatment responses, and this has not been studied in prospective clinical trials. Practice Point 4.1.1 states that the definitions relating to nephrotic syndrome in children are based on the clinical characteristics outlined in Figure 39.

Glomerulonephritis

TEGSEDI can cause glomerulonephritis that may require immunosuppressive treatment and may result in dialysis-dependent renal failure. One clinical trial patient who developed glomerulonephritis and did not receive immunosuppressive treatment remained dialysis-dependent. In clinical trials, cases of glomerulonephritis were accompanied by nephrotic syndrome, which can have manifestations of edema, hypercoagulability with venous or arterial thrombosis, and increased susceptibility to infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

TEGSEDI should generally not be initiated in patients with urinary protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 1000 mg/g or higher [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Prior to starting TEGSEDI, measure the serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), and perform a urinalysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. During treatment, monitor serum creatinine, eGFR urinalysis, and UPCR every two weeks. TEGSEDI should not be given to patients who develop a UPCR of 1000 mg/g or higher, or eGFR below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, pending further evaluation of the cause.

If a dose is held, once eGFR increases to ≥ 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, UPCR decreases to below 1000 mg/g, or the underlying cause of the decline in renal function is corrected, weekly dosing may be reinitiated. In patients with UPCR of 2000 mg/g or higher, perform further evaluation for acute glomerulonephritis, as clinically indicated. If acute glomerulonephritis is confirmed, TEGSEDI should be permanently discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^1178DFgo]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

The decision to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and the optimal timing for commencement is a difficult decision faced by clinicians when treating acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care setting. Without clinically significant ureamic symptoms or emergent indications (electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload) the timing of RRT initiation remains contentious and inconsistent across health providers. Current trends of initiating RRT in the ICU are often based on isolated blood urea levels without clear guidelines demonstrating an upper limit for treatment. Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

### Acute kidney injury in patients with primary nephrotic syndrome: influencing factors and coping strategies [^116qmkap]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent and serious complication in patients with primary nephrotic syndrome (PNS). We aimed to evaluate the influencing factors of AKI in patients with PNS, to provide implications for the clinical management and nursing care of patients with PNS.

Methods

PNS patients who were treated in the Department of Nephrology in our hospital from January 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021 were included. The clinical characteristics and pathological type of PNS patients were evaluated. Pearson correlation and Logistic regression analysis were performed to analyze the related risk factors of AKI in patients with PNS.

Results

A total of 328 patients with PNS were included, the incidence of AKI in PNS patients was 28.05%. Pearson correlation analysis showed that diabetes(r = 0.688), pulmonary infection (r = 0.614), albumin (r = 0.779), serum creatinine (r = 0.617), uric acid (r = 0.522), blood urea nitrogen (r = 0.616), renal tubular casts (r = 0.707) were correlated with AKI in PNS patients (all P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that diabetes (OR2.908, 95%CI1.844 ~ 4.231), pulmonary infection(OR3.755, 95%CI2.831 ~ 4.987), albumin ≤ 24 g/L (OR1.923, 95%CI1.214 ~ 2.355), serum creatinine ≥ 90 μmol/L (OR2.517, 95%CI2.074 ~ 3.182), blood urea nitrogen ≥ 6.5 mmol/L (OR1.686, 95%CI1.208 ~ 2.123), uric acid ≥ 390 μmol/L (OR2.755, 95%CI2.131 ~ 3.371), renal tubular casts(OR1.796, 95%CI1.216 ~ 2.208) were the independently influencing factors of AKI in PNS patients (all P < 0.05).

Conclusions

AKI is common in PNS patients. Actively controlling diabetes and pulmonary infection, strengthening nutrition support and renal function monitoring are essential to reduce the occurrence of AKI in PNS patients.

### Serum blood urea nitrogen as an independent marker of subsequent mortality among patients with acute coronary syndromes and normal to mildly reduced glomerular filtration rates [^114XRVou]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

We hypothesized that elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) would be associated with adverse outcomes independent of serum creatinine (sCr)-based estimates of kidney function in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

Background

Although lower glomerular filtration rates (GFR) have prognostic significance among patients with ACS, estimates of GFR based on sCr may perform less accurately among patients with milder kidney dysfunction. In this population in particular, BUN, which can reflect increased proximal tubular reabsorption in addition to decreased GFR, may have independent prognostic value.

Methods

Data were drawn from 9,420 patients with unstable coronary syndromes from Orbofiban in Patients With Unstable Coronary Syndromes-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (OPUS-TIMI)-16, a trial that excluded patients with sCr > 1.6 mg/dl or estimated creatinine clearance < 40 ml/min.

Results

Patients with elevated BUN were older, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, and had higher heart rates, lower systolic blood pressures, and an abnormal Killip class more often on admission. In univariate analyses, as well as in stratified and multivariable analyses including sCr-based estimates of GFR as a covariate, a stepwise increase in mortality occurred with increasing BUN (multivariable hazard ratio with BUN 20 to 25 mg/dl 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 2.6; with BUN ≥ 25 mg/dl 3.2 [95% confidence interval 2.2 to 4.7]) compared with BUN ≤ 20 mg/dl. A higher BUN was also associated with increased mortality among strata of troponin-I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein concentrations.

Conclusions

Among patients with unstable coronary syndromes and predominantly normal or mildly reduced GFR, an elevated BUN is associated with increased mortality, independent of sCr-based estimates of GFR and other biomarkers.

### A case report of successfully treated nephrotic syndrome after renal angioplasty [^114qHFgH]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 48-year-old man was referred to our hospital for evaluation of azotemia and uncontrolled blood pressure. Ten years earlier, he had been diagnosed with an intracerebral hemorrhage and underwent stereotactic hematoma aspiration. Due to uncontrolled hypertension at that time, he was evaluated for secondary hypertension at admission; however, no specific findings were observed on a captopril renal scan. Since then, he had been prescribed antihypertensive drugs by a private clinic.

At his first visit to our hospital for uncontrolled hypertension, his blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg despite triple therapy with amlodipine, carvedilol, and hydrochlorothiazide. His blood urea nitrogen concentration was 23.7 mg/dl (reference, 6.0–20.0 mg/dl), his serum creatinine (sCr) concentration was 1.45 mg/dl (reference, 0.6–1.2 mg/dl), and his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the CKD-EPI equation was 57 ml/min/1.73 m 2. His serum total protein concentration was 7.4 g/dl, his serum albumin concentration was 4.5 g/dl (reference, 3.5–5.2 g/dl), his total cholesterol concentration was 292 mg/dl (reference, 120–220 mg/dl), his low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration was 195 mg/dl (reference, 0–130 mg/dl), his triglyceride concentration was 73 mg/dl (reference, 0–200 mg/dl), his plasma renin activity (PRA) was 19.32 ng/ml/hr. (reference: supine, 0.32–1.84 ng/ml/hr.; upright, 0.60–4.18 ng/ml/hr), and his spot urine protein-to-Cr ratio (uPCR) was 0.4 g/g without hematuria.

Effects of MSCs infusion in CKD

MSCs may prevent or reverse the progression of certain stages of experimental CKD, which can be demonstrated by improving renal function markers and serological indicators used clinically. Here, we mainly evaluate the efficacy of MSCs in CKD patients based on safety, renal function, and other laboratory parameters (Table 3 and 4). Major parameters include proteinuria, GFR, serum creatinine (SCr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) while others involve immune or inflammatory responses consisting of complement, interleukins, and immune cells.

### Nephrotic syndrome [^116SYQwc]. Pediatrics in Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) encompasses a variety of disease processes leading to heavy proteinuria and edema. Minimal change disease (MCD) remains the most common primary cause of NS, as well as the most responsive to pharmacologic treatment with often minimal to no chronic kidney disease. Other causes of NS include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which follows MCD, and secondary causes, including extrarenal or systemic diseases, infections, and drugs. Although initial diagnosis relies on clinical findings as well as urine and blood chemistries, renal biopsy and genetic testing are important diagnostic tools, especially when considering non-MCD NS. Moreover, biomarkers in urine and serum have become important areas for research in this disease. NS progression and prognosis are variable and depend on etiology, with corticosteroids being the mainstay of treatment. Other alternative therapies found to be successful in inducing and maintaining remission include calcineurin inhibitors and rituximab. Disease course can range from recurrent disease relapse with or without acute kidney injury to end-stage renal disease in some cases. Given the complex pathogenesis of NS, which remains incompletely understood, complications are numerous and diverse and include infections, electrolyte abnormalities, acute kidney injury, and thrombosis. Pediatricians must be aware of the presentation, complications, and overall long-term implications of NS and its treatment.

Q19: SHOULD FURTHER STUDIES BE PERFORMED IN A PATIENT PRESENTING AT DIAGNOSIS WITH NEPHROTIC SYNDROME IN WHOM A COL4A3/4/5 PATHOGENIC VARIANT IS IDENTIFIED?

19.1-Suggestion: A kidney biopsy is suggested in an individual with a P/LP COL4A3/4/5 variant if the onset of nephrotic syndrome is abrupt or the degree of proteinuria does not match the expected clinical presentation of the disease. (Grade D, expert opinion)

19.2-Suggestion: In the presence of an unexpected nephrotic syndrome and a non-specific kidney biopsy, we suggest expanding genetic testing by using a genetic panel test that includes all genes associated with inherited kidney disease or exome sequencing. (Grade D, expert opinion)

The typical histological feature of later stages of AS is FSGS, which is thought to be triggered by progressive podocyte loss and consequent focal segmental glomerular scarring. Although the exact patho-mechanisms are not well understood, most male patients with XLAS and males and females with ARAS with progressive disease can develop nephrotic range proteinuria and some even develop nephrotic syndrome. In heterozygous autosomal patients with AS, however, nephrotic syndrome is very rare and typically associated with additional contributing factors.

The amount of proteinuria can be aggravated by infections, poor blood pressure control, high body mass index, high protein intake, additional kidney disease, and during pregnancy.

In AS, nephrotic syndrome develops gradually over months and years, rather than presenting with an abrupt onset.

### Effect of low-density lipoprotein apheresis on urinary protein and podocyte excretion in patients with nephrotic syndrome due to diabetic nephropathy [^114BznrX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of the present study is to determine whether low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis affects proteinuria and urinary podocyte excretion in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephrotic syndrome.

Methods

LDL apheresis was performed on patients with diabetes with long-standing nephrotic syndrome, and urinary protein level and number of urinary podocytes were compared between these patients (5 men, 3 women; mean age, 54.6 years) and 10 nephrotic patients with diabetes not treated with LDL apheresis (6 men, 4 women; mean age, 56.5 years).

Results

LDL apheresis reduced total cholesterol (P < 0.001), LDL cholesterol (P < 0.001), lipoprotein(a) (P < 0.001), creatinine (P < 0.05), and blood urea nitrogen (P < 0.05) levels and increased creatinine clearance (P < 0.05). The LDL apheresis group showed a significant decrease in urinary protein excretion (from 10.8 ± 3.2 to 1.8 ± 1.1 g/d; P < 0.001) and number of urinary podocytes (from 4.8 ± 2.2 to 0.9 ± 0.4 cells/mL; P < 0.01).

Conclusion

These data suggest that LDL apheresis effectively reduces proteinuria and podocyte excretion, ameliorating renal dysfunction in patients with nephrotic syndrome caused by diabetic nephropathy.

### Protein energy-wasting associated with nephrotic syndrome-the comparison of metabolic pattern in severe nephrosis to different stages of chronic kidney disease [^115iiqRk]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is associated with a hypercatabolic state expressed as an exacerbated degradation of muscle mass. However, the clinical significance of this phenomenon has not yet been investigated. The aim of the study was to evaluate the nutritional status of patients with severe NS (defined as nephrotic range proteinuria with hypoalbuminemia ≤ 2.5g/dL) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 45mL/min/1.73m 2 in comparison to patients in different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

Twenty men with severe NS (NS group) and 40 men without proteinuria similar in term of serum creatinine (control group) were included into the study. A retrospective cohort of 40 men with CKD stage G4 (PreD group) and 20 haemodialysis men (HD group) were added to the analysis after matching for age, height and weight using propensity score matching. The bioimpedance spectroscopy and biochemical nutritional markers were evaluated.

Results

Nephrotic patients had a significantly lower lean tissue mass (LTM; p = 0.035) and index (a quotient of LTM over height squared, LTI; p = 0.068), with an expected deficiency of LTM by 3.2kg, and LTI by 0.9kg/m 2 when compared to the control group. A significant lean tissue deficit (defined as LTI below the lower limit of the reference range by 1.0kg/m 2) was observed in 12.5% of patients in the control group in comparison to 31.7% with advanced CKD (PreD+HD; p = 0.032) and 50% with NS (p = 0.003). NS group presented with higher phosphorus (p = 0.029), uric acid (p = 0.002) and blood urea (p = 0.049) than the control group. Blood urea was strongly negatively correlated with LTM in NS (r = -0.64, p = 0.002). Nine nephrotic patients (45%) were identified as hypercatabolic based on severe hyperphosphatemia (> 5.0mg/dL) and/or hyperuricemia (> 8.0mg/dL), and were characterized by higher blood urea and lower prealbumin, as well as LTM lower by 5.6kg than in less catabolic individuals.

Conclusions

In term of lean tissue amount, NS group was more similar to advanced CKD than to the control group. We concluded that specific metabolic pattern with elevated phosphorus, uric acid and blood urea, and lean tissue deficiency may be defined as protein-energy wasting associated with nephrotic syndrome (neph-PEW).

Case presentation

A 30-year old man came to our hospital due to a pyrexia, oliguria and general malaise that persisted for 10 days. He suddenly presented with a high fever and general malaise 10 days before and was transferred to our hospital because elevated leukocyte counts, a marked inflammatory reaction and a decline in kidney function were shown in the previous clinic (Fig. 1). He had been unable to eat or drink for more than a week due to severe appetite loss. He had a past clinical history of ulcerative colitis (UC) at the age of 23, but had been in remission for the past few years and had taken no medication for UC anymore. In addition, he was a current smoker and had habitual drinking, he also has a family history of rheumatoid arthritis in his mother. On admission, the patient's blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, pulse rate was 70/min regularly. Body temperature had risen to 38.8 °C. His body weighed 70.4 kg, despite not getting enough food and drink for nearly a month, his weight increased of 400 g from the previous months. Physical examination revealed high fever on admission, but there were no other abnormal findings including pitting edema on his limbs. The blood test showed with a moderate anemia of hemoglobin 10.5 g/dl, and a leukocytosis with 11,400/μl (neutrophil dominant). He developed severe renal impairment, with an increase of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr), 36.1 mg/dl and 6.68 mg/dl respectively. An elevated inflammatory response was noted (c-reactive protein 20.75 mg/dl) and serum procalcitonin level was elevated, but there were no obvious signs and symptoms of infection. Serum albumin was found to have decrease to 1.2 g/dl. Anti-GBM antibody was high at 184.7 U/l, but both anti-myeloperoxidase and protease 3 neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) were negative. Although he presented oliguria (< 400 ml), urine findings showed a large number of glomerular erythrocytes and diverse sediments; numerous urinary RBCs and granular cast (with high power field), and 50–99 of epithelial and waxy casts were observed (with wide field), and the results of urine biochemistry and electrolytes were as follows; protein 702 mg/dl, 5.28 was found as urine protein estimated by gram creatinine (gCr), Na 12 mmol/L, UN 244 mg/dl, Cr 133 mg/dl, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) 32.1 IU/L, and β2-microglobulin 3720 μg/l. Fractional excretion of sodium (%FEna) and of urea nitrate (%FEun) were 0.4 and was 5.57 respectively, and selectivity index (S. I.) calculated by urine IgG and transferrin was 0.30. There were no findings of cardiac enlargement and alveolar hemorrhage on the chest x-ray. Abdominal echocardiography and abdominal computed tomography showed bilateral renal swelling and no other noteworthy findings.

ACC/AHA LDL threshold consideration in CKD: although the recent ACC/AHA guidelines recommend treatment with a statin if LDL cholesterol level is ≥ 190 mg/dL regardless of other risk factors, this is not addressed in the current KDIGO lipid guideline; this may be most relevant to younger adults with nephrotic syndrome. Given the lack of clinical trials in nephrotic syndrome, it might be prudent to follow the ACC/AHA guidelines and treat individuals with LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL, especially if nephrotic syndrome is not responsive to therapy and the cause is prolonged, which could lead to treatment of younger individuals with CKD who do not currently meet risk-calculator–based recommendations.

### Lithium [^112K75Kb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Lithium-Induced Chronic Kidney Disease

The predominant form of chronic renal disease associated with long-term lithium treatment is a chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy (CTIN). The biopsy findings in patients with lithium induced CTIN include tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, sclerotic glomeruli, tubular dilation, and nephron atrophy with cyst formation. The relationship between renal function and morphologic changes and their association with lithium treatment has not been established. CTIN patients might present with nephrotic proteinuria (> 3.0g/dL), worsening renal insufficiency and/or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Postmarketing cases consistent with nephrotic syndrome in patients with or without CTIN have also been reported. The biopsy findings in patients with nephrotic syndrome include minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The discontinuation of lithium in patients with nephrotic syndrome has resulted in remission of nephrotic syndrome.

Kidney function should be assessed prior to and during lithium treatment. Routine urinalysis and other tests may be used to evaluate tubular function (e.g., urine specific gravity or osmolality following a period of water deprivation, or 24-hour urine volume) and glomerular function (e.g., serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, or proteinuria). During lithium treatment, progressive or sudden changes in renal function, even within the normal range, indicate the need for re-evaluation of treatment.

5.5 Encephalopathic Syndrome

An encephalopathic syndrome, characterized by weakness, lethargy, fever, tremulousness and confusion, extrapyramidal symptoms, leukocytosis, elevated serum enzymes, BUN and fasting blood glucose, has occurred in patients treated with lithium and an antipsychotic. In some instances, the syndrome was followed by irreversible brain damage. Because of a possible causal relationship between these events and the concomitant administration of lithium and antipsychotics, patients receiving such combined treatment should be monitored closely for early evidence of neurological toxicity and treatment discontinued promptly if such signs appear. This encephalopathic syndrome may be similar to or the same as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

### Rationale and design of the nephrotic syndrome study network (NEPTUNE) match in glomerular diseases: designing the right trial for the right patient, today [^115jsFrR]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) comprises focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease, and membranous nephropathy, which are rare glomerular diseases associated with debilitating complications, including possible progression to kidney failure. Despite similar and overlapping symptoms (e.g. edema, proteinuria, and loss of kidney function), individual clinical courses can vary markedly. The only US Food and Drug Administration–approved medical treatments are corticosteroid-based immunosuppressive agents (i.e. prednisone and adrenocorticotrophic hormone) that cause severe adverse effects. Off-label use of second-line immunosuppressive medications is currently part of guideline-based clinical care.

The clinical, histopathology-based taxonomy of NS fails to capture the underlying molecular drivers of these diseases (Figure 1). Consequently, current diagnostic categories have limited use in either predicting the disease course or responding to therapy, frequently putting patients at risk of adverse effects from treatments that prove ineffective. In addition, clinical trials in NS enroll an unstratified, biologically diverse group of individuals. This underlying mechanistic heterogeneity often results in inconclusive trial outcomes, even though the intervention may successfully target a subset of susceptible patients.

### Pathophysiology of oedema in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome [^113C58g4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

The decrease in plasma protein and colloid osmotic pressure (COP) in the nephrotic syndrome is accompanied by a decrease in tissue-fluid protein and COP. The latter protects against a fall in blood volume. However, the range and speed of this protective mechanism are limited, and a decrease in blood volume can be expected if plasma COP is below approximately 10 mmHg, or (temporarily) if the protein loss starts very fast. In addition, due to this protective mechanism volume retained by the kidneys cannot effectively expand blood volume, explaining that hypertension is rarely grave and pulmonary congestion unusual, whereas peripheral oedema can be gross. The renal derangement leading to volume retention involves a decreased filtration per nephron, increased tubular reabsorption, and decreased sensitivity to ANP but the relation between these changes is incompletely resolved.

### Reversible acute renal failure and nephrotic syndrome in a type 1 diabetic patient [^1153g84D]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2002). Low credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome is a condition commonly associated with end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy. It is usually associated with long-standing renal insufficiency, microalbuminuria, and overt proteinuria. We present a diabetic patient with acute oliguric renal failure and nephrotic syndrome. At presentation, he had a serum creatinine of 2.3 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 69 mg/dl, urinary protein excretion of 10.5 g/24 h, serum albumin of 1.3 g/dl, and a urine output < 400 cc/24 h. A renal biopsy was done and the renal pathology was compatible with early diabetic nephropathy. Despite intense diuretic therapy, the patient's renal condition did not improve, and peritoneal dialysis was started several months after diagnosis. After 8 months of dialysis therapy, the patient's renal parameters and urinary output spontaneously restored to normal limits (serum creatinine was 1.1 mg/dl, urinary albumin excretion was 411 mg/24 h, serum albumin was 4.3 g/dl, and normal urine output) and dialysis was discontinued. His renal function did not deteriorate after discontinuation of dialysis. We conclude that this patient's reversible acute renal failure and nephrotic syndrome were associated with minimal change disease and not due to diabetic nephropathy.

### Zonisamide [^1121Voth]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Tests:

In several clinical studies, zonisamide was associated with a mean increase in the concentration of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of approximately 8% over the baseline measurement. Consideration should be given to monitoring renal function periodically (see PRECAUTIONS, Effect on Renal Function subsection).

Zonisamide increases serum chloride and alkaline phosphatase and decreases serum bicarbonate (see WARNINGS, Metabolic Acidosis subsection), phosphorus, calcium, and albumin.
