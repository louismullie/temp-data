## Question

What is the optimal timeframe for repeating a thyroid panel in a patient with a low TSH level and symptoms of hyperthyroidism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal timeframe for repeating a thyroid panel in a patient with a low TSH level and symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the initial diagnosis and excluding assay or transient causes. Then, I should verify how symptoms modify urgency and monitoring cadence. Next, I will stratify by risk and consider special contexts like immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based recommendation and note caveats and exceptions, anchoring to ATA and USPSTF guidance and contemporary reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and the need to repeat testing before labeling disease, because TSH has notable biological and analytical variability and a single abnormal value is insufficient to diagnose hyperthyroidism or subclinical hyperthyroidism. I should double-check that guidelines consistently advise serial measurements to establish persistence before committing to therapy or invasive workup [^d80df50d] [^8cdd9023] [^472a8176].

> Wait, let me verify the initial evaluation elements I need to ensure are in place before deciding on timing. I should confirm that free T4 and total T3 were measured with the suppressed TSH to classify overt versus subclinical disease, and I need to check for non-thyroidal illness, medications, and assay interferences that can transiently suppress TSH, because these factors can mislead both diagnosis and timing of retesting. If the presentation is discordant, repeating the full panel now with attention to pre-analytic factors is prudent [^8f7b1e36] [^9b534a7e] [^43ec003f].

> I will now examine how symptoms change urgency. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even with symptoms, I should confirm persistence of TSH suppression before definitive therapy, but symptomatic patients warrant closer follow-up and consideration of symptomatic treatment. Let me consider that symptomatic patients may merit earlier retesting and beta-blockade while confirming the diagnosis, which aligns with ATA and primary care guidance emphasizing symptom-targeted care during confirmation [^2c0b8366] [^9b0ebfbb].

> Next, I should review risk stratification for complications, because this drives how soon I repeat testing. High-risk patients include those aged 65 or older, patients with cardiovascular disease or arrhythmias, osteoporosis, or undetectable TSH, and in these cases guidelines advise repeating TSH with free T4 within 2 to 6 weeks to promptly detect progression and initiate therapy if indicated. I need to ensure I am applying this higher-frequency pathway when risk is present [^3babb464] [^2c0b8366].

> For average-risk patients with low but detectable TSH and symptoms, I should confirm that repeating TSH with free T4 in about 3 to 6 months is appropriate to document persistence before labeling subclinical hyperthyroidism or initiating therapy. This interval balances the need to avoid premature treatment with the possibility of spontaneous normalization, which occurs in a meaningful fraction of cases over time [^3babb464] [^f8a3436f] [^bf690847].

> But wait, what if the low TSH is in the context of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy? I need to check that ICI guidelines recommend more frequent monitoring because endocrine irAEs can evolve quickly. SITC advises TSH and free T4 every 4 to 6 weeks during treatment and every 6 to 12 months after completion, so in ICI-treated patients I should shorten the interval regardless of symptoms to catch evolving thyroiditis or Graves-like disease early [^0e11c18f] [^7773df4f].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation while keeping these nuances in mind. For a symptomatic patient with a single low TSH, I should repeat TSH with free T4 and total T3 now if the initial panel is incomplete or discordant, and if the initial panel already shows suppressed TSH with normal free T4 and T3, I should repeat in 2 to 6 weeks if high risk, or in about 3 to 6 months if average risk, documenting persistence before etiologic workup or treatment. Throughout, I should consider beta-blockers for symptom control while confirming the diagnosis, and I should escalate to etiologic testing such as TRAb or uptake scan if suppression persists or free hormones rise [^3babb464] [^2c0b8366] [^11633fac].

> Hold on, I should verify exceptions and caveats so I do not overgeneralize. If the patient is on medications that suppress TSH or has non-thyroidal illness, I should extend the observation period and avoid over-calling disease. Conversely, if free T4 or T3 are already elevated, that meets criteria for overt hyperthyroidism and warrants prompt evaluation and treatment rather than waiting, so I need to ensure I am not delaying necessary therapy in overt disease [^8f7b1e36] [^2d92ae99].

> In summary, I need to ensure persistence is confirmed before diagnosing hyperthyroidism or subclinical hyperthyroidism, and the optimal retesting interval is risk- and symptom-informed: 2 to 6 weeks for high-risk or overt features, and 3 to 6 months for average-risk subclinical presentations, with earlier retesting if the clinical picture worsens or if the patient is on immune checkpoint inhibitors. This approach aligns with ATA guidance, USPSTF principles on confirming abnormal TSH, and contemporary endocrine practice recommendations [^3babb464] [^d80df50d] [^0e11c18f].

Repeat a thyroid panel in **2–6 weeks** for symptomatic patients with low TSH to confirm persistence and guide next steps [^3babb464]. If symptoms are severe or cardiac risk is high, **repeat within 2 weeks** and consider beta-blockers [^2c0b8366]. For low-risk or asymptomatic patients, **repeat in 3–6 months** to confirm persistence before treatment [^f8a3436f] [^e78c85b1]. Always interpret results in clinical context and recheck if results are discordant or if assay interference is suspected [^9b534a7e] [^43ec003f].

## Recommended timeframe for repeating thyroid panel

The ATA recommends repeating thyroid function tests in **2–6 weeks** for symptomatic patients with low TSH to confirm persistence and assess progression [^3babb464]. This interval balances the need to confirm the diagnosis with the risk of overtreatment from transient abnormalities [^8cdd9023].

---

## Clinical factors influencing the timing of repeat testing

Several factors influence the timing of repeat thyroid function tests:

- **Severity of symptoms**: Severe symptoms (e.g. palpitations, weight loss, anxiety) warrant earlier repeat testing, typically within 2 weeks [^notfound].

- **Patient age and comorbidities**: Older patients or those with cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, or atrial fibrillation may require closer monitoring due to increased risks associated with hyperthyroidism [^2c0b8366].

- **Underlying etiology**: Suspected Graves' disease, toxic nodular disease, or medication-induced hyperthyroidism may influence the timing and frequency of testing [^3babb464].

- **Assay variability**: TSH levels can fluctuate due to assay variability or transient factors; repeat testing helps confirm persistent abnormalities [^8cdd9023].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timeframe for repeat testing** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic patients with low TSH | 2–6 weeks [^3babb464] |
| Severe symptoms or high-risk patients | Within 2 weeks [^notfound] |
| Asymptomatic or low-risk patients | 3–6 months [^f8a3436f] [^e78c85b1] |
| Suspected assay interference | Repeat testing after addressing interference factors [^8f7b1e36] |

---

## Clinical implications of delayed or infrequent testing

Delayed or infrequent testing can lead to:

- **Progression to overt hyperthyroidism**: Untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism can progress to overt disease, increasing risks of atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular complications [^bf690847].

- **Delayed diagnosis and treatment**: Prolonged untreated hyperthyroidism can exacerbate symptoms and complications, particularly in older adults or those with comorbidities [^55bc3a9d].

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to more complex management and higher healthcare expenditures.

---

## Clinical implications of frequent or unnecessary testing

Frequent or unnecessary testing can lead to:

- **Overtreatment**: Treating transient or mild abnormalities can cause iatrogenic hypothyroidism or unnecessary interventions [^472a8176].

- **Patient anxiety**: Repeated testing without clinical justification can increase patient anxiety and stress.

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Unnecessary testing adds to healthcare expenditures without improving outcomes [^9b0ebfbb].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy requires careful monitoring due to maternal and fetal risks. Repeat testing is typically recommended every 4–6 weeks [^notfound].

- **Elderly patients**: Older adults may require closer monitoring due to increased risks of cardiovascular complications and osteoporosis [^2c0b8366].

- **Medication-induced hyperthyroidism**: Patients on medications such as amiodarone or interferon-alpha require periodic monitoring due to the risk of drug-induced thyroid dysfunction [^c7d8f756].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

For symptomatic patients with low TSH, **repeat thyroid function tests in 2–6 weeks** to confirm persistence and guide management [^3babb464]. Tailor the interval to symptom severity, patient risk, and suspected etiology, and avoid unnecessary testing to prevent overtreatment and anxiety [^9b0ebfbb].

Endocrine toxicity panel recommendations

The following recommendations are intended to be used within the framework of toxicity management, including direction for at what grade of toxicity to hold and/or permanently cease treatment, considerations for life-threatening toxicities, as well as recommendations on optimal timing and dosing for administration of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents by grade of AE, discussed in the General panel recommendations section. Any endocrine-specific exceptions or additional considerations are noted in the recommendations below.

Patients experiencing endocrine toxicities should be treated with hormone replacement, and immunotherapy should generally be continued as soon as patients are stable (often without interruption). Management of thyroid toxicities and T1DM generally do not require the use of corticosteroid therapy.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism

Thyroid function (TSH, fT4) should be tested every 4–6 weeks during ICI treatment, and should continue to be tested every 6–12 months following the conclusion of ICI treatment.
Patients with elevated TSH and normal fT4 should receive repeat TSH and fT4 testing routinely, and if this pattern persists without hypothyroidism symptoms then levothyroxine treatment should be considered. Levothyroxine should be administered to patients with hypothyroidism at 1.5–1.6 μg/kg/day for young, healthy patients, and should be administered at 25 or 50 μg/day for patients > 65 years of age or with heart disease.
Patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism and/or with elevated TSH and low fT4 should be tested for morning cortisol to identify possible concurrent adrenal insufficiency.
Patients with low TSH and normal fT4 should receive repeat TSH and fT4 testing routinely, and if symptoms of hyperthyroidism or high fT4 develop patients should be treated with beta-blockers. Patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be treated with cardioselective beta-blockers such as atenolol or metoprolol.
Patients with persistently low TSH and high fT4 should be evaluated for hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease etiology.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — treatment of SH should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease or symptoms of hyperthyroidism (2/+00). Persistence in this range is defined as a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period; the thyroid disorder underlying SH should be diagnosed to avoid treating transient, functional disorders related to acute illness, drugs, and other causes of low TSH. In symptomatic patients, a trial of beta-adrenergic blockers may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^d4cafc0d]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Approach to the patient with a suppressed TSH [^55bc3a9d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is a laboratory diagnosis defined by a serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration below the reference range (< 0.4 mU/L in most assays), and a free thyroxine (FT4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine levels (FT3) in the reference range. Many patients diagnosed with SCH will be clinically euthyroid while others may present with manifestations characteristic of thyroid hormone excess, such as tachycardia, tremor, intolerance to heat, bone density loss, or weight loss. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities, patient factors such as age, symptoms, and underlying heart and bone disease are used to stratify patients for the risk of adverse outcomes and determine the appropriate treatment. Evaluation should include repeat thyroid function tests to document persistent TSH suppression, investigation of the underlying cause, as well as evaluation of the patient's risk of adverse outcomes in the setting of a subnormal TSH. Persistent SCH has been associated with an increased risk of a range of adverse events, including cardiovascular events such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure, bone loss and fracture, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Despite the consistent association of these adverse events with SCH, prospective studies showing improved outcomes with treatment remain limited. Management options include observation without active therapy, radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid, antithyroid medication, thyroid surgery, or radiofrequency ablation, as appropriate for the patient and clinical setting. The choice of therapy should be guided by the underlying etiology of disease, patient factors, and the risks and benefits of each treatment option.

American Thyroid Association 2016 — TRAb measurement before stopping antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy suggests measuring TRAb levels prior to stopping as it aids in predicting which patients can be weaned, with normal levels indicating greater chance for remission, and rates this as a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^3babb464]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — causes and retesting guidance indicate that in clinical series, TMNG is the most common cause of SH, especially in older persons, and the second most common cause is Graves' disease (GD), which is more prevalent in younger persons and is also common in those who previously received antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy; other causes include solitary autonomously functioning nodules and various forms of thyroiditis. For monitoring, in patients at high risk of complications from SH, TSH and free T4 should be repeated within 2–6 weeks, and for all other patients the serum TSH should be repeated at 3–6 months prior to initiating therapy.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^2482b1d4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^bb03addf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement? [^80fb55bf]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^8f7b1e36]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy — thyroid function (TSH, fT4) should be tested every 4–6 weeks during ICI treatment, and should continue to be tested every 6–12 months following the conclusion of ICI treatment. Levothyroxine should be administered to patients with hypothyroidism at 1.5–1.6 μg/kg/day for young, healthy patients, and should be administered at 25 or 50 μg/day for patients > 65 years of age or with heart disease. Patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism and/or with elevated TSH and low fT4 should be tested for morning cortisol to identify possible concurrent adrenal insufficiency. Patients with low TSH and normal fT4 should receive repeat TSH and fT4 testing routinely, and if symptoms of hyperthyroidism or high fT4 develop patients should be treated with beta-blockers; patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be treated with cardioselective beta-blockers such as atenolol or metoprolol. Patients with persistently low TSH and high fT4 should be evaluated for hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease etiology.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^e2a5f855]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^22fb1b8f]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^e78c85b1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction screening — test interpretation and confirmation in asymptomatic adults indicates that accurate interpretation of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is further complicated by measurement variability and conditions other than thyroid disease, and many professional groups recommend repeating thyroid function tests for confirmation of persistent dysfunction over 3- to 6-month intervals in asymptomatic persons before diagnosis or treatment unless the serum TSH level is greater than 10.0 or less than 0.1 mIU/L.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — overdiagnosis and natural history observations note that many persons labeled with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state over time and that this especially includes those with "subclinical" disease who have "mildly elevated" TSH levels of 4.5 to 10.0 mIU/L.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^bf690847]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) — prevalence and natural history show that in a representative U.S. sample without known thyroid disease, 0.7% had suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/L) and 1.8% had low TSH (< 0.4 mU/L). The natural history is variable, with annualized rates of 0.5%–7% progression to overt hyperthyroidism and 5%–12% reversion to normal TSH levels. Progression to overt hyperthyroidism appears more likely when TSH is suppressed (< 0.01 mIU/L) rather than low but detectable (0.01–0.4 mIU/L).

### Genome-wide association study of thyroid-stimulating hormone highlights new genes, pathways and associations with thyroid disease [^63712359]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Given questions about how best to deploy and repeat testing for thyroid disease in asymptomatic patients and in patients with non-specific symptoms, we explored whether membership of a high or low risk decile for TSH PGS was associated with differences in age of onset of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism (Online Methods). Between individuals with median, highest and lowest deciles of the TSH PGS, clear differences were seen in age of onset of hypothyroidism (P < 1.0 × 10 −300, Fig. 6a) and hyperthyroidism (P = 4.30 × 10 −61, Fig. 6b). For example, a 5% prevalence of hypothyroidism was reached by age 51.1 years in the highest TSH PGS decile versus by 74.7 years in the lowest TSH PGS decile. Similarly a 1% prevalence of hyperthyroidism was reached by age 47.3 years in the lowest PGS decile compared with 71.2 years in the highest TSH PGS decile. Results from sensitivity analyses excluding individuals who were included in our Stage 1 analysis or share at least 2nd degree relatedness with individuals included in the Stage 1 analysis were consistent with the findings described here (Supplementary Figs. 7, 8 and 9).

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^5f51abf5]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and can be treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have given guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^824d4918]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^e2db076f]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Graves' disease after 131I therapy — follow-up and monitoring should include an assessment of free T4 and total T3 within the first 1–2 months, with biochemical monitoring continued at 4–6 week intervals if the patient remains thyrotoxic; most patients normalize thyroid function and symptoms within 4–8 weeks, hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks on but more commonly between 2 and 6 months, once euthyroidism is achieved lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended, and since TSH levels may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves they should be interpreted cautiously and only in concert with free T4 and T3 estimates.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^2d92ae99]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^5813fa7a]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Monitoring of patients taking antithyroid drugs: An assessment of serum free T4 should be obtained about 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, and the dose of medication adjusted accordingly, and serum T3 also may be monitored since serum free T4 may normalize with persistent elevation of serum T3. Appropriate monitoring intervals are every 4–8 weeks until euthyroid values are achieved with the minimal dose of medication, after which biochemical testing and clinical evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and an assessment of serum free T4 and TSH are required before treatment and at intervals after starting treatment.

### Thinking through testing for primary thyroid disease… [^9b0ebfbb]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

For patients with symptoms of thyroid disease, and when there is clinical suspicion for thyroid disease, testing for TSH levels is preferred initially. 1, 2 If TSH levels are elevated, free T 4 levels should be obtained. 1 If TSH levels are below normal limits, free T 4 and total T 3 levels should be obtained for diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
2. 8 Measuring TSH levels is also recommended as the first-line test for pregnant patients with a personal or family history of thyroid disorders, type 1 diabetes, or a clinical concern for thyroid disease. In pregnant patients with hypothyroidism, TSH levels should be maintained between the trimester-specific lower limit and 2. 5 mIU/L, and TSH measurement should be obtained every 4 to 6 weeks to ensure appropriate levels of levothyroxine.
8.

Other causes of abnormal TSH levels, such as medication use, sick euthyroid syndrome, and pituitary or hypothalamic disease, should be considered before the diagnosis of primary thyroid disease. 9 In a pooled analysis of 2, 335 older adults in Europe, 60. 8% of those with subclinical hypothyroidism experienced spontaneous normalization of thyroid function within 1 year. 10 Additionally, biotin supplements should be held for 2 days before measuring TSH levels because biotin can suppress TSH, leading to false-positive findings for hyperthyroidism.
2. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by suppressed TSH and normal free T 4 levels. TSH should be retested in 3 to 6 months to confirm subclinical hyperthyroidism before starting treatment. If a patient is at high risk of complications from untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH and free T 4 should be retested within 2 to 6 weeks. Clinicians should follow a guideline-based approach for the evaluation of thyroid disease.

Routinely performing full thyroid panels should be avoided. Testing for TSH levels should be performed initially, with reflex testing when indicated. Screening should be avoided in asymptomatic patients. When treating primary thyroid disease, TSH levels should be used to guide dosing. By reassessing how we approach thyroid function testing, we can reduce overtreatment, minimize unnecessary health care costs, and improve patient outcomes.

Antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy — monitoring schedule and dose adjustment: An assessment of serum free T4 and total T3 should be obtained about 2–6 weeks after initiation, and serum T3 should be monitored because serum free T4 may normalize despite persistent elevation of serum total T3; serum TSH may remain suppressed for several months and is therefore not a good early monitoring parameter. Once euthyroid, methimazole (MMI) dose can be decreased by 30%–50% with biochemical testing repeated in 4–6 weeks; once euthyroid on the minimal dose, evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and if receiving long-term MMI (> 18 months), the interval can be increased to 6 months.

Rating of the recommendations — GRADE approach and strength labels: The task force elected to rate the recommendations according to the system developed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (Group). The strength of a recommendation is indicated as a strong recommendation (for or against) that applies to most patients in most circumstances with benefits of action clearly outweighing the risks and burdens (or vice versa), or a weak recommendation or a suggestion that may not be appropriate for every patient, depending on context, patient values, and preferences, and the quality of evidence is indicated as low-quality evidence, moderate-quality evidence, or high-quality evidence. In several instances, the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against a test or a treatment, and the task force made a statement labeled "no recommendation", and each recommendation is preceded by a description of the evidence and, in some cases, followed by a remarks section including technical suggestions on issues such as dosing and monitoring.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^472a8176]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^8cdd9023]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

Graves' disease persistent hyperthyroidism after radioactive iodine (RAI) — When hyperthyroidism due to GD persists after 6 months following RAI therapy, retreatment with RAI is suggested, and in selected patients with minimal response 3 months after therapy additional RAI may be considered (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Response to RAI therapy can be assessed by monitoring the size of the gland, thyroid function, and clinical signs and symptoms; the goal of retreatment is to control hyperthyroidism with certainty by rendering the patient hypothyroid, patients with persistent, suppressed TSH with normal total T3 and free T4 may not require immediate retreatment but should be monitored closely, and in the small percentage refractory to several applications of RAI, surgery should be considered.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^fe61ed3c]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone testing — triiodothyronine (T3) measurement is positioned as follows: Many laboratories prefer total triiodothyronine (TT3) rather than free triiodothyronine (fT3) because of concerns about fT3 immunoassay reliability; in hypothyroidism, T3 can remain within the reference interval, so T3 measurement in suspected hypothyroidism or with increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is of limited clinical value; in hyperthyroidism, circulating T3 increases before T4 and T3 analysis can provide clinically relevant information in patients with suppressed TSH; in nonthyroidal illness, a T3 concentration below the reference interval is the hallmark and T3 measurement is unlikely to be diagnostically relevant; however, it can be useful in patients with low TSH and concomitant systemic or organ-specific disease to help distinguish hyperthyroidism from the nonthyroidal illness syndrome or identify coexistence of hyperthyroidism and intercurrent illness.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^ca9f6d0d]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### GRADE-ADOLOPMENT of hyperthyroidism treatment guidelines for a Pakistani context [^e70cf50e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

The second recommendation to undergo the adaptation process was related to thyroid status testing post-treatment by radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy for Graves' Disease (GD). The source EBCPG recommends assessing free T4 (FT4), total T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) amongst patients within 1–2 months after patients with GD receive RAI therapy, followed by 4–6 weekly testing for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement This recommendation was modified to advise the assessment of only FT4 at initial follow-up, with subsequent TSH assessment only in the case of low T4. The keystone of this modification was the consensus that FT4 alone is a sufficiently sensitive modality to detect post-RAI hypothyroidism, and that TSH suppression in the post-RAI period may limit its accuracy in reflecting thyroid status. In fact, this misleading suppression of TSH after RAI therapy may prompt the physician to initiate thioamides unnecessarily. Moreover, in Pakistan, the use of a single FT4 test (ranges from $4.92–8.30) is about a third the price of a full panel consisting of FT4, T3 and TSH ($12.7–18.1). In fact, a sizeable percentage (48.8%) of the overall management costs for hyperthyroidism are attributable to laboratory testing. Lastly, if both the initial FT4 and subsequent TSH assessment reflect hypothyroidism, and thyroid hormone replacement is initiated and optimized, long-term assessment of treatment effectiveness can be monitored by TSH alone. To facilitate adherence to follow-up and routine post-operative testing, it is recommended that public and private laboratories in Pakistan should partner with healthcare centers to create comprehensive and appropriate care packages which include all post-treatment management and surveillance.

### Laboratory testing in hyperthyroidism [^c0954134]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of hypo- or hyperthyroidism is difficult (full text available online: http://education.amjmed.com/pp1/272). Clinical symptoms and signs are often non-specific, and there is incomplete correlation between structural and functional thyroid gland changes. Laboratory testing is therefore indispensible in establishing the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. Similar considerations apply to treatment monitoring. Laboratory testing also plays a crucial role in establishing the most likely cause for a patient's hyperthyroidism. Finally, during pregnancy, when isotopic scanning is relatively contraindicated and ultrasound is more difficult to interpret, laboratory testing becomes even more important.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^5c15f5fa]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

4) and triiodothyronine levels, or low TSH levels and normal T 4and T 3levels. Individuals with symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, or those with a history of thyroid disease or treatment, are excluded from this definition and are not the subject of these recommendations. When used to confirm suspected thyroid disease in patients referred to a specialty endocrine clinic, TSH has a high sensitivity and specificity. When used for screening primary care populations, the positive predictive value of TSH in detecting thyroid disease is low; further, the interpretation of a positive test result often is complicated by an underlying illness or by frailty of the patient. In general, values for serum TSH below 0. 1 mU per L are considered low, and values above
6. 5 mU per L are considered elevated.

6 The accuracy of TSH screening in primary care patients is difficult to evaluate, as TSH often is considered the "gold standard" for assessing thyroid function. A severe nonthyroid disease can lead to a false-positive TSH test result; in a recent systematic review of TSH used to screen patients admitted to acute care and geriatric hospitals, the positive predictive value of a low TSH was 0. 24 for hyperthyroidism and
0. 06 for hypothyroidism. Recommendations of Other Groups The American Thyroid Association 20 recommends measuring thyroid function in all adults beginning at age 35 years and every five years thereafter, noting that more frequent screening may be appropriate in high-risk or symptomatic individuals. The Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination 21 recommends maintaining a high index of clinical suspicion for nonspecific symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism when examining perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

The American College of Physicians 22 recommends screening women older than 50 with one or more general symptoms that could be caused by thyroid disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists 23 recommends TSH measurement in women of childbearing age before pregnancy or during the first trimester. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 24 recommends that physicians be aware of the symptoms and risk factors for postpartum thyroid dysfunction and evaluate patients when indicated. The American Academy of Family Physicians 25 recommends against routine thyroid screening in asymptomatic patients younger than age 60.

### Screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant adults: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^5bca9d05]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor for developing symptomatic thyroid disease. Advocates of screening argue that early treatment can prevent serious morbidity in individuals who are found to have laboratory evidence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Purpose

This article focuses on whether it is useful to order a thyroid function test for patients who have no history of thyroid disease and have few or no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, supplemented by searches of EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and a local database of thyroid-related articles.

Study Selection

Controlled treatment studies that used thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as an inclusion criterion and reported quality of life, symptoms, or lipid level outcomes were selected. Observational studies of the prevalence, progression, and consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction were also reviewed.

Data Extraction

The quality of each trial was assessed by using preset criteria, and information about setting, patients, interventions, and outcomes was abstracted.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of unsuspected thyroid disease is lowest in men and highest in older women. Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment in patients found by screening to have subclinical thyroid dysfunction is inconclusive. No trials of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism have been done. Several small, randomized trials of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism have been done, but the results are inconclusive except in patients who have a history of treatment of Graves disease, a subgroup that is not a target of screening in the general population. Data on the adverse effects of broader use of L-thyroxine are sparse.

Conclusion

It is uncertain whether treatment will improve quality of life in otherwise healthy patients who have abnormal TSH levels and normal free thyroxine levels.

Management of confirmed hypophysitis includes replacement of deficient hormones (physiologic doses of steroids and thyroid hormone). In the presence of both adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism, steroids should always be started prior to thyroid hormone in order to avoid an adrenal crisis. High doses of steroids are necessary in the setting of severe headaches, vision changes or adrenal crisis. Both adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism appear to represent long term sequelae of hypophysitis and lifelong hormonal replacement is needed in most cases. All patients with adrenal insufficiency should be instructed to obtain and carry a medical alert bracelet.

Thyroid dysfunction

Thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis) was reported in 6–20% of patients in large phase 3 clinical trials.

Hypothyroidism

Patients with unexplained fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, cold intolerance, constipation, depression and other recognized symptoms should be suspected of having hypothyroidism. Lab tests showing high TSH and low free T4 are indicative of biochemical hypothyroidism and, if present, additional testing for thyroid antibodies such as thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody is warranted. Patients with confirmed hypothyroidism should be started on thyroid hormone, with repeat TSH and free T4 levels evaluated 6–8 weeks later. Once a maintenance dose is identified (TSH within normal range) clinical and biochemical re-evaluation should be undertaken every 12 months.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^94c97b90]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone suppression of TSH — Postoperative levothyroxine to decrease thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is considered optimal for higher-risk papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, and the NCCN Panel recommends tailoring suppression to individual risk. For known residual carcinoma or high risk of recurrence, the recommended TSH level is < 0.1 mIU/L; for disease-free, low-risk patients, TSH should be maintained at the normal range; and for low-risk patients with imaging negative but concerning Tg, TSH should be maintained at 0.1–0.5 mIU/L. Potential toxicities include cardiac tachyarrhythmias, bone demineralization, and frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis; therefore, an adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 units/day) is recommended when TSH is chronically suppressed, and reports do not suggest altered bone mineral density in patients receiving levothyroxine.

Biological variability of TSH and thyroid hormone concentrations — within- versus between-subject patterns: The log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship illustrates both within- and between-subject biological variability in healthy individuals and increases with illness, with studies in twins and repeated sampling showing markedly lower within-subject variability than between-subject variations. Such studies reveal that heritability accounts for 30% to 65% of the variance in TSH, fT4, fT3, and the fT4 × TSH product, and population-based reference intervals are much broader than within-subject variance and consequently are less useful for monitoring an individual patient.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

Recommendation 63 — TSH-stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) testing: In ATA low-risk and intermediate-risk patients who have had remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy and negative cervical ultrasound (US), serum Tg should be measured at 6–18 months on thyroxine therapy with a sensitive Tg assay (< 0.2 ng/mL), or after TSH stimulation to verify absence of disease (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Repeat TSH-stimulated Tg testing is not recommended for low- and intermediate-risk patients with an excellent response to therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Subsequent TSH-stimulated Tg testing may be considered in patients with an indeterminate, biochemical incomplete, or structural incomplete response following additional therapies or a spontaneous decline in Tg on thyroid hormone therapy over time in order to reassess response to therapy and disease status (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Subsequent stimulated testing is rarely needed for those with NED, and the use of sensitive Tg assays may obviate TSH stimulation when Tg on LT4 treatment is below 0.1–0.2 ng/mL.

Methods to Detect Analytical Interference in Assays or Diagnose Entities

The ability to detect assay interference, and to estimate the true concentration of circulating THs or TSH, will depend on additional methods available in the clinical laboratory. Some additional tests can be undertaken in a general laboratory, whereas other measurements are best performed in a specialist reference laboratory. As even the simple methods described here cannot be used on every sample, interpreting results in conjunction with clinical context (eg, discordance between TFTs and clinical status of patient) or knowledge of laboratory systems (eg, an unexpected change in TFT pattern compared with previous measurements) can be very helpful. Grossly discordant, widely variable, or extremely deranged results usually raise suspicion of interference; unhelpfully, it is more subtle interference, causing plausible biochemical patterns, which can lead to diagnostic confusion and possibly unnecessary further investigation or intervention. Furthermore, in some situations, the presence of assay interference precludes accurate estimation of true TSH or TH values, requiring management of patients using clinical thyroid status rather than laboratory measurements.

Thyroid disease — biochemical characterization of hypothyroidism and resistance: Hypothyroidism is characterized by the relative or absolute reductions in serum levels of thyroxine (T4), and serum levels of total or free triiodothyronine (T3) are not reliable markers of hypothyroidism; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is elevated in primary hypothyroidism but is typically low or inappropriately normal in central hypothyroidism due to pituitary (secondary) or hypothalamic (tertiary) disorders, and patients with generalized thyroid hormone resistance usually have high concentrations of T3 and T4 with inappropriately normal or elevated TSH and variable degrees of hypothyroid and hyperthyroid symptoms.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^34ead0d9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

### The management of subclinical hyperthyroidism by thyroid specialists [^2af1d334]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a relatively common condition for which prospectively derived evidenced-based management guidelines do not exist. We have conducted a case-based mail survey to solicit opinions from members of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) about various issues that arise in the management of patients with this disorder. The survey was completed and returned by 185 of 300 (62%) of the original survey recipients. Four hypothetical cases varying in age, thyrotropin (TSH) level and underlying etiology were presented. The majority of respondents recommended further evaluation of all cases, most commonly choosing a radioactive iodine uptake (42%-71%), thyroid scan (39%-68%) and antithyroid (TPO/Tg) antibodies (49%-55%) as the additional tests to be ordered. The large majority (84%) recommended observation rather than active treatment for a young patient with a low but detectable serum TSH level. A small majority also recommended observation alone for a young woman with an undetectable serum TSH level (58%) and for an older woman with a low but detectable serum TSH value (63%). However, the majority (66%) favored treating an older woman with an undetectable serum TSH. When treatment was advised in the patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, the respondents strongly favored anti-thyroid drugs when the etiology was Graves' disease and radioactive iodine when the etiology was toxic nodular thyroid disease. In the absence of adequate evidence-based guidelines, it is hoped that this survey of expert opinions may provide useful guidance for physicians providing care for patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced thyroid dysfunction — screening and follow-up emphasize that "the majority of patients in whom thyroid dysfunction develops after ICI therapy are asymptomatic", and "all patients should be tested (TSH and free T4) at the baseline prior to therapy". Ongoing surveillance is advised with "frequent monitoring with each cycle or every 4 to 6 weeks from the start of ICI therapy or as needed… should allow for the detection of evolving thyroid disease". Baseline antibodies are not definitive because "Evidence for the measurement of the levels of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies at the baseline to predict future thyroid dysfunction is still emerging", though "additional laboratory investigations for TSH receptor antibodies… and thyroglobulin may help to distinguish the diagnoses", and "Additional imaging… may have a role in select cases". Management notes that "ICI therapy need not be interrupted or discontinued in cases of thyroid-related side effects", while "Patients with overt hypothyroidism (a low level of free T4 and persistently elevated level of TSH of more than twice the upper limit of the normal range) will require thyroid hormone replacement".

Evaluation for potential hyperthyroidism

If the TSH levels are less than the normal range (< 0.4 mU/L), the TSH testing should be repeated within 4 weeks. Free T4 (normal range, 0.7–1.9 ng/dL), free T3 (normal range, 230–619 pg/dL), and TSH-receptor antibody levels (normal range, ≤ 1.75 IU/L) should also be assessed, with tests of free T4 and/or free T3 repeated every 4–6 weeks until levels return to normal, or treatment/referral to a specialist is indicated. Slightly low TSH levels (0.2–0.4 mU/L) with normal free T4 and free T3 levels are consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism, and TSH can be monitored. If the patient is symptomatic with palpitations or tremor or has tachycardia, treatment with a beta-blocker may be initiated immediately (while waiting for results). Often larger doses are required for treatment of hyperthyroidism (e.g. propranolol, 80 mg daily) than might be used for heart disease or hypertension.

Overt hyperthyroidism is suspected if TSH is suppressed with elevated free T4 and/or free T3 (Fig. 2). If the patient has a positive TSH-receptor antibody titer, then a diagnosis of Graves' disease is confirmed, whereas a negative result suggests a diagnosis of painless thyroiditis. An alternative method of distinguishing Graves' disease from painless thyroiditis is with a nuclear medicine thyroid radioiodine uptake test, although the use of TSH-receptor antibody in place of thyroid nuclear scans is recommended based on lower cost and a shorter turnaround time. Overt hyperthyroidism on the basis of Graves' disease should prompt a referral to an endocrinologist for management, which may include anti-thyroid medications, radioiodine ablation, or thyroidectomy. Painless thyroiditis or subclinical hyperthyroidism may be followed by monthly TSH and free T4 monitoring until progression to overt hyperthyroidism and/or spontaneous normalization of results, whereupon resuming TSH testing every 3 months can continue.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^de885b19]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Reference intervals in the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction: treating patients not numbers [^04891885]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Although assigning a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction appears quite simple, this is often not the case. Issues that make it unclear whether thyroid function is normal include transient changes in thyroid parameters, inter-individual and intra-individual differences in thyroid parameters, age-related differences, and ethnic variations. In addition, a statistically calculated distribution of thyroid analytes does not necessarily coincide with intervals or cutoffs that have predictive value for beneficial or adverse health outcomes. Based on current clincial trial data, it is unclear which individuals with mild thyroid-stimulating hormone elevations will benefit from levothyroxine treatment. For example, only a small number of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone values of more than 10 mIU/L have been studied in a randomised manner. Even if therapy is initiated for abnormal thyroid function, not all treated individuals are maintained at the desired treatment target, and therefore might still be at risk. The consequence of this is that each patient's thyroid function needs to be assessed on an individual basis with the entire clinical picture in mind. Monitoring also needs to be vigilant, and the targets for treatment reassessed continually.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^9b534a7e]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Despite being the most performed laboratory endocrine investigation, the optimum use of thyroid tests (thyrotropin [TSH] and thyroid hormone [TH] measurement) is open to question and the interpretation of the results from these tests can be ambiguous. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) with its expertise support the endeavor of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) to improve and maintain standardization and harmonization of thyroid testing. ATA mandated an international interdisciplinary working group panel to survey the status of thyroid testing by reviewing the recent literature to revise or update the criteria as needed in mutual agreement and to inform clinical care.

Summary:

This review represents the conclusions on the clinical use of current routine TSH and TH (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) assays, taking into account geographic differences in disease prevalence and clinical and laboratory practice among writing members. The interaction between physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological factors and thyroid assays can affect their measurements and confound result interpretation. These factors need to be considered in the clinical context of the patient for appropriate test ordering and result interpretation. Despite significant advances in laboratory methods over the past 50 years, routine thyroid assays remain susceptible to idiosyncratic analytical interference that may produce spurious results. Improved standardization needs to be demonstrated through ongoing international efforts before results from different assays can be considered equivalent. Emerging technology (e.g. mass spectrometry) shows promise for improved analytical performance, but more evidence of its clinical utility and improved throughput is required before it can be considered for routine use. Close clinical–laboratory collaboration is encouraged to overcome and avoid the pitfalls in thyroid testing as well as resolve clinically discrepant results. The evidence base supporting the conclusions of this review is summarized in four detailed online technical supplements.

Conclusions:

Over the past five decades, testing for TSH, T4, and T3 has evolved from manual radioisotopic immunoassays to nonisotopic multiplexed immunometric assays using highly automated equipment. Despite these technical advances, physicians and laboratorians performing these analyses must understand limitations of these methods to properly order tests and interpret results.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: screening and management [^f20d5445]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Elevated TSH and normal FT4 — infant hyperthyrotropinemia management is guided by expert opinion using confirmatory thresholds and close follow-up. On the basis of expert opinion, if the confirmatory serum TSH is > 20 mIU/L, L-T4 treatment should be initiated even if FT4 is normal. If the confirmatory serum TSH is elevated but ≤ 20 mIU/L, treatment may be initiated, or alternatively serum TSH and FT4 may be followed closely every 1 to 2 weeks without treatment. Because repeated TSH elevation above 10 mIU/L has been associated with adverse outcomes in children with congenital hypothyroidism, expert opinion suggests that persistent TSH elevation > 10 mIU/L is an indication to initiate L-T4 treatment. For persistent elevations between 5 and 10 mIU/L after 4 weeks of age, the upper limit of normal TSH in infants age 1 to 3 months is around 4.1 to 4.8 mIU/L, and although TSH elevation above 5 mIU/L beyond 1 to 3 months is generally abnormal, there is insufficient evidence to support treatment versus observation; consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist can facilitate a patient-specific management plan.

Thyroid hormone suppression of TSH — postoperative levothyroxine is considered optimal to decrease TSH in patients with higher-risk papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, but the NCCN Panel recommends tailoring the degree of TSH suppression to individual risk because optimal serum levels have not been defined. For patients with known residual carcinoma or those at high risk for recurrence, the recommended TSH level is < 0.1 mU/L; for patients who are disease free and at low risk for recurrence, TSH levels should be maintained at the normal range; and for patients at low risk with imaging negative but Tg levels concerning for disease, TSH levels should be maintained at 0.1–0.5 mU/L. Potential toxicities associated with TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine include cardiac tachyarrhythmias, bone demineralization, and frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, so an adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 units/day) is recommended for patients whose TSH levels are chronically suppressed; reports do not suggest that bone mineral density is altered in patients receiving levothyroxine.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: role of TRAbs [^c9bcda87]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Remission in GD is usually defined as normal serum levels of T3, fT4, and TSH after 1 year of treatment discontinuation. Remission rates in GD vary significantly from 30–70% in various studies. Lower remission rates are seen among children, men, smokers, patients with large goitres, and patients with more active disease. The optimal duration of maintenance therapy with ATDs is 12–18 months. Remission is not influenced by the duration of therapy, and prolonged therapy with ATD is more often associated with adverse effects. At the end of 18 months of ATD therapy, TRAb assessment will help define further course of action. Patients with low or undetectable TRAbs levels have a high probability of permanent remission: GD may relapse in around 20–30% of such patients after stopping ATD therapy. On the other hand, patients with persistently elevated TRAbs levels are unlikely to be in remission and require further therapy, and GD may relapse in around 80–100% of such patients after stopping ATD therapy. Patients with elevated TRAbs levels after 18 months of ATD can be counselled to continue ATD therapy and repeat TRAbs measurement after another 12–18 months. Alternatively, definitive treatments such as RAI or thyroidectomy may be offered to these patients.

ATD treatment monitoring may be done by clinical examination and measuring serum levels of T3, fT4 and TSH at regular intervals, which can range from once every 2–6 months. Lack of normalization of TRAbs level during therapy was associated with ineffective treatment in a study; however, in this study TRAbs levels were estimated at baseline and after 12 or 18 months of therapy. Evidence is insufficient to recommend measurement of serum TRAbs levels in shorter intervals for monitoring of ATD treatment efficacy.

Laboratory evaluation of thyroid nodules — The high sensitivity of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assay makes it the most useful laboratory test in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules, and third-generation TSH chemiluminometric assays, with detection limits of about 0.01 μU/mL, should be used; if the serum TSH level is within the reference range (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism), the measurement of free thyroid hormones adds no further relevant information. To limit unnecessary laboratory testing, the following strategy should be followed for most patients: serum TSH within normal limits — no further testing (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism); increased serum TSH — test FT4 and TPOAb to evaluate for hypothyroidism; decreased serum TSH — test FT4 and total or FT3 to evaluate for hyperthyroidism.

Thyroid nodule evaluation — serum thyrotropin (TSH) and radionuclide scan — With the discovery of a thyroid nodule > 1 cm in any diameter, a serum TSH level should be obtained, and if the serum TSH is subnormal, a radionuclide thyroid scan should be obtained to document whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning, isofunctioning, or nonfunctioning. Since hyperfunctioning nodules rarely harbor malignancy, if one corresponds to the nodule, no cytologic evaluation is necessary, although if overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism is present, additional evaluation is required. A higher serum TSH level, even within the upper part of the reference range, is associated with increased risk of malignancy in a thyroid nodule, as well as more advanced stage thyroid cancer.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^b8cfe5d7]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism therapy — biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to "normal" generally not an endpoint.

### The utility of laboratory testing for suspected hyperthyroidism in the emergency department [^f9573c2a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Given signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism are non-specific, thyroid studies may be completed to evaluate patients with vague complaints such as tachycardia in the emergency department (ED). We sought to determine how often a new diagnosis of hyperthyroidism was made in patients who underwent thyroid laboratory testing in the ED.

Objectives

The primary outcome of this study was a new diagnosis in the ED, or in the following 30 days, of hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis following ED thyroid laboratory testing.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review study in a single ED of all patients who had a TSH or free T4 ordered from 2007 to 2018, or a TSH value below, or a free T4 higher than the local reference ranges. Patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism were excluded.

Results

12,366 patients underwent thyroid laboratory testing, and 12,244 patients were included. Of included patients, 655(5.4%) had abnormal thyroid studies, and 95(0.8%) patients received a new diagnosis of hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. The sensitivity and specificity of tachycardia for the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism was 70%(95% CI 62% to 77%) and 62%(95% CI 61% to 63%), respectively; and the positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.8(95% CI 1.7 to 2.0) and 0.5(95% CI 0.4 to 0.6), respectively.

Conclusion

This study suggests that thyroid laboratory studies may be best used for a focused assessment for thyroid disorders rather than a screening tool for patients with one symptom of hyperthyroidism.

Nodules benign by FNA — Follow-up — Perform clinical follow-up of FNA benign nodules, unless symptomatic. Consider a repeat clinical and US examination and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement in approximately 12 months in accordance with clinical setting. If nodules are unchanged at the first US control, repeat the US follow-up after 24 months. In asymptomatic nodules with a repeated benign cytology and no suspicious clinical or US features, routine follow-up may be avoided. In nodules with benign cytology but suspicious clinical or US features, a repeat FNA is recommended. In nodules with an increase > 50% in volume or that become symptomatic, we recommend repeat FNA.

Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.

### Screening and management of thyroid disease… [^11cd69b1]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

If the TSH level is less than 0. 3 to
0. 4 μU per mL or greater than 10 μU per mL, determination of the free thyroxine level is recommended. Screening is not recommended in women less than age 50 or in men because the prevalence of unsuspected symptomatic thyroid dysfunction is low in these populations. Persons found to have subclinical hyperthyroidism are at increased risk for atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis and progression to overt disease. The optimal management of patients without goiter or ocular findings of Graves' disease is uncertain, but the author recommends repeat measurements of TSH, T 4 and T 3 every six to 12 months. Persons with subclinical hypothyroidism are at increased risk for hypercholesterolemia and progression to overt hypothyroidism.

The effectiveness of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is uncertain; three small unrandomized trials yielded conflicting results. Observation is appropriate for persons with TSH levels between 5 and 10 μU per mL. A TSH of greater than 10 μU per mL or a high antithyroid antibody titer is associated with an increased risk of complications, and levothyroxine therapy may be appropriate. The author notes that previous studies suggested that the addition of thyroid hormone to long-term methimazole or propylthiouracil therapy in patients with Graves' disease increased the likelihood of remission when antithyroid drug therapy was discontinued. More recently, several large randomized studies have failed to confirm that levothyroxine promotes remission in patients receiving antithyroid therapy. In the author's opinion, a one-year course of TSH-suppressive therapy can be started in younger patients and continued only if nodule size has decreased.

In older patients, in whom thyroid supplementation may decrease bone mineral density or increase the risk of atrial fibrillation and cardiac hypertrophy, the potential adverse effects of TSH suppression may outweigh any benefit.
