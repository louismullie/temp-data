## Question

Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental extraction in the setting of joint prosthetic.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antibiotic prophylaxis is needed before dental extraction in a patient with a prosthetic joint, and if so, what regimen should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality guideline positions and the strength of their recommendations. Then, I should verify the direct evidence on whether dental procedures increase prosthetic joint infection risk and whether prophylaxis reduces that risk. Next, I will examine potential harms and costs of prophylaxis. After that, I need to consider any legitimate exceptions or high-risk subgroups. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and confirm the bottom line for this specific scenario of extraction in a typical prosthetic joint patient.

> Let me first confirm the guideline consensus, because that frames the default answer. The American Dental Association's 2015 evidence-based guideline states that, in general, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures, including those involving gingival manipulation or mucosal incision, to prevent prosthetic joint infection, and this was judged with moderate certainty of no association between dental procedures and PJI, leading to a recommendation against prophylaxis [^112SYCr6] [^111BLHaL]. The AAOS/AAHKS 2025 guideline similarly recommends avoiding routine systemic prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures in patients with hip or knee replacements, citing low-quality evidence and limited strength of option, which aligns with a stewardship-first approach rather than blanket prophylaxis [^117XUgB3] [^116FrMAR].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary basis before concluding anything. Multiple large observational studies and meta-analyses show no reduction in PJI with dental antibiotic prophylaxis and no consistent association between invasive dental procedures and subsequent PJI. For example, a Taiwanese cohort of 255,568 arthroplasty patients found no association between dental procedures and PJI and no benefit from prophylaxis, with PJI rates around 0.6% regardless of dental exposure or antibiotic use [^112jJyoG]. A 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis likewise found no significant reduction in PJI with prophylaxis, and a large English case-crossover analysis of 9,427 LPJI admissions found no temporal association with invasive dental procedures, with an incidence rate ratio of 0.89 favoring fewer dental procedures in the 3 months before LPJI, which argues against causality and thus against prophylaxis utility [^114krkX5] [^111toCuM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without weighing harms and costs. Prophylaxis exposes patients to adverse drug reactions, including anaphylaxis, and increases the risk of C. difficile infection; even a single dose of clindamycin carries nontrivial C. difficile risk, and clindamycin is frequently misprescribed for prophylaxis despite higher risk and no superior benefit in this context [^111YDZ28] [^1166M6Ty]. I should double-check the cost burden too: estimates place annual U.S. spending on dental prophylaxis for joint replacement patients at roughly $50–60 million, with no demonstrated reduction in PJI to justify it, reinforcing the stewardship imperative to avoid routine prophylaxis [^115A2owq] [^111ARgyb].

> But wait, what if there are high-risk subgroups where prophylaxis still makes sense? The ADA allows consideration only in patients with prosthetic joints who have a history of complications from their joint replacement surgery and are undergoing procedures involving gingival manipulation, and even then only after consultation with the orthopedic surgeon and a careful review of the health history, which is a very narrow exception and not the typical scenario [^112SYCr6]. The AAOS 2025 guideline acknowledges uncertainty in high-risk cohorts such as revision arthroplasty or immunocompromised patients, noting the predominance of staphylococcal etiologies and the relative infrequency of oral streptococci as PJI pathogens, which makes dental prophylaxis biologically less compelling even in those groups; thus, routine prophylaxis is not advised outside of individualized, exceptional circumstances [^111MjKDb] [^1146Rygh].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating this with other dental prophylaxis indications. Antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures is still indicated for patients at highest risk of infective endocarditis, but that cardiac indication is separate from prosthetic joint infection prevention and should not be extrapolated to joint prophylaxis without a qualifying cardiac condition [^112yRgrG]. Let me reconsider the timing around arthroplasty as well: elective dental procedures are often deferred for about 3 months after joint replacement to minimize early postoperative infection risk, but that timing recommendation is not equivalent to mandating antibiotic prophylaxis for later dental care once the joint has healed and stabilized [^115sGqUu].

> Next, I should review real-world practice patterns to gauge how far we are from evidence-based care. Large U.S. claims analyses show that more than 80% of dental antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions are unnecessary, with prosthetic joints being a major driver of inappropriate prescribing, and clindamycin overuse remains common despite higher C. difficile risk, underscoring the need for stewardship and clinician education to align practice with guidelines [^11554yd4] [^113E8yL4] [^1166M6Ty]. Even in systems emphasizing stewardship, unnecessary prophylaxis persists, highlighting that changing entrenched habits requires explicit guideline endorsement and communication with orthopedic colleagues and patients [^1115WU8H].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line for this specific question. For a typical patient with a prosthetic joint undergoing a dental extraction, routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended, because high-quality guidelines advise against it, the best available evidence shows no association between dental procedures and PJI and no benefit from prophylaxis, and the potential harms and costs outweigh any theoretical benefit [^112SYCr6] [^117XUgB3] [^114krkX5] [^1125jr99]. If the patient has a history of significant complications from the joint replacement or is profoundly immunocompromised, a case-by-case discussion with the orthopedic surgeon may be reasonable, but even then the evidence is limited and prophylaxis should not be automatic [^112SYCr6] [^111MjKDb].

> Finally, I should double-check practical steps that reduce risk without antibiotics. Emphasize excellent oral hygiene and definitive management of active dental infections, and coordinate elective extractions to avoid the immediate post-arthroplasty period when feasible. These measures target modifiable risk and align with guideline principles while avoiding unnecessary antibiotics [^115sGqUu] [^111toCuM].

Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is **not recommended** for dental extractions in patients with prosthetic joints, as there is **no evidence** that it reduces prosthetic joint infection (PJI) risk [^112SYCr6] [^114krkX5] and it may cause harm from adverse effects and resistance [^111YDZ28] [^115KYYeU]. Prophylaxis is only considered for **high-risk patients** (e.g. immunocompromised, prior PJI, or within 2 years of joint placement) after consultation with the orthopedic surgeon [^112SYCr6] [^111MjKDb]. If indicated, use **amoxicillin 2 g orally 30–60 minutes before the procedure**; if allergic, use azithromycin 500 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, or clindamycin 600 mg orally 30–60 minutes before the procedure. Maintain strict aseptic technique and prioritize oral hygiene and infection control [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

The **ADA 2015 guideline** states that prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for patients with prosthetic joint implants undergoing dental procedures, including extractions, because there is no evidence that dental procedures cause PJI and no evidence that prophylaxis prevents PJI [^112SYCr6] [^114VE7gK]. The **AAOS 2025 guideline** similarly recommends avoiding routine systemic prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures in patients with hip or knee replacements, as they do not reduce PJI risk [^117XUgB3] [^115igYqW].

---

## Evidence supporting or refuting antibiotic prophylaxis

Multiple studies and systematic reviews show **no reduction in PJI risk** with prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures:

- **Berbari et al. (2010)**: No association between dental procedures and PJI, with or without antibiotics [^115igYqW].
- **Skaar et al. (2011)**: No significant association between dental procedures and PJI [^111vMruf].
- **Swan et al. (2011)**: No significant association between dental procedures and PJI [^111vMruf].
- **Jacobson et al. (1986)**: No significant association between dental procedures and PJI [^notfound].
- **Systematic review (2025)**: No significant reduction in PJI with prophylactic antibiotics; slight, non-significant increase in risk with antibiotics [^1125jr99].

---

## Risks and disadvantages of antibiotic prophylaxis

Antibiotic prophylaxis carries **potential harms**, including:

- **Adverse drug reactions**: Anaphylaxis, gastrointestinal upset, and other allergic reactions [^11374GSp].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Widespread prophylaxis contributes to resistance [^115igYqW].
- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Increased risk, especially with clindamycin [^111YDZ28] [^1166M6Ty].
- **Cost**: Annual U.S. cost exceeds $50 million [^115A2owq] [^111ARgyb].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing the decision

Certain patients may be at **higher risk** for PJI, and prophylaxis may be considered case-by-case:

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Higher infection risk.
- **Patients with prior PJI**: Increased risk of recurrence.
- **Patients within 2 years of joint replacement**: Higher early infection risk [^111hctyT].

In these cases, decisions should be made through **shared decision-making** with the orthopedic surgeon and patient, balancing individual risks and benefits [^113uR73G].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens (if indicated)

If prophylaxis is indicated, the following regimens are **recommended**:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin | 2 g orally | 30–60 minutes before procedure |
| Azithromycin | 500 mg orally | 30–60 minutes before procedure |
| Clarithromycin | 500 mg orally | 30–60 minutes before procedure |
| Clindamycin | 600 mg orally | 30–60 minutes before procedure |

---

## Alternative preventive measures

Emphasize **oral hygiene** — regular dental care and hygiene reduce bacterial load and infection risk [^111toCuM] — and use **aseptic technique** during extractions, including sterile instruments and antiseptic rinses [^notfound]. Manage active dental infections before extractions to reduce bacteremia risk [^115sGqUu].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is **not recommended** for dental extractions in patients with prosthetic joints, given the lack of benefit and potential harms [^112SYCr6] [^114krkX5]. Prophylaxis may be considered for high-risk patients after consultation with the orthopedic surgeon, using the recommended regimens if indicated. Emphasize oral hygiene, aseptic technique, and infection control to minimize PJI risk [^111toCuM].

### Review of guidelines for dental antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections and need for dental stewardship [^115tzHcp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Dentists prescribe 10% of all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, writing more than 25.7 million prescriptions per year. Many are for prophylaxis in patients with prosthetic joint replacements; the American Dental Society states that "in general", prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended to prevent prosthetic joint infections. Orthopedic surgeons are concerned with the risk of implant infections following a dental procedure and, therefore, see high value and low risk in recommending prophylaxis. Patients are "stuck in the middle", with conflicting recommendations from orthopedic surgeons (OS) and dentists. Unnecessary prophylaxis and fear of lawsuits amongst private practice dentists and OS has not been addressed. We review The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology, American Dental Association, and American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons' guidelines on dental antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections. We provide experience on how to engage private-practice dentists and OS in dental stewardship using a community-based program.

### Changes in antibiotic prescribing by dentists in the United States, 2012–2019 [^111XQ6x7]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study had several limitations. The IQVIA LRx data set did not include characteristics of dental visits or patient comorbidities. Thus, we could not evaluate the appropriateness of the antibiotic prescribed. Furthermore, we included all prescriptions dispensed, but we could not determine whether patients actually took the antibiotic. Finally, the data included in this study may not include all patients receiving dental care because the LRx database only contains information on dispensed prescriptions.

Regardless, our results are relevant to public health efforts to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics. Obtaining data identifying the indication for a dental antibiotic is challenging. Population-level prescription data sets, such as IQVIA LRx, can be used to monitor the need for and effectiveness of antibiotic stewardship strategies. The CDC Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship recommend the use of prescribing data to inform stewardship efforts. Although dentists are included as a targeted group to implement the Core Elements, there are few examples of the implementation of antibiotic stewardship in dental practices. These antibiotic stewardship strategies should be tailored to the practice of dental specialists, especially oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Future monitoring should assess overall antibiotic prescribing rates, trends by dental specialists, and the impact of removing clindamycin from the 2021 update to the AHA infective endocarditis prophylaxis guidelines. Before-and-after analyses specific to guideline changes and/or stewardship efforts that are implemented as a result of these data can also be monitored with the use of IQVIA LRx to determine whether these strategies have made a significant impact. Using these data in this manner can be an effective monitoring strategy in future dental stewardship efforts. Antibiotics are commonly used as premedication to prevent complications from tooth extractions and dental implants. Although data are mixed on the effectiveness of this practice, guidelines recommending antibiotic prophylaxis for extractions and implants are not available. The United Kingdom does not recommend antibiotics to prevent postoperative infection or dry socket associated with tooth extraction and only recommends antibiotics to prevent dental implant complications when bone augmentation is part of the procedure. Finally, the impact of the 2015 ADA guidelines removing antibiotic prophylaxis recommendations in patients with prosthetic joints appears to have minimal, if any, impact on overall antibiotic prescribing rates by dentists.

### Interventions for replacing missing teeth: antibiotics at dental implant placement to prevent complications [^11374GSp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Some dental implant failures may be due to bacterial contamination at implant insertion. Infections around biomaterials are difficult to treat, and almost all infected implants have to be removed. In general, antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery is only indicated for patients at risk of infectious endocarditis; with reduced host-response; when surgery is performed in infected sites; in cases of extensive and prolonged surgical interventions; and when large foreign materials are implanted. A variety of prophylactic systemic antibiotic regimens have been suggested to minimise infections after dental implant placement. More recent protocols recommended short-term prophylaxis, if antibiotics have to be used. Adverse events may occur with the administration of antibiotics, and can range from diarrhoea to life-threatening allergic reactions. Another major concern associated with the widespread use of antibiotics is the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in implant dentistry is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial or harmful effects of systemic prophylactic antibiotics at dental implant placement versus no antibiotic or placebo administration and, if antibiotics are beneficial, to determine which type, dosage and duration is the most effective.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 17 June 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 17 June 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 17 June 2013). There were no language or date restrictions placed on the searches of the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) with a follow-up of at least three months, that compared the administration of various prophylactic antibiotic regimens versus no antibiotics to people undergoing dental implant placement. Outcome measures included prosthesis failures, implant failures, postoperative infections and adverse events (gastrointestinal, hypersensitivity, etc).

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the risk of bias of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two review authors. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RRs) using a random-effects model for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity, including both clinical and methodological factors, was to be investigated.

Main Results

Six RCTs with 1162 participants were included: three trials compared 2 g of preoperative amoxicillin versus placebo (927 participants), one compared 3 g of preoperative amoxicillin versus placebo (55 participants), one compared 1 g of preoperative amoxicillin plus 500 mg four times a day for two days versus no antibiotics (80 participants), and one compared four groups: (1) 2 g of preoperative amoxicillin; (2) 2 g of preoperative amoxicillin plus 1 g twice a day for seven days; (3) 1 g of postoperative amoxicillin twice a day for seven days, and (4) no antibiotics (100 participants). The overall body of evidence was considered to be of moderate quality. The meta-analyses of the six trials showed a statistically significant higher number of participants experiencing implant failures in the group not receiving antibiotics (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.67, P value 0.002, heterogeneity: Tau² 0.00; Chi² 2.87, df = 5 (P value 0.57); I² 0%). The number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) to prevent one person having an implant failure is 25 (95% CI 14 to 100), based on an implant failure rate of 6% in participants not receiving antibiotics. There was borderline statistical significance for prosthesis failures (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00), with no statistically significant differences for infections (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.35), or adverse events (RR 1; 95% CI 0.06 to 15.85) (only two minor adverse events were recorded, one in the placebo group). No conclusive information can be derived from the only trial that compared three different durations of antibiotic prophylaxis since no event (implant/prosthesis failures, infections or adverse events) occurred in any of the 25 participants included in each study group. There were no trials that evaluated different antibiotics or different antibiotic dosages.

Authors' Conclusions

Scientific evidence suggests that, in general, antibiotics are beneficial for reducing failure of dental implants placed in ordinary conditions. Specifically 2 g or 3 g of amoxicillin given orally, as a single administration, one hour preoperatively significantly reduces failure of dental implants. No significant adverse events were reported. It might be sensible to suggest the use of a single dose of 2 g prophylactic amoxicillin prior to dental implant placement. It is still unknown whether postoperative antibiotics are beneficial, and which antibiotic is the most effective.

### The use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joints: evidence-based clinical practice guideline for dental practitioners – a report of the American dental association council on scientific affairs [^111BLHaL]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical recommendation and rationale — prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joints: The 2014 Panel judged with moderate certainty that there is no association between dental procedures and the occurrence of PJIs. Consistent with the ADA's methods, when there is moderate certainty of no association, the strength of the recommendation is against, and against means that evidence suggests not implementing this intervention or discontinuing ineffective practices. On this basis, the Panel states: In general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection. The Panel also made the assumption that the evidence regarding hip and knee joint infections can be extrapolated to all joints because, to our knowledge, no studies have been published addressing the relationship between dental treatment and infections of other types of prosthetic joints.

AAOS guideline goals and methodology emphasize evaluation of the current best evidence, with a systematic literature review conducted between January 1980 and October 2023, and AAOS staff methodologists supporting a rigorous systematic process. The AAOS adopted the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision Framework in April 2019 to enable incorporation of additional factors into recommendation strength and to move away from previous language stems. The document is not intended for use as a benefits determination and does not cover allocation of resources, business and ethical considerations, or other factors needed to determine the material value of orthopaedic care.

### Is routine antibiotic prophylaxis cost effective for total joint replacement patients? [^115sLo95]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2015). Low credibility.

The routine use of amoxicillin antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures for patients with total joint prostheses in place remains controversial. This analysis shows that the practice may not be cost-effective for patients in whom the risk of infection with dental work is low. However, specific data quantifying the risk and the impact prophylactic antibiotics can have is needed. Patients and physicians will need to continue to consider their use on an individual basis and should consider the risk of infection as well as the risk of adverse drug reaction when making treatment decisions.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis–related harms and resistance in patients with prosthetic joints are outlined, noting that there is a long-standing and increasing concern that repeated exposure to antibiotics is a risk factor for the development of resistant bacterial species. Although there are no data regarding the risk of developing a drug reaction from 1 dose of amoxicillin prescribed to prevent a distant site infection such as PJI, older regimens with intramuscular injections and multiple oral doses suggest that more people who are given antibiotic prophylaxis would experience drug reactions from penicillin-type drugs — some of which may be fatal — than would be prevented from developing PJI, and there also is an increased risk of experiencing adverse reactions with increasing patient age (that is, in patients 70 years or older). Prolonged treatment with antibiotics is associated with infections secondary to changes in the gastrointestinal microbial flora, and Clostridium difficile infection potentially can cause pseudomembranous colitis; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that annually there are approximately 250,000 people with C difficile infections that require hospitalization or already affect hospitalized patients, resulting in 14,000 deaths per year, and investigators have identified clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones as the inducing agents.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joint implants — clinical recommendation and evidence basis: American Dental Association clinical guidance states that, "In general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection". The 2014 Panel judged that the current best evidence failed to demonstrate an association between dental procedures and prosthetic joint infection (PJI). The 2014 Panel also presented information about antibiotic resistance, adverse drug reactions, and costs associated with prescribing antibiotics for PJI prophylaxis. The practitioner and patient should consider possible clinical circumstances that may suggest the presence of a significant medical risk in providing dental care without antibiotic prophylaxis, as well as the known risks of frequent or widespread antibiotic use. As part of the evidence-based approach to care, this clinical recommendation should be integrated with the practitioner's professional judgment and the patient's needs and preferences.

Implementation considerations — timing of dental procedures around total joint arthroplasty (TJA): Benefits and harms should be weighed for each patient, acute dental infections early in the TJA period require management, and elective procedures might best be delayed for 3 months; in general, there are limited harms from delaying elective dental procedures for the maximum noted 3-month period.

Adjusted Analysis

In multivariable analyses, unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased over time (Table 3). Patients 65 years and older and those aged 35 to 44 years had lower odds of being prescribed unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis compared with patients aged 18 to 34 years, while women (vs men; odds ratio [OR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.17–1.25) had higher odds of unnecessary prescribing. Significant regional variation remained: compared with the Midwest, the Northeast and South had lower odds of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis, while the West (OR, 1.15, 95% CI, 1.06–1.25) had higher odds of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis. In addition, being in a rural location was associated with lower odds of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis. Dental procedures defined as diagnostic, preventive, oral and maxillofacial surgery, periodontics, and endodontics had lower odds of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis compared with those without these CDT procedure categories; adjunctive general services, implant services (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.45–1.89), prosthodontics, orthodontics, and maxillofacial prosthetics had higher odds of unnecessary prescribing. Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis was less common in patients with diabetes, immunocompromised conditions, or health care use in the previous 6 months, while having a prosthetic joint device (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.22–2.41) was associated with unnecessary prescribing compared with those not having a prosthetic joint. Finally, unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis was most associated with antibiotics falling into the "other" category, followed by clindamycin (OR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15), compared with amoxicillin.

Antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures — high-risk arthroplasty populations and microbiology are characterized by stated concerns regarding "higher risk patients such as revision total joint arthroplasty (TJA) patients, patients with prior periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), or patients with certain medical comorbidities", while the evidence "is mostly derived from patients with primary arthroplasty, particularly total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA)", and high‑risk cohorts were "too small… to draw meaningful conclusions"; additionally, the "predominance of staphylococci and relative infrequency of viridans group streptococci and other mouth bacterial flora" as PJI etiologies makes dental prophylaxis "less intuitive… even in high‑risk populations".

### Medical clearance for common dental procedures [^1154vLyJ]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Medical consultations before dental procedures present opportunities to integrate cross-disciplinary preventive care and improve patient health. This article presents recommendations related to patients with certain medical conditions who are planning to undergo common dental procedures, such as cleanings, extractions, restorations, endodontic procedures, abscess drainage, and mucosal biopsies. Specifically, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for preventing prosthetic joint infections or infectious endocarditis except in certain circumstances. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies typically should not be suspended for common dental treatments. Elective dental care should be avoided for six weeks after myocardial infarction or bare-metal stent placement or for six months after drug-eluting stent placement. It is important that any history of antiresorptive or antiangiogenic therapies be communicated to the dentist. Ascites is not an indication for initiating prophylactic antibiotics before dental treatment, and acetaminophen is the analgesic of choice for patients with liver dysfunction or cirrhosis who abstain from alcohol. Nephrotoxic medications should be avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease, and the consultation should include the patient's glomerular filtration rate. Although patients undergoing chemotherapy may receive routine dental care, it should be postponed when possible in those currently undergoing head and neck radiation therapy. A detailed history of head and neck radiation therapy should be provided to the dentist. Multimodal, nonnarcotic analgesia is recommended for managing acute dental pain.

### Appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2016–2018 [^1128pnob]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis is common yet unnecessary for many dental visits. In this analysis, our objective was to assess whether the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis has improved over time.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using dental visits from 2016 to 2018 (data analyzed in 2021) using medical and prescriptions claims data of patients from the U.S. with commercial dental insurance. Antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as a ≤ 2 days' supply prescription dispensed within 7 days before a dental visit. Appropriateness of prophylaxis was defined on the basis of the manipulation of the gingiva/tooth periapex or oral mucosa perforation in patients with appropriate cardiac diagnoses. Associations between patient and visit characteristics and appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis were assessed using multiple Poisson regression.

Results

Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis was highly prevalent in this cohort, ranging from 77.0% in 2016 to 78.5% in 2018. In the adjusted analysis, factors associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis included younger age, female sex, geographic region, rurality, type of antibiotic, and certain dental procedures. The factors associated with the highest risk of unnecessary prophylaxis in the adjusted analysis were orthodontic procedures and having a history of a prosthetic joint. Notably, the risk of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased over time in the adjusted analysis.

Conclusions

Unnecessary prescription of antibiotic prophylaxis by dentists continues to be common. Antimicrobial stewardship strategies are needed to improve prescribing by dentists.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for prosthetic joint patients undergoing invasive dental procedures: time for a rethink? [^1128AFDb]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In the United States, it has been common practice to recommend that dentists provide antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) before invasive dental procedures (IDPs) to prevent late periprosthetic joint infections (LPJIs) in patients who have prosthetic arthroplasties despite lack of evidence for a causal relationship between IDP and LPJI and a lack of evidence for AP efficacy.

Methods

A recent study quantified the IDP incidence over the 15-month period prior to LPJI hospital admissions in the United Kingdom for which dental records were available. A case-crossover analysis compared IDP incidence in the 3 months before LPJI admission with the preceding 12 months. The English population was used because guidelines do not recommend AP and any relationship between IDPs and LPJI should be fully exposed.

Results

No significant positive association was identified between IDPs and LPJI. Indeed, the incidence of IDPs was lower in the 3 months before LPJI hospital admission than that in the preceding 12 months.

Conclusion

In the absence of a significant positive association between IDPs and LPJI, there is no rationale to administer AP before IDPs in patients with prosthetic joints, particularly given the cost and inconvenience of AP, the risk of adverse drug reactions, and the potential for unnecessary AP use that promotes antibiotic resistance. These results should reassure orthopedic surgeons and their patients that dental care of patients who have prosthetic joints should focus on maintaining good oral hygiene rather than on recommending AP for IDPs. Moreover, it should also reassure those in other countries where AP is not recommended that such guidance is sufficient.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^113E8yL4]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

More than 80% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions before dental procedures are unnecessary: clindamycin use, the presence of prosthetic joints, and residence in the western United States were associated with unnecessary prescribing. While antibiotic prophylaxis is appropriately prescribed for indicated dental procedures in patients with cardiac conditions, most antibiotic prophylaxis is prescribed to patients in whom guideline-identified risk factors are not present. Although prescribing is slowly improving, the high proportion of antibiotics that were found to be unnecessary in our study is worrisome. Implementing antimicrobial stewardship efforts in dental practices is an opportunity to improve antibiotic prescribing for infection prophylaxis.

### Analysis of prosthetic joint infections following invasive dental procedures in england [^114krkX5]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Dentists in the United States are under pressure from orthopedic surgeons and their patients with prosthetic joints to provide antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures (IDP) to reduce the risk of late prosthetic joint infection (LPJI). This has been a common practice for decades, despite a lack of evidence for an association between IDP and LPJI, a lack of evidence of antibiotic prophylaxis efficacy, cost of providing antibiotic prophylaxis, and risk of both adverse drug reactions and the potential for promoting antibiotic resistance.

Objective

To quantify any temporal association between IDP and subsequent LPJI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used a case-crossover and time trend design to examine any potential association between IDP and LPJI. The population of England (55 million) was chosen because antibiotic prophylaxis has never been recommended to prevent LPJI in England, and any association between IDP and LPJI would therefore be fully exposed. All patients admitted to hospitals in England for LPJI from December 25, 2011, through March 31, 2017, and for whom dental records were available were included. Analyses were performed between May 2018 and June 2021.

Exposures

Exposure to IDP.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was the incidence of IDP in the 3 months before LPJI hospital admission (case period) compared with the incidence in the 12 months before that (control period).

Results

A total of 9427 LPJI hospital admissions with dental records (mean [SD] patient age, 67.8 [13.1] years) were identified, including 4897 (52.0%) men and 4529 (48.0%) women. Of these, 2385 (25.3%) had hip prosthetic joints, 3168 (33.6%) had knee prosthetic joints, 259 (2.8%) had other prosthetic joints, and 3615 (38.4%) had unknown prosthetic joint types. There was no significant temporal association between IDP and subsequent LPJI. Indeed, there was a lower incidence of IDP in the 3 months prior to LPJI (incidence rate ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82–0.96; p = 0.002).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that there is no rationale to administer antibiotic prophylaxis before IDP in patients with prosthetic joints.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery: advisory statement 2008 [^114Z4yTG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic prophylaxis is an important component of dermatologic surgery, and recommendations in this area should reflect the updated 2007 guidelines of the American Heart Association, the American Dental Association with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines, and recent prospective studies on surgical site infection.

Objective

To provide an update on the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery for the prevention of infective endocarditis, hematogenous total joint infection, and surgical site infection.

Methods

A literature review was performed, expert consensus was obtained, and updated recommendations were created, consistent with the most current authoritative guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American Dental Association with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.

Results

For patients with high-risk cardiac conditions, and a defined group of patients with prosthetic joints at high risk for hematogenous total joint infection, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended when the surgical site is infected or when the procedure involves breach of the oral mucosa. For the prevention of surgical site infections, antibiotics may be indicated for procedures on the lower extremities or groin, for wedge excisions of the lip and ear, skin flaps on the nose, skin grafts, and for patients with extensive inflammatory skin disease.

Limitations

These recommendations are not based on multiple, large-scale, prospective trials.

Conclusions

There is a strong shift away from administration of prophylactic antibiotics in many dermatologic surgery settings, based on updated authoritative guidelines. These recommendations provide guidance to comply with the most current guidelines, modified to address dermatology-specific considerations. Managing physicians may utilize these guidelines while individualizing their approach based on all clinical considerations.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) risk factors independent of dental procedures are described from a case-control study, in which postoperative wound drainage after arthroplasty had a strong association (OR = 18.7; 95% CI, 7.4–47.2), with additional postoperative associations for wound hematoma after arthroplasty (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3–9.5) and postoperative urinary tract infection (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.04–7.1). There were no data regarding whether use of prophylactic antibiotics decreased the risk of developing PJIs in patients with these specific postoperative conditions. Preoperative factors had significant ORs (ranging from 1.8 to 2.2), but some epidemiologists maintain that in case-control studies significant ORs of less than 4 may not be large enough to be clinically relevant and the upper limit of the 95% CIs for the preoperative factors did not include values of 4 or greater. Independent of having undergone a dental procedure, postoperative factors such as drainage or infection after undergoing arthroplasty were associated more strongly with PJI than having undergone previous surgery or arthroplasty of the index joint, being immunocompromised, or having a medical condition such as diabetes mellitus.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^116hH2yN]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Unadjusted Analysis

Of the 168 420 eligible dental visits with antibiotic prophylaxis, the most frequent antibiotics prescribed were amoxicillin (69.4%), followed by clindamycin (16.0%) (Table 2). Only 19.1% of antibiotics prescribed were appropriate; therefore, 80.9% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions before dental visits were discordant with guidelines. Those with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis had a lower percentage of amoxicillin prescribed but a higher percentage of cephalexin and other types of antibiotics than those with appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis. Compared with those visits with appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, visits with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis were associated with a higher percentage of women, urban locations, and prosthetic joints but a lower percentage of diagnostic and preventive dental procedure categories, gingival manipulation, cardiac conditions, and previous health care use. There was also significant variation by US Census geographic region and the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis. The highest unnecessary prescribing was observed in the West (84.5% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were unnecessary in the West) and the lowest in the Northeast (78.2% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were unnecessary in the Northeast). Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased over time between 2011 and 2015 from 84.5% to 78.8% overall and across all geographic regions (P < .001) (Figure 2).

### Prosthetic joint infection following invasive dental procedures and antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with hip or knee arthroplasty [^112jJyoG]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVES We aimed to clarify whether invasive dental treatment is associated with increased risk of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and whether prophylactic antibiotics may lower the infection risk remain unclear. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS All Taiwanese residents (N = 255,568) who underwent total knee or hip arthroplasty between January 1, 1997, and November 30, 2009, were screened. METHODS The dental cohort consisted of 57,066 patients who received dental treatment and were individually matched 1:1 with the nondental cohort by age, sex, propensity score, and index date. The dental cohort was further divided by the use or nonuse of prophylactic antibiotics. The antibiotic and nonantibiotic subcohorts comprised 6,513 matched pairs. RESULTS PJI occurred in 328 patients (0.57%) in the dental subcohort and 348 patients (0.61%) in the nondental subcohort, with no between-cohort difference in the 1-year cumulative incidence (0.6% in both, P = 0.3). Multivariate-adjusted Cox regression revealed no association between dental procedures and PJI. Furthermore, PJI occurred in 13 patients (0.2%) in the antibiotic subcohort and 12 patients (0.18%) in the nonantibiotic subcohorts (P = 0.8). Multivariate-adjusted analyses confirmed that there was no association between the incidence of PJI and prophylactic antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS The risk of PJI is not increased following dental procedure in patients with hip or knee replacement and is unaffected by antibiotic prophylaxis.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, in collaboration with the American Dental Association, has developed Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for the Management of Patients with Orthopaedic Implants Undergoing Dental Procedures. Evidence-based information, in conjunction with the clinical expertise of physicians, was used to develop the criteria to improve patient care and obtain best outcomes while considering the subtleties and distinctions necessary in making clinical decisions. The Management of Patients with Orthopaedic Implants Undergoing Dental Procedures AUC clinical patient scenarios were derived from indications of patients with orthopaedic implants presenting for dental procedures, as well as from current evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and supporting literature to identify the appropriateness of the use of prophylactic antibiotics. The 64 patient scenarios and 1 treatment were developed by the writing panel, a group of clinicians who are specialists in this AUC topic. Next, a separate, multidisciplinary, voting panel (made up of specialists and nonspecialists) rated the appropriateness of treatment of each patient scenario using a 9-point scale to designate a treatment as Appropriate (median rating, 7 to 9), May Be Appropriate (median rating, 4 to 6), or Rarely Appropriate (median rating, 1 to 3).

Limitations and Public Health Implications

These results are not without limitations. The cohort is a convenience sample of US patients with commercial dental insurance. Therefore, our results may not be representative of the uninsured and underrepresents persons with Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Medicare does not generally cover dental care, and the state provision of dental benefits to adults with Medicaid is optional. As a result, these persons are not included in our sample unless supplemental commercial dental benefits were purchased. Due to limitations in the data set, the prescriptions cannot be directly linked with the health care encounter or prescriber. We adapted methods used by other investigators to link antibiotic prescriptions to health care encounters and exclude other indications for antibiotics. To increase the specificity of our antibiotic-related dental visits, we conservatively defined a cohort in which other indications for antibiotics are unlikely. In contrast to medical care providers, dentists rarely use diagnostic codes (ICD-9 or ICD-10-CM) and are reimbursed based on procedure codes (CDT). Therefore, it is difficult to associate a diagnosis with the prescription. To increase the likelihood that an antibiotic was prescribed for infection prophylaxis (vs treatment of an oral infection), the days' supply for the antibiotic prescription was limited to 2 days or less (whereas oral infections are likely to be treated for ≥ 3 days). We did not assess dental visits at which an antibiotic was indicated but not dispensed. Although the 2007 infective endocarditis guidelines significantly decreased the number of patients with a prophylaxis indication, data are conflicting regarding the association of this change with the incidence of endocarditis. However, the sole studywith results identifying an increase in infective endocarditis in the United States did not include dental visit data and was not able to adjust for increases in infective endocarditis observed with the opioid epidemic. So, it is difficult to elucidate the causal factor (dental visit vs substance misuse). We did not apply 2017 (after our study period) expert panel recommendations of clinical scenarios in which antibiotic prophylaxis may be appropriate in patients with prosthetic joints. All scenarios include patients with multiple comorbidities (eg, prosthetic joint plus uncontrolled diabetes and prosthetic joint plus immunocompromised state). Because the comorbidities in the expert panel recommendationsare similar to those in the 2003 prosthetic joint guidelines, we anticipate the results from the expert panel recommendations to be similar to the results from the 2003 prosthetic joint guidelines. Due to the difficulty in identifying specific diagnoses, we broadened the definition for certain conditions to include all cardiac transplantation (removing cardiac valvulopathy), all diabetes (vs just type 1), and all congenital heart diseases. Therefore, unnecessary prescribing is likely higher than our results indicate.

### Prevention of orthopaedic implant infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^1127Lgfw]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

The Prevention of Orthopaedic Implant Infection in Patients Undergoing Dental Procedures evidence-based clinical practice guideline was codeveloped by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American Dental Association. This guideline replaces the previous AAOS Information Statement, "Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Bacteremia in Patients With Joint Replacement", published in 2009. Based on the best current evidence and a systematic review of published studies, three recommendations have been created to guide clinical practice in the prevention of orthopaedic implant infections in patients undergoing dental procedures. The first recommendation is graded as Limited; this recommendation proposes that the practitioner consider changing the long-standing practice of routinely prescribing prophylactic antibiotic for patients with orthopaedic implants who undergo dental procedures. The second, graded as Inconclusive, addresses the use of oral topical antimicrobials in the prevention of periprosthetic joint infections. The third recommendation, a Consensus statement, addresses the maintenance of good oral hygiene.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^112DEFQs]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Infective endocarditis is a rare disease with a high morbidity and mortality. For more than 50 years antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive procedures has been the primary focus for preventing infective endocarditis and remains the standard of care for patients with the disease in most parts of the world. The rationale for such treatment is to reduce or eliminate the bacteraemia that may result from such procedures. A particular focus is on antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, as oral streptococci have been implicated in between 18% and 65% of cases of infective endocarditis, although most studies suggest the proportion is closer to 35–45%. Regardless, little or no firm scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing infective endocarditis, and two case-control studies provide evidence that dental treatment is unlikely to be a risk factor. Some authors therefore suggest that the current focus on antibiotic prophylaxis is an unproved, expensive, and potentially harmful standard of care, whereas others argue that it prevents cases of infective endocarditis. Owing to ethical and medicolegal issues, cost, and the large number of patients necessary to achieve statistically significant results, a randomised placebo controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis has never been attempted.

In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom produced controversial new guidance recommending the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients at risk of infective endocarditis undergoing dental and a wide range of other invasive procedures. Although the American Heart Associationand the European Society for Cardiologychanged their guidelines around the same time, they did not recommend the complete cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis. Both continued to recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with prosthetic heart valves undergoing invasive dental procedures, patients with cardiac valves repaired using prosthetic material, and patients with significant congenital heart lesions, a heart transplant with valvular lesions, or a history of endocarditis.

We hypothesised that by studying national prescribing data as well as data recorded for all inpatient hospital activity in the United Kingdom, we would be able to quantify the effect of the new NICE guideline on prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis and the incidence of infective endocarditis. We describe the effect of the guideline on the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis in England and the changes in the incidence of cases of infective endocarditis and deaths from the disease in hospital over that period.

2014 Panel case-control studies — associations between dental procedures and prosthetic joint infection (PJI) are summarized from 3 additional case-control studies. In a nested case-control study by Skaar and colleagues, the main results were not significant with HR = 0.78 [95% CI, 0.18–3.39]; OR = 0.56 [95% CI, 0.18–1.74]; p = 0.45 despite control participants being more likely to have undergone invasive dental procedures. In a study by Swan and colleagues, they identified 17 patients (of 1,641) in whom PJI developed more than 3 months postoperatively and 51 control patients, and calculated the OR as 1.53 (95% CI, 0.13–18.03). In a study by Jacobson and colleagues, there were 30 case participants with late (> 6 months after implant placement) PJI and 101 control patients, and from the published data the OR was 0.07 (95% CI, 0.01–0.56), implying that those undergoing dental procedures were at lower risk of developing PJI; however, these findings were noted as inconsistent with other studies in which investigators failed to show an association between dental procedures and PJI.

In Berbari and colleagues (2010), the authors reported an OR of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.41–1.6; p = 0.56) for high risk dental procedures without antibiotics, and the authors used geographic location, education level, American Society of Anesthesiologists status, and sex. In Jacobson and colleagues (1986), a Fisher exact test reported P = 0.0005 and a crude calculation yielded an OR of 0.07, with no adjusting for confounding.

### Analysis of prosthetic joint infections following invasive dental procedures in england [^111toCuM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this cohort study suggest that, in the absence of any increase in IDP prior to LPJI, there is no evidence to support a positive association between IDP and LPJI or the practice of administering antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with prosthetic joints undergoing IDP. The continuing use of antibiotic prophylaxis represents a large and unnecessary financial burden on individuals and the health care system as well as an unnecessary risk to patients, from adverse drug reactions, and society, owing to the potential development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and should cease. However, our data suggest that maintenance of good oral hygiene may be important in preventing the small number of LPJIs in which oral bacteria are implicated. In addition, our findings should provide reassurance to orthopedic surgeons, dentists, and their patients in countries where antibiotic prophylaxis use in patients with prosthetic joints is not currently recommended.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^11188Vck]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline — antiseptic/antimicrobial treatment before dental procedures in patients with a hip or knee replacement — in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that the use of an oral topical antiseptic wash is not necessary before a dental procedure in patients with a hip or knee replacement. Quality of Evidence: Consensus. Strength of Option: Consensus. The literature review did not identify any studies meeting inclusion criteria that evaluated topical antiseptic wash prior to a dental procedure for patients with a hip or knee replacement. The results of these studies indicate that chlorhexidine wash prophylaxis does not significantly reduce the level of bacteremia following dental procedures, and as a result, oral topical antiseptic wash is not recommended before a dental procedure in patients with a hip or knee replacement for the purpose of reducing the risk of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Periprosthetic joint infection is a devastating complication after total joint arthroplasty associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and rates of PJI are reported as low as 1%. This recommendation does not support the use of chlorhexidine wash, which will improve cost-effectiveness and resource utilization. Because of the lack of demonstrated harm and historical practices of oral, topical antiseptic washes, clinicians might be less willing to accept the guidelines and change practice, but adopting the guidelines is not resource-intensive or reliant on special needs and therefore would be highly feasible to implement with greater clinician acceptance.

### Dentists: improve patient safety by optimizing antibiotic prescribing… [^113Csqkh]. blogs.cdc.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

Dentists: Improve patient safety by optimizing antibiotic prescribingPosted on by Dentists prescribe approximately 10% of all outpatient antibiotics in the United States. 1 Many of these antibiotic prescriptions may not be needed based on existing guidelines. Studies show that patients with total joint replacement commonly receive unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis despite clinical practice guidelines from the American Dental Association and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons that recommend against using antibiotics to prevent late prosthetic joint infection in most cases.
2. How can a dental procedure impact a prosthetic joint. When you have a dental procedure, bacteria in your mouth can enter your bloodstream. This also happens during normal daily activities, such as brushing and flossing your teeth. For most people, the immune system kills the bacteria and prevents them from causing infection somewhere else in the body.

However, people with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of infection and may need to take an antibiotic before some dental procedures. Taking an antibiotic to prevent an infection is called antibiotic prophylaxis. In the past, antibiotic prophylaxis was commonly prescribed to patients with prosthetic joints before certain dental procedures to prevent joint infections. However, expert guidelines no longer recommend pre-dental procedure antibiotic prophylaxis for most patients with prosthetic joints. This is because studies have shown that antibiotics given before dental procedures do not prevent prosthetic joint infections and can lead to side effects and the development of antimicrobial resistance. Patients who have other indications for dental antibiotic prophylaxis should continue to receive antibiotics. Talk to a healthcare professional about when antibiotics are needed.

And increasing evidence suggests that dental procedures pose no greater risk for bacteremia for patients with TJR than activities of daily living, such as brushing teeth or eating. 3–6 Thus, the risks of antibiotic prophylaxis, including adverse drug reactions and the threat of antimicrobial resistance, outweigh the potential benefit for most patients.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^115igYqW]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline — prophylactic systemic antibiotics before dental procedures in hip or knee arthroplasty patients states that "Routine use of a systemic prophylactic antibiotic prior to a dental procedure in patients with a hip or knee replacement may not reduce the risk of a subsequent periprosthetic joint infection", with "Quality of Evidence: Low" and "Strength of Option: Limited". Evidence cited includes a cohort where "In 255,568 patients… within 2 years after arthroplasty" there was "no difference in PJI risk between those that received antibiotics and those that did not", a matched analysis where Berbari et al. reported no association "in 339 matched patients" and that "antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures did not decrease the risk of PJI", and a large "database analysis of over 1,952,917" that "found no association between a dental procedure… and risk of PJI" and that "the rates of PJI and revision were not different between patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis and those who did not". Benefits and harms note that "rates of PJI are reported as low as 1%", that "The direct societal cost… is significant", and that prophylaxis "may promote the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and increase the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection", while acknowledging practice context that "Antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures after THA and TKA is a widely utilized practice".

### International guideline changes and the incidence of infective endocarditis: a systematic review [^1129GUes]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a relatively rare disorder with an estimated incidence of 3–10 cases per 100 000 per year. Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances, prognosis remains poor, as reflected by hospital mortality of about 22%, rising to 40% at 5 years. Morbidity rates are also high; 50% of patients require operative management in the acute phase of the disease, often with ongoing consequences for quality of life. The substantial risk associated with IE has driven recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk subgroups, particularly those with valvular heart disease and other structural cardiac disorders.

Ever since the 1950s when the large-scale commercial production of penicillin was established, the American Heart Association (AHA) has advocated antibiotic prophylaxis in subgroups of patients undergoing invasive procedures, including dental extraction and certain gastrointestinal and genitourinary procedures, that are likely to cause secondary bacteraemia. Secondary bacteraemia in relation to these procedures is well documented but a causal relationship with IE has never been established in randomised trials or case–control studies. Despite this, antibiotic prophylaxis has remained a central component of management in at-risk individuals for over 50 years.

In 2002, innovative guidelines in France challenged accepted practice by suggesting restriction of prophylaxis against IE to patients with the highest ratio of benefit to individual and collective risk while emphasising the importance of general and oral hygiene in populations at risk. In 2007, the AHA — followed in 2009 by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) — withdrew recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in all but the highest risk individuals such as those with previous IE, prosthetic heart valves or immunodeficiency disorders. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) made the yet more radical recommendation for complete cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in all individuals regardless of risk. These new guideline recommendations, summarised in table 1, broke with a long-established principle of care and caused deep concern among many clinicians who cited historical, often small studies in questioning whether the recommendation was evidence based and whether it was safe for patients.NICE was unrepentant arguing that the absence of an evidence base was precisely why the need for antibiotic prophylaxis had been questioned and that the harms of anaphylaxis through wide-scale application of antibiotic prophylaxis were likely to exceed any potential benefits of IE prevention.

### Capturing orthopaedic surgical site infection data and assessing dental recommendations with respect to total joint arthroplasty [^117BLaWu]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Greater documentation of patient history and clinical course is crucial for identifying factors that can influence surgical outcomes. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have already begun public reporting of hospital data on readmission, complication, and infection rates and will soon launch a website to make physician-specific outcomes data public. The orthopaedic community has the opportunity to lead the way in ensuring that adequate and accurate data is collected to facilitate appropriate comparisons that are based on patients' true risk of complications and the complexity of treatment. Several studies have reported a link between oral pathogens and periprosthetic infection, although it remains unclear whether organisms unique to dental tissues are also present in osteoarthritic joints and tissues affected by periprosthetic joint infection. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Dental Association are aware of these concerns and have created guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients who have undergone total hip or knee arthroplasty and require high-risk dental procedures. Because these guidelines have received considerable criticism, recommendations that are based on scientific and case-controlled clinical studies and provide effective guidance on this important subject are needed.

### Interventions for replacing missing teeth: antibiotics at dental implant placement to prevent complications [^1125xure]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Some dental implant failures may be due to bacterial contamination at implant insertion. Infections around biomaterials are difficult to treat and almost all infected implants have to be removed. In general, antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery is only indicated for patients at risk of infectious endocarditis, for patients with reduced host-response, when surgery is performed in infected sites, in cases of extensive and prolonged surgical interventions and when large foreign materials are implanted. To minimise infections after dental implant placement various prophylactic systemic antibiotic regimens have been suggested. More recent protocols recommended short term prophylaxis, if antibiotics have to be used. With the administration of antibiotics adverse events may occur, ranging from diarrhoea to life-threatening allergic reactions. Another major concern associated with the widespread use of antibiotics is the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in implant dentistry is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial or harmful effects of systemic prophylactic antibiotics at dental implant placement versus no antibiotic/placebo administration and, if antibiotics are of benefit, to find which type, dosage and duration is the most effective.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched up to 2nd June 2010. Several dental journals were handsearched. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) with a follow up of at least 3 months comparing the administration of various prophylactic antibiotic regimens versus no antibiotics to patients undergoing dental implant placement. Outcome measures were prosthesis failures, implant failures, postoperative infections and adverse events (gastrointestinal, hypersensitivity, etc).

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two review authors. Results were expressed as random-effects models using risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was to be investigated including both clinical and methodological factors.

Main Results

Four RCTs were identified: three comparing 2 g of preoperative amoxicillin versus placebo (927 patients) and the other comparing 1 g of preoperative amoxicillin plus 500 mg 4 times a day for 2 days versus no antibiotics (80 patients). The meta-analyses of the four trials showed a statistically significant higher number of patients experiencing implant failures in the group not receiving antibiotics: RR = 0.40 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.84). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one patient having an implant failure is 33 (95% CI 17 to 100), based on a patient implant failure rate of 5% in patients not receiving antibiotics. The other outcomes were not statistically significant, and only two minor adverse events were recorded, one in the placebo group.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence suggesting that 2 g of amoxicillin given orally 1 hour preoperatively significantly reduce failures of dental implants placed in ordinary conditions. No significant adverse events were reported. It might be sensible to suggest the use of a single dose of 2 g prophylactic amoxicillin prior to dental implant placement. It is still unknown whether postoperative antibiotics are beneficial, and which is the most effective antibiotic.

### Antibiotics to prevent complications following dental implant treatment [^114BapQm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Some dental implant failures may be due to bacterial contamination at implant insertion. Infections around biomaterials are difficult to treat and almost all infected implants have to be removed. In general, antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery is only indicated for patients at risk of infectious endocarditis, for patients with reduced host-response, when surgery is performed in infected sites, in cases of extensive and prolonged surgical interventions and when large foreign materials are implanted. To minimise infections after dental implant placement various prophylactic systemic antibiotic regimens have been suggested.

With the administration of antibiotics adverse events may occur, ranging from diarrhoea to life-threatening allergic reactions. Another major concern associated with the widespread use of antibiotics is the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The use of antibiotics in implant dentistry is controversial. It would be useful to know whether prophylactic antibiotics are effective in reducing failures of dental implants.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial or harmful effects of the administration of prophylactic antibiotics for dental implant placement versus no antibiotic/placebo administration and if antibiotics are of benefit, to find which type, dosage and duration is the most effective.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. We handsearched several dental journals. No language restrictions were applied. Personal contacts and manufacturers of dental implants were contacted to identify unpublished trials. Most recent search: March 2003.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) with a follow up of at least 3 months comparing the administration of various prophylactic antibiotics regimens and no antibiotics/placebo to patients undergoing dental implant placement. Outcome measures were prosthesis failures, implant failures, postoperative infections and adverse events (gastrointestinal, hypersensitivity).

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were to be conducted in duplicate and independently by two reviewers. Results were to be expressed as random effects models using weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes and relative risk for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence interval. Heterogeneity was to be investigated including both clinical and methodological factors.

Main Results

No RCTs were identified.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is not appropriate scientific evidence to recommend or discourage the use of prophylactic systemic antibiotics to prevent complications and failures of dental implants. Even though the present review did not assess the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics for patients at risk for endocarditis, it seems sensible to recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics for patients at high and moderate risk for endocarditis, with immunodeficiencies, metabolic diseases, irradiated in the head and neck area and when an extensive or prolonged surgery is anticipated.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures at risk of causing bacteremia among post-total joint arthroplasty patients: a survey of Canadian orthopaedic surgeons and dental surgeons [^1151T9j7]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2014). Low credibility.

To elicit current practice and attitudes toward use of antibiotic-prophylaxis among TJA patients prior to dental procedures, a cross-sectional survey of practicing Canadian orthopaedic (OS) and dental surgeons (DS) was undertaken. Of respondents, 77% of OS and 71% of DS routinely prescribe antibiotic-prophylaxis, but while 63% of OS advocate lifelong use, only 22% of DS choose to do so (P < 0.0001). Both groups nonetheless recognize the importance of treatment within 2-years post-TJA as per AAOS/ADA guidelines. However, greater duration of practice pointed to potential inadequacy of these guidelines based on reported experience with late-hematogenous infection post-TJA. While discrepancies in attitude toward antibiotic-prophylaxis between surgeon groups remain, both groups agreed that the evidence to support decision making regarding antibiotic-prophylaxis for TJA patients undergoing dental procedures remains inadequate.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures following total joint arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1125jr99]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a serious complication following total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Hematogenous spread, including from dental procedures, is a proposed mechanism for PJI. While prophylactic antibiotics (PAs) have traditionally been recommended before dental procedures in patients with joint prostheses, recent guidelines question their effectiveness. This study aimed to evaluate the association between dental antibiotic prophylaxis and PJI risk through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies included adult patients who had TJAs undergoing dental procedures, with and without antibiotic prophylaxis, and reported PJI outcomes. There were four retrospective cohort studies, encompassing 157,466 patients, that met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A random-effects meta-analysis with Hartung-Knapp adjustment was used to pool odds ratios (OR).

Results

Incidence of PJI ranged from 0.07 to 0.3% across included studies. There were no studies that demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in PJI rates among patients who received prophylactic antibiotics. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in PJI risk between antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups, with a slight, non-significant increase in risk among patients receiving antibiotics. Several studies identified other PJI risk factors, including revision arthroplasty, obesity, congestive heart failure, and diabetes with end-organ damage.

Conclusion

Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures in patients who have primary total hip or knee arthroplasty does not reduce the risk of PJI. Given the low overall incidence of PJI and the potential harms of unnecessary antibiotic use, including resistance and adverse effects, current evidence supports limiting prophylaxis to select high-risk populations. Updated clinical guidelines should reflect these findings to enhance antibiotic stewardship and reduce healthcare costs.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^1166M6Ty]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Our results demonstrate that most antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental visits are unnecessary. These findings are concerning because dentists prescribe a significant proportion of antibiotics and are the top prescribers of clindamycin in the United States. Antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis by dentists have been associated with community-associated C difficile infection. One dose of clindamycin has an equivalent risk of C difficile compared with a prolonged course. Therefore, it is alarming that clindamycin was more likely to be inappropriately prescribed than amoxicillin. However, there was a significant decrease in antibiotic prophylaxis over the study period. This may indicate that the 2013 guidelines for the prevention of prosthetic joint infections are being applied to patient care.

These results are consistent with those from other countries, where 58% to 81% of dental antibiotic prescriptions are inconsistent with guidelines, particularly for infection prophylaxis. However, dentists are knowledgeable about and generally satisfied with the antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines. Regardless, 70% of dentists surveyed reported prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis when not indicated. Dentists in the United States identified factors associated with guideline-consistent antibiotic prescribing to be postgraduate education, urban locale, and a smaller patient panel. Reasons for higher antibiotic prescribing rates included increasing use of dental implants, an aging population, underinsurance driving antibiotics as an oral surgery substitute, slow adoption of new guidelines, lack of awareness of the role of dentists in antibiotic resistance, and physician and patient pressure. These characteristics are similar to those associated with physician antibiotic overprescribing. Therefore, antibiotic stewardship strategies shown to be effective in outpatient medical clinics may also improve antibiotic prescribing in dentistry. In fact, a recent example has provided early evidence that implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship in dental practices was effective.

### Analysis of prosthetic joint infections following invasive dental procedures in england [^116Xyn5s]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

LPJI is most often attributed to hematogenous seeding of bacteria from another anatomical site, and this led US orthopedic surgeons to recommend patients with prosthetic joints be given antibiotic prophylaxis prior to invasive dental procedures (IDP), a practice that is supported by more than 90% of US orthopedic surgeons. Nonetheless, there are little data to support a causal link between IDP and LPJI, and there has never been a randomized clinical trial of antibiotic prophylaxis efficacy in preventing LPJI, to our knowledge. Furthermore, microbiological studies suggest that oral streptococci are an uncommon cause of LPJI, accounting for less than 10% of infections. These reasons may explain why antibiotic prophylaxis use for patients with prosthetic joints is not advocated in many countries, including the United Kingdom. The annual cost of providing antibiotic prophylaxis in the US has been calculated at approximately $59 640 000, but this does not take into account the cost of adverse drug reactions caused by antibiotic prophylaxis, or the risk that antibiotic prophylaxis could contribute to selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

For antibiotic prophylaxis to be effective, there must be a positive temporal association between IDP and LPJI, but data on this are lacking. In the absence of this evidence, the demand on US dentists to provide antibiotic prophylaxis for IDP remains controversial. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a positive association between LPJI and IDP in the population of England where, because antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended, the association should be fully exposed.

### Antibiotic use in dentistry… [^115KYYeU]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis before dental visits was recommended in the past for patients at high risk of infective endocarditis and for patients with prosthetic joints to prevent prosthetic joint infections. Former guidelines for the use of antibiotics for the prevention of IE and PJIs were revised to narrow the indications for prophylaxis in the 2007 and 2013 versions. 4, 5 Revisions were undertaken due to a lack of evidence supporting an association between dental procedures and secondary infections or any benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis, combined with increased recognition of the risk of antibiotic-associated adverse events. The article by Suda and colleagues6 assesses the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis for IE and PJIs before dental procedures. Their findings suggest that an astounding 80. 9% of antibiotics prescribed for IE and PJI prophylaxis before dental procedures are unnecessary, and they make a call to action for improved antibiotic prescribing in dentistry.

Preprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis for IE and PJIs was defined as systemic antibiotic prescription with a days' supply of 2 days or less occurring within 7 days before a dental visit. Preexisting medical diagnoses and procedures were based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification and Current Procedural Terminology coding. Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as both an indicated procedure and a medical history consistent with guideline recommendations. Of the 168 420 dental visits with antibiotics included, Suda and colleagues6 found that 80. 9% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions for IE and PJIs were unnecessary.

Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing was more common among women, in the western United States, with the use of clindamycin, and in patients with prosthetic joints. Aside from unnecessary prophylaxis in patients with prosthetic joints, the study by Suda and colleagues6 leaves unanswered questions regarding what additional factors may be driving antibiotic prophylaxis. Possible reasons include delayed application of revised IE prophylaxis guidelines and continued use for previous indications, such as mitral valve prolapse.

### Analysis of prosthetic joint infections following invasive dental procedures in england [^115FJ8dz]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study of 9427 patients with dental records who developed LPJI, time trend and case-crossover analyses found no evidence of a temporal association between IDP and LPJI. In the 1970s and 1980s, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis in individuals at high risk of LPJI undergoing IDP became well established and led US orthopedic surgeons to call for dentists to give antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with prosthetic joints. In 1988, the American Dental Association (ADA) sponsored a workshop to address this. Although there was limited evidence to support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, they recommended its use until further evidence became available, and antibiotic prophylaxis was widely adopted by dentists. In 1997and 2003the ADA and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) jointly published advisory statements recommending antibiotic prophylaxis for just 2 years after joint replacement but lifelong for patients with medical conditions that might put them at increased LPJI risk. However, in 2009, the AAOS unilaterally recommended that clinicians consider antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients with joint replacements prior to any invasive procedure that may cause bacteremia. This caused confusion among dentists and their patients. Several subsequent attempts were made by AAOS and ADA, either together or alone, to produce guidance, but these efforts only increased uncertainty about whether to provide antibiotic prophylaxis or not. As a result, in 2014, the ADA's Council on Scientific Affairs assembled an expert panel to conduct a systematic review. They recommended: "In general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures". Unfortunately, this advice lacked AAOS support. Consequently, there is still confusion among dentists and their patients, as well as ongoing pressure from orthopedic surgeons for their patients to receive antibiotic prophylaxis when undergoing IDP, and many dentists continue to give antibiotic prophylaxis for fear of being considered negligent.

### The use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joints: evidence-based clinical practice guideline for dental practitioners – a report of the American dental association council on scientific affairs [^112SYCr6]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Management of patients with prosthetic joints undergoing dental procedures — clinical recommendation states that, in general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection. For patients with a history of complications associated with their joint replacement surgery who are undergoing dental procedures that include gingival manipulation or mucosal incision, prophylactic antibiotics should only be considered after consultation with the patient and orthopedic surgeon, and a complete health history is always recommended when making final decisions regarding the need for antibiotic prophylaxis. The clinical reasoning provided is that there is evidence that dental procedures are not associated with prosthetic joint implant infections, that antibiotics provided before dental care do not prevent prosthetic joint implant infections, that there are potential harms of antibiotics including risk for anaphylaxis, antibiotic resistance, and opportunistic infections (e.g. Clostridium difficile), that the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis may not exceed the harms for most patients, and that the individual patient's circumstances and preferences should be considered when deciding whether to prescribe prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures.

As the population ages and people remain active into the 7th and 8th decades of life, the frequency of total joint replacement is increasing. Following joint replacement surgery, patients inevitably require various invasive procedures as part of their routine health maintenance, including, but not limited to, dental care, colonoscopy, cystoscopy, and cardiac catheterization. There is scant evidence to support the use of periprocedural prophylactic antibiotics in the prevention of late total joint infection. The guidelines for the usage of periprocedural antibiotics have changed as knowledge of the pathophysiology of joint infection has evolved. We review the current recommendations from subspecialty academic organizations regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing routine urologic, gastrointestinal, dental, and cardiac procedures after total joint replacement.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions prior to dental visits in the veterans' health administration (VHA), 2015–2019 [^1115WU8H]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine prophylaxis appropriateness by Veterans' Affairs (VA) dentists.

Design

A cross-sectional study of dental visits, 2015–2019.

Methods

Antibiotics within 7 days before a visit in the absence of an oral infection were included. Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as visits with gingival manipulation and further delineated into narrow and broad definitions based on comorbidities. The primary analysis applied a narrow definition of appropriate prophylaxis: cardiac conditions at the highest risk of an adverse outcome from endocarditis. The secondary analysis included a broader definition: cardiac or immunocompromising condition or tooth extractions and/or implants. Multivariable log-linear Poisson generalized estimating equation regression was used to assess the association between covariates and unnecessary prophylaxis prescriptions.

Results

In total, 358,078 visits were associated with 369,102 antibiotics. The median prescription duration was 7 days (IQR, 7–10); only 6.5% were prescribed for 1 day. With the narrow definition, 15% of prophylaxis prescriptions were appropriate, which increased to 72% with the broader definition. Prophylaxis inconsistent with guidelines increased over time. For the narrow definition, Black (vs White) race, Latine (vs non-Latine) ethnicity, and visits located in the West census region were associated with unnecessary prophylaxis. Variables associated with a lower risk were older age, prosthetic joints, immunocompromising condition, and rural location.

Conclusions

Of every 6 antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions, 5 were inconsistent with guidelines. Improving prophylaxis appropriateness and shortening duration may have substantial implications for stewardship. Guidelines should state whether antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for extractions, implants, and immunocompromised patients.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in orthopedic prosthetic surgery [^1177oxQQ]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The problem of prophylaxis in orthopedic implant surgery will become increasingly important and complex as the population ages and requires more arthroplasty procedures, and the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria meanwhile also continues to rise. Energy spent preventing prosthetic joint infection is more effective than that expended in treating the infection of a prosthetic joint, once established. Preventive measures encompass a wide array of variables related to host response, wound environment, and microorganisms. Prophylaxis should address these areas in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods. Antimicrobial prophylaxis remains the single most effective method of reducing the prevalence of infection after total joint arthroplasty. In the postoperative period, prophylaxis aims to protect the prosthetic joint against hematogenous seeding from oral, urologic, skin, or gastrointestinal sources. Currently, dental and urologic advisory statements provide recommendations for antimicrobial prophylaxis for high-risk patients with total joint arthroplasty undergoing high-risk procedures. Close collaboration between the orthopedic surgeon, urologist, or dentist and the infectious disease specialist is crucial for providing recommendations regarding prophylaxis in special circumstances. In these particular circumstances, individual decisions should be made based on clinical judgment.

The Prevention of Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Periprosthetic Joint Infection in Patients Undergoing Dental Procedures Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies examining the influence of dental care and procedures on outcomes after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) as well as strategies to mitigate potential risks associated with dental care and procedures in patients with a TJA. The scope of this guideline includes the role of dental screening, antibiotic prophylaxis, use of antimicrobial mouth rinses, and timing of dental procedures before and after TJA. The population was limited to patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty because of a paucity of data on patients with other orthopaedic implants. Based on the best current available evidence, this guideline contains five options to assist all qualified clinicians, including orthopaedic surgeons and dental providers, considering the prevention of total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infections in patients undergoing dental procedures. It is also intended to serve as an information resource for professional healthcare practitioners and developers of practice guidelines and recommendations. In addition to providing pragmatic practice recommendations, this guideline also highlights gaps in literature and informs areas for future research and quality measure development.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^11554yd4]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Antibiotics are recommended before certain dental procedures in patients with select comorbidities to prevent serious distant site infections.

Objective

To assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures using Truven, a national integrated health claims database.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study. Dental visits from 2011 to 2015 were linked to medical and prescription claims from 2009 to 2015. The dates of analysis were August 2018 to January 2019. Participants were US patients with commercial dental insurance without a hospitalization or extraoral infection 14 days before antibiotic prophylaxis (defined as a prescription with ≤ 2 days' supply dispensed within 7 days before a dental visit).

Exposures

Presence or absence of cardiac diagnoses and dental procedures that manipulated the gingiva or tooth periapex.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as a prescription dispensed before a dental visit with a procedure that manipulated the gingiva or tooth periapex in patients with an appropriate cardiac diagnosis. To assess associations between patient or dental visit characteristics and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, multivariable logistic regression was used. A priori hypothesis tests were performed with an α level of .05.

Results

From 2011 to 2015, antibiotic prophylaxis was prescribed for 168 420 dental visits for 91 438 patients (median age, 63 years; interquartile range, 55–72 years; 57.2% female). Overall, these 168 420 dental visits were associated with 287 029 dental procedure codes (range, 1–14 per visit). Most dental visits were classified as diagnostic (70.2%) and/or preventive (58.8%). In 90.7% of dental visits, a procedure was performed that would necessitate antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk cardiac patients. Prevalent comorbidities include prosthetic joint devices (42.5%) and cardiac conditions at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis (20.9%). Per guidelines, 80.9% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions before dental visits were unnecessary. Clindamycin was more likely to be unnecessary relative to amoxicillin (odds ratio [OR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15). Prosthetic joint devices (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.22–2.41), tooth implant procedures (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.45–1.89), female sex (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.17–1.25), and visits occurring in the western United States (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06–1.25) were associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis.

Conclusion and Relevance

More than 80% of antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental visits were unnecessary. Implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in dental practices is an opportunity to improve antibiotic prescribing for infection prophylaxis.

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) prophylaxis — In the absence of reliable evidence comparing other antibiotics and antibiotic combinations, including those listed in the guideline, it is the opinion of this work group that perioperative antibiotics should be selected based on principles of responsible stewardship, balancing the risk of PJI and antibiotic resistance. Selection should reflect the antibiogram of the individual institution, the individual risk factors of the patient, and multidisciplinary support of institutional infection control experts; there is no current reliable evidence to support one antibiotic versus the other. Strength of Recommendation: Consensus.

### Analysis of prosthetic joint infections following invasive dental procedures in england [^111MEQrc]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an association between invasive dental procedures (IDP) and late prosthetic joint infections (LPJI) in patients who did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis prior to IDP?

Findings

This cohort study of 9427 LPJI hospital admissions for which dental records were available from 15 months preceding admission found no evidence of a temporal association between IDP and LPJI.

Meaning

These findings refute recommendations to give antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with prosthetic joints prior to IDP, given the cost, adverse drug reaction risk, and potential for promoting antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic prophylaxis.

Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) risk after dental procedures — case-control evidence and review methods: The 2012 Panel "identified 1 study" providing direct evidence; Berbari and colleagues conducted a case-control study of "339 patients with infected hip or knee prostheses (cases)" matched with "339" controls at the "Mayo Clinic Care Network (Rochester, MN) from December 2001 through May 2006", with exposure "measured within the previous 6 months and 2 years" and classified as low-risk dental procedures (fluoride treatment, restorative dentistry, and endodontic treatment) and high-risk dental procedures (periodontal treatment, extraction, treatment of a dental abscess, oral surgery, and dental hygiene). Controls were matched on joint location, yielding "prosthetic hip (n = 164) and knee (n = 175) replacements among cases and controls". Regression modeling using odds ratios showed "no statistical association" for high-risk procedures without antibiotics at "6-months (OR = 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4–1.7) or 2-years (OR = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4–1.6)", whereas with antibiotics results were "statistically significant at 6 months (OR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.9), but not at 2 years (OR = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–1.1)". The 2014 Panel "considered the direct evidence" linking dental procedures to PJI and "did not conduct a meta-analysis" of observational studies due to potential confounding risk.

### Medical clearance for common dental procedures… [^115z2Azp]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Although people with diabetes have a well-documented increased risk of infection in general, research suggests that this does not extend to tooth extractions, regardless of the level of glycemic control. 24 Thus, diabetes alone is not an indication for using antibiotics in patients undergoing routine extractions. 24 Studies are not as clear about dental implant procedures, and research is ongoing to investigate whether the success of implants is influenced by glycemic control. 42 It may be helpful for physicians to include a recent A1C level in the medical consultation. HEPATIC DISEASE AND CIRRHOSIS Cirrhosis is associated with coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, anemia, ascites, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A dental assessment and treatment are critical in preparing patients with cirrhosis for liver transplantation by optimizing oral health and minimizing the risk of oral infections.

3 per μL has been challenged by studies showing that dental extractions are safe when platelet counts are as low as 10 × 10³ per μL. 25, 26 Studies also show that the risk of hemorrhage during dental extraction in patients with cirrhosis is not predicted by laboratory values. 25 Given the lack of consensus, it may be reasonable for physicians to include a recent complete blood count, prothrombin time, and INR in the medical consultation for a dental extraction. 25, 29. The preferred analgesic for patients with dental pain and compensated hepatic dysfunction or cirrhosis who abstain from alcohol is acetaminophen, sometimes limited to 2 g per day. 27, 28 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, except aspirin when prescribed for cardiovascular disease, are usually avoided because of platelet, kidney, and gastric risks. 28, 29.

OSTEOPOROSIS Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw is a serious complication associated with the use of bisphosphonates and other antiresorptive agents or antiangiogenic cancer treatments. 9, 30 A history of exposure to these drugs can increase the patient's lifetime risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw by up to 100-fold, depending on the treatment regimen and indication for which it was prescribed. 9 Dental extraction and implant procedures are known to trigger osteonecrosis; therefore, the dentist may need to modify the care plan in these patients. 30.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures after total hip and knee arthroplasty does not decrease the risk of periprosthetic joint infection [^116ZcYQs]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication after total hip and total knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA). While some guidelines no longer recommend routine use of prophylactic antibiotics for dental procedures, many surgeons continue to prescribe antibiotics for their THA/TKA patients. In a setting of increasing antibiotic resistance, it is important to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. This study aims to evaluate antibiotics prior to dental procedures and the association between dental procedures and PJI.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent THA/TKA between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020. The primary outcome was late-presenting PJI, occurring > 90 days after surgery. Patients were designated in the antibiotic group (2,000 mg of amoxicillin) or non-antibiotic group based on their surgeon's prophylaxis protocol. Dental-associated PJIs were considered if the patient had evidence of poor dentition or a recent dental procedure prior to the onset of PJI symptoms.

Results

There were 2,871 (26.4%) patients in the no antibiotics group and 8,023 (73.6%) patients in the antibiotics group. We found 27 (0.3%) late-presenting PJIs and 4 dental-associated PJIs. In the univariate and multivariable analyses, body mass index ≥ -30 and revision surgery were the only variables that increased the odds of late-presenting PJI. All 4 dental-associated PJIs occurred in patients prescribed antibiotics.

Conclusions

We found a low rate of late-presenting PJI. Routine antibiotics prior to dental procedures were not shown to affect the risk of late-presenting PJI. These findings suggest that routine antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures is not necessary after THA/TKA.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^114Vksmq]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Results

More than 3 million dental visits and antibiotic prescriptions were identified in the Truven commercial dental database during the study period of 2011 to 2015. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 168 420 eligible dental visits (or episodes of care) with antibiotic prophylaxis for 91 438 unique patients were included in this analysis (Figure 1). The characteristics of the sample are listed in Table 2. The median age of the cohort was 63 years (interquartile range, 55–72 years) and was majority female (57.2%). Overall, these 168 420 dental visits were associated with 287 029 dental procedure codes (range, 1–14 per visit). Most visits with antibiotic prophylaxis occurred in the midwestern United States (46.9%), followed by the southern United States (31.5%), and occurred in an urban setting (56.7%). Most dental procedures conducted during the dental visits with antibiotic prophylaxis were classified as diagnostic (70.2%), followed by preventive (58.8%), and involved some type of gingival manipulation and/or mucosal incision (90.7%). Comorbidities were common in the cohort, especially prosthetic joint devices (42.5%) and cardiac conditions at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis (20.9%). Health care use in the previous 6 months was common, with half having a primary care visit (50.7%) and most having a specialty care visit (80.4%).

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^111hctyT]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Given the varying guidelines and recommendations occurring over the course of the study period (updated prosthetic joint infection prophylaxis guidelines were published in 2013 and reaffirmed in 2015), we conducted sensitivity analyses varying the definition of what would qualify as an indication for joint-related prophylaxis (1) defining a 2-year window of appropriate antibiotic prescription after prosthetic joint placement (the highest-risk period for infection)and (2) using prior guidelinesper recommendations by Lockhart. Other sensitivity analyses estimating the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis included varying selection criteria within plausible scenarios of (1) continuous medical plan enrollment throughout the entire study period, (2) stratified years of estimates to reflect changes in practice and guideline recommendations, and (3) stratification of patients with and without a history of prosthetic joint diagnoses or procedures.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive characteristics of groups with visits identified as having an appropriate use of antibiotic prophylaxis and those that did not were compared using independent-samples t test for continuous variables and χ 2 test for categorical variables. Missing data (55 observations) were included in the analysis and are labeled in the multivariable analysis as unknown. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs with robust standard errors for association between patient-level and visit-level characteristics and appropriate antibiotic use. Also, in analyses that included multiple visits per patient (54.3% in the primary analysis), generalized estimating equations with a first-order autoregressive working matrix were used to estimate corresponding ORs and 95% CIs. Variables significant in unadjusted analyses or identified as factors associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis were included in the model. The most parsimonious model was selected by only including those final variables significantly associated with prescribing. SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc), was used for all analyses. A priori hypothesis tests were performed with a 2-sided α level of.05.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^114yLAGG]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Dentists prescribe 1 in 10 antibiotic prescriptions and are the top specialty prescriber of antibiotics in the United States. Antibiotic prescribing by dentists is common, comprising almost 60% of prescriptions to Medicare Part D beneficiaries. While decreases in prescribing of antibiotics have been observed nationally, dental prescribing has remained steady. This is despite changes in clinical guidelines narrowing the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures.,

Prior infection prophylaxis guidelines recommended that patients with certain conditions (ie, patients with recent prosthetic joint implants) receive antibiotic prophylaxis before a dentist visit. The rationale for prophylaxis was that patients with these conditions have an increased risk for serious distant site infections (eg, infective endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections) secondary to bacteremia introduced during dental care. However, guidelines for the use of antibiotics for the prevention of infective endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections were revised in 2007 and 2013, respectively. The rationale for these revisions was secondary to poor evidence on the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis, lack of an association between endocarditis and joint infections and dental care, and the risk of antibiotic-associated adverse events. Antibiotic resistance, risk of Clostridioides difficile infection, and general adverse effects outweigh any potential benefit, which is likely to be small. Therefore, antibiotics before dental procedures are only recommended per guidelines in patients with cardiac conditions at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis undergoing invasive dental procedures.

While studies in outpatient primary medical care settings have demonstrated that 30% of antibiotics prescribed are unnecessary, no study has evaluated the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing by dentists. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures.

Defining the strength of recommendation — strength of recommendation expresses the degree of confidence one can have in a recommendation and takes into account the quality, quantity, and the trade-off between the benefits and harms of a treatment, the magnitude of a treatment's effect, and whether data exists on critical outcomes. Future evidence is very difficult to overturn recommendations based on many high quality randomized controlled trials that show a large effect, whereas it is much more likely to overturn recommendations derived from a few small retrospective comparative studies; consequently, recommendations based on the former are given a "strong" strength of recommendation and statements based on the latter are presented as "Options" with either a "limited" strength or, in the event of no supporting or only conflicting evidence, a "consensus" strength. For any "consensus" strength option, inclusion of a statement in the clinical practice guideline is at the discretion of the guideline development group.

Many patients with artificial joints seek guidance from their dental and orthopaedic surgeons on whether they should take prophylactic antibiotics for routine dental treatment. Advice on this has been conflicting in the past, and other than a joint statement from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Dental Association, there has been little official guidance. In view of the lack of consensus, we have reviewed the relevant literature and have concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis should not be routinely given to all patients undergoing dental treatment but should be reserved for those patients deemed at high risk.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is the use of antibiotics in the perioperative period to prevent surgical site infections from local flora. Specific guidelines and criteria exist to prevent these infections while also practicing antimicrobial stewardship. Most dentoalveolar procedures do not require antibiotic prophylaxis. For nondentoalveolar procedures, the decision to provide antibiotic prophylaxis is based on involvement of the respiratory, oral, or pharyngeal mucosa. Special considerations exist for patients at high risk for infective endocarditis, patients with head and neck cancer, and temporomandibular joint replacement procedures. This article discusses indications for antibiotic prophylaxis during oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures.

Multivariable Analysis of Factors Associated With Unnecessary Antibiotic Prophylaxis Among 168 420 Dental Visits

Abbreviations: ADA, American Dental Association; ED, emergency department; PCP, primary care provider.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess whether our findings were robust to assumptions of selection criteria within a plausible range. In the event that medical coding missed a cardiac condition diagnosis, we limited our cohort to those patients continuously enrolled in the medical plan from 2009 until the date of the visit. In this continuous enrollment analysis, 60.1% (n = 101 231) of the cohort were included, and 80.2% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were defined as unnecessary. The 2003 guidelines for the prevention of prosthetic joint infections also changed during our study period (updated guidelines were published in 2013 [released online in 2012]) (Table 1). The results were similar after modifying our definition of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis with recommendations in the 2003 prosthetic joint infection guidelines(75.7% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were unnecessary overall [76.7% in 2011–2013 and 74.1% in 2014–2015]). The highest-risk period of a prosthetic joint infection after joint implant placement is 2 years. After including prosthetic joint placement within 2 years in our definition of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, 80.9% of antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental visits were unnecessary. A subanalysis of the cohort with visits clustered into episodes of care (n = 13 825), 82.7% of patients at the first visit, 84.6% at the second visit, and 84.3% at the third visit received unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis. Stratifying the overall cohort by the presence or absence of a prosthetic joint, 11.2% of patients with a prosthetic joint received appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis secondary to a concomitant cardiac condition (n = 71 651). After excluding those with a prosthetic joint, the percentage of visits with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased to 75.0% (n = 96 769). Similar characteristics were found to be associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis as identified in the full analysis (eTables 1, 2, and 3 in the Supplement).
