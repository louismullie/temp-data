## Question

What is the management of spinal cord compression detected on MRI following a motor vehicle collision, both in patients with and without neurological deficits?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of traumatic spinal cord compression detected on MRI after a motor vehicle collision, for patients with and without neurological deficits. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate trauma stabilization and spinal motion restriction. Then, I should clarify the optimal imaging strategy, including when to obtain CT versus MRI and how urgently. Next, I will classify neurological status with ISNCSCI to guide urgency. After that, I will delineate management for patients with and without neurological deficits, including timing of decompression, hemodynamics, and the role of steroids. I also need to consider special entities like central cord syndrome, and finally outline postoperative care, rehabilitation, and prognostication using MRI features, while continuously verifying claims against the evidence base as I go [^111UwdLn] [^1131nZCX] [^115BgnR1].

> Let me first confirm initial priorities: follow ATLS principles while protecting the spinal cord with spinal motion restriction rather than rigid immobilization, maintaining neutral alignment during extrication, and preferring jaw thrust over head tilt–chin lift to avoid cervical extension; I should double-check that guidance, and yes, the updated WMS recommendations emphasize motion restriction and airway techniques consistent with cord protection, which I will apply here [^1131nZCX] [^1129CF44] [^111UwdLn].

> Next, I should review imaging sequencing; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because in trauma the fastest modality to detect fracture stability is CT, while MRI answers questions about neural elements and soft tissues. So, obtain CT first to assess osseous injury and alignment, then escalate to MRI if there are neurological deficits, suspected canal compromise, ligamentous injury, or persistent clinical concern despite a nonrevealing CT, including potential SCIWORA; if feasible, perform MRI urgently, even within hours, recognizing logistics for unstable patients who may need MRI-compatible monitoring and anesthesia support [^116aYktR] [^115BgnR1] [^1146yWew] [^112Mr2jG] [^115Wmi8s].

> I will now examine neurological classification because it dictates urgency; I need to ensure use of standardized tools. The AANS/CNS guidelines recommend the ISNCSCI/AIS exam for severity grading and documentation, which I should perform serially to detect evolution from AIS A–C to D–E or vice versa, and I should also document pain using the recommended datasets for comprehensive assessment where appropriate [^116HMKsb] [^116gLZ8V].

> For patients with neurological deficits, early decompression is the priority; let me think about timing and approach. The initial statement I have says decompression between 24–72 hours is too late to prevent substantial permanent deficits, which suggests that only surgery within 24 hours is acceptable, but wait, I should verify that because it sounds absolute; while multiple trauma consensus papers and cohort data support "early" surgery with better outcomes, the quality is variable, and although ultra-early or within-24-hour decompression is associated with improved recovery, benefits can still accrue beyond 24 hours in many scenarios, so saying 24–72 hours is categorically too late is too strong and needs correction. A more defensible position is to pursue decompression as soon as safely possible, ideally within 24 hours, while recognizing that patient factors, transfer delays, and instability may necessitate surgery in the 24–72 hour window, which can still be beneficial, especially when MRI confirms persistent compression amenable to surgery [^111UwdLn] [^114pkQ5P] [^115dVkM1] [^112vGcnM] [^116P3VrZ].

> I need to check the surgical approach selection; anterior approaches suit ventral compression such as disc, osteophyte, or burst retropulsion, posterior approaches suit dorsal compression, multilevel stenosis, or posterior element disruption, and combined strategies are used for circumferential or complex injuries; let me verify that surgeons commonly tailor ACDF, ACCF, laminectomy, and instrumented fusion to injury morphology and that post-operative MRI confirmation of a continuous CSF interface around the cord is a reasonable quality metric of decompression, which aligns with published series and definitions used in neurotrauma studies [^116GjNap] [^116ytNL7] [^114xdSUq].

> Now, I should confirm hemodynamic goals and ICU monitoring; maintaining mean arterial pressure 85–90 mmHg for the first week is advised to optimize cord perfusion, with monitored care for cardiovascular and respiratory complications, and I need to ensure we avoid routine high-dose methylprednisolone in traumatic cord injury given lack of supportive contemporary evidence; steroids remain indicated for malignant epidural compression as a bridge to definitive therapy, so I must distinguish traumatic from malignant etiologies when considering corticosteroids [^1125MgGz] [^116yH7tD] [^115dVkM1] [^117LBPPB] [^114RUipG] [^1136f1UV].

> But wait, what if the patient has MRI-confirmed compression without neurological deficits; I should not over-treat. In AIS D–E patients with stable fractures, ≤ 25% maximal spinal cord compression, and no PLC disruption, careful nonoperative management with immobilization, frequent neurological checks, and readiness to repeat MRI if symptoms evolve is appropriate; I should double-check that MRI is used judiciously and that ED survey MRI protocols can expedite triage in select systems while avoiding overutilization [^1131nZCX] [^115BgnR1] [^116aYktR] [^111A4oCL].

> I will now examine triggers for surgery even without overt deficits; progressive compression on interval imaging, unstable fracture patterns such as PLC disruption or facet dislocation, substantial canal compromise or high MSCC, and intramedullary hemorrhage or extensive edema are red flags for deterioration and poor outcomes that should prompt early decompression; let me verify the thresholds, and yes, higher MSCC and intramedullary hemorrhage predict worse neurological recovery, and data suggest that focal compression alone with normal canal diameter is not a strong predictor, whereas multilevel compression and smaller canal diameters increase risk, so canal diameter and extent/number of compressed levels refine risk beyond simple "any compression" [^113yaUFc] [^114wZoj5] [^111Abw92] [^115Uz8Ea].

> Next, I should review central cord syndrome considerations; older patients with preexisting cervical stenosis after MVC may present with disproportionate upper extremity weakness and variable bladder involvement. Early decompression is recommended when compression is focal and anterior, and emerging evidence suggests better functional outcomes when surgery is performed within 24 hours, though I should acknowledge persisting heterogeneity and evolving definitions of this entity, with some advocating the term acute traumatic myelopathy to clarify the pathophysiology and stabilize decision-making frameworks [^1125MgGz] [^112oxRze] [^111VV9bE] [^1116w2Ne].

> After operative care, I need to ensure verification of decompression and structured rehabilitation; post-operative MRI can confirm restoration of a continuous CSF column around the cord, and early transfer to specialized spinal cord injury centers with initiation of multidisciplinary rehabilitation is associated with improved outcomes, which I should prioritize alongside prevention and management of complications such as infections and neuropathic pain [^114xdSUq] [^115dVkM1].

> For prognostication, hold on, I should verify the value and limits of early MRI metrics. Greater maximal spinal cord compression, longer cord edema, and intramedullary hemorrhage correlate with poorer neurological recovery, and intramedullary lesion length can expand over the first 48–72 hours, underscoring the importance of timely decompression and repeat imaging when clinically indicated; however, I should confirm that prognostication must integrate multiple factors and avoid reliance on a single variable, given heterogeneity in evidence quality and patient trajectories [^113yaUFc] [^111R5fxX] [^113jYykH] [^112DSQ43].

> Bringing this together into a practical algorithm, let me reconsider the sequence to ensure clarity: stabilize with ATLS while protecting the spine, obtain CT first and proceed immediately to MRI when deficits or high-risk features are present, perform ISNCSCI grading to set urgency, pursue surgical decompression as soon as safely possible — ideally within 24 hours — when neurological deficits or high-risk imaging features exist, maintain MAP 85–90 mmHg with ICU-level monitoring, avoid routine steroids in traumatic compression while using corticosteroids promptly for malignant epidural compression, manage neurologically intact and stable cases nonoperatively with close observation and selective imaging, and verify decompression postoperatively with MRI followed by early specialized rehabilitation, adjusting prognosis with a composite of clinical and MRI predictors rather than any single measure [^111UwdLn] [^115BgnR1] [^1125MgGz] [^115dVkM1] [^117LBPPB] [^113yaUFc].

---

For spinal cord compression following a motor vehicle collision, **immediate immobilization and MRI** [^1131nZCX] [^115BgnR1] [^113jYykH] are essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide management. If neurological deficits are present, **urgent surgical decompression within 24 hours** [^111UwdLn] [^1125MgGz] [^112vGcnM] is recommended to prevent permanent injury and improve outcomes. If no deficits are present, use **continued immobilization and close neurological monitoring** [^115ALSj7], reserving surgery for later only if instability or new deficits develop. High-dose steroids are not routinely recommended [^111UwdLn] because of limited benefit and potential harm. Early rehabilitation and multidisciplinary care [^115dVkM1] are critical for recovery and for preventing complications.

---

## Initial management and diagnostic evaluation

### Immediate immobilization and stabilization

- **Immobilization**: Immediate spinal immobilization is critical to prevent further injury during transport and initial evaluation [^1131nZCX].

- **Alignment**: Maintain neutral alignment using nonrigid tools during extrication unless resistance, increased pain, or new/worsening neurological deficits occur [^1129CF44].

- **Airway**: Prefer jaw thrust over head tilt/chin lift for airway management in suspected spinal cord injury [^1129CF44].

---

### Imaging evaluation

MRI is the **gold standard** [^113jYykH] for evaluating spinal cord compression and offers detailed assessment of the cord, ligamentous structures, and soft tissues [^115BgnR1]. CT complements MRI by characterizing bony injury and instability [^115Wmi8s] [^1138F9Rh].

---

## Treatment strategies based on neurological status

### Patients with neurological deficits

#### Surgical intervention

- **Timing**: Urgent surgical decompression within 24 hours is recommended to prevent permanent neurological injury and improve outcomes [^111UwdLn] [^1125MgGz] [^116P3VrZ].

- **Indications**: Surgery is indicated for neurological deficits, spinal instability, or significant cord compression on MRI [^111UwdLn].

- **Approach**: The choice of surgical approach (anterior, posterior, or combined) depends on injury location, severity, and surgeon expertise [^116GjNap].

---

#### Medical management

High-dose steroids (e.g. methylprednisolone) are **controversial and not routinely recommended** because of limited evidence and potential complications [^111UwdLn]. Maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 85 mmHg [^1125MgGz] to support spinal cord perfusion.

---

#### Rehabilitation and supportive care

Early rehabilitation with physical and occupational therapy is **essential** to promote functional recovery [^115dVkM1] and prevent complications. Multidisciplinary care, including pain management and psychological support, is critical for optimal outcomes [^116DMwxe].

---

### Patients without neurological deficits

#### Conservative management

Continue **immobilization with close neurological monitoring**. Observation is appropriate, reserving delayed surgery for the development of neurological deficits or evidence of instability [^115ALSj7].

---

#### Surgical intervention

Consider **surgery** when significant spinal instability or progressive neurological deficits develop. If indicated, operative intervention is typically delayed until these occur during observation.

---

## Prognostic factors influencing treatment decisions

Several **prognostic factors** influence treatment decisions and outcomes:

| **Prognostic factor** | **Impact on treatment decisions** |
|-|-|
| Degree of cord compression | Higher compression severity necessitates urgent surgical decompression |
| Presence of neurological deficits | Deficits indicate urgent surgical intervention [^111UwdLn] |
| Spinal instability | Instability requires surgical stabilization [^1125MgGz] |
| Patient age and comorbidities | Older age and comorbidities may influence surgical risk and recovery [^112DSQ43] |
| MRI findings (edema, hemorrhage) | Intramedullary edema or hemorrhage indicates severe injury, necessitating urgent intervention |

---

## Potential complications and risks

### Surgical intervention

Surgical management carries **risks**, including infection, bleeding, neurological deterioration, and hardware failure. Additional anesthesia-related risks are of particular concern in patients with comorbidities [^111M5pw4].

---

### Conservative management

Conservative treatment carries a **risk of neurological deterioration** if instability or compression worsens and may lead to immobilization-related complications such as pressure ulcers and deep vein thrombosis [^115dVkM1].

---

## Follow-up and rehabilitation

Follow-up requires **regular neurological assessments and imaging** to monitor recovery and detect complications [^113jYykH]. Early, multidisciplinary rehabilitation is essential to promote recovery and prevent complications [^115dVkM1].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Neurological deficits present | - Immediate immobilization <br/> - Urgent surgical decompression within 24 hours <br/> - Early rehabilitation |
| No neurological deficits | - Conservative management <br/> - Continued immobilization <br/> - Close monitoring <br/> - Delayed surgery if deficits or instability develop |

---

Immediate **immobilization and MRI** are essential following a motor vehicle collision with spinal cord compression [^115BgnR1]. Urgent surgical decompression within 24 hours is recommended for patients with neurological deficits [^111UwdLn], while conservative management with close monitoring is appropriate for those without deficits [^115ALSj7]. Early rehabilitation and multidisciplinary care are critical for recovery and preventing complications [^115dVkM1].

### ATLS(r) and damage control in spine trauma [^111UwdLn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Considering spinal cord injury, numerous research efforts have been undertaken, for which we kindly refer the reader to the literature and reviews. A consensus has been established that a mechanical impact to the spinal cord initiates and sustains secondary injury events, exacerbating the spinal cord injury, as is also evident in traumatic brain injury. As a result, spinal cord decompression must be performed even in the polytraumatized patient as quickly as possible, since decompression between 24 and 72 hours is too late to prevent substantial neurological deficits.

Following the primary survey and detection of symptoms resembling a traumatic injury to the myelon and in higher-rated spinal fractures with substantial spinal canal compression, for example, from a posterior wall fragment, the extent of the operative approach must be planned individually. This planning should consider the severity of the neurological deficit, spinal fracture pattern, and additional injuries, with a special focus on the immunological status concerning the potential for SIRS and CARS. Due to the vast array of injury combinations, no guidelines can be established for structured management of these patients. Excessive research efforts regarding pharmacological treatment options for neurological deficits have not shown success in clinical settings. Additionally, research efforts, reviews, and study analyses could not confirm the results of the NASCIS-II and NASCIS-III studies.

### Management of acute central cervical spinal cord injuries [^1125MgGz]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

There is insufficient evidence to support treatment standards for acute central cervical spinal cord injuries. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to support treatment guidelines.

- **Options**: Intensive care unit (or other monitored setting) management is recommended, especially for patients with severe neurological deficits. Medical management should include cardiac, hemodynamic, and respiratory monitoring. The maintenance of mean arterial blood pressure at 85 to 90 mmHg for the first week after injury to improve spinal cord perfusion is advised. An early reduction of fracture-dislocation injuries is recommended, as is surgical decompression of the compressed spinal cord, particularly when the compression is focal and anterior.

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: Enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^112gw8P9]. Spine (2022). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common form of spinal cord impairment in adults. DCM is an important, disabling, and unfortunately frequently overlooked condition, which is estimated to affect as many as one in 50 adults. Despite the prevalence of DCM, awareness of this condition among members of the public and even among physicians is lacking. Thus, many patients do not receive a timely diagnosis, with wait times to the time of diagnosis ranging on average from two to five years. Given the frequent delays in diagnosis and treatment, many will be left with lifelong disabilities despite appropriate surgical intervention.

AO Spine RECODE DCM (REsearch Objectives and Common Data Elements for Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy) was formed as an international, interdisciplinary, and interprofessional initiative, including patients with DCM. One of the research priorities is the development of comprehensive diagnostic criteria for DCM to facilitate early diagnosis and timely management. This requires standardized clinical evaluation metrics based on objective and reproducible signs and symptoms, coupled with advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches with standardized evaluation methods. This is pertinent to DCM as MRI findings, such as cord compression, are often incidental and only weakly correlate with disease severity. To stimulate research and awareness, we discuss a proposed diagnostic framework to advance the role of imaging in the diagnosis of DCM.

### Extent of spinal cord decompression in motor complete (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grades A and B) traumatic spinal cord injury patients: Post-operative magnetic resonance imaging analysis of standard operative approaches [^116GjNap]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Low credibility.

Decompressive surgery was performed a mean of 21.5 ± 20.8 hours (median 14; range 4.0–136.8 hours) following trauma by one of 14 board-certified neurosurgeons (with five being spine-fellowship trained). When appropriate, certain patients underwent attempted closed reduction by cervical traction prior to operative intervention. Whether or not reduction was achieved, all pre-operative candidates had evidence of spinal cord compression as indicated by deformation and effacement of SAS at the injury epicenter and either rostrally or caudally to it. The objective of surgery was anatomical alignment and internal fixation (anterior, posterior, or a combination of anterior and posterior) of the subaxial cervical spine and decompression of the spinal cord. There was no policy or guidelines for surgical procedures: each neurosurgeon applied his preferred surgical techniques to obtain decompression and the most secure internal fixation.

The five common operative techniques chosen by surgeons were:

1. ACDF (one to three skeletal segments),
2. ACCF (one or two skeletal segments),
3. ACDF in association with laminectomy (one to five levels) with or without posterior spinal fusion,
4. ACCF and laminectomy (one to five levels),
5. Laminectomy (two to five levels) with or without posterior spinal fusion.

The surgical techniques used by the 14 neurosurgeons were compatible with the recommended surgical approaches reported previously by Vaccaro and colleagues and Dvorak and colleagues.

### Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging reveals tract-specific microstructural correlates of electrophysiological impairments in non-myelopathic and myelopathic spinal cord compression [^116qmAyR]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Non‐myelopathic degenerative cervical spinal cord compression (NMDC) frequently occurs throughout aging and may progress to potentially irreversible degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). Whereas standard clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electrophysiological measures assess compression severity and neurological dysfunction, respectively, underlying microstructural deficits still have to be established in NMDC and DCM patients. The study aims to establish tract‐specific diffusion MRI markers of electrophysiological deficits to predict the progression of asymptomatic NMDC to symptomatic DCM.

High‐resolution 3 T diffusion MRI was acquired for 103 NMDC and 21 DCM patients compared to 60 healthy controls to reveal diffusion alterations and relationships between tract‐specific diffusion metrics and corresponding electrophysiological measures and compression severity. The relationship between the degree of DCM disability, assessed by the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale, and tract‐specific microstructural changes in DCM patients was also explored.

The study identified diffusion‐derived abnormalities in the gray matter, and dorsal and lateral tracts congruent with trans‐synaptic degeneration and demyelination in chronic degenerative spinal cord compression, with more profound alterations in DCM than NMDC. Diffusion metrics were affected in the C3‐6 area as well as above the compression level at C3, with more profound rostral deficits in DCM than NMDC. Alterations in lateral motor and dorsal sensory tracts were noted.

### Optimal management of malignant epidural spinal cord compression [^117LBPPB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Malignant epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) is a common neurologic complication of cancer. MESCC is a medical emergency that requires rapid diagnosis and treatment to prevent paraplegia. Patients with malignancy who present with new onset of neurologic signs and symptoms should undergo emergent evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging of the entire spine. If MESCC is diagnosed, corticosteroids should be administered. Simultaneously, spine surgery and oncology teams should be immediately consulted. If indicated, patients should undergo maximal tumor resection and stabilization followed by postoperative radiotherapy. Emerging treatment options such as stereotactic radiosurgery and vertebroplasty may provide symptomatic relief for patients who are not surgical candidates.

### Focal compression of the cervical spinal cord alone does not indicate high risk of neurological deterioration in patients with a diagnosis of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy [^115Uz8Ea]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). High credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the functional derangement of the spinal cord resulting from vertebral column spondylotic degeneration. Typical neurological symptoms of DCM include gait imbalance, hand/arm numbness, and upper extremity dexterity loss. Greater spinal cord compression is believed to lead to a higher rate of neurological deterioration, although clinical experience suggests a more complex mechanism involving spinal canal diameter (SCD).

In this study, we utilized machine learning clustering to understand the relationship between SCD and different patterns of cord compression (i.e. compression at one disc level, two disc levels, etc) to identify patient groups at risk of neurological deterioration. A total of 124 MRI scans from 51 non-operative DCM patients were assessed through manual scoring of cord compression and SCD measurements. Dimensionality reduction techniques and k-means clustering established patient groups that were then defined with their unique risk criteria.

- **Spinal canal diameter extremes**: We found that the compression pattern is unimportant at SCD extremes (≤ 14.5 mm or > 15.75 mm). Otherwise, severe spinal cord compression at two disc levels increases deterioration likelihood.

- **Normal SCD assessment**: Notably, if SCD is normal and cord compression is not severe at multiple levels, deterioration likelihood is relatively reduced, even if the spinal cord is experiencing compression.

We elucidated five patient groups with their associated risks of deterioration, according to both SCD range and cord compression pattern. Overall, SCD and focal cord compression alone do not reliably predict an increased risk of neurological deterioration.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of spinal cord trauma: A pictorial essay [^1146yWew]. Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Assessing a patient with clinical signs of acute spinal cord trauma is an emergency. A radiological work-up is crucial in determining management, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice. It should therefore be performed immediately, preferably within 3 hours, even when plain radiography does not show an abnormality. By choosing an appropriate imaging protocol, it is possible to assess the spinal cord, joints, muscles, ligaments, and bone marrow of the spine. Moreover, early MRI findings assist in determining functional prognosis. A major limitation to early MRI is that the examination is usually restricted to stable trauma patients because of the difficulties in monitoring ventilated patients during scanning. However, when an anesthesiologist with experience in MRI and MR-compatible monitoring equipment is available, even these patients can be safely examined. MRI is also indicated for the evaluation of patients with late complications and sequelae following spinal cord trauma, since many of these chronic lesions are potentially treatable.

### Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging reveals tract-specific microstructural correlates of electrophysiological impairments in non-myelopathic and myelopathic spinal cord compression [^1133B3Nj]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Our findings also demonstrate malicious effects of the compression on microstructural CSC integrity above the compression level at the C3 level. Deficits at C3 in NMDC were limited to the spinal lemniscus and were depicted solely using the ball-and-sticks f1 metric, pointing to incipient remote degeneration in NMDC patients in the early stages of degenerative CSC compression. As the compression progressed to DCM, additional f1, FA, and RD alterations in dorsal and lateral columns occurred. The ball-and-sticks f1 demonstrated higher discrimination when showing changes in the spinal lemniscus that were not detected using the DTI model.

Significantly lower f1 and FA above the compression level in DCM patients compared to HC point to progressive anterograde and retrograde axonal degeneration of dorsal sensory pathways such as fasciculus gracilis, cuneatus, and spinal lemniscus, as well as lateral motor corticospinal tracts, respectively. Alterations of FA at the C3 level are in agreement with a recent study from Seif et al, which demonstrated a remote FA decrease in the lateral corticospinal and spinothalamic tracts at the C2/3 level in DCM patients and patients with traumatic spinal cord injury compared to HC. Changes in GM along with spinal cord CSA reduction above the compression level in DCM patients compared to NMDC patients and HC point to trans-synaptic degeneration and GM atrophy above the stenosis level in patients with myelopathy.

Direct comparison between symptomatic DCM and NMDC patients demonstrated more severe deficits in DCM patients in the dorsal and lateral columns.

### Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging reveals tract-specific microstructural correlates of electrophysiological impairments in non-myelopathic and myelopathic spinal cord compression [^1136ZJxc]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

High-resolution multi-shell diffusion and anatomical sequences were combined with state-of-the-art postprocessing to achieve selective tract-specific CSC analyses. The capability of the microstructural dMRI metrics to reliably reflect histopathological studies, which previously demonstrated tract-specific distinctions in CSC integrity in degenerative compression, was also investigated.

Thus, tract-specific alterations in degenerative spinal cord compression at the compression level and also above the compression were hypothesized, with more severe deficits in DCM patients than NMDC patients. Relationships between tract-specific dMRI metrics and corresponding electrophysiology and compression severity, previously confirmed as risk factors of DCM development, were further hypothesized. The relationship between the degree of DCM disability assessed by the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scale and tract-specific diffusion-informed microstructure was also explored.

### Spinal cord avulsion in the pediatric population: Case study and review [^115kmcPG]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) is a rare phenomenon. However, with advances in imaging and improvements in magnetic resonance imaging, more cases are being identified. Even more uncommon is the finding of spinal cord avulsion as a type of SCIWORA, with only single case reports available in the literature. We present the case reports of two patients, both experiencing spinal cord avulsion as a type of SCIWORA secondary to improper lap-belt restraint during a motor vehicle accident.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^116F8ccs]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Spinal cord compression results in progressive neurological decline and affects quality of life. Left untreated, it can lead to tetraplegia and wheelchair dependence (data on how many patients with DCM progress in this way are unavailable). Surgical decompression can halt the disease progression; however, the regenerative capacity of the spinal cord is limited, and any damage is often permanent. Delayed treatment leads to poorer outcomes and lifelong disability. Findings from the AOSpine series (746 patients with DCM) indicate that treatment within six months of symptoms offers the best chance of recovery, but this time frame is some way from average diagnosis times.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^112DSQ43]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Low credibility.

In accordance with recommendations of the GRADE network, these statements were considered by the panel to be actionable, supported by indirect evidence where appropriate, and essential to guide the practice of neuroprognostication. The good clinical practices reflected in these statements lacked a meaningful body of direct supporting evidence — typically because of insufficient clinical equipoise — but were considered by the panel to be unequivocally beneficial.

- **Good practice statement #1**: We recommend that prognostication should be performed with consideration of the complete clinical condition and never based on a single variable (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded).

	*Rationale*: Neuroprognostication in traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) is complicated by heterogeneity in injury patterns, management strategies, and study methodology. Clinicians must therefore use caution when formulating a prognosis with the predictors addressed in these guidelines. Additionally, the overall body of literature on tSCI outcomes is of poor quality. Most studies perform retrospective analysis of registry databases that, even with prospective enrollment, may exclude important variables. Studies based on retrospective chart review have additional limitations, especially for the determination of outcomes. Given these limitations, prognostication can be improved through consideration of multiple predictors. Decisions should always be made with attention to individual patient characteristics, as well as preferences and values.

### Posterior approaches for symptomatic metastatic spinal cord compression [^111M5pw4]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

Surgical interventions for spinal metastasis are commonly performed for mechanical stabilization, pain relief, preservation of neurological function, and local tumor reduction. Although multiple surgical approaches can be used for the treatment of metastatic spinal lesions, posterior approaches are commonly performed. In this study, the role of posterior surgical procedures in the treatment of spinal metastases was reviewed, including posterior laminectomy with and without instrumentation for stabilization, transpedicular corpectomy, and costotransversectomy.

A review of the literature from 1980 to 2015 was performed using Medline, as well as a review of the bibliographies of articles meeting preset inclusion criteria, to identify studies on the role of these posterior approaches among adults with spinal metastasis. Thirty-four articles were ultimately analyzed, including 1 randomized controlled trial, 6 prospective cohort studies, and 27 retrospective case reports and/or series. Some of the reviewed articles had Level II evidence indicating that laminectomy with stabilization can be recommended for improvement in neurological outcome and reduction of pain in selected patients. However, the use of laminectomy alone should be carefully considered.

Additionally, transpedicular corpectomy and costotransversectomy can be recommended with the expectation of improving neurological outcomes and reducing pain in properly selected patients with spinal metastases. With improvements in the treatment paradigms for patients with spinal metastasis, as well as survival, surgical therapy will continue to evolve and play a crucial role in patient care.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® myelopathy: 2021 update [^115GSq1p]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Myelopathy is a clinical diagnosis characterized by the localization of neurological findings to the spinal cord, rather than the brain or the peripheral nervous system, and then to a specific segment of the spinal cord. It can result from primary intrinsic disorders of the spinal cord or secondary conditions that cause extrinsic compression of the spinal cord. While the causes of myelopathy are varied, the acuity of presentation and symptom onset guide a practical approach to differential diagnosis. Imaging is crucial in evaluating myelopathy, with MRI being the preferred modality.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Guideline development and revision include extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. When evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Extent of spinal cord decompression in motor complete (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale Grades A and B) traumatic spinal cord injury patients: Post-operative magnetic resonance imaging analysis of standard operative approaches [^116ytNL7]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Low credibility.

Investigators have shown that continued spinal cord compression (SCC) following experimental or traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) negatively affects neurological outcome, including motor and overall functional status. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) myelogram remain the standards for demonstrating SCC. In the most recent studies of the timing of operative intervention in TSCI, candidates for decompressive surgery were selected based on SCC as revealed primarily by T2 weighted image (T2WI) or short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences on MRI. Decompressive surgery was carried out in those patients with MRI evidence of continued SCC before or after successful closed reduction in the studies of Vale and colleagues, Papadopoulos and colleagues, and Fehlings and colleagues; Vaccaro and colleagues also performed randomization after the demonstration of SCC by MRI.

Nevertheless, although the role of decompression following TSCI is widely acknowledged, we argue that research into the surgical management of TSCI and its long-term outcome is potentially confounded by the lack of post-operative confirmation of actual decompression following operative intervention. Without such studies, the exact definition of "decompression" remains uncertain, and as a result, the most effective techniques for achieving it remain unclear.

In a 2007 evidence-based systematic review of traumatic subaxial cervical spine injuries, Dvorak and colleagues developed an algorithm recommending a stand-alone anterior approach for most compression, burst, and distract…

### Efficacy of ultra-early (< 12 h), early (12–24 h), and late (> 24–138.5 h) surgery with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed decompression in American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grades A, B, and C cervical spinal cord injury [^112vGcnM]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of cervical traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) is complex, and there remains no effective treatment for this high-impact disorder. In cervical TSCI, there is disruption of the anatomic integrity of the vertebral column, followed by endothelial, neuronal, and axonal damage within fractions of a second of the injury. Continued compression of the spinal cord during the ensuing hours culminates in ischemia, swelling, and hemorrhagic progression of a compressive contusion. In this scenario, a deleterious cycle of events ensues, in which molecular cascades instigate the upregulation of cationic channels that promote secondary injury and edema, visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 10 min, ultimately leading to further compression of the injured spinal cord. The swollen spinal cord becomes compressed circumferentially and longitudinally against the dura mater and rigid bone at the injury epicenter and beyond, resulting in the displacement of cerebrospinal fluid and the effacement of the subarachnoid space across multiple vertebral segments.

Compression of the spinal cord against an unyielding spinal canal results in increased intraspinal pressure and reduced perfusion pressure, further jeopardizing blood flow to the spinal cord. In motor complete TSCI patients, swelling of the spinal cord spreads rostrally and caudally from the injury epicenter in fusiform fashion, at a rate of approximately 900 μm/h. Frequently, by the time the victim is transferred to the trauma center, the intramedullary lesion length (IMLL) can measure between 40 and 100 m.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for cervical spine injury, specifically with respect to cervical spine immobilization, the WMS 2024 guidelines recommend restoring and maintaining neutral alignment using nonrigid tools during extrication. This should be done unless such a maneuver results in resistance, increased pain, or a new or worsening neurologic deficit. Prefer the jaw thrust over the head tilt/chin lift for establishing an airway in potential spinal cord injury cases.

### What has been learned from magnetic resonance imaging examination of the injured human spinal cord: A Canadian perspective [^114ZuHh6]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has transformed the way surgeons and researchers study and treat spinal cord injury. In this narrative review, we explore the historical context of imaging the human spinal cord and describe how MRI has evolved from providing the first visualization of the human spinal cord in the 1980s to a remarkable set of imaging tools today. The article focuses in particular on the role of Canadian researchers in this field. We begin by outlining the clinical context of traumatic injury to the human spinal cord and describe why MRI standards fall short when it comes to treating this disabling condition.

Parts 2 and 3 of this work explore an exciting and dramatic shift in the use of MRI technology to aid in our understanding and treatment of traumatic injury to the spinal cord. We explore the use of functional imaging (part 2) and structural imaging (part 3) and examine how these techniques have evolved, how they are used, and the challenges we face for continued refinement and application to patients who live with the neurological and functional deficits caused by injury to the delicate spinal cord.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of acute intramedullary myelopathy: Radiological differential diagnosis for the on-call radiologist [^115mRaQR]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Spinal cord disease is often viewed as having a poor outcome. Although in certain conditions this is true, non-traumatic myelopathy encompasses a vast array of diseases, some of which are exquisitely responsive to treatment. Accurate diagnosis becomes important as damage is often progressive, and long-term disability and morbidity are related to the degree of neurological impairment when the diagnosis is reached. Out-of-hours magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally requested and performed to ascertain whether there is spinal cord compression; however, there are other causes of a cord syndrome, which are more subtle. This review aims to provide a summary of the imaging features of non-traumatic intramedullary spinal cord emergencies, many of which may appear radiologically similar.

### Clinical applicability of magnetic resonance imaging in acute spinal cord trauma [^115Wmi8s]. European Spine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with acute spinal cord trauma (SCT) according to the type, extension, and severity of injury, as well as the clinical-radiological correlation.

- **Methods**: Diagnostic imaging, including computed tomography (CT) and MRI, was analyzed for 98 patients with acute SCT to assess clinical diagnostic value. The radiological findings investigated included vertebral compression fractures, bursts and dislocations, posterior element fractures, C1 and C2 lesions, vertebral listhesis, bone swelling, spinal canal compression, disk herniation, extradural hematoma, spinal cord contusions, spinal cord swelling, and posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) injuries.

- **Results**: The radiological findings were better visualized using MRI, except for the posterior elements, which were better identified with CT (p = 0.001). A total of 271 lesions were diagnosed: 217 using MRI, 154 using CT, and 100 (36.9%) using both MRI and CT. MRI detected 117 more lesions than CT.

- **Conclusion**: MRI was significantly superior to CT in diagnosing bone swelling, PLC injury, disk herniation, spinal canal compression, spinal cord contusion, and swelling present in SCT. MRI detected a larger number of lesions than CT and is highly useful for diagnosing soft tissue and intrathecal injuries.

### Extent of spinal cord decompression in motor complete (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale Grades A and B) traumatic spinal cord injury patients: Post-operative magnetic resonance imaging analysis of standard operative approaches [^116MJf1U]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Low credibility.

According to the most currently accepted management algorithms for managing subaxial TSCI, the presence of SCC at the time of initial radiographic assessment factors into the decision of operative versus non-operative management. The choice of the operative technique itself, whether anterior, posterior, or a combination, and the rostral-caudal extent of intervention, has been guided primarily by the goal of correcting structural instability and misalignment. While our experience supports the evidence-based paradigm of Dvorak and colleagues, our research suggests that it may be necessary to supplement this algorithm to more adequately address the relationship between the chosen operative approach, the extent of spinal cord decompression, and the re-establishment of structural stability and alignment.

Nevertheless, as the preceding discussion shows, the time-dependent process of secondary spinal cord swelling has far-reaching consequences. Surgical strategies must anticipate this phenomenon while addressing the issue of alignment and stability. The most effective strategy must not only follow the evidence-based algorithm of Dvorak and colleagues but also assure complete spinal cord decompression. Regarding the role of MRI, we suggest that detecting SCC on admission studies should influence not only the decision to operate but also, in conjunction with admission neurologic status (i.e. AIS grade), the choice of a specific surgical strategy.

### Imaging outcomes of MRI after CT in pediatric spinal trauma: A single-center experience [^112KUwKD]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Low credibility.

Imaging plays an essential role in the diagnostic workup of suspected pediatric spinal trauma. The most suitable imaging method is still debated, considering factors such as the patient, injury, and local resources. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often performed after computed tomography (CT) in cases of neurological symptoms or suspected ligamentous disruption. However, it remains unclear whether MRI provides significant additional value after CT if spinal cord injury is not suspected, or if MRI could be used as the sole imaging modality in emergency departments. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic value of emergency MRI following CT in suspected spinal trauma in children and adolescents.

- **Methods**: The imaging data and medical records of patients 17 years of age and younger, who underwent emergency spinal CT and MRI over 8 years, were retrospectively reviewed. The primary study outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the two imaging modalities in detecting surgically treated spinal injuries.

- **Results**: The study population consisted of 100 patients. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated all 7 surgically treated injuries, although one injury was initially missed with CT. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed more injuries; however, none of the injuries visible on CT required surgical fixation. Magnetic resonance imaging was able to exclude unstable injuries in patients who had highly suspicious or unequivocal findings on CT.

### Extent of spinal cord decompression in motor complete (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale Grades A and B) traumatic spinal cord injury patients: Post-operative magnetic resonance imaging analysis of standard operative approaches [^114xdSUq]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Low credibility.

In this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, the primary outcome was complete spinal cord decompression on post-operative MRI studies. This was defined as a continuous column of CSF anterior and posterior to the spinal cord on T2WI or STIR sagittal imaging.

From January 2001 through December 2016, over a 16-year period, 1927 patients with blunt subaxial cervical TSCI were admitted to a level I trauma center. Of this number, 184 patients were screened, selected, and included in this study. Patients were aged 16 years or older, and based on the International Standards for Neurological and Functional Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI), they were classified as either AIS grade A or B. Good quality pre- and post-operative CT and MRI studies were available for all patients. The subjects underwent surgery for their injuries and were followed in the intensive or intermediate care unit until discharge to a rehabilitation center or death.

Excluded patients included those with AIS grades C and D or non-testable (NT; 832 patients), those with non-operative management of their subaxial cervical spine and spinal cord injuries (509 patients), and those with no or poor imaging studies (197 patients). Also excluded were patients with penetrating (gunshot wound or sharp object) SCI (68 patients).

### Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging reveals tract-specific microstructural correlates of electrophysiological impairments in non-myelopathic and myelopathic spinal cord compression [^115VMWK2]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Non-myelopathic degenerative cervical spinal cord compression (NMDC) frequently occurs throughout aging and may progress to potentially irreversible degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). Whereas standard clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electrophysiological measures assess compression severity and neurological dysfunction, respectively, underlying microstructural deficits still have to be established in NMDC and DCM patients. The study aims to establish tract-specific diffusion MRI markers of electrophysiological deficits to predict the progression of asymptomatic NMDC to symptomatic DCM.

- **Methods**: High-resolution 3 T diffusion MRI was acquired for 103 NMDC and 21 DCM patients, compared to 60 healthy controls, to reveal diffusion alterations and relationships between tract-specific diffusion metrics, corresponding electrophysiological measures, and compression severity. The relationship between the degree of DCM disability, assessed by the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale, and tract-specific microstructural changes in DCM patients was also explored.

- **Results**: The study identified diffusion-derived abnormalities in the gray matter, dorsal and lateral tracts congruent with trans-synaptic degeneration and demyelination in chronic degenerative spinal cord compression, with more profound alterations in DCM than NMDC. Diffusion metrics were affected in the C3–6 area as well as above the compression level at C3, with more profound rostral deficits in DCM than NMDC. Alterations in lateral motor and dorsal sensory tracts correlated with…

### Early magnetic resonance imaging in spinal cord injury without radiological abnormality in adults: A retrospective study [^112Mr2jG]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and imaging characteristics of patients experiencing blunt spinal trauma without radiological abnormalities but with transient or persistent neurological deficits.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study analyzed plain radiographs, computed tomographic scans, and magnetic resonance images of patients with spinal cord injury without radiological abnormality (SCIWORA) who were admitted to a Level I trauma center. Neurologic status, Frankel grade, and short-term patient outcomes were assessed.

- **Results**: Of 1,604 patients experiencing blunt spinal trauma, 21 (12 men and 9 women) with a mean age of 35.5 years (range, 16.2–70.9 years) presented with a clinicoradiographic mismatch. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was available in 15 patients. In seven patients (46.6%), MRI revealed either neural (n = 2, 13.3%) or extraneural (n = 5, 33.3%) spinal abnormalities. Importantly, in eight patients (53.3%), no spinal abnormalities were visible on MRI. Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed no prognostic value regarding the presence or absence of detectable spinal injuries.

- **Conclusion**: Spinal abnormalities were not detected on MRI in a substantial proportion of patients presenting with SCIWORA. The prognostic value of MRI findings in SCIWORA needs to be validated by future studies.

- **Level of evidence**: Epidemiological study, level V.

### Efficacy of ultra-early (< 12 h), early (12–24 h), and late (> 24–138.5 h) surgery with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed decompression in American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grades A, B, and C cervical spinal cord injury [^116P3VrZ]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.

- **Cohort**: Over a 13-year period, from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2017, 950 MRI-proven isolated cervical TSCI patients were admitted to this level I trauma center for management. From this cohort, we screened and selected 72 patients who were eligible for this investigation. The inclusion criteria were being ≥ 16 years of age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score ≥ 14, no coexisting life-threatening injury or disease, imaging studies compatible with subaxial cervical spine fracture dislocations, available good quality pre- and post-operative computed tomography (CT) and MRI studies indicating complete spinal cord decompression following surgery, and follow-up of at least 6 months after trauma and surgical management. The exclusion criteria included being obtunded, stuporous, and non-testable, having penetrating subaxial TSCI, having upper cervical SCI, a post-operative MRI indicating inadequate spinal cord decompression, non-operative management, having had a cervical CT myelogram and not an MRI as the primary imaging study, dying or being lost to follow-up, or having poor-quality imaging studies. This study was performed after approval from the institutional review board (IRB) of the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO).

### Intramedullary lesion expansion on magnetic resonance imaging in patients with motor complete cervical spinal cord injury [^111R5fxX]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2012). Low credibility.

The authors performed a study to determine if lesion expansion occurs in humans during the early hours after spinal cord injury (SCI), as has been established in rodent models of SCI, and to identify factors that might predict lesion expansion.

- **Methods**: The authors studied 42 patients with acute cervical SCI and admission American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale Grades A (35 patients) and B (7 patients) in whom 2 consecutive MRI scans were obtained 3–134 hours after trauma. They recorded demographic data, clinical information, Injury Severity Score (ISS), admission MRI-documented spinal canal and cord characteristics, and management strategies.

- **Results**: The characteristics of the cohort were as follows: male/female ratio 37:5; mean age, 34.6 years; and cause of injury, motor vehicle collision, falls, and sports injuries in 40 of 42 cases. The first MRI study was performed 6.8 ± 2.7 hours (mean ± SD) after injury, and the second was performed 54.5 ± 32.3 hours after injury. The rostrocaudal intramedullary length of the lesion on the first MRI scan was 59.2 ± 16.1 mm, whereas its length on the second was 88.5 ± 31.9 mm. The principal factors associated with lesion length on the first MRI study were the time between injury and imaging (p = 0.05) and the time to decompression (p = 0.03). The lesion's rate of rostrocaudal intramedullary expansion in the interval between the first and second MRI was 0.9 ± 0.8 mm/hour. The principal factors associated with the rate of expansion were the maximum spinal cord compression (p = 0.03) and the mechanism of injury.

### Geomapping of traumatic spinal cord injury in Canada and factors related to triage pattern [^1174A39H]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2017). Low credibility.

At the onset of traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI), patients are at significant risk of neurological deterioration resulting from secondary injury to the spinal cord. Prompt recognition of tSCI, appropriate triage, and timely access to specialized care are critical. Evidence-based guidelines developed by expert consensus recommend early transport of patients sustaining an acute tSCI to an SCI-specialized center and early surgical treatment within 24 hours of injury to achieve optimal outcomes. However, despite these guidelines and the growing evidence supporting the benefits of expeditious transfer to an SCI center, research indicates that more than half of patients with tSCI experience delayed admission to SCI centers and receive surgery more than 24 hours post-injury.

Recent efforts aim to understand the barriers to achieving optimal care delivery by delineating the processes of the clinical journey from the point of injury to the commencement of specialized care and identifying potential correctable delays. The processes measured in these studies included pre-hospital time, time spent in an intermediate non-specialized center, time from injury to a specialized center, time to assessment by a spine surgeon, time to decision regarding surgical management, and time to surgery. Results from these studies revealed that patients who were sent indirectly to the specialized center spent an average of 9 to 33 hours in the intermediate center, and received surgery 14 hours later than those who were admitted directly to the specialized center. These findings suggest that direct admission to the specialized center may improve surgical timing and outcomes.

### Best practice care for persistent pain in adults with spinal cord injuries: A systematic review and narrative synthesis of clinical practice guideline recommendations [^116DMwxe]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2023). High credibility.

To review clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and recent literature, the study aimed to identify common recommendations guiding "best practice" pain care for adults with spinal cord injury (SCI).

The methodology involved searching four scientific databases and four guideline repositories from January 2010 to February 2022 for CPGs relating to the management of pain following SCI. Guidelines that related to a single treatment modality, complementary medicines, specific disease processes, and those not freely available were excluded.

The results showed 1373 records were identified, with 11 meeting all eligibility criteria. Seven were classified as "tier 1", used to generate 46 care components related to neuropathic pain management. These were organized into three themes: screening and assessment, principles of evaluation and management, and management recommendations; and seven subthemes: screening, assessment and diagnosis, addressing complex care needs, ongoing evaluation, management - interventional, management - pharmacological, and management - non-pharmacological. Four CPGs were classified as "tier 2" and were used to provide supporting evidence. Twelve recommendations related to the management of nociceptive pain were identified.

This synthesis of recommendations can guide consumers, clinicians, researchers, and policymakers, informing understanding and clinical implementation of evidence-based "best practice" management of pain in adults with SCI. Persistent pain is a frequent problem for individuals following spinal cord injury, and its effects are significant.

### Extent of spinal cord decompression in motor complete (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale Grades A and B) traumatic spinal cord injury patients: Post-operative magnetic resonance imaging analysis of standard operative approaches [^114okUEu]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Low credibility.

The importance of timely and complete decompression of the contused and compressed spinal cord is gaining wider recognition among neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons as evidence increasingly supports its role as a neuroprotective surgical strategy. Nevertheless, the definition of "decompression" still remains heterogeneous, and decompression has not been established according to evidence-based guidelines. This study highlights the significance of laminectomy as a supplemental or stand-alone procedure for achieving complete spinal cord decompression.

### Acute traumatic myelopathy: Rethinking central cord syndrome [^1116w2Ne]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Low credibility.

Central cord syndrome (CCS) is an incomplete spinal cord injury that consists of both sensory and motor changes of the upper and lower extremities. CCS most commonly occurs after trauma to the cervical spine, leading to acute neurological changes. Despite being the most common incomplete spinal cord injury with the best outcomes, optimal treatment remains controversial. Although clinical practice has shifted from primarily conservative management to early surgical intervention, many questions remain unanswered, and treatment remains varied.

One of the most limiting aspects of CCS remains the diagnosis itself. CCS, by definition, is a syndrome with a very specific pattern of neurological deficits. In practice and in the literature, CCS has been used to describe a spectrum of neurological conditions and traumatic morphologies. Establishing clarity will allow for more accurate decision-making by clinicians involved in the care of these injuries. The authors emphasize that a more precise term for the clinical condition in question is acute traumatic myelopathy: an acute cervical cord injury in the setting of a stable spine with either congenital and/or degenerative stenosis.

### Implementation of a survey spine MR imaging protocol for cord compression in the emergency department: Experience at a level 1 trauma center [^111A4oCL]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2024). High credibility.

Imaging stewardship in the emergency department (ED) is vital in ensuring patients receive optimized care. While suspected cord compression (CC) is a frequent indication for total spine MR imaging in the ED, the incidence of CC is low. Recently, our level 1 trauma center introduced a survey spine MR imaging protocol to evaluate for suspected CC while reducing examination time to avoid imaging overutilization. This study aims to evaluate the time savings, frequency of ordering patterns of the survey, and the symptoms and outcomes of patients undergoing the survey.

- **Materials and methods**: This retrospective study examined patients who received a survey spine MR imaging in the ED at our institution between 2018 and 2022. All examinations were performed on a 1.5T GE Healthcare scanner using our institutional CC survey protocol, which includes sagittal T2WI and STIR sequences through the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. Examinations were read by a blinded, board-certified neuroradiologist.

- **Results**: A total of 2002 patients received a survey spine MR imaging protocol during the study period. Of these patients, 845 (42.2%, mean age 57 ± 19 years, 45% women) received survey spine MR imaging examinations for the suspicion of CC, and 120 patients (14.2% positivity rate) had radiographic CC. The survey spine MR imaging averaged 5 minutes and 50 seconds (79% faster than routine MR imaging). On multivariate analysis, trauma, back pain, lower extremity weakness, urinary or bowel incontinence, numbness, ataxia, and hyperreflexia were each independently associated.

### Who are the best candidates for decompressive surgery and spine stabilization in patients with metastatic spinal cord compression? A new scoring system [^1113t2iT]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

The indication for surgery was neurological deficit due to spinal cord compression. Patients underwent decompressive surgery. Local radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy were routinely performed after the wound healed, approximately 3 to 4 weeks post-surgery, if applicable. Postoperative function outcomes were also analyzed according to the scoring system. Neurological function was graded based on Frankel grades preoperatively and approximately 4 weeks postoperatively. Patients with Frankel D and E grades have the ability to walk.

- **Surgery and function analysis**: A 58-year-old man was unable to walk due to metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) resulting from lung cancer.
	- Preoperative X-ray displayed vertebral collapse at T12.
	- Preoperative MRI revealed spinal cord compression at T12.
	- Preoperative CT showed bone destruction at T12.
	- Following laminectomy at T11 and T12, pedicle screw fixation was conducted for spine stabilization.
	- Postoperative motor function improved from Frankel C to D 4 weeks after the operation. Unfortunately, he died postoperatively.

### An extended role for CT in the emergency diagnosis of malignant spinal cord compression [^1161E3em]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

To evaluate the usefulness of computed tomography (CT) for triaging between urgent transfer to a neurosurgical unit and delayed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the local hospital:

- **Materials and methods**: Radiologists blinded to the MRI findings scored CT images from 1–5 using a novel grading system based on the degree of cord compression observed in 44 patients. Seventy separate levels were scored. The observers' CT scores were compared with MRI findings. All scoring radiologists were specialist registrars at different stages of training.

- **Results**: Agreement between CT and MRI scores for metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) was high, with Cohen's weighted Kappa score of 0.70 (p < 0.001, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.75). CT has a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 92% for MSCC. Half of the false-positive and false-negative results came from a single junior radiologist who would not normally report CT or MRI studies unsupervised. The best CT-MRI agreement was from the most senior trainee radiologist.

- **Conclusions**: Spinal findings on routine staging whole-body CT, combined with clinical findings, are sufficient to determine which patients with MSCC can safely wait for MRI the next working day at the local hospital and those who need emergency transfer to a neurosurgical unit for MRI and possible surgical decompression.

### Traumatic cervical central cord syndrome due to intramedullary hemorrhage studied with MRI: Case presentation [^114WTCjj]. European Spine Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Cervical central cord syndrome is characterized by disproportionately greater motor impairment of the upper than the lower extremities, predominantly distal motor dysfunction, varying degrees of sensory abnormalities, and bladder dysfunction. Although the original description stated that intramedullary hemorrhage is a possible cause of traumatic cervical central cord syndrome, recent studies have not demonstrated its presence based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or pathological evidence. The authors describe and discuss a case of traumatic central cervical cord syndrome studied with MRI, which presented intramedullary hemorrhage. This supports hemorrhage as a possible cause of traumatic cervical central cord syndrome.

### A simplified algorithm for diagnosis of spinal cord lesions [^117W15EL]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Neuroimaging is indispensable for the evaluation of myelopathy, not only for localization but also for etiologic determination. MRI is the preferred examination for further characterization of the majority of these conditions, which include traumatic, inflammatory, infectious, compressive, and neoplastic conditions. This article provides an overview of a variety of pathologies that afflict the spinal cord in an easy-to-understand format. The review focuses on their respective imaging manifestations on MRI and differential diagnoses. Early diagnosis and treatment of myelopathy are critical in preventing or arresting neurological morbidity.

### Efficacy of early (≤ 24 hours), late (25–72 hours), and delayed (> 72 hours) surgery with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed decompression in American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grades C and D acute traumatic central cord syndrome caused by spinal stenosis [^111VV9bE]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Low credibility.

In 1951, the clinical syndrome of acute traumatic central cord syndrome (ATCCS) caused by spinal stenosis was recognized. At the time, investigators advocated against surgical decompression, favoring instead a natural recovery of function and avoidance of surgical complications. Over the ensuing two decades, non-surgical management dominated as the standard of care for these patients. Subsequently, surgeons increasingly adopted surgical decompression, and over time, surgery gradually emerged as the standard of care.

Numerous investigations of ATCCS, focusing on its epidemiology, pathophysiology, imaging characteristics, and optimal operative strategies, have advanced understanding of this condition. Nevertheless, questions remain regarding the best management, especially concerning surgical timing, operative technique, and the extent of spinal cord decompression. At present, one of the most pressing questions is the timing of surgical intervention for ATCCS.

### Neurovascular injuries of the spinal cord [^1169GNi1]. European Journal of Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Neurovascular spinal cord injuries are very prevalent; in a busy trauma center radiology practice, these injuries are commonly seen. Imaging neurovascular injuries has been greatly facilitated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The histopathological changes that occur with spinal cord trauma have been found to correlate well with what is seen on MRI examinations. The MRI findings in spinal cord trauma have also been found to be useful in determining patient prognosis.

Spinal cord infarcts due to arterial injury from trauma are relatively rare; however, imaging has shown that vertebral artery injuries are not an unusual occurrence. The specific findings associated with neurovascular injuries will be described, with an emphasis on the findings on MRI and MRA examinations. MRI and MRA techniques have become the procedures of choice for evaluating neurovascular injuries because of their proven accuracy and because they are non-invasive. Conventional angiography, however, remains quite useful for evaluating arterial injuries.

### Surgery with or without radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for malignant spinal cord compression: An updated meta-analysis [^1126qBzG]. Spine (2025). Low credibility.

This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis. The objective was to conduct a meta-analysis of studies comparing surgery with or without radiotherapy to radiotherapy alone for patients with malignant spinal cord compression, including a subgroup analysis of patients stratified by hematologic and solid malignancies.

Two previous meta-analyses indicated that surgery, with or without radiotherapy, was superior to radiotherapy alone in patients with malignant spinal cord compression. However, these analyses did not stratify results by tumor type, causing uncertainty in the optimal approach for patients with hematologic malignancies.

The research involved a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for relevant studies. The primary outcomes considered were the improvement in ambulatory status and survival at 12 months. For neurological outcomes, the analysis included studies on both locally advanced primary malignancies of the spine and metastatic tumors. For survival outcomes, the analysis was limited to studies on metastases.

The results encompassed 2536 patients from 18 studies, with surgery performed in 890 patients (35%). The pooled analysis demonstrated significant improvements in ambulatory status [odds ratio (OR): 2.65; 95% CI: 1.60–4.39] and survival at 12 months (OR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.10–2.52) for patients undergoing surgery with or without radiotherapy. Additionally, improvements were noted in ambulatory status (OR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.19–3.09).

### The importance of personally reviewing imaging for clinical correlation: A case of thoracic spinal stenosis masquerading as a motor neuron disease [^115Jin76]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). High credibility.

A 64-year-old man with a history of a previous motor vehicle collision and chronic back pain was referred to an outpatient spine clinic. He had a 3-year history of bilateral lower limb weakness and numbness that progressed to severe bilateral foot drop. He had previously been seen by another practitioner from a different hospital, who performed an electromyography that was interpreted as possible primary lateral sclerosis. His clinical picture was difficult to interpret, as it did not fit any of the disease patterns, such as a motor neuron disease, suggested by previous electromyography.

Repeated magnetic resonance imaging revealed multifactorial canal stenosis at L3-L4 and L4-L5, with foraminal stenosis. The ordering physician personally reviewed the magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine and noticed possible spinal canal stenosis in the lower thoracic region, which had not been noted by the radiologist. Consequently, a magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine was ordered for further evaluation.

This case is significant as it highlights a patient who, despite undergoing extensive workup, was misdiagnosed. It is important to recognize that thoracolumbar disc herniations can cause mixed upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron signs. This scenario underscores the importance of personally reviewing imaging and correlating it with the clinical presentation.

### The influence of initial spinal cord haematoma and cord compression on neurological grade improvement in acute traumatic spinal cord injury: A prospective observational study [^114wZoj5]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Low credibility.

The study followed a prospective observational cohort design linked with administrative data.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely performed after traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) to facilitate early, accurate diagnosis and optimize clinical management. While the prognosis from early MRI post-injury remains unclear, having this information available could guide early intervention. The aim of this study was to determine the association of spinal cord intramedullary haematoma and/or the extent of cord compression evident on initial spine MRI with neurological grade change after TSCI.

The study involved individuals with acute TSCI aged 16 years or older, with MRI reviews conducted. Neurological gradings, based on the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS), were compared to initial MRI findings. Various MRI parameters were evaluated to predict neurological improvement before discharge.

The study included 120 subjects, with 79% being male, and a mean (SD) age of 51.0 (17.7) years. Motor vehicle crashes (42.5%) and falls (40.0%) were the most common injury mechanisms. Intramedullary spinal cord haematoma was identified by MRI in 40.0% of patients and was associated with more severe neurologic injury (58.3% initially AIS A). Generalised linear regression indicated that higher maximum spinal cord compression (MSCC) was associated with a lower likelihood of neurological improvement from the initial assessment to follow up prior to rehabilitation discharge. Combined thoracic level injury, intramedullary haematoma, and MSCC greater than 25% resulted in almost 90% probability of the pre-discharge AIS grade A remaining unchanged from the admission assessment.

### A novel approach to quantitatively assess posttraumatic cervical spinal canal compromise and spinal cord compression: A multicenter responsiveness study [^111Abw92]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

The study design was a multicenter retrospective study. The objective was to examine whether posttraumatic cervical spinal canal compromise and spinal cord compression are responsive to changes in motor and sensory functions.

The maximum canal compromise (MCC) and maximum spinal cord compression (MSCC) were developed to quantitatively assess canal stenosis and spinal cord compression using computed tomographic (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the setting of acute spine trauma.

Methods involved the inclusion of 100 consecutive patients with acute spine trauma. Patients were classified into three groups: patients with acute spine trauma without spinal cord injury (group 1), patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (group 2), and patients with complete spinal cord injury (group 3). Three quantitative imaging parameters were studied: MCC using CT-based measurements, MCC using T1-MRI based measurements, and MSCC using T2-MRI based measurements.

Results showed 78 male patients and 22 female patients with ages ranging from 17 to 82 years (mean age = 45 years). In group 1, there were no significant differences regarding the mean MRI-MCC and MSCC among the spine levels. Although most spine levels were statistically comparable regarding the CT-MCC in patients of group 1, the C7 level significantly differed from the C3 level. Comparisons among all three patient groups showed significant differences regarding the mean MRI-MCC and MSCC, but no significant differences were observed in the mean CT-MCC between groups 1 and 2.

### International surveillance study in acute spinal cord injury confirms viability of multinational clinical trials [^115dVkM1]. BMC Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Traumatic spinal cord injury is a devastating neurological disorder associated with lifelong motor, sensory, and autonomic deficits. Damage to the spinal cord occurs via mechanical perturbation, known as primary injury, and a cascade of damaging pathophysiological events, known as secondary injury. Currently, no pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions are available to mitigate the extent of damage in the acutely injured spinal cord. Despite the lack of effective treatment options, considerable progress has been made toward reducing mortality and morbidity among patients with spinal cord injury.

This progress is chiefly attributable to advances in the acute and long-term care of spinal cord injury, including early spine surgery, such as decompression and stabilization, and blood pressure augmentation within the first week post-injury. Additional contributions include the introduction of antibiotics, the availability of specialized rehabilitation centers, rehabilitation practices such as gait training, and the prevention and treatment of secondary complications like infections and neuropathic pain.

### Approach and considerations regarding the patient with spinal injury [^115ALSj7]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

Spinal trauma often results in a complex interaction of injuries to the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. This combination of biomechanical and neurological considerations provides a unique challenge to those dealing with the spinally injured patient. Proper assessment of the injuries sustained by the patient remains the initial, yet key, step in determining appropriate management. The aim of the physical examination is not only to characterize the nature of the injury to the vertebral column but also to determine the extent of actual and potential damage to the neural elements. It is also concerned with detecting associated injuries of the brain, viscera, and limbs that can impact management and outcome, particularly of any neurological deficit.

Further information about the spinal column and spinal cord is derived from appropriate radiological assessment, which is evolving with the increasing sophistication of imaging modalities. In spinal injury, classification systems are particularly important as they simplify a diverse range of injury patterns into a usable and reproducible form that may be used to aid communication among clinicians, guide management for individual patients, and provide the basis for research consistency.

The medical management involves consideration of the impact of spinal injury, in particular cord injury, on aspects including resuscitation and anticoagulation, as well as the role of steroids. The definitive management of the spinal column injury may be operative or nonoperative. Factors influencing this decision are biomechanical (stabilization) considerations.

### Efficacy of early (≤ 24 hours), late (25–72 hours), and delayed (> 72 hours) surgery with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed decompression in American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale Grades C and D acute traumatic central cord syndrome caused by spinal stenosis [^116gdUgd]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Low credibility.

Patients were transferred to The R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) supine on a rigid backboard with the head and neck secured by a hard collar and chin strap. Upon arrival, primary and secondary examinations were performed by trauma surgeons. Once the patients were deemed medically stable following initial resuscitation, members of the neurosurgical team (senior resident or nurse practitioners) conducted a complete neurological assessment and then presented the case to the attending neurosurgeon. Admission AMS and AIS grades were determined according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI).

Preoperative multiplanar cervical spine CT was performed within 2–3 hours of trauma, and multi-sequence multiplanar T2-weighted and STIR sequences were acquired within 5–7 hours following trauma. We defined the morphometric measures of spinal stenosis, including the number of stenotic skeletal segments, the segmental level of maximum spinal cord compression, and the maximum canal compromise (MCC). Intramedullary lesion length was measured on sagittal T2 and/or STIR MRI. Sagittal and axial T2 and STIR MRI sequences were also used to determine the extent of spinal cord decompression following surgery. Post-operative MRI studies were performed within a median of 53 hours (mean 75 hours) from injury. Decompression was defined as the presence of a CSF interface between the spinal cord and dura (either ventral, dorsal, or both) continuous to the decompressed area.

### Treatment of metastatic spinal epidural disease: A review of the literature [^114RUipG]. Neurosurgical Focus (2003). Low credibility.

Spinal cord compression is one of the most dreaded complications of metastatic cancer. It can lead to various sequelae, including pain, spinal instability, neurological deficits, and a reduction in the patient's quality of life. Except in selected circumstances, treatment is palliative. Treatment options include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. The goal of this study was to summarize the existing data on the outcomes of various treatment methods for metastatic spinal epidural disease and to make appropriate recommendations for their use.

- **Methods**: The authors used a search strategy that included an electronic database search, a manual search of journals, analysis of bibliographies in relevant review papers, and consultation with the senior author. There is good evidence, including Class I data, that steroid drugs constitute a beneficial adjunctive therapy in patients with myelopathy from epidural compression. Historically, conventional radiation therapy has been viewed as the first-line treatment because it has been shown to be as effective as a decompressive laminectomy, with a lower incidence of complications (Class II data). Nevertheless, in the last 20 years, there has been remarkable progress in surgical techniques and technology. Currently, the goals of surgery are to achieve a circumferential decompression of the spinal cord and to reconstruct and immediately stabilize the spinal column. Results in a large body of literature support the belief that surgery is better at retaining or regaining neurological function than radiation and that surgery is highly effective.

### Recognizing spinal cord emergencies [^111ZgLHU]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Physicians working in primary care settings and emergency departments frequently evaluate patients with neck and back pain. Although spinal cord emergencies are uncommon, recognizing an injury early is crucial to quickly confirm the diagnosis and initiate treatment, potentially preventing permanent loss of function. The differential diagnosis includes spinal cord compression secondary to vertebral fracture or space-occupying lesion, spinal infection or abscess, vascular or hematologic damage, severe disc herniation, and spinal stenosis.

The most important information in assessing a possible spinal cord emergency comes from the history and clinical evaluation. Physicians must look for "red flags", which are key historical and clinical clues that increase the likelihood of a serious underlying disorder. In considering diagnostic tests, physicians should apply the principles outlined in an algorithm for the evaluation of low back pain prepared by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research). Although computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can clearly define anatomy, these studies are costly and have a high false-positive rate. Referral of high-risk patients to a neurologist or spine specialist may be indicated.

### Outcomes of follow-up imaging after pediatric spinal trauma confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging [^1171Yxo5]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Low credibility.

Information about the imaging studies, radiology reports, treatment, and patient outcomes was extracted from the radiology information system, picture archiving and communication system, and clinical medical records.

This study aimed to assess the diagnostic yield of follow-up imaging after MRI-confirmed pediatric spinal trauma. We examined the impact of follow-up imaging on treatment plans and the progression of the traumatic findings in the follow-up imaging. A particular focus was on two groups: (1) the patients with cervical spine trauma and flexion-extension (FE) follow-up imaging and (2) the patients with one or multiple thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures with height loss not exceeding 30% in any vertebral body in primary imaging.

The MRI findings strongly indicating instability were defined as follows: PLC or anterior tension band disruption, burst fractures, and disruption of the ligaments stabilizing the occipitocervical junction.

The results are expressed as the number of cases (n), percentages, means, and standard deviations. Ordinal variables were compared with the χ² test. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We performed the statistical analyses with IBM SPSS Statistics for Mac (version 28, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).

The hospital district board's permission for the study was obtained; however, the institutional review board's approval or written patient consent was not required for this retrospective study.

### MRI in traumatic spinal cord injury: from clinical assessment to neuroimaging biomarkers [^113jYykH]. The Lancet Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Traumatic spinal cord injury occurs when an external physical impact damages the spinal cord, leading to permanent neurological dysfunction and disability, and it is associated with a high socioeconomic burden. Conventional MRI plays a crucial role in the diagnostic workup as it reveals extrinsic compression of the spinal cord and disruption of the discoligamentous complex. Additionally, it can reveal macrostructural evidence of primary intramedullary damage such as haemorrhage, oedema, post-traumatic cystic cavities, and tissue bridges.

- **Quantitative MRI**: Techniques such as magnetisation transfer, magnetic resonance relaxation mapping, and diffusion imaging enable the tracking of secondary changes across the neuraxis at the microstructural level. Both conventional MRI and quantitative MRI metrics, obtained early after spinal cord injury, are predictive of clinical outcome. Neuroimaging biomarkers could thus serve as surrogate endpoints for more efficient future trials targeting acute and chronic spinal cord injury. The adoption of neuroimaging biomarkers in centers for spinal cord injury might lead to personalized patient care.

### Metastatic spinal cord compression [^1136f1UV]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 70% of cancer patients have metastatic disease at death, with the spine involved in up to 40% of those patients. Spinal cord compression may develop in 5% to 10% of cancer patients and up to 40% of patients with preexisting nonspinal bone metastasis, accounting for more than 25,000 cases annually. Given the increasing survival times of patients with cancer, greater numbers of patients are likely to develop this complication. The role of surgery in the management of metastatic spinal cord compression is expanding.

- **Treatment modalities**: The management of metastatic spine disease can consist of a combination of surgery, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy. These treatment modalities are not mutually exclusive and must be individualized for patients evaluated in a multidisciplinary setting.

### Can MRI findings predict the outcome of cervical spinal cord injury? A systematic review [^113yaUFc]. European Spine Journal (2020). Low credibility.

MRI is the established gold standard for imaging acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Our aim was to identify the prognostic value, in terms of neurological outcome, of extradural and intradural features detected on MRI performed acutely following traumatic cervical SCI.

- **Materials and methods**: Several databases were systematically searched to identify potentially eligible articles until December 2019. Using a standard PRISMA template, 2606 articles were initially identified.

- **Results**: A final 6 full-text articles met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. An extradural factor, namely the maximal spinal cord compression, was associated with poor neurological outcome and was statistically significant (P = 0.02 and P = 0.001 in 2 out of 3 studies). The intradural factors of length of the cord edema (P = 0.001, P = 0.006, and P < 0.001 in 3 studies), intramedullary hemorrhage (P = 0.002, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.002 in 4 studies), and the length of intramedullary hemorrhage (P = 0.028, P = 0.022 in 2 studies) also significantly correlated with poor neurological recovery at follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: While early MRI is established as a gold standard imaging of acute spinal trauma, it also serves to provide prognostic value on neurological recovery. From our systematic review, there is a strong association of the extradural finding of maximal spinal cord compression, intradural MRI findings of length of cord edema, intramedullary hemorrhage, and length of intramedullary hemorrhage with neurological recovery in traumatic cervical spinal cord injuries.

- **Level of evidence**: III.
