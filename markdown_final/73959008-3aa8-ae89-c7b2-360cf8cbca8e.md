## Question

Treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define moderate to severe UC and confirm diagnostic thresholds. Then, I should verify the overarching treatment goals and principles. Next, I will examine induction strategies, including corticosteroids, advanced therapies, and combination therapy. After that, I need to review maintenance options and de-escalation principles. I will then consider special populations and scenarios, including biologic-experienced patients, acute severe UC, and extraintestinal manifestations. Finally, I should integrate safety, monitoring, and shared decision-making, and close with a concise, practical algorithm that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the disease definition and severity thresholds, because treatment selection hinges on accurate staging. Moderate to severe UC is typically defined by moderate to severe symptoms with endoscopic subscore 2–3, or mild symptoms with high inflammatory burden or poor prognostic features, and includes patients with corticosteroid dependence or refractory disease; clinical remission is generally defined as Mayo Clinic score less than 3 with no subscore greater than 1, which anchors both induction and maintenance targets [^d851c106] [^19527f6a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about therapy before establishing goals. The overarching treatment objectives are to induce clinical and endoscopic remission, achieve corticosteroid-free maintenance, prevent hospitalization and colectomy, and restore quality of life; shared decision-making is emphasized given heterogeneity in patient values and the expanding therapeutic armamentarium, and I should confirm that these principles are consistently reflected across contemporary guidelines [^6aaafced] [^891ad428].

> Next, I should review induction strategies, starting with corticosteroids as bridge therapy. Systemic corticosteroids are recommended to induce remission in moderate to severely active UC, but they are not for maintenance; budesonide MMX may be considered for moderately active disease to reduce systemic exposure, though it is not appropriate for severely active disease, and I need to ensure I do not overstate its role in severe presentations [^6c97ebe8] [^72945cb4].

> I will now examine advanced therapies for induction, and I should double-check comparative efficacy signals. Multiple guidelines recommend infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, upadacitinib, ustekinumab, and S1P modulators such as ozanimod and etrasimod as options for induction, with network meta-analyses suggesting higher efficacy for some agents in biologic-naïve patients, notably infliximab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and JAK inhibitors, while acknowledging that head-to-head data remain limited and certainty varies [^13f2d73e] [^07d4ba93] [^d851c106].

> Wait, let me verify combination therapy recommendations, especially for TNF antagonists. The AGA suggests infliximab plus a thiopurine over monotherapy for induction and maintenance, supported by UC-SUCCESS showing improved corticosteroid-free remission at week 16 with combination therapy; this is a conditional recommendation with moderate certainty, and I should note that extrapolation to other TNF agents is less certain due to limited direct evidence [^e350e0a3] [^d7f9f988] [^15afa428].

> Let me consider the role of 5-ASA in moderate to severe disease, because I need to ensure I do not overextend its indication. 5-ASA is not indicated for moderate to severe UC, and guidelines suggest stopping 5-ASA once patients escalate to advanced therapies after remission is achieved; however, in patients with moderately active disease who decline advanced therapy, a cautious trial of high-dose oral plus rectal 5-ASA may be reasonable, recognizing lower likelihood of success and the need for timely escalation if ineffective [^7c3bac2a] [^194c66c5] [^72945cb4].

> Next, I should review maintenance therapy, and I must confirm that the induction agent generally dictates maintenance. Most effective induction agents are continued for maintenance, with evidence supporting continuation of infliximab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, and upadacitinib; thiopurine monotherapy may be considered for maintenance in selected patients in remission, but not for induction, and methotrexate monotherapy is not recommended for induction or maintenance in UC [^6aaafced] [^bb1c75e5] [^2ebbe5e3].

> I should double-check de-escalation principles, because overtreatment carries risks. In patients achieving corticosteroid-free remission on combination TNF plus immunomodulator, guidelines suggest withdrawing the TNF agent rather than the immunomodulator if de-escalation is desired, though evidence is limited; conversely, in those on combination therapy, stopping 5-ASA is reasonable once remission is sustained, and I need to ensure these nuances are communicated clearly [^8da69242] [^194c66c5].

> But wait, what if the patient is biologic-experienced or has primary nonresponse to TNF therapy. I should confirm that switching mechanism of action is preferred over cycling within TNF agents, and that therapeutic drug monitoring can guide optimization or switching in secondary loss of response; higher-efficacy options such as ustekinumab, tofacitinib, upadacitinib, or infliximab are favored in this setting, and vedolizumab is also reasonable, particularly for patients at higher infectious risk [^a50e75ee] [^c88a956a] [^52ef326e].

> I need to ensure I address acute severe UC separately, because inpatient management differs. For ASUC, intravenous methylprednisolone 40–60 mg daily is recommended; if there is no improvement within 3–5 days, rescue therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine is indicated, and early involvement of surgery is essential to mitigate colectomy risk; I should confirm that these recommendations align with AGA guidance and emphasize close monitoring and multidisciplinary coordination [^1c692d00] [^e03a136e].

> Let me reconsider extraintestinal manifestations and special populations, because mechanism-specific benefits matter. For patients with arthropathy or dermatologic EIMs, TNF antagonists or JAK inhibitors may offer dual benefit, whereas gut-selective vedolizumab may be less effective for EIMs; in older adults or those at higher infectious risk, vedolizumab or anti-IL-23 strategies may be preferred to minimize systemic immunosuppression, and I should confirm that these positioning statements are consistent with ACG and AGA guidance [^52ef326e] [^0e968984].

> Next, I should review safety, monitoring, and vaccination, and I need to check that I cover both class-specific and general risks. Before biologics or small molecules, screen for TB, hepatitis B, and consider TPMT for thiopurines; monitor CBC, liver enzymes, and creatinine periodically; for JAK inhibitors, assess VTE and cardiovascular risk and consider baseline ECG; vaccinate against influenza, pneumococcus, and shingles prior to immunosuppression when feasible, and counsel on infection risk mitigation throughout therapy [^1c4a3f45].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of biomarkers and treat-to-target endpoints, because this influences follow-up cadence. Fecal calprotectin and CRP can help rule in active inflammation and guide therapy adjustments, though they do not replace endoscopic assessment; endoscopic improvement or remission within 6–12 months is a key target, and symptomatic response should be assessed within 3 months of initiating advanced therapy to ensure timely optimization or switching if goals are not met [^705d7693] [^1c4a3f45].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I should confirm it aligns with guideline hierarchies. For moderate to severe UC, induce with systemic corticosteroids while planning a steroid-sparing advanced therapy; in biologic-naïve patients, consider infliximab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, or upadacitinib based on disease severity, speed of response needed, comorbidities, and patient preference, with a suggestion to favor infliximab or vedolizumab over adalimumab in many cases; consider combination therapy, particularly infliximab plus thiopurine, to improve efficacy; for maintenance, continue the effective induction agent; in biologic-experienced or TNF-nonresponsive patients, switch mechanism and consider higher-efficacy options; throughout, reassess at 3 months and pursue endoscopic targets by 6–12 months, adjusting therapy promptly if goals are unmet [^13f2d73e] [^e350e0a3] [^a50e75ee] [^1c4a3f45].

> Finally, I should confirm that shared decision-making and access considerations are explicit, because payer-imposed step therapy can delay effective care. Guidelines emphasize that patients should have access to all appropriate options and that step-therapy mandates should not interfere with clinician–patient decisions; this is especially critical in moderate to severe UC, where delays increase risks of colectomy and complications, and I need to ensure this principle is communicated clearly in the care plan [^52ef326e] [^0e968984].

For moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, **induce remission with systemic corticosteroids** [^6c97ebe8] and **escalate to advanced therapies** (anti-TNF, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, or JAK inhibitors) if steroids fail or are not tolerated [^aca7ebfa]. Infliximab is preferred for rapid control or severe disease [^52ef326e]; vedolizumab is favored for lower infection risk or EIMs [^52ef326e]. Combination therapy (biologic plus immunomodulator) improves efficacy but increases infection risk [^2e942d6f]; monitor closely and individualize [^1c4a3f45]. Maintain remission with the effective induction agent [^6aaafced], aiming for steroid-free remission and mucosal healing [^3bfdd616]; consider colectomy for refractory disease or complications [^72945cb4].

---

## Induction of remission

### Systemic corticosteroids

- **First-line**: Prednisone 40–60 mg/day until clinical remission, then taper over 8–12 weeks [^notfound].
- **Limitations**: Not for maintenance; high risk of dependency and adverse effects [^04d42b80].

---

### Advanced therapies (biologics and small molecules)

Use **advanced therapies** if steroids fail or are not tolerated [^aca7ebfa]:

| **Agent** | **Mechanism** | **Indication** | **Efficacy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Infliximab | Anti-TNF | Induction/maintenance | High; rapid onset [^47558c34] |
| Adalimumab | Anti-TNF | Induction/maintenance | Moderate [^47558c34] |
| Golimumab | Anti-TNF | Induction/maintenance | Moderate [^47558c34] |
| Vedolizumab | Anti-integrin | Induction/maintenance | Moderate; gut-selective [^fd355f08] |
| Ustekinumab | Anti-IL-12/23 | Induction/maintenance | Moderate [^fac369f6] |
| Tofacitinib | JAK inhibitor | Induction/maintenance | Moderate; oral [^b27d53fd] |
| Upadacitinib | JAK inhibitor | Induction/maintenance | Moderate; oral [^d9c176b9] |

---

### Combination therapy

Combination therapy pairs a **biologic with an immunomodulator** (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) to improve efficacy, especially with infliximab [^e350e0a3] [^15afa428]. Risks include higher infection rates and malignancy; monitor closely [^notfound].

---

## Maintenance of remission

- **Continue**: The effective induction agent [^6aaafced].
- **Goal**: Steroid-free remission with mucosal healing [^3bfdd616].
- **Options**: Anti-TNFs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, or JAK inhibitors [^13f2d73e].

---

## Special considerations

- **Acute severe UC**: IV corticosteroids; rescue with infliximab or cyclosporine if no improvement in 72 hours [^notfound].
- **Refractory disease**: Consider colectomy [^72945cb4].
- **Extraintestinal manifestations**: Tailor therapy to affected organs [^52ef326e].

---

## Monitoring and safety

- **Assess**: Response at 3 months; endoscopic improvement by 6–12 months [^1c4a3f45].
- **Monitor**: CBC, liver enzymes, renal function, and drug levels as indicated [^1c4a3f45].
- **Vaccinate**: Influenza, pneumococcus, hepatitis B, and HPV before immunosuppression [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Induction**: Systemic corticosteroids; escalate to advanced therapies if needed [^6c97ebe8] [^aca7ebfa].
- **Maintenance**: Continue effective induction agent; aim for steroid-free remission [^6aaafced].
- **Refractory**: Consider colectomy [^72945cb4].
- **Monitoring**: Regular clinical, biochemical, and endoscopic assessment [^1c4a3f45].

---

Treatment of moderate-to-severe UC requires a **stepwise approach**, with early escalation to advanced therapies to achieve and maintain steroid-free remission and mucosal healing [^d851c106].

### Quality of life in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and the impact of treatment: a narrative review [^8958b9d9]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

As a chronic inflammatory disease, ulcerative colitis has significant negative impact on the quality of life (QoL) of patients. Since the disease affects many aspects of QoL, comprising multiple domains, treatments that induce and maintain remission can provide benefits beyond hard clinical endpoints. Effective treatment of ulcerative colitis can restore QoL and return it to normal or near normal levels. Biological therapies have shown consistent improvement in the QoL of patients with ulcerative colitis during the induction phase, with benefits that are generally maintained in the long-term. Current medical treatment options broadly comprise aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, thiopurines, and calcineurin inhibitors, as well as biologic therapies. Conventional therapies do not always adequately control disease in a sizeable portion of patients, while anti-TNF antibodies are associated with several issues such as contraindications, intolerance, primary non-response, and loss of response in some patients. JAK inhibitors have been associated with clinical improvements in disease manifestations and long-term improvement in QoL outcomes. However, additional studies are needed to better understand the comparative effects of different treatments on QoL and patient preferences for therapy. Herein, the available evidence is reviewed regarding the impact of various treatments on QoL in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

### A review of available medical therapies to treat moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease [^2c4714ed]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The treatment armamentarium for inflammatory bowel disease has expanded rapidly in the past several years with new biologic and small molecule-agents approved for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. This has made treatment selection more challenging with limited but evolving guidance as to where to position each medication. In this review, we discuss the efficacy data for each agent approved in the United States by reviewing their phase 3 trial data and other comparative effectiveness studies. In addition, safety considerations and use in special populations are summarized with proposed algorithms for positioning therapies. The aim is to provide a synopsis of high-impact data and aid in outpatient treatment decision-making for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

### Positioning biologics and small molecules in the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^039f2760]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review addresses the selection of biologic and small molecule therapy for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). With several new treatment options approved within the past few years, an update in positioning is timely and relevant.

Recent Findings

Updates on the safety and comparative efficacy of approved therapeutic agents for UC are presented. Newly approved therapies including tofacitinib and ustekinumab, as well as where to position these treatments are discussed. Data on the first-ever head-to-head trial of biologic therapy in UC are examined. This review provides an evidence-based overview of the optimal management strategies of patients in both the inpatient and outpatient settings.

Summary

As we move closer towards the goal of personalized therapy for our patients with UC, we hope to better select appropriate and effective treatment options. Newly approved therapies provide us with additional options for management. Future advancements in predictive serologic, mucosal, genetic, and fecal markers can enable us to tailor therapy to an individual patient.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^891ad428]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Living Clinical Practice Guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis — future directions and updating plan note that "future selection of therapy may be based on predictive clinical and biomarker-based models", but "there is a paucity of data on how such models can inform treatment selection in the real-world setting", with "ongoing research efforts using multi-omic platforms using serum, stool, and tissue specimens" to develop predictive biomarkers. It emphasizes that "Shared decision making is an important process in selecting the management strategy for management of ulcerative colitis" and describes potential strategies including "combination advanced therapy or episodic use of nonimmunogenic advanced therapies, such as small molecules", while stating that "Further primary data are required to accurately inform the positioning of such strategies". For maintenance as a living guideline, it specifies that "the AGA will update relevant recommendations from these guidelines by periodic review of evidence every 6 months", and that the review "will include availability of phase 3 or phase 4 efficacy data for new treatments, treatment strategies, or existing treatments, as well as significant new safety concerns informing treatment positioning".

### AGA technical review on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^e03a136e]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

A subset of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) present with, or progress to, moderate to severe disease activity. These patients are at high risk for colectomy, hospitalization, corticosteroid dependence, and serious infections. The risk of life-threatening complications and emergency colectomy is particularly high among those patients hospitalized with acute severe ulcerative colitis. Optimal management of outpatients or inpatients with moderate to severe UC often requires the use of immunomodulator and/or biologic therapies, including thiopurines, methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, TNF-α antagonists, vedolizumab, tofacitnib, or ustekinumab, either as monotherapy or in combination (with immunomodulators), to mitigate these risks. Decisions about optimal drug therapy in moderate to severe UC are complex, with limited guidance on comparative efficacy and safety of different treatments, leading to considerable practice variability. Therefore, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized development of clinical guidelines on this topic. To inform the clinical guidelines, this technical review was completed in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Focused questions in adult outpatients with moderate to severe UC included: (1) overall and comparative efficacy of different medications for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with or without prior exposure to TNF-α antagonists, (2) comparative efficacy and safety of biologic monotherapy vs combination therapy with immunomodulators, (3) comparative efficacy of top-down (upfront use of biologics and/or immunomodulator therapy) vs step-up therapy (acceleration to biologic and/or immunomodulator therapy only after failure of 5-aminosalicylates, and (4) role of continuing vs stopping 5-aminosalicylates in patients being treated with immunomodulator and/or biologic therapy for moderate to severe UC. Focused questions in adults hospitalized with acute severe ulcerative colitis included: (5) overall and comparative efficacy of pharmacologic interventions for inpatients refractory to corticosteroids, in reducing risk of colectomy, (6) optimal dosing regimens for intravenous corticosteroids and infliximab in these patients, and (7) role of adjunctive antibiotics in the absence of confirmed infections.

### Use of biologics and small molecule drugs for the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: IG-IBD clinical guidelines based on the GRADE methodology [^e2d19bbe]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

The management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis has undergone significant changes over the past 15 years due to the regulatory approval of several new drugs. In particular, following the approval of the first biological, i.e. infliximab, a number of further biological drugs, such as adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab and ustekinumab, and small molecules, such as tofacitinib, have been approved, thus enriching the therapeutic armamentarium for ulcerative colitis. Choice of therapy must take into consideration not only the need to induce and maintain disease remission according to the patient's profile, but also age, co-morbidities, and prior treatments. To guide these decisions, the Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease has developed clinical guidelines that supersede its earlier document from 2011. These new guidelines were developed following the GRADE methodology for rating the quality of the evidence and for determining the strength of the recommendations. This article presents the methodology and results, in the form of 20 statements with commentary on the use of the five biologics and tofacitinib for managing the intestinal manifestations of active ulcerative colitis and for maintaining remission. A separate technical review reports the analyses of the evidence upon which the present recommendations are based.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^57cdadc8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — therapeutic management guidance: Therapeutic management in UC should be guided by the extent of bowel involvement, an assessment of disease activity and disease prognosis; patients with moderate-to-severely active UC or with high risk of hospitalization or colectomy should be treated with therapies that have evidence for efficacy based on clinical trials and real world studies. We recommend that prognosis should guide choice of therapy as much as activity of inflammation at the time of acute illness.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^6aaafced]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Guideline scope and outcomes — this guideline addresses adult outpatients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) and hospitalized adults with ASUC, focusing on "immunomodulators, biologics, and small molecules for induction and maintenance of remission", and notes that "in general, most drugs that are initiated for induction of remission are continued as maintenance therapy, if they are effective", which "is considered standard of care" with the assumption effective drugs "will be continued for maintenance of remission". It states "this guideline does not address surgical management of moderate to severe UC or ASUC", and for ASUC evidence profiles include "short-term colectomy risk (within 3 months of hospitalization)". Effect estimates "are presented as the risk for failure to induce or maintain remission, that is, a relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) < 1 suggests that the drug under consideration is more effective than the comparison drug or placebo for induction or maintenance of remission".

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^52ef326e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) — therapy positioning for moderately to severely active disease emphasizes access and selection principles: "There are no validated therapeutic biomarkers or companion diagnostic tests to enhance selection or predict response to treatment for the patient with active UC". Patients "should have available all medical options" and step-therapy requirements "should not come between the patient and their health care team" when making decisions. Patients with moderate to severe UC "have higher rates of response and remission with their first therapies than after failure of one or more other advanced therapies", and distinguishing between "primary nonresponse and secondary nonresponse is important" to select the next option. "Post hoc subgroup analyses and network meta-analyses provide hypothesis-generating data but are not sufficient to stratify therapies for individual patients". "Infliximab is the preferred anti-TNF therapy for patients with moderately to severely active UC". For those at higher infectious risk, some "may benefit from vedolizumab or an anti-IL-23 strategy over more systemically immunosuppressive medical options". Therapy selection "may be chosen based on extra-intestinal manifestations", including joints or skin, when therapies have efficacy in both UC and the extraintestinal organ.

### Vedolizumab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis [^4dfe5ab4]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

With a need for a larger armamentarium of therapeutic options for those suffering from moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, vedolizumab, an α4β7-integrin biologic therapy, has recently received approval in the United States, Canada and Europe. However, it is unclear where it should be positioned in relation to current therapies for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.

Areas Covered

We systematically reviewed the literature for phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 randomized controlled trials assessing the role of vedolizumab in ulcerative colitis.

Expert Opinion

Trials assessing vedolizumab highlight its arrival as an effective and safe therapy for patients suffering from ulcerative colitis.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^7c3bac2a]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) — upfront advanced therapy versus step-up: In adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe UC, the AGA suggests early use of advanced therapies with or without immunomodulator therapy, rather than gradual step up after failure of 5-ASAs [Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence]. Patients, particularly those with less severe disease, who place higher value on the safety of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) therapy and lower value on the efficacy and risks of adverse effects of advanced therapies and immunomodulators, may reasonably decline early use of these therapies. Since the last guideline published in 2020, no new randomized controlled trials comparing upfront advanced therapies and/or immunomodulator therapy versus step-up therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe UC were identified, and 5-ASAs are not indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC.

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of ulcerative colitis [^224f7c35]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aim

To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions.

Methods

The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus.

Results

A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms.

Conclusions

Given the limited available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations that is now accessible via an online application.

### Acute severe ulcerative colitis: an international Delphi consensus on clinical trial design and endpoints [^67b78f50]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Interventional clinical trials in acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) are characterized by substantial heterogeneity due to a lack of consensus in several key areas of trial design-this impedes clinical research efforts to identify novel therapies. The objective of this initiative was to achieve the first consensus and provide clear position statements on ASUC trial design.

Methods

A modified Delphi consensus approach was employed with a panel of 20 clinicians with international representation and expertise in ASUC trial design and delivery. Agreement was defined as at least 75% of participants voting as "agree" with each statement.

Results

In total, 30 statements achieved consensus and were approved. Statements centred on proposing suitable eligibility criteria (disease extent, disease severity, prior therapy exposure), optimizing trial design (randomization, stratification, corticosteroid handling, timing of assessments), and recommending primary and secondary endpoints alongside defining key efficacy outcomes (clinical and endoscopic response and remission, treatment failure, quality of life).

Conclusions

The expansion of drugs to treat moderate-severe ulcerative colitis over the past decade, particularly the rapidly acting Janus kinase inhibitors, is promising and has reignited the interest in identifying suitable therapeutic candidates for ASUC. Clinical trials in this high-risk population are challenging to conduct and this consensus provides a framework for future trials to advance drug development.

### Is there room for immunomodulators in ulcerative colitis? [^bf2058a9]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: The management of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) has evolved over the past few decades. While aminosalicylates remain the mainstay of induction and maintenance therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate UC, the advent of biologic agents and novel oral small molecules has substantively changed the treatment landscape for patients with moderate-to-severe disease and confounded the role of traditional immunomodulators (IMMs) such as thiopurines and methotrexate in the UC management algorithm. Areas covered: We summarize the mechanism of action of thiopurines and methotrexate, identify clinical parameters for their use, and appraise the evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of IMMs in UC as both monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, emphasizing on prospective, controlled data. Expert opinion: With the advent of several classes of highly effective treatments for UC, emergence of data demonstrating no benefit of IMMs over placebo, and concerns about the relative safety profile of long-term IMM exposure, we propose that the role of thiopurines or methotrexate be restricted to patients with milder disease failing to maintain corticosteroid-free remission on aminosalicylates alone or in combination therapy with tumor necrosis factor antagonists in patients with moderate-to-severe UC.

### Induction and maintenance treatment with upadacitinib improves health-related quality of life in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: phase 3 study results [^913bebdc]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Messages

What is already known?

Induction treatment with upadacitinib (UPA) has previously demonstrated improvement in health-related quality of life measures in a phase 2 clinical trial in patients with ulcerative colitis, but longer-term benefits through maintenance therapy and across a broader range of patient-reported outcomes remain unknown.

What is new here?

Induction treatment with UPA 45 mg significantly improved health-related quality of life measures across multiple patient-reported outcomes that measure inflammatory bowel disease symptoms, work productivity, physical and mental functioning, and general well-being that were maintained after 52 weeks of maintenance treatment with UPA (15 mg and 30 mg), compared with placebo.

How can this study help patient care?

The benefits identified in HRQoL with UPA treatment fulfill the recommendations of the STRIDE initiative that targets the restoration of quality of life as an important, long-term treatment goal for patients with inflammatory bowel disease, which is increasingly recognized as an important factor influencing patient preference regarding treatment options.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^0e968984]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — key concept statements indicate that there are no validated therapeutic biomarkers or companion diagnostic tests to enhance selection or predict response to treatment for the patient with active ulcerative colitis (UC); patients with UC should have available all medical options as recommended by their doctor and healthcare team, and third-party payers and requirements for step therapy should not come between the patient and their healthcare team in making decisions about treatment for UC; patients with moderately to severely active UC have higher rates of response and remission with their first therapies than after failure of one or more other advanced therapies; given the expanding number of therapies per mechanistic class, a distinction between primary nonresponse and secondary nonresponse is important to select the next therapeutic option; post hoc subgroup analyses and network meta-analyses provide hypothesis-generating data but are not sufficient to stratify therapies for individual patients; infliximab is the preferred anti-TNF therapy for patients with moderately to severely active UC; some patients with moderately to severely active UC who are at higher risk for infectious complications may benefit from vedolizumab or an anti-IL-23 strategy over more systemically immunosuppressed medical options; and initial and subsequent therapies for moderately to severely active UC may be chosen based on extraintestinal manifestations, including the involvement of joints or skin, in which therapies having efficacy for both UC and the extraintestinal organ is known.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^1c692d00]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Management of hospitalized patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis — In hospitalized adult patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis, the AGA suggests using intravenous methylprednisolone dose equivalent of 40 to 60 mg/d rather than higher doses of intravenous corticosteroids (Conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence).

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^d3158fdd]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — early biologic therapy strategy. The AGA suggests early use of biologic agents with or without immunomodulator therapy, rather than gradual step up after failure of 5-ASA (Conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence). Patients, particularly those with less severe disease, who place higher value on the safety of 5-ASA therapy, and lower value on the efficacy of biologic agents, may reasonably choose gradual step therapy with 5-ASA therapy. Evidence notes there were no studies comparing upfront biologic-based therapy or tofacitinib vs gradual step-up therapy, that 5-ASAs have not been specifically studied in moderate to severe disease activity and are limited to mild to moderate disease, and that delaying effective treatment in moderate to severe UC at high risk of colectomy may be harmful; overall evidence supporting this recommendation was rated as very low due to serious indirectness and imprecision.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^16f7c233]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA living clinical practice guideline — PICO questions for adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis outline comparisons of pharmacologic strategies and key outcomes. Immunomodulator monotherapy options listed are thiopurines (azathioprine, mercaptopurine) and methotrexate (oral or SC). For tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, combination therapy with a TNF antagonist and an immunomodulator (thiopurines or methotrexate) is assessed with outcomes including induction of clinical remission and maintenance of clinical remission. For non-TNF biologics, combination therapy with a non-TNF antagonist biologic and an immunomodulator (thiopurines or methotrexate) is compared with non-TNF antagonist biologic monotherapy and immunomodulator monotherapy (thiopurines or methotrexate), with outcomes of induction of clinical remission and maintenance of clinical remission. Among patients in steroid-free remission on combination therapy, discontinuation of an immunomodulator or discontinuation of a biologic is contrasted with continuation of combination therapy, focusing on prevention of relapse. Treatment strategies are also contrasted as top-down therapy (upfront use of advanced therapies and/or immunomodulator therapy; upfront use of biologic-based combination therapy) versus step therapy (acceleration to advanced therapy only after failure of 5-ASA; initial use of immunomodulator or advanced therapy).

In patients with moderate-to-severe UC who are in corticosteroid-free clinical remission for at least 6 months on combination therapy of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists and an immunomodulator, the AGA SUGGESTS AGAINST withdrawal of TNF antagonists (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The guideline makes NO RECOMMENDATION in favor of, or against, withdrawing immunomodulators or continuing combination therapy (No recommendation, knowledge gap).

### Clinical practice guidelines for the medical management of nonhospitalized ulcerative colitis: the toronto consensus [^3bfdd616]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The medical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) has improved through the development of new therapies and novel approaches that optimize existing drugs. Previous Canadian consensus guidelines addressed the management of severe UC in the hospitalized patient. We now present consensus guidelines for the treatment of ambulatory patients with mild to severe active UC.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified studies on the management of UC. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on by a working group of specialists.

Results

The participants concluded that the goal of therapy is complete remission, defined as both symptomatic and endoscopic remission without corticosteroid therapy. The consensus includes 34 statements focused on 5 main drug classes: 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies, and other therapies. Oral and rectal 5-ASA are recommended first-line therapy for mild to moderate UC, with corticosteroid therapy for those who fail to achieve remission. Patients with moderate to severe UC should undergo a course of oral corticosteroid therapy, with transition to 5-ASA, thiopurine, anti-TNF (with or without thiopurine or methotrexate), or vedolizumab maintenance therapy in those who successfully achieve symptomatic remission. For patients with corticosteroid-resistant/dependent UC, anti-TNF or vedolizumab therapy is recommended. Timely assessments of response and remission are critical to ensuring optimal outcomes.

Conclusions

Optimal management of UC requires careful patient assessment, evidence-based use of existing therapies, and thorough assessment to define treatment success.

### ACG releases updated practice guidelines for ulcerative colitis in… [^aa6ed6ae]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with mild or moderate distal colitis may be treated with: oral aminosalicylate. If patients do not respond to mesalamine enemas or suppositories, oral prednisone should be administered. Patients with mild or moderate extensive colitis should begin therapy with oral sulfasalazine in daily doses titrated up to 4 to 6 g per day, or an alternative ASA in doses up to 4. 8 g per day of the active 5-ASA moiety. Oral steroids should be reserved for patients whose disease does not respond to other therapies or for patients with troubling symptoms that demand immediate improvement, and patients who receive steroids should be observed for signs of toxicity.

When the inflammation extends beyond the reach of topical therapy, oral therapy should be used, with sulfasalazine at 4 to 6 g per day being the first line of treatment. At this dosage, 80 percent of patients will experience clinical remission or improvement within four weeks. The following drug regimens were all found to be effective in maintaining remission in distal disease: sulfasalazine, 2 g per day; olsalazine, 1 g per day, Eudragit-S–coated mesalamine, 3. 2 g per day, balsalazide, 3 to 6 g per day. The combination of oral mesalamine and mesalamine enema is more effective than oral mesalamine alone. Topical corticosteroids have not been proved effective for maintaining remission. In patients with mild to moderate extensive colitis, remission is maintained by treatment with sulfasalazine, olsalazine, mesalamine, or balsalazide.

If patients do not respond to this first-line therapy, steroids may be administered.

### The biologics of ulcerative colitis [^1eb1bdac]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors dramatically changed the management of moderate-to-severe phenotypes of ulcerative colitis. The recent incoming of vedolizumab, which targets gut-specific leukocyte trafficking, provides a new biologic option for these patients. Areas covered: This review focuses on the rationale of use, efficacy, and safety profile of all biologics currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, including tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors (Infliximab and biosimilars, adalimumab, and golimumab), and the more recent vedolizumab. Expert opinion: Although biologics have been available in clinical practice for ulcerative colitis for about 15 years, there are several aspects that have not been fully understood yet: we know that they work, but we still don't know which subsets of patients benefit more, and how to optimize their use. All these unresolved problems are at least partly due to the discrepancy observed between phase II/III clinical trials of all biologics currently used in ulcerative colitis and in clinical practice.

### Positioning tofacitinib in the treatment algorithm of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^10a9609c]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment options for ulcerative colitis (UC) remain limited because conventional therapies do not succeed at controlling the disease in a considerable percentage of patients, while up to 30% of those receiving biologics are primary nonresponders and 10%-20% lose response per year, requiring an increase in the treatment dose or the use of a different drug. Recently, tofacitinib, an orally administered small molecule that inhibits the Janus kinases, was proven efficacious for inducing and maintaining remission in adult patients with moderate to severe UC. Tofacitinib may represent a therapeutic alternative for the management of UC, pending approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and other international regulatory authorities. Herein, we review tofacitinib's efficacy and safety data reported from randomized controlled trials in UC populations, with the aim to define how this new molecule could be inserted into the therapeutic algorithm of patients with UC.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^60e530ff]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — conclusions outline disease characterization and management, noting that UC is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the recto-colon and colon with variable activity and severity and significant morbidity. Appropriate management involves successful induction of both clinical and endoscopic remission followed by use of a corticosteroid-free maintenance strategy and ongoing monitoring for disease and drug-related complications. Choice of therapy is based on activity, severity, extent of inflammation and prognostic factors, and may include oral, topical (rectal), or systemic therapies, as well as surgery. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease should be treated early in their disease course with therapies that have been shown to be effective and should not linger with suboptimal therapy or recurrent courses of corticosteroids. In general, the induction therapy selected drives the choice of maintenance therapy. Positioning considerations include a single head-to-head trial in moderately to severely active UC, separation of induction and maintenance strategies for some patients with ASUC, and considerations of comorbid or concomitantly existing extraintestinal manifestations. We advocate for preservation of the clinician-patient shared decision-making approach to therapy selection and exclusion of limitations imposed by third-party payers.

### Biological agents for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^47558c34]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Biological agents are emerging treatment options for the management of ulcerative colitis (UC).

Purpose

To assess the comparative efficacy and harm of biological agents in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC who are naive to biological agents.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library from inception through December 2013, without language restrictions, and ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration Web sites.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled or head-to-head trials assessing biological agents as induction or maintenance therapy for moderately to severely active UC.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently abstracted study data and outcomes and rated each trial's risk of bias.

Data Synthesis

There were no head-to-head trials. There were 7 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that were rated as low risk of bias and showed that all biological agents (adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab, and vedolizumab) resulted in more clinical responses, clinical remissions, and mucosal healings than placebo for induction therapy. The results of network meta-analysis suggested that infliximab is more effective to induce clinical response (odds ratio, 2.36 [95% credible interval, 1.22 to 4.63]) and mucosal healing (odds ratio, 2.02 [95% credible interval, 1.13 to 3.59]) than adalimumab. No other indirect comparison reached statistical significance. For maintenance, 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that were rated high risk of bias showed that all biological agents have greater clinical efficacy than placebo. The occurrence of adverse events was not different between biological agents and placebo.

Limitation

Few trials, no head-to-head comparisons, and inadequate follow-up in maintenance trials.

Conclusion

Biological agents are effective treatments for UC, but head-to-head trials are warranted to establish the best therapeutic option.

### Tofacitinib for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a systematic review, network meta-analysis and economic evaluation [^eea871e2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong inflammatory disorder of the colon characterised by intermittent flares of symptoms (relapses) between variable periods of remission. Ulcerative colitis may present at any age, but most commonly affects adults in the second-to-fourth decades of life, resulting in disability in patients' most economically productive years. The physical symptoms of ulcerative colitis are debilitating, and the disease has a high negative impact on patients' quality of life, social and psychological well-being and daily functioning.

The primary goals of treatment for ulcerative colitis are to induce remission rapidly, maintain remission once achieved and prevent complications. In the UK, treatment options for patients with an inadequate response to conventional therapies comprise four biological therapies — the tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) agents adalimumab, golimumab and infliximaband the anti-integrin therapy vedolizumab — and an orally administered small molecule therapy, tofacitinib.

Tofacitinib has a novel mode of action for the treatment of ulcerative colitis: inhibition of the Janus kinase family. Acting intracellularly, tofacitinib can modulate the response of multiple cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. As a small molecule, tofacitinib is likely to avoid the immunogenicity seen with large proteins such as biological therapies. To date, however, there has been no direct comparison of tofacitinib and any biological therapy for ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study is therefore to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib with licensed biological therapies for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis from a UK perspective.

Where data exist from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with the same comparators, these can be combined using meta-analysis, a statistical procedure that integrates the results of several independent studies. Network meta-analysis (NMA) combines both direct and indirect evidence allowing for the comparison of multiple treatments simultaneously, including those that have not been compared in an RCT.NMAs are typically based on the results of comprehensive systematic literature reviews, to ensure that all relevant RCT evidence is captured. In addition to providing estimates of the comparative efficacy of interventions, NMA results often inform cost-effectiveness analysis, providing a comparable set of efficacy inputs for the comparators of interest.

### New lessons: classic treatments, expanding options in ulcerative colitis [^151f7127]. Colorectal Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) of moderate severity is a common presentation in gastroenterological practice and a number of treatment options exist to rapidly and effectively induce remission. This review highlights how novel formulations and dosing regimens can ensure treatment success at a greater convenience for the patient with no increased risk of adverse effects. 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA) is well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse effects, and has a significant role in the management of UC. Different formulations of oral 5-ASA are now available and allow targeted treatment to inflammatory areas of the small bowel and ascending colon. 5-ASA is often initiated at a low dose for patients with mild to moderately active UC and with increasing doses for those who fail or have a poor response. 5-ASA at high doses is increasingly being used as induction therapy for active UC, particularly in patients with recurrent and/or extensive disease. The recent ASCEND studies show that an induction dose of 5-ASA of 4.8 g daily in patients with moderate UC is significantly more effective and resolves symptoms faster compared with a daily dose of 2.4 g. The evidence provided by the ASCEND studies support the rationale for a 'top-down' dosing strategy for UC where more potent therapies are introduced at an earlier stage of moderately severe disease.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Exposure‐response analyses can help predict which dosing regimens might be of most benefit to patients.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ This study characterized the relationship between tofacitinib exposure and efficacy end points for both induction and maintenance therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and identified patient‐specific factors that are important determinants of efficacy.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ Results support the use of tofacitinib 10 mg b.i.d. for induction in patients with moderate to severe UC. However, they also suggest tofacitinib 5 mg b.i.d. might be efficacious for induction in patients without prior tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) failure. Although 5 mg b.i.d. was efficacious for maintenance, patients with prior TNFi failure might see additional benefit on 10 mg b.i.d. Patients with lower baseline disease activity were more likely to achieve efficacy end points at the end of maintenance.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ The findings highlight that prior TNFi status and baseline disease activity are important considerations that may impact efficacy of tofacitinib induction and maintenance therapy in patients with UC.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^90373d36]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Key concept statements for mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC) emphasize that patients with a number of prognostic factors associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or surgery should be treated with therapies for moderate-to-severe disease. Patients with mildly to moderately active UC should be reassessed to determine response to induction therapy within 8 weeks. There is not sufficient evidence for routine use of probiotics, prebiotics, or other alternative therapies as primary induction therapy for patients with mildly to moderately active UC, and there is not sufficient evidence of an optimal approach to fecal microbial transfer as a primary induction treatment. Patients with previously mildly to moderately active UC who have achieved remission should be treated with maintenance therapy with demonstrated efficacy in prevention of relapse, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of a probiotic as primary or adjunctive maintenance therapy.

### Comparative efficacy of advanced therapies for management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis: 2024 American Gastroenterological Association evidence synthesis [^07d4ba93]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

We performed an updated systematic review and network meta-analysis to inform the 2024 American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Guidelines on the management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC).

Methods

We searched multiple electronic databases through November 21, 2023, to identify randomized controlled trials in adults with moderate-to-severe UC, comparing different advanced therapies (tumor necrosis factor antagonists, vedolizumab, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, interleukin 12/23 or selective interleukin 23 antagonists, and Janus kinase [JAK] inhibitors) against placebo or another active comparator. Our primary outcomes were induction and maintenance of clinical remission, and our secondary outcome was endoscopic improvement. We performed a network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to appraise certainty of evidence.

Results

After excluding JAK inhibitors as potential first-line treatment (in accordance with the United States Food and Drug Administration), low-certainty evidence supports clinically important benefit with infliximab, ozanimod, risankizumab, and guselkumab over adalimumab and mirikizumab for achieving remission with induction therapy in biologically naïve patients with moderate-to-severe UC, with risankizumab and ozanimod being ranked the highest for induction of clinical remission. With the inclusion of JAK inhibitors as first-line therapy, upadacitinib was more efficacious compared with all other medications except ozanimod and risankizumab, with low- to moderate-certainty evidence. In patients with prior biologic exposure, upadacitinib, tofacitinib, and ustekinumab were ranked highest for achieving remission.

Conclusions

Using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise quality of evidence, this updated network meta-analysis will be used to inform comparative efficacy and positioning of advanced therapies for the treatment of biologic-naïve and biologic-exposed patients with moderate-to-severe UC.

### Use of biologics and small molecule drugs for the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: IG-IBD technical review based on the GRADE methodology [^9b14564f]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

The increased knowledge on the biological mechanisms underlying ulcerative colitis (UC) has triggered an advance in drug development, drastically changing the therapeutic landscape. Several biologics and small-molecule drugs have been regulatory approved (i.e., infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab and tofacitinib), and frequently pose clinical dilemmas: physicians need to know how these therapies can be used to optimize patient-important outcomes. Adhering to the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation" (GRADE) methodology, this technical review systematically searched and identified the evidence, synthesized it using rigorous meta-analytic methodology, appraised its quality, and concisely presented it in a transparent way, forming the basis for developing clinical recommendations on the use of biologics and small-molecule drugs in adult patients with UC.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^72945cb4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Key concept statements in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) management — Patients with mildly to moderately active UC who are not responsive (or are intolerant) to 5‑aminosalicylic acid (5‑ASA) therapies should be treated as patients with moderate‑to‑severe disease. Strategies for the management of the nonhospitalized patient with moderately or severely active UC are similar with the exception of a few considerations: 5‑ASA therapy could be used as monotherapy for induction of moderately but not severely active UC; in patients with moderately active UC, consider nonsystemic corticosteroids such as budesonide MMX before the use of systemic steroid therapy; in patients with severely active UC, consider systemic corticosteroids rather than topical corticosteroids; and corticosteroids may be avoided entirely when other effective induction strategies are planned. The extent of bowel involvement in moderately to severely active UC should not limit the choice of advanced therapies, including that patients with moderately to severely active isolated proctitis should have access to and be treated with therapies with demonstrated efficacy in patients with more extensive UC of similar activity. Data on combination anti‑tumor necrosis factor (anti‑TNF) and immunomodulators in moderately to severely active UC only exist for infliximab and thiopurines. The patient with nonresponse or loss of response to anti‑TNF therapy should be assessed with measurement of drug concentrations to optimize the existing therapy or to select an alternate therapy. Patients who are primary nonresponders to an anti‑TNF should be evaluated and considered for alternative mechanisms of disease control rather than cycling to another drug within the anti‑TNF class. Biosimilars to anti‑TNF therapies and to ustekinumab are acceptable substitutes for originator therapies; delays in switching should not occur and patients and clinicians should be notified about such changes. Subcutaneous infliximab and vedolizumab are considered equivalent to the standard intravenous maintenance dosing of these agents, but the equivalence of the subcutaneous formulations for induction or as substitution for escalated doses of these therapies has not been robustly established. Obtain consultation with a surgeon and consider colectomy in patients with moderately to severely active UC who are refractory or intolerant to medical therapy.

Vedolizumab versus placebo — GRADE evidence for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis reports induction and maintenance of clinical remission with randomized controlled trials. For induction of clinical remission (CRITICAL), risk with placebo was 18/231 (7.8%) versus risk with vedolizumab 68/389 (17.5%), with relative effect RR 2.09 (1.28–3.43) and absolute effect 109 more per 1000 (from 28 more to 243 more); 620 (2 RCTs), quality MODERATE. For maintenance of clinical remission (CRITICAL), risk with placebo was 41/224 (18.3%) versus risk with vedolizumab 146/323 (45.2%), with RR 2.41 (1.78–3.27) and absolute effect 212 more per 1000 (from 117 more to 340 more); 547 (3 RCTs), quality MODERATE. Absolute effects were estimated using placebo rates across trials (induction of clinical remission ~10%; maintenance of clinical remission ~15%) and were "rated down for imprecision because optimal information size not met (< 200 events)", with the note that "Lower limit of 95% absolute effect crosses the clinically meaningful difference threshold of drug over placebo for induction of clinical remission outcome".

### Medical therapy versus surgery in moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^ac9f93cf]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the colon from rectum to caecum, is characterized by periods of increased bowel movements, blood in feces, rectal urgency, tenesmus, and abdominal pain, with periods of remission and flares of disease, which negatively impact quality of life. A number of therapeutic options are available for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, however, no clear treatment algorithm exists. Therapeutic goals include short-term benefits for patients (i.e., the reduction/absence of symptoms, essentially stool frequency and rectal bleeding) and long-term benefits (i.e., sustained clinical remission, steroid-free remission, and mucosal healing). Therapies currently approved and available for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis include monoclonal antibodies such as those targeting anti-tumor necrosis factor α (i.e., infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab), anti-adhesion molecules (i.e., vedolizumab), anti-interleukin 12/23 agents (i.e., ustekinumab), and Janus Kinase inhibitors (i.e., tofacitinib). Surgical approaches should also be considered in patients refractory to medical therapy or with complications (including toxic megacolon or colonic dysplasia/cancer). This review provides an overview of currently available treatment options for patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis and summarizes factors that should be considered during the therapeutic decision.

Key Messages

What is already known? Mirikizumab, a p19-directed interleukin-3 monoclonal antibody, is effective at 12 weeks of induction and 52 weeks of maintenance treatment in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.

What is new here? Long-term treatment with mirikizumab up to 104 weeks is associated with a sustained and durable effect on clinical response/remission, endoscopic, histologic, symptomatic, and quality-of life outcomes in patients who had previously failed biologic therapy and those who had not.

How can this study help patient care? This study provides long-term (2-year) treatment data for mirikizumab, informing benefit-risk decisions when prescribing this new biologic to patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^2ebbe5e3]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Moderate to severe ulcerative colitis — therapy selection and positioning: current evidence supports use of infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, and tofacitinib for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate to severe UC. Thiopurine monotherapy should not be used for induction of remission, but may be considered for maintenance of remission; in contrast, methotrexate monotherapy, orally or subcutaneously, should not be used for induction or maintenance of remission. Network meta-analysis suggests that infliximab and vedolizumab may be preferred first-line therapy in biologic-naïve patients rather than standard-dose adalimumab or golimumab, with limited evidence to inform appropriate positioning of tofacitinib. In patients with prior exposure to infliximab, particularly those with primary nonresponse to induction therapy, vedolizumab or tofacitinib may be preferred over adalimumab or golimumab. Combination therapy of a biologic agent with an immunomodulator is more effective than monotherapy with either agent, although patients, particularly those with less severe disease and those averse to side effects from medications, may opt for monotherapy. In patients with moderate to severe disease activity at high risk of colectomy, biologic agents with or without an immunomodulator, or tofacitinib, should be used early rather than gradual step-up therapy after failure of 5-ASA, and patients in remission with biologic agents and/or immunomodulators after prior failure of 5-ASA, may discontinue 5-ASA.

### Preventive care considerations… [^ecd1e899]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment INDUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF REMISSION The goal of managing patients with ulcerative colitis is to attain mucosal healing with symptom control so that sustained steroid-free remission can be achieved and prevent hospitalizations and surgeries. Initiation of treatment begins with stratifying disease activity into mild vs. moderate to severe. The American College of Gastroenterology Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index provides a set of criteria to help determine if the disease is in remission, mild, moderate to severe, or fulminant. TREATMENT OF MILD DISEASE The 2019 guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology recommend treatment of mild ulcerative proctitis with rectal 5-amino-salicylic acid therapies. 1 Mild to moderate colitis should be treated with a combination of rectal 5-ASA enemas and oral 5-ASA therapies. Rectal 5-ASA enemas are preferred to rectal steroid formulations. Mesalamine is more potent than sulfasalazine for inducing remission.

TREATMENT OF MODERATE TO SEVERE DISEASE First-line therapy for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis is biologics. 14 Biologic agents with or without glucocorticoids and immune modulators should be used to induce and maintain remission. Thiopurines or methotrexate should not be used as monotherapy. 1 Systemic corticosteroids are effective in inducing remission, but dosages and treatment duration should be limited. Other options for inducing remission include tumor necrosis factor–alpha antibodies, anti-integrin antibodies, anti-interleukin antibodies, and Janus kinase inhibitors 1. Fecal microbiota transplantation induces remission in some patients with ulcerative colitis, but current use is limited to clinical trials. 15–17. COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE One probiotic modestly improves symptoms.

It also helps to prevent pouchitis, an abnormal immune response in patients susceptible to autoimmune disease that leads to inflammation of the rectal pouch fashioned after a colectomy. 19–21 A systematic review of six small studies found that curcumin promotes clinical and endoscopic improvement when added to conventional therapy in patients with mild ulcerative colitis. 22 Acupuncture is considered safe in addition to conventional treatment, but high-quality evidence of effectiveness is lacking. 25.

### Real-world effectiveness of advanced therapies among patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in the United States [^23d494fe]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Patients with UC frequently continue using steroids during the first year after initiating advanced therapies, and those initiating biologic therapies often require combination therapy with an immunosuppressant. A subset of patients also experience extended UC-related hospitalization stays. These results suggest that optimization of current therapies and/or therapies with alternative mechanisms of action are needed to achieve steroid-free goals of treatment.

### Adalimumab in ulcerative colitis-efficacy, safety and optimization in the era of treat-to target [^0f33f93b]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Active ulcerative colitis is associated with significant morbidity and impairment to quality of life. Adalimumab is a welcome addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for clinicians treating patients with moderate-severe ulcerative colitis refractory to conventional therapies, an indication with few prior treatment options. It offers the convenience of self-injection and is most appropriate for outpatients with moderate disease activity. Areas covered: This review briefly summarizes data from well-designed clinical trials and observational real-life studies that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in UC. Particular attention is paid to newer studies, including those with objective treatment endpoints and pharmacokinetic outcomes that incorporate a treat to target approach in inflammatory bowel disease. Expert opinion: Adalimumab is effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in patients with moderate-severe ulcerative colitis refractory to conventional therapies. At currently approved doses, it is most suitable for use in outpatients with moderate disease activity; higher doses may be required for patients with more severe disease. The convenience of self-injection will make it popular for remote patients and it may be an appropriate option in patients in whom monotherapy, rather than combination therapy with an immunomodulator, is preferred.

AGA guideline — key overarching considerations for adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis emphasize that patients should have confirmation of active inflammation based on UC-related symptoms, biomarkers, and/or endoscopic evaluation before starting advanced therapies; patients should have both general and therapy-specific pretreatment workup before initiation of such treatments with screening for hepatitis B and tuberculosis exposure before any biologic or advanced small molecule treatments, thiopurine methyl transferase testing before initiation of thiopurines, and a baseline electrocardiogram before use of S1P receptor modulators; evaluation for factors influencing risk of treatment-related complications including assessment of comorbidities, frailty, and functional status and concomitant medications, and assessment of thromboembolic and cardiovascular risk factors is important; in order to decrease risk of serious infections with immunosuppressive therapies, vaccination against influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, and herpes zoster (particularly before S1P receptor modulator or JAK inhibitor use) should be considered; initiation of advanced therapy should be followed by monitoring for symptomatic response within 3 mo of initiation, symptomatic and biochemical remission within 3–6 mo, and endoscopic improvement/ remission within 6–12 mo; and on-treatment monitoring for potential toxicity from immunosuppressive therapies, such as periodic monitoring of hemogram, chemistries, and transaminases, should be performed, according to drug label.

Ulcerative colitis — induction and maintenance of remission in mildly to moderately active disease — Patients with mildly to moderately active UC and prognostic factors associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or surgery should be treated with therapies for moderate-to-severe disease. Patients with mildly to moderately active UC should be reassessed to determine response to induction therapy within 8 wk. There is not sufficient evidence for routine use of probiotics, prebiotics, or other alternative therapies as primary induction therapy for patients with mildly to moderately active UC, and there is not sufficient evidence of an optimal approach to fecal microbial transfer as a primary induction treatment for this population. Patients with previously mildly to moderately active UC who have achieved remission should be treated with maintenance therapy with demonstrated efficacy in prevention of relapse, and in patients with previously mildly to moderately active UC who have achieved remission, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of a probiotic as primary or adjunctive therapy for maintenance of remission.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^8aed0061]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that seems to be rising in incidence and prevalence throughout the world. These guidelines were developed to indicate the preferred approach to the management of adult patients with ulcerative colitis as established by valid scientific research and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology under the auspices of the Practice Parameters Committee. The scientific evidence for the recommendations made in these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process, assessing the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) and assigning a strength of recommendation based on its apparent clinical benefit (strong or conditional). In instances where the available evidence was not appropriate for a formal Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation recommendation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, statements were developed using expert consensus (termed key concept statements). These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable to practitioners regardless of specialty or interest and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios. As opposed to standards of care, guidelines are inherently flexible, and physicians should use them as tools in choosing the best course in a specific clinical situation. These guidelines represent the state of the evidence at the time of this publication. As new evidence emerges, these guidelines will be continuously reviewed, and updates will be published as needed to assure continued validity.

### Upadacitinib as induction and maintenance therapy for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: results from three phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomised trials [^d9c176b9]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

There is a great unmet need for advanced therapies that provide rapid, robust, and sustained disease control for patients with ulcerative colitis. We assessed the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor, as induction and maintenance therapy in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.

Methods

This phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical programme consisted of two replicate induction studies (U-ACHIEVE induction [UC1] and U-ACCOMPLISH [UC2]) and a single maintenance study (U-ACHIEVE maintenance [UC3]). The studies were conducted across Europe, North and South America, Australasia, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region at 199 clinical centres in 39 countries (UC1), 204 clinical centres in 40 countries (UC2), and 195 clinical centres in 35 countries (UC3). Patients aged 16–75 years with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Adapted Mayo score 5–9; endoscopic subscore 2 or 3) for at least 90 days were randomly assigned (2:1) to oral upadacitinib 45 mg once daily or placebo for 8 weeks (induction studies). Patients who achieved clinical response following 8-week upadacitinib induction were re-randomly assigned (1:1:1) to upadacitinib 15 mg, upadacitinib 30 mg, or placebo for 52 weeks (maintenance study). All patients were randomly assigned using web-based interactive response technology. The primary endpoints were clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score at week 8 (induction) and week 52 (maintenance). The efficacy analyses in the two induction studies were based on the intent-to-treat population, which included all randomised patients who received at least one dose of treatment. In the maintenance study, the primary efficacy analyses reported in this manuscript were based on the first 450 (planned) clinical responders to 8-week induction therapy with upadacitinib 45 mg once daily. The safety analysis population in the induction studies consisted of all randomised patients who received at least one dose of treatment; in the maintenance study, this population included all patients who received at least one dose of treatment as part of the primary analysis population. These studies are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02819635 (U-ACHIEVE) and NCT03653026 (U-ACCOMPLISH).

Findings

Between Oct 23, 2018, and Sept 7, 2020, 474 patients were randomly assigned to upadacitinib 45 mg once daily (n = 319) or placebo (n = 155) in UC1. Between Dec 6, 2018, and Jan 14, 2021, 522 patients were randomly assigned to upadacitinib 45 mg once daily (n = 345) or placebo (n = 177) in UC2. In UC3, a total of 451 patients (21 from the phase 2b study, 278 from UC1, and 152 from UC2) who achieved a clinical response after 8 weeks of upadacitinib induction treatment were randomly assigned again to upadacitinib 15 mg (n = 148), upadacitinib 30 mg (n = 154), and placebo (n = 149) in the primary analysis population. Statistically significantly more patients achieved clinical remission with upadacitinib 45 mg (83 [26%] of 319 patients in UC1 and 114 [34%] of 341 patients in UC2) than in the placebo group (seven [5%] of 154 patients in UC1 and seven [4%] of 174 patients; p < 0.0001; adjusted treatment difference 21.6% [95% CI 15.8–27.4] for UC1 and 29.0% [23.2–34.7] for UC2). In the maintenance study, clinical remission was achieved by statistically significantly more patients receiving upadacitinib (15 mg 63 [42%] of 148; 30 mg 80 [52%] of 154) than those receiving placebo (18 [12%] of 149; p < 0.0001; adjusted treatment difference 30.7% [21.7–39.8] for upadacitinib 15 mg vs placebo and 39.0% [29.7–48.2] for upadacitinib 30 mg vs placebo). The most commonly reported adverse events in UC1 were nasopharyngitis (15 [5%] of 319 in the upadacitinib 45 mg group vs six [4%] of 155 in the placebo group), creatine phosphokinase elevation (15 [4%] vs three [2%]), and acne (15 [5%] vs one [1%]). In UC2, the most frequently reported adverse event was acne (24 [7%] of 344 in the upadacitinib 45 mg group vs three [2%] of 177 in the placebo group). In both induction studies, serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were less frequent in the upadacitinib 45 mg group than in the placebo group (serious adverse events eight [3%] vs nine (6%) in UC1 and 11 [3%] vs eight [5%] in UC2; adverse events leading to discontinuation six [2%] vs 14 [9%] in UC1 and six [2%] vs nine [5%] in UC2). In UC3, the most frequently reported adverse events (≥ 5%) were worsening of ulcerative colitis (19 [13%] of 148 in the upadacitinib 15 mg group vs 11 [7%] of 154 in the upadacitinib 30 mg group vs 45 [30%] of 149 in the placebo group), nasopharyngitis (18 [12%] vs 22 [14%] vs 15 [10%]), creatine phosphokinase elevation (nine [6%] vs 13 [8%] vs three [2%]), arthralgia (nine [6%] vs five [3%] vs 15 [10%]), and upper respiratory tract infection (seven [5%] vs nine [6%] vs six [4%]). The proportion of serious adverse events (ten [7%] vs nine [6%] vs 19 [13%]) and adverse events leading to discontinuation (six [4%] vs ten [6%] vs 17 [11%]) was lower in both upadacitinib groups than in the placebo group. Events of cancer, adjudicated major adverse cardiac events, or venous thromboembolism were reported infrequently. There were no treatment-related deaths.

Interpretation

Upadacitinib demonstrated a positive efficacy and safety profile and could be an effective treatment option for patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.

### Expert consensus paper on the use of vedolizumab for the management of patients with moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease [^b9a88ed7]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) are chronic, relapsing conditions resulting from uncontrolled inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Both conditions are associated with significant disability and patients with CD face higher mortality rates compared to the general population. The increasing understanding of the immunological basis of the disease led to the introduction of biologic therapies targeting key pathways of the natural and adaptive immune response such as Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNF-α) inhibitors and, more recently, integrin-receptor antagonists. Treatment with TNF-α inhibitors improved clinical and patient-reported outcomes for many patients who did not benefit from conventional therapy. However, a sizeable share of patients still face suboptimal outcomes due to primary or secondary therapy failure. With the introduction of VDZ, a biologic treatment targeting novel IBD-relevant biologic pathways, it is crucial to understand how to integrate such innovations into current clinical practice. To this end, a panel of 14 Italian experts in the management of IBD met for a roundtable discussion. Recommendations concerning the management of moderate-to-severe IBD based on experts' opinions and literature review are discussed in the present report.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological agents for management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analyses [^eb4f947f]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The majority of patients with ulcerative colitis have mildly to moderately active disease. To inform the management of patients with left-sided or extensive mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis, we assessed the comparative efficacy and tolerability of different therapies.

Methods

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched Epub, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to Dec 14, 2015, and updated on MEDLINE on March 1, 2018, for randomised controlled trials in adults (age ≥ 17 years) with left-sided or extensive mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Studies were included if patients were treated with oral sulfasalazine, diazo-bonded 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), mesalazine (low dose < 2 g/day, standard dose 2–3 g/day, or high dose > 3 g/day), controlled ileal-release budesonide, or budesonide multimatrix, alone or in combination with rectal 5-ASA therapy, and were compared with each other or placebo for induction or maintenance of clinical remission. The minimum duration of therapy was 4 weeks for trials of induction and 24 weeks for trials of maintenance therapy. We did pairwise and random-effects network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach, and calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs; agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to appraise quality of evidence. We examined heterogeneity with the I 2 statistic.

Findings

Our search identified 1316 unique studies, from which 75 randomised trials with 12215 patients were eligible for analysis. Based on 48 induction randomised trials (8020 participants) that met inclusion criteria, combined oral and rectal 5-ASAs (SUCRA 0.99) and high-dose mesalazine (> 3 g/day; SUCRA 0.82) were ranked highest for induction of remission. Both interventions were superior to standard-dose mesalazine (2–3 g/day; failure to induce remission with combined oral and rectal 5-ASAs OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22–0.77; high-dose mesalazine 0.78, 0.66–0.93) with moderate confidence in estimates. On the basis of 28 randomised trials (4218 participants) that met inclusion criteria, all interventions were superior to placebo for maintenance of remission; however, neither combined oral and rectal 5-ASAs nor high-dose mesalazine were superior to standard-dose mesalazine.

Interpretation

In patients with mildly to moderately active left-sided or extensive ulcerative colitis, combined oral and topical mesalazine therapy and high-dose mesalazine are superior to standard-dose mesalazine for induction of remission, but not maintenance of remission. Standard-dose mesalazine might be preferred for maintenance in most patients.

3.5 Initial treatment of active UC with 5-ASA

Statement 3. We recommend that mild to moderate ulcerative colitis should be managed with oral 5-ASA 2–3 g/day (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). We recommend the addition of 5-ASA enemas, rather than oral treatment alone (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 95.6%).

Statement 4. We suggest that ulcerative colitis patients flaring on 5-ASA therapy should receive dose escalation to 4–4.8 g/day orally alongside 5-ASA enemas (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 82.2%).

Oral 5-ASA (5-aminosalicylic acid) is the standard therapy for mild to moderately active UC. Meta-analyses support the efficacy of oral 5-ASA for induction therapy for mild to moderately active UC. Once daily dosing is as effective as divided doses. Doses ≥ 2 g/day are more effective than dosages < 2 g/day for remission (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98). The majority of patients with mild to moderate UC will respond to 2–3 g 5-ASA (depending on formulation used) and higher doses can be used in those with more severe symptoms or those not responding initially.

Adult outpatients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis — biologic and small-molecule selection for induction: The AGA recommends using infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, tofacitinib, or ustekinumab over no treatment. In biologic-naive patients, the AGA suggests using infliximab or vedolizumab rather than adalimumab for induction of remission, and recommends that tofacitinib only be used in the setting of a clinical or registry study (No recommendation; knowledge gap). In those previously exposed to infliximab, particularly with primary nonresponse, the AGA suggests using ustekinumab or tofacitinib rather than vedolizumab or adalimumab for induction of remission.

INTRODUCTION

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease of the colon characterized by intermittent periods of disease flaring and remission. It affects approximately 900,000 people in the United States. Although the primary clinical symptom is the presence of bloody diarrhea, patients can also experience a range of additional symptoms including urgency and abdominal pain. Individuals can also have more systemic symptoms, such as fever and weight loss.

The goal of treatment in UC is to induce and maintain remission of symptoms and allow for healing of inflammation. For patients with mild to moderate disease severity, conventional treatment typically consists of oral or topical aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) or topical steroids for induction of remission and oral and/or topical 5-ASAs for maintenance. For patients who are refractory to 5-ASA therapy or topical steroids, oral steroids can be used to induce remission. However, steroids are not indicated for maintenance therapy in UC. Despite this, 22% of patients develop steroid dependency, and only half achieve steroid-free remission within a year of their first course of systemic steroids. Inability to taper off steroids is suggestive of a need to switch to advanced therapies.

Approximately half of newly diagnosed patients progress to moderate or severe disease, either continuously or intermittently. In addition, many patients with UC do not respond to conventional therapies, either failing to respond to induction therapy (primary nonresponse) or initially achieving remission but not maintaining it with long-term treatment (secondary nonresponse). For example, 42% of patients fail to achieve clinical improvement with oral 5-ASA induction treatment, and a further subset fail to maintain remission at ≥ 6 months. For patients with moderate to severe disease, advanced therapies available at the time of this study (March 31, 2017) included immunosuppressants (eg, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine) and biologic therapies (adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, and vedolizumab), although clinical practice guidelines have recently been updated to include tofacitinib, an oral small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of UC. In patients with primary nonresponse to one of the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) biologic therapies, an alternative mechanism of disease control (eg, a different class of therapy) is recommended over switching to a different TNFi.
