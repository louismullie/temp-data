## Question

What is a management plan for a uncomplicated Influenza diagnosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a management plan for uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy, non–high-risk outpatients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing uncomplicated from complicated disease. Then, I should verify the role and timing of diagnostic testing. Next, I will evaluate antiviral therapy indications, choices, and duration, including baloxavir considerations. After that, I need to outline supportive care and return-to-activity guidance. Finally, I should address special scenarios, follow-up, and what to do if the patient deteriorates, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis and severity. Uncomplicated influenza typically presents with abrupt onset of fever, cough, myalgias, headache, and rhinorrhea, with gastrointestinal symptoms more common in children; absence of dyspnea, hypoxia, altered mental status, or signs of lower respiratory tract disease supports an uncomplicated course, and vaccination status does not exclude influenza during circulation periods [^5c226e7c] [^e62031a2] [^fb11fe4a].

> Wait, let me verify the role of testing in uncomplicated, non–high-risk outpatients. Routine testing is not required; I initially thought testing might be broadly indicated, but hold on, I should correct that — testing is reserved for cases where results will change management, such as high-risk patients, severe or progressive disease, or when results will reduce unnecessary antibiotics or inform infection control; in low-risk outpatients with classic symptoms during circulation, empiric management without testing is reasonable [^c191ee4c] [^2b8ee4ff] [^3b82bef4].

> I need to check antiviral indications for uncomplicated, non–high-risk patients. The clearest benefit is when treatment is started within 48 hours of symptom onset, yielding about a 1–2 day reduction in symptoms; beyond 48 hours, benefit wanes but may still be considered if illness is moderate to severe or progressive, or if there is a high-risk household contact, balancing modest gains against adverse effects like nausea and vomiting [^df3037c6] [^4b414581] [^37ae3453].

> Let me consider agent selection and duration. Standard options are oral oseltamivir for 5 days, inhaled zanamivir for 5 days, or a single IV dose of peramivir; I should confirm that routine combination therapy or higher-than-approved dosing is not recommended, and indeed IDSA advises against both practices in seasonal influenza [^84fab550] [^56a890c4] [^d7545c30].

> Hold on, I should verify baloxavir's role. Baloxavir is FDA-approved for acute uncomplicated influenza in patients aged 12 years and older within 48 hours of symptom onset and reduces time to symptom alleviation by roughly 26–29 hours versus placebo, with similar efficacy to oseltamivir; however, WHO 2024 recommends against baloxavir in non-severe, low-risk patients, so I should frame it as an option where available and appropriate, but not routinely favored in this exact scenario [^3bd7e3a0] [^215aa74b] [^c9c63573].

> Next, I should review supportive care, which is foundational. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and myalgias, adequate hydration, rest, and cough control as needed are appropriate; I need to ensure I advise staying home until at least 24 hours after fever resolution to limit transmission, and I should caution against aspirin in children due to Reye syndrome risk [^4b414581].

> I will now examine special scenarios that modify management. If the patient is a household contact of someone at high risk for complications, I should consider antivirals even beyond 48 hours in some cases; if the patient is pregnant, postpartum, immunocompromised, or has severe or progressive disease, treatment should be offered regardless of time since onset, and testing should not delay therapy; in children, the same early-treatment principles apply, with oseltamivir approved down to 2 weeks of age and consideration of antivirals even after 48 hours if moderate to severe or progressive [^37ae3453] [^e7d789ef] [^b392da63] [^5a858f8a].

> Let me think about what to do if the patient fails to improve. If there is no improvement after 2–3 days of appropriate therapy, I should double-check for alternative diagnoses such as bacterial coinfection, COVID-19, or noninfectious etiologies, and consider further evaluation; I should confirm that routine antibiotics are not indicated without evidence of bacterial infection in non-severe influenza, aligning with WHO guidance [^485c9bc9] [^a2bcbf36] [^048518d8].

> I should confirm follow-up and patient education. Provide clear return precautions for dyspnea, chest pain, persistent high fever, altered mental status, or worsening symptoms; reinforce hand hygiene and cough etiquette; and remind patients that annual vaccination remains the cornerstone of prevention and does not preclude current infection or treatment considerations [^4b414581] [^fb11fe4a].

> Putting this together, my final, streamlined plan is as follows: for an otherwise healthy, non–high-risk outpatient with suspected uncomplicated influenza within 48 hours of symptom onset, offer antiviral therapy with oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days, inhaled zanamivir twice daily for 5 days, or a single IV dose of peramivir, discussing modest benefits and potential adverse effects; beyond 48 hours, consider antivirals if illness is moderate to severe, progressive, or if there is a high-risk household contact; prioritize supportive care and home isolation until 24 hours after fever resolution; reserve testing for scenarios where results will change management; and escalate evaluation if no improvement in 2–3 days or if red flags emerge [^84fab550] [^37ae3453] [^4b414581] [^c191ee4c] [^485c9bc9].

---

For uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy patients, management is **supportive care** [^4b414581] with antipyretics, hydration, and rest, and **antivirals are optional** [^37ae3453] if started within 48 hours of symptom onset [^df3037c6]. Oseltamivir or zanamivir for 5 days, or a single dose of peramivir or baloxavir, can shorten illness by about 1 day [^df3037c6] [^3bd7e3a0]; baloxavir is not recommended for low-risk patients [^c9c63573]. Antibiotics are not indicated unless bacterial coinfection is suspected [^048518d8]. Patients should isolate until 24 hours after fever resolution [^4b414581], and seek care if symptoms worsen or persist beyond 7–10 days.

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Uncomplicated influenza typically presents with **abrupt onset** of fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, myalgia, headache, and fatigue [^5c226e7c]; gastrointestinal symptoms may occur, especially in children [^5c226e7c]. Diagnosis is **primarily clinical** during influenza season, with testing reserved for cases where results will change management or when influenza is not circulating [^c191ee4c] [^2b8ee4ff].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care is the cornerstone of management for uncomplicated influenza and includes:

- **Antipyretics**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain control [^4b414581].

- **Hydration**: Encourage oral fluids to prevent dehydration.

- **Rest**: Adequate rest to support recovery.

- **Cough management**: Over-the-counter cough suppressants may be used if cough is bothersome.

---

## Antiviral therapy

Antiviral therapy is **not routinely required** for uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy individuals but may be considered in specific scenarios:

- **Timing**: Initiate within 48 hours of symptom onset for maximal benefit [^df3037c6].

- **Indications**: Consider in patients presenting within 48 hours, those with severe or progressive illness, or those at high risk of complications (e.g. pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, patients with chronic medical conditions) [^e7d789ef].

- **Options**: Oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir for 5 days, or a single dose of intravenous peramivir or oral baloxavir [^84fab550] [^3bd7e3a0].

- **Benefit**: Antivirals can reduce symptom duration by approximately 1 day and may reduce the risk of complications [^df3037c6] [^4b414581].

---

## When to consider antiviral therapy

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Illness onset ≤ 48 hours | Consider antiviral therapy |
| Severe or progressive illness | Initiate antiviral therapy |
| High-risk patients (pregnant, immunocompromised, chronic conditions) | Initiate antiviral therapy |
| Illness onset > 48 hours | Generally not recommended unless severe or high-risk |

---

## Infection control and prevention

Patients should be advised to **isolate themselves** until at least 24 hours after fever resolution without antipyretics [^4b414581]. Hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette (covering coughs and sneezes) should be emphasized to prevent transmission [^4b414581].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Patients should be instructed to **return if symptoms worsen**, persist beyond 7–10 days, or if new symptoms develop (e.g. dyspnea, chest pain, confusion) [^notfound]. Persistent or worsening symptoms may indicate complications or alternative diagnoses and warrant further evaluation [^485c9bc9].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Antiviral therapy is recommended for pregnant women with suspected or confirmed influenza, regardless of symptom duration [^46da8f3c].

- **Children**: Antivirals are recommended for hospitalized children, those with severe or progressive illness, or those at high risk of complications [^b392da63].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Antiviral therapy is recommended due to higher risk of complications [^e7d789ef].

---

## Management of uncomplicated influenza

Management of uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy patients centers on **supportive care**, with antiviral therapy considered when initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset or in high-risk patients. Antibiotics are not indicated unless bacterial coinfection is suspected [^048518d8]. Patients should isolate until 24 hours after fever resolution and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or persist [^4b414581].

What treatments are available for influenza?

Influenza is usually self limiting in healthy individuals. Treatment of uncomplicated disease in healthy individuals is supportive and includes antipyretics, adequate fluid intake, rest, and staying off work or school until 24 hours after resolution of fever to limit spread to others.

Most randomised trials of antiviral drugs have been conducted among otherwise healthy individuals and have shown modest reductions in symptom duration (0.7 days). Fewer studies have been conducted among individuals at risk of complicated influenza. Data from observational studies and trials suggests that antiviral treatment may reduce adverse outcomes. For example, the meta-analysis from 2015 reported fewer lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics after oseltamivir treatment compared with placebo (risk difference −3.8%) and fewer hospital admissions (risk difference −1.1%).NICE, Public Health England, UK Chief Medical Officers, and the WHOrecommend treatment of suspected and confirmed influenza for individuals at risk of complicated influenza (box 1). General practitioners considering prescription of antivirals should discuss with patients likely benefits, as well as possible harms including nausea (number treated to cause nausea in one patient = 28)and vomiting (number treated to cause vomiting in one patient = 22).

Individuals with complicated influenza may be helped by antiviral treatment. Treatment is most effective if started within 48 hours of symptom onset, and it should not be delayed while awaiting results of investigations. Neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir inhibit viral release from infected cells and reduce the rate of viral replication. Meta-analysis of individual participant data found that, compared with late treatment, early treatment (within 48 hours of symptom onset) of hospitalised individuals with complicated influenza reduced the odds of mortality by 52%. Some individuals may require antibiotic therapy to treat secondary bacterial infections.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^df3037c6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Evidence summary — early neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) therapy in outpatients: Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that established the efficacy of NAIs in reducing the duration of fever and symptoms by approximately 1–2 days were conducted among mostly non–high-risk adult and pediatric outpatients with uncomplicated laboratory-confirmed influenza, enrolled within 36–48 hours of illness onset. Greater clinical benefit was reported when NAI treatment was started very early; in both adults and children, NAI treatment started within 6 hours of illness onset reduced symptoms by about 4 days. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate that early initiation (within 2 days of illness onset) of antiviral treatment can reduce the duration of fever and symptoms, especially in nonasthmatic children; decrease the risk of otitis media in children; and reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics and of hospitalization in adults.

### Healthcare system strategy for seasonal influenza implementation plan [^ab9fa251]. American Journal of Infection Control (2020). Medium credibility.

Healthcare systems are expanding, no longer bound by county, state or country, thus necessitating the importance of consistent and standardized guidelines for the management and control of communicable diseases, including influenza. As a healthcare system consisting of diverse facilities with a focus not only on safe patient care but also patient satisfaction, there was a clear need for a multifaceted approach to manage influenza across the system. This resulted in the development of a strategic plan for decision-making, depiction of data and dissemination of information at both a system- and local facility-level.

Seasonal influenza — viral shedding kinetics and timing of specimen collection: In most persons, infectious influenza virus levels in the upper respiratory tract of persons with uncomplicated influenza peak during the first 1–2 days after illness onset, and decline to undetectable levels within 1 week. Collection of upper respiratory tract specimens from immunocompetent outpatients with influenza > 3–4 days after illness onset may yield negative results because of substantially decreased influenza viral shedding, especially in older children and adults, although influenza viruses might be detectable in upper respiratory tract specimens for longer periods in some patients, particularly when molecular assays are used. Infants and young children and adults hospitalized with severe lower respiratory tract illness often shed influenza viruses for ≥ 1 week, and immunocompromised patients may have prolonged influenza virus replication and shed infectious influenza viruses for weeks to months, even when asymptomatic or without fever. The appropriate respiratory tract specimen to collect depends upon which influenza test is used and patient acceptability.

### Updated preparedness and response framework for influenza pandemics [^2ec7db4e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Influenza pandemics — CDC has updated its framework to describe influenza pandemic progression using six intervals (two prepandemic and four pandemic intervals) and eight domains, and this updated framework can be used for influenza pandemic planning and serves as recommendations for risk assessment, decision-making, and action in the United States. The six intervals are: 1) investigation of cases of novel influenza, 2) recognition of increased potential for ongoing transmission, 3) initiation of a pandemic wave, 4) acceleration of a pandemic wave, 5) deceleration of a pandemic wave, and 6) preparation for future pandemic waves; the eight domains are incident management, surveillance and epidemiology, laboratory, community mitigation, medical care and countermeasures, vaccine, risk communications, and state/local coordination. The updated framework replaces the U.S. federal government stages from the 2006 implementation plan for the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, has been aligned with the pandemic phases restructured in 2013 by the World Health Organization, and activities and decisions during a response are event-specific with these intervals serving as a reference for public health decision-making and not meant to be prescriptive or comprehensive.

What are the new findings?

There is limited availability of pandemic influenza CMGs globally, most were developed for upper-middle and higher-income settings.
Many CMGs were of limited quality and were produced more than 5 years ago, many during the H1N1 pandemic and only one had been updated since then.
There were limited, heterogeneous and at times contradictory recommendations on supportive care, and limited recommendations for different at-risk populations.
All CMGs recommended oseltamivir, but with variations in recommendations for pregnant women. Recommendations on additional neuraminidase inhibitors were conflicting, reflecting the limited evidence-base to support recommendations.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^c191ee4c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — testing and empiric treatment during community circulation: Confirmation of influenza virus infection by diagnostic testing is not required for decisions to prescribe antiviral medication, and initiation of empiric antiviral treatment should not be delayed while influenza testing results are pending; antiviral treatment is clinically most beneficial when started as close to illness onset as possible. All hospitalized patients with suspected influenza should be tested, and influenza testing may be used to inform decisions on use of antibiotics or continuation of antiviral medication, on need for further diagnostic tests, on consideration for home care, or on recommendations for ill persons living with others who are at high risk for influenza complications; influenza testing may be useful in order to inform decisions in infection control practices. Antiviral treatment is recommended for outpatients with suspected influenza who are at high risk for complications or those with progressive disease not requiring hospital admission, and antiviral treatment of outpatients who are not at high risk can be considered based upon clinical judgment if presenting within 2 days of illness onset.

Background

Influenza pandemics are one of the greatest global health threats, potentially causing millions of deaths and huge socioeconomic disruption. The ever-present threat of pandemic influenza and experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic emphasise the critical importance of pandemic preparedness.

The 1918 influenza pandemic, previously labelled "the deadliest pandemic of modern age", gave us an illustration of how fatal an influenza pandemic can be, with an estimated 50–100 million deaths globally. The more recent influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic, despite a lower case-fatality rate than predicted, reminded us of the risk to human health from a novel virus. Most recently, the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, with more than six million deaths reported (as of 11th May 2022), highlights our ongoing global vulnerability to emerging viral infections and a need to incorporate lessons learnt to strengthen our preparedness for future outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a reminder of how rapidly respiratory infections transmit globally, resulting in morbidity, mortality, economic, societal and health system disruptions. It has further demonstrated that we are still not adequately prepared for a pandemic global response, as the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board highlighted in October 2019.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^acb6d073]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza — epidemiology, burden, risk groups, and vaccine effectiveness indicate that in the United States during 2010–2016, the seasonal incidence of symptomatic influenza among all ages was approximately 8% and varied from 3% to 11%, and seasonal epidemics were associated each year with an estimated 4.3–16.7 million medical visits, 140 000–710 000 hospitalizations, and 12 000–56 000 respiratory and circulatory deaths; globally, modeling estimated 291 243–645 832 seasonal influenza–associated respiratory deaths annually. People at increased risk for severe and fatal influenza include children aged < 5 years (but especially < 2 years) and adults aged ≥ 65 years, among other high-risk groups. Appropriate diagnosis of influenza and timely use of antiviral medications may decrease unnecessary testing and empiric antibiotic use, duration of symptoms, hospitalization, the need for critical care, and mortality. Because influenza vaccine effectiveness is widely variable — approximately 40%–60% in well-matched seasons — a history of current season influenza vaccination does not exclude a diagnosis of influenza.

Seasonal influenza — adult dosing and duration — standardizes drug dosing for oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir, notes that oseltamivir requires dosage adjustment for reduced renal function and that zanamivir is an orally inhaled powder with limited systemic absorption excreted unchanged by the kidneys; duration of therapy for ambulatory adults with uncomplicated influenza is 5 days; in ambulatory adults, peramivir administered as a single intravenous (IV) dose is an alternative but is costlier; in hospitalized adults, oseltamivir is the preferred antiviral drug because data are very limited on inhaled zanamivir in severely ill influenza patients.

### Influenza [^7fc6c28a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Influenza is an acute viral respiratory disease that affects persons of all ages and is associated with millions of medical visits, hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and thousands of deaths during annual winter epidemics of variable severity in the United States. Elderly persons have the highest influenza-associated hospitalization and mortality rates. The primary method of prevention is annual vaccination. Early antiviral treatment has the greatest clinical benefit; otherwise, management includes adherence to recommended infection prevention and control measures as well as supportive care of complications.

What do the new findings imply?

The data highlight a need to ensure mechanisms for regular updates of pandemic influenza CMGs are considered at the development stage, to ensure publicly available CMGs are up to date, providing the best available evidence-based treatment and supportive care recommendations, for different at-risk populations.
The limited scope highlights a need for investments into trials to identify effective treatments and supportive care strategies to benefit patient care and outcomes.
A living guideline framework with mechanisms for integrating new evidence and dissemination, with close links between researchers and guideline developers from different settings, is needed to improve the quality, inclusivity, and availability of evidence-based care recommendations.
Further research is needed into the implementation of CMGs from development to the front line in different settings and contexts.

In accordance with World Health Organization guidelines, the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports designed a national plan to minimize effects of pandemic influenza. Within the scope of the Dutch pandemic preparedness plan, we were asked to estimate the magnitude of the problem in terms of the number of hospitalizations and deaths during an influenza pandemic. Using scenario analysis, we also examined the potential effects of intervention options. We describe and compare the scenarios developed to understand the potential impact of a pandemic (i.e., illness, hospitalizations, deaths), various interventions, and critical model parameters. Scenario analysis is a helpful tool for making policy decisions about the design and planning of outbreak control management on a national, regional, or local level.

State Procedures and Plans

Forty-nine states have Internet websites that include statewide pandemic influenza procedures and plans or, in a few instances, have simply addressed broad questions about state-based responses to pandemic influenza (Table A1). Often these plans, which are funded by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) preparedness cooperative agreement, were posted in the last half of 2005 or early 2006, and these documents are still largely in transition. US HHS has recently issued guidelines; however, specific planning, problem solving, and funding are still left to the individual states.

Almost all of the states' plans address a wide range of issues regarding command and control, surveillance, vaccination, antiviral drugs, communication, and emergency management and containment measures. The purpose of this review was to focus on community public health strategies, especially vaccination, surveillance and detection, and containment, which the various states develop as they refine their plans.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2020–2021 [^3b48afdf]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Antiviral treatment recommendations — pediatric influenza 2020–2021 — are applicable to infants and children with suspected influenza when viruses are circulating or when infection is confirmed, and oseltamivir (oral), zanamivir (inhaled), peramivir (IV), and baloxavir (oral) are FDA-approved for uncomplicated outpatient treatment; published data exist to support oseltamivir for hospitalized and high-risk children, and for more serious infections in immune compromised children, seeking the advice of an infectious diseases specialist is suggested. Regardless of influenza vaccination status, antiviral treatment should be offered as early as possible to any hospitalized child with suspected or confirmed influenza disease, any child with severe, complicated, or progressive illness attributable to influenza, and any influenza virus infection of any severity in children at high risk of complications, each regardless of duration of symptoms. Antiviral treatment may be considered for any previously healthy, symptomatic outpatient not at high risk if an influenza diagnosis is confirmed or suspected on clinical judgment, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset.

During influenza season, acute respiratory illness due to influenza is difficult to distinguish from other influenza-like illnesses, but testing should be reserved for situations when timely results will influence management or infection control measures. Immunization status and timing of disease onset notwithstanding, a neuraminidase inhibitor should be offered immediately for certain high-risk children; neuraminidase inhibitor treatment should be considered if shorter illness is warranted or an at-risk sibling may be protected. Antipyretics and cough control may be useful. Immunization with an age-appropriate dose of an inactivated influenza vaccine is the cornerstone of prevention for health care personnel and our patients.

### Reality check of laboratory service effectiveness during pandemic (H1N1) 2009, victoria, Australia [^6267805e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Pandemic Planning

Our planned algorithm for influenza A virus testing involved extraction of RNA from clinical specimens by using QIAxtractor or BioRobot Universal System extraction robots (each from QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA), followed by reverse transcription with random hexamers. cDNA was amplified in parallel assays by using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Foster City, CA, USA) and incorporating primers and probes selective for the matrix gene of influenza A viruses, including that of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, and for the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of that virus. (Sequences of all primers and probes used in these assays are available upon request to M.C.).

Our model of anticipated pandemic influenza testing comprised 2 phases. First, an initial peak of intense testing needed to identify early cases would result in > 500 additional PCRs being conducted each day for 2 weeks. Second, a step-down in demand with a focus on severe or atypical cases that needed testing for clinical management would result in ≈200 tests being conducted each day for several months. Implicit in the latter phase was that a clinical case definition would suffice for most uncomplicated influenza cases and that dominant circulation of the pandemic strain would enable a test result of "influenza A detected" from many laboratories to be a de facto diagnosis of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection. Some laboratory capacity would be reserved for outbreak monitoring by sentinel surveillance and detailed strain characterization. All routine diagnostic laboratory activity (≈1,000 tests/day) for diseases other than influenza would proceed routinely, but elective activities such as research would be delayed as needed.

To realize this pandemic plan, certain measures were undertaken at VIDRL. They were 1) assembly of enough nucleic acid extraction robotics and real-time PCR analyzers for > 500 daily PCRs, 2) recruitment and training of 2 additional scientists who could work in the testing laboratory during a major outbreak, 3) planning for the temporary reassignment of scientific staff with appropriate skills from other laboratory areas during an outbreak, 4) cross-training of secretarial and clerical staff to enter patient and specimen data into the laboratory information system, 5) manning of the laboratory telephone switchboard by clerical staff, and 6) creation of a small stockpile of essential laboratory reagents.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2025–2026: technical report [^1e52333d]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Antiviral therapy for children with influenza — The AAP, CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society recommend antiviral treatment for children with serious, complicated, or progressive disease presumptively or definitively caused by influenza, irrespective of influenza vaccination status or whether illness began > 48 hours before presentation. Earlier treatment provides better clinical responses, but treatment after 48 hours of symptoms in adults and children with moderate to severe disease or with progressive disease has been shown to provide some benefit and should be offered. The AAP recommends treatment of children at risk for severe complications of influenza, regardless of duration of symptoms. Otherwise healthy children with suspected or confirmed influenza and an uncomplicated presentation should be considered for antiviral medication, particularly if they are in contact with other children who are younger than 6 months or have high-risk conditions (including age < 5 years) when influenza viruses are known to be circulating in the community. Antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset and should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive influenza test result.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) seasonal influenza guideline (2018 update) — executive summary epidemiology and clinical impact: Seasonal influenza A and B virus epidemics are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with the seasonal incidence of symptomatic influenza among all ages in the United States during 2010–2016 approximately 8% and varying from 3% to 11%. During 2010–2018 in the United States, seasonal influenza epidemics were associated each year with an estimated 4.3–23 million medical visits, 140 000–960 000 hospitalizations, and 12 000–79 000 respiratory and circulatory deaths, while a modeling study estimated 291 243–645 832 seasonal influenza–associated respiratory deaths annually worldwide. Use of available diagnostic modalities and proper interpretation can accurately identify patients presenting with influenza; timely diagnosis may decrease unnecessary testing and antibiotic use, improve infection prevention and control measures, and increase appropriate antiviral use; early treatment with antivirals reduces symptom duration and the risk of some complications and hospitalization, and may decrease mortality among high-risk populations.

### Effect of double dose oseltamivir on clinical and virological outcomes in children and adults admitted to hospital with severe influenza: double blind randomised controlled trial [^0bb679f6]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Human influenza is often considered an acute self limiting febrile illness. Occasionally, however, it is associated with respiratory complications, admission to hospital, and mortality. Clinical trials have shown that treatment with oseltamivir has clinical and virological benefit in patients with uncomplicated influenza when it is administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Randomised trials in patients with severe influenza are lacking, but observational studies in patients admitted to hospital indicate that oseltamivir treatment, especially if it is given early, is associated with reduced mortality and shorter length of stay, although mortality can still be up to 6% with H1N1-pdm09 (pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza) or seasonal influenza. Timely oseltamivir treatment of patients with avian H5N1 influenza reduces mortality, but many patients die despite treatment.

Higher oseltamivir doses were tested in patients with uncomplicated influenza, but no consistently improved clinical or virological outcomes were found compared with the standard dose. Despite a lack of evidence, several authorities have suggested use of double dose oseltamivir for severe influenza. The use of higher doses has major implications for clinical management, public health, and planning for antiviral stockpiles. The sudden emergence of pandemic H1N1 virus in 2009, the persistent circulation of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses across large regions of the world since 1997, and the recent emergence and spread of avian H7N9 influenza virus in Chinaillustrate the continuing threat of influenza viruses to global health. Improvement of the evidence base for current treatment guidelines of severe influenza is clearly essential for optimal clinical management and pandemic preparedness. Consequently, we conducted a randomised controlled trial to ascertain whether double dose oseltamivir controls viral replication faster and improves clinical outcomes compared with standard dose in patients admitted to hospital with severe influenza.

Rationale for influenza antiviral treatment in children — treatment aims are 3-fold (reduce the duration of symptoms; reduce complication of influenza, including hospitalization and death; and potentially reduce transmission). Randomized clinical trials among outpatients with uncomplicated influenza have found that timely treatment (optimally ≤ 2 days from symptom onset) can reduce the duration of influenza symptoms and fever, and observational studies suggest that antivirals are safe and could reduce the risk of certain influenza complications, including hospitalization and death.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2015–2016 [^570578c5]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics influenza antiviral management — oseltamivir use and timing are outlined as follows: Treatment with oseltamivir for children with presumed serious, complicated, or progressive disease, irrespective of immunization status or whether illness began > 48 hours before admission, continues to be recommended by the AAP, CDC, and Infectious Diseases Society of America, and earlier treatment provides better clinical responses; treatment after 48 hours of symptoms in adults and children with moderate to severe disease or with progressive disease has been shown to provide some benefit and should be strongly considered. Children younger than 2 years are at an increased risk of hospitalization and complications; the FDA has licensed oseltamivir for children as young as 2 weeks of age, and AAP believes that oseltamivir can be used to treat influenza in both term and preterm infants from birth because benefits of therapy are likely to outweigh possible risks of treatment. In adverse event data, the only statistically-attributable adverse effect that was greater in 1- through 13-year-old children was vomiting (15% of treated versus 9% receiving placebo). A randomized, prospective trial with 75% of subjects younger than 15 years documented no benefit of double-dose therapy over standard-dose therapy. Clinical judgment is important, and antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset and should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive influenza test result.

### Populations at risk for severe or complicated influenza illness: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1ab42620]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Influenza is a major global cause of illness and death, resulting in an estimated three to five million cases of severe influenza illness and 250 000 to 500 000 deaths annually. The risk of complications from influenza, including lower respiratory tract infection, admission to hospital, and death vary depending on factors such as age and the type of comorbidity that may be present. Currently, the World Health Organization and most countries prioritise specific high risk groups for vaccination. Although some recommendations are consistent, such as vaccination of healthcare workers, pregnant women, and those with certain high risk conditions, there are also discrepancies, such as the age groups that need to be prioritised (table 1). Despite the widely accepted public health policy of recommending vaccination to groups believed to be at high risk for complications of influenza, a comprehensive and systematic review of the evidence defining these groups is lacking. Assessment of the quality of evidence supporting these risk groups and identifying the most important risk groups is essential when making decisions about the allocation of influenza vaccination and antiviral therapy, and planning about health system utilisation. We summarised this evidence for seasonal and pandemic influenza.

In a single urban US emergency department, the best predictive model for identifying influenza for all ages consisted of cough (diagnostic odds ratio [DOR], 5.87), fever (DOR, 4.49), rhinorrhea (DOR, 1.98), and myalgias (DOR, 1.44). In prospective studies, fever (temperature ≥ 38°C) and cough were significantly associated with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)–confirmed influenza, and in adults in Taiwan, fever and cough had the best sensitivity (86%), while fever, cough, and sneezing had the best specificity (77%) for influenza.

Influenza antivirals recommendations for 2019–2020 — Treatment recommendations for antiviral medications are applicable to infants and children with suspected influenza when viruses are known to be circulating in the community or when infection is confirmed by testing. Continuous monitoring of the epidemiology, change in severity, and resistance patterns by the CDC may lead to new guidance. Oseltamivir (oral), zanamivir (inhaled), peramivir (IV), and baloxavir (oral) are FDA approved for treatment of uncomplicated influenza virus infection in pediatric outpatients; published data exist to support the use of oseltamivir (oral) for hospitalized children and children at high risk. For more serious influenza virus infections, particularly in immune compromised children, seeking the advice of an infectious diseases specialist is suggested.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — antiviral timing and hospital admission management — Greatest clinical benefit was reported when antiviral treatment was started within 2 days of illness onset, but benefit was noted even when started in most patients 4–5 days and up to 7 days after illness onset, including when NAI treatment was started > 48 hours after illness onset; a meta-analysis in hospitalized A(H1N1)pdm09 cases suggested that antiviral treatment within 48 hours of illness onset was associated with lower mortality compared to later or no treatment. Early antiviral treatment of influenza in outpatients reduces the likelihood of antibiotic use or physician-diagnosed complications and may reduce secondary bacterial coinfection. For patients being admitted with suspected influenza, we recommend starting empiric antiviral treatment as soon as possible without waiting for influenza testing results.

### State plans for containment of pandemic influenza [^8a4927b0]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Implications

The control of future pandemic or interpandemic influenza will necessarily rely on each individual state's plan to vaccinate persons and detect and contain this disease. Still, the current national (HHS) pandemic influenza plan presents only a categorization and listing of steps, rather than explicit direction for the states. This lack of central coordination can result in a patchwork of plans that will not adequately detect and control this or other respiratory disease pandemics.

Given the lack of clear guidance, coupled with the fact that no one knows when an influenza pandemic may strike, what its characteristics will be, and the effectiveness and quantity of strain-specific vaccine, the evolving state plans are nonetheless in agreement in adhering generally to ACIP and HHS guidelines for prioritizing vaccination. In general, the elderly, those with chronic diseases, and healthcare and infrastructure personnel will be prioritized to receive vaccination, and in approximately one third of states, young children will be prioritized to be vaccinated. We believe the estimate that such persons make up ≈15%–20% of the population in any state is reasonable. However, this vaccination strategy is predicated on preventing deaths from influenza, not stopping or retarding an epidemic or pandemic. Given that vaccine adequate to cover the entire US population will not be available for several more years, the goal of reducing transmission would require much more vaccination than is available.

Regarding surveillance and detection, state plans are even more variable than they are about strategizing vaccinations. All states indicate that they plan to use the NSPS network and the nationwide 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System. In NSPS, each year ≈1,100 (55%) of ≈2,000 healthcare providers nationwide voluntarily report the number of weekly outpatient visits for ILI and submit specimens from a subset of patients to state public health laboratories for influenza virus testing. The 122 city-specific mortality reporting is unavoidably even more delayed. Neither system would likely detect a local outbreak of influenza < 2 weeks into its establishment. Thus, some state and federal authorities are assessing the utility of syndromic surveillance of ILI (e.g. cough, headache, and fever) in emergency departments and clinics in test cities. Several such programs exist, and CDC's BioSense includes plans to expand such early surveillance to 300 clinical sites. However, to our knowledge, no health authority feels confident that earlier detection of influenza by 1 to 3 weeks would necessarily lead to better control or substantial retardation of an outbreak.

Seasonal influenza — definitions for surveillance and clinical terms include that influenza season refers to the surveillance period when influenza activity typically occurs, such as during October through May, in the United States; influenza activity is defined as the circulation of seasonal influenza A and B viruses among persons in the local community, with high influenza activity defined as high circulation during the colder fall, winter, and spring months and low influenza activity defined as low or lack of circulation such as during the warm summer months. Acute respiratory illness is defined as infection of either the upper or lower respiratory tract with respiratory symptoms, with or without fever; influenza-like illness (ILI) is defined as acute respiratory illness with fever and either cough or sore throat; influenza refers to symptomatic illness caused by seasonal influenza A or B virus infection; respiratory distress is defined as difficulty in breathing usually associated with an increased respiratory rate and use of accessory muscles of breathing; and laboratory-confirmed influenza is defined as acute respiratory illness with laboratory testing evidence of influenza virus infection.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — vaccination status, immunocompromised hosts, and treatment initiation — Annual influenza vaccination can prevent influenza, but influenza vaccine effectiveness has ranged from low to moderate in preventing medically attended outpatient visits and hospitalizations, and may have lower effectiveness in immunocompromised patients, who may also experience prolonged influenza viral replication. A history of current season influenza vaccination does not exclude a diagnosis of influenza in either immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients. Therefore, antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible in hospitalized patients, high-risk persons, and those with severe or progressive disease if influenza is suspected, irrespective of receipt of influenza vaccine.

### Evaluation and management of seasonal influenza in the emergency department [^4deed636]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Seasonal influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality, primarily due to increased complication rates among the elderly population and patients with chronic diseases. Timely diagnosis of influenza and early recognition of an influenza outbreak or epidemic are key components in preventing influenza-related complications, hospitalizations, and deaths. Emergency departments are the most frequent points of entry for most influenza cases and are well positioned to identify and manage influenza community outbreaks and epidemics. Emergency departments need specific infection control measures to curb the spread of influenza in the Emergency Department and hospital during the influenza season.

### When should a diagnosis of influenza be considered in adults requiring intensive care unit admission? Results of population-based active surveillance in toronto [^22b23811]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Optimal management of severe influenza depends on the ability to recognize those patients admitted to the ICU who require empiric therapy and additional precautions for influenza pending the results of diagnostic testing.

- Influenza testing, empiric antiviral therapy and empiric infection control precautions should be considered in the small proportion of patients admitted during influenza season with a diagnosis of pneumonia or respiratory infection and who are either febrile or admitted during weeks of peak influenza activity.

- Although identification of patients may be improved with the application of this simple rule, a significant proportion of patients with influenza infection will be missed. Further research is needed with regard to strategies for improved identification of influenza patients admitted with atypical presentations.

Hospitalized patients — diagnostic testing during influenza activity and low activity — Clinicians should test for influenza on admission in all patients requiring hospitalization with acute respiratory illness, including pneumonia, with or without fever (A-II). Clinicians should test for influenza on admission in all patients with acute worsening of chronic cardiopulmonary disease (eg, COPD, asthma, coronary artery disease, or congestive heart failure), as influenza can be associated with exacerbation of underlying conditions (A-III). Clinicians should test for influenza on admission in all patients who are immunocompromised or at high risk of complications and present with acute onset of respiratory symptoms with or without fever, as the manifestations of influenza in such patients are frequently less characteristic than in immunocompetent individuals (A-III). Clinicians should test for influenza in all patients who, while hospitalized, develop acute onset of respiratory symptoms with or without fever, or respiratory distress, without a clear alternative diagnosis (A-III). During periods of low influenza activity, clinicians should test for influenza on admission in all patients requiring hospitalization with acute respiratory illness, with or without fever, who have an epidemiological link to a person diagnosed with influenza, an influenza outbreak or outbreak of acute febrile respiratory illness of uncertain cause, or who recently traveled from an area with known influenza activity (A-II).

Outpatients (including emergency department patients) during influenza activity (defined as the circulation of seasonal influenza A and B viruses among persons in the local community) have the following testing recommendations: Clinicians should test for influenza in high-risk patients, including immunocompromised persons who present with influenza-like illness, pneumonia, or nonspecific respiratory illness (eg, cough without fever) if the testing result will influence clinical management (A-III). Clinicians should test for influenza in patients who present with acute onset of respiratory symptoms with or without fever, and either exacerbation of chronic medical conditions (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], heart failure) or known complications of influenza (eg, pneumonia) if the testing result will influence clinical management (A-III). Clinicians can consider influenza testing for patients not at high risk for influenza complications who present with influenza-like illness, pneumonia, or nonspecific respiratory illness and who are likely to be discharged home if the result will influence antiviral treatment decisions or reduce use of unnecessary antibiotics, further diagnostic testing, and time in the emergency department, or if results might influence treatment or chemoprophylaxis decisions for high-risk household contacts (C-III).

Assessment and treatment algorithm for pregnant individuals with suspected or confirmed respiratory infection emphasizes early empiric therapy and risk‑based triage. Pregnant and postpartum individuals are at significantly higher risk of serious complications related to seasonal and pandemic influenza infections compared with nonpregnant people. Clinicians should initiate empiric antiviral treatment as soon as possible, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset, for all pregnant individuals with suspected influenza, and antiviral treatment should not be delayed while awaiting respiratory infection test results. Respiratory virus symptoms may include fever ≥ 38°C (100.4°F), and if a patient does not report fever but has abrupt onset of symptoms suggestive of respiratory infection, proceed with the algorithm. When available, test for influenza and COVID-19 infection, but Do not rely on test results to initiate treatment; treat presumptively based on clinical evaluation. High Risk: Recommend patient immediately seek care in an emergency department or equivalent unit that treats pregnant individuals; when possible, send patient to a setting where they can be isolated; consider admitting patient to critical care unit; treatment should follow CDC guidelines. Moderate Risk: See patient as soon as possible in an ambulatory setting with resources to determine severity of illness; when possible, send patient to a setting where they can be isolated; clinical assessment for respiratory compromise includes physical examination and tests such as pulse oximetry, chest x-ray, or ABGs as clinically indicated; if there is respiratory compromise or complications, admit patient for further evaluation and treatment. Low Risk: Plan for follow-up within 24–48 hours.

Background

Annual seasonal influenza epidemics of variable severity result in significant morbidity and mortality in the United States (U.S.) and worldwide. In temperate climate countries, including the U.S. influenza activity peaks during the winter months whereas in tropical regions influenza activity may be more variable. Most persons with symptomatic influenza virus infection have self-limited uncomplicated upper respiratory tract illness. One study estimated that during 2010–2016, approximately 8.3% of the U.S. population experienced symptomatic influenza each year. However, complications may result in severe illness, including fatal outcomes. During 2010–2018, an estimated 4.3–23 million medical visits, 140,000–960,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000–79,000 deaths were associated with influenza each year in the U.S. Another study estimated that 18,000–96,000 influenza-related intensive care unit (ICU) admissions occur annually in the U.S. There are an estimated 291,000–646,000 respiratory deaths attributed to seasonal influenza each year worldwide. Here, we review strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of influenza virus infections in the ICU (Table 1).

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2022–2023 [^b392da63]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Influenza in children — antiviral treatment indications and timing: The AAP, CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society recommend treatment with oseltamivir for children with serious, complicated, or progressive disease irrespective of vaccination status and even if illness began > 48 hours before presentation. Earlier treatment provides better responses, but treatment after 48 hours in outpatients with moderate to severe or progressive disease has been shown to provide some benefit and should be offered. The AAP recommends treatment of children at risk for severe complications regardless of duration of symptoms, noting that children younger than 2 years are at increased risk of hospitalization and complications. Antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset and should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive influenza test result. The FDA has approved oseltamivir for treatment of children as young as 2 weeks of age. Otherwise healthy children with suspected uncomplicated influenza should be considered for antiviral medication, particularly if they are in contact with children younger than 6 months or with high-risk conditions, including age < 5 years, when influenza viruses are circulating in the community.

### Influenza antiviral medications: summary for clinicians… [^88a802c5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Decisions about starting antiviral treatment for patients with suspected influenza should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection. Empiric antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible in the above priority groups. Clinicians can consider early empiric antiviral treatment of non-higher-risk outpatients with suspected influenza based upon clinical judgment if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset.
- Patients at higher risk for influenza complications should be advised to call their provider as soon as possible if they have acute respiratory illness symptoms for consideration of infection with influenza A or B viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory pathogens.
- Clinicians can consider starting early empiric antiviral treatment of non-higher-risk outpatients with suspected influenza, based upon clinical judgment, including without an office visit. SARS-CoV-2 and other etiologies of acute respiratory illness should also be considered.
- The recommended treatment course for uncomplicated influenza is two doses per day of oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir for 5 days, or one dose of intravenous peramivir or oral baloxavir for 1 day.
- While influenza vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza illness, a history of influenza vaccination does not rule out the possibility of influenza virus infection in an ill patient with clinical signs and symptoms compatible with influenza. Figure: Guide for considering influenza testing and treatment when influenza viruses are circulating in the community 1.
- Meta-analyses of randomized controlled clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of early initiation of treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors in reducing duration of fever and illness symptoms compared with placebo in otherwise healthy children and adults with uncomplicated influenza. Treatment should be started as soon as possible after symptom onset for the greatest clinical benefit. Chemoprophylaxis: Recommended duration is 7 days. For control of outbreaks in institutional settings and hospitals, CDC recommends antiviral chemoprophylaxis of exposed residents with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir for a minimum of 2 weeks and continuing up to 1 week after the last known case was identified.

### Influenza virus-related critical illness: prevention, diagnosis, treatment [^ed06b52b]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Persons with uncomplicated influenza typically experience acute onset of respiratory symptoms (cough, rhinorrhea, congestion), myalgias, and headache with or without fever. During influenza season, clinicians should also consider influenza when there is only fever present or in patients who are afebrile and have respiratory symptoms. Complications of influenza vary by age, underlying comorbidities or high-risk conditions such as pregnancy, and immune function; elderly and immunocompromised persons may not always manifest fever. Critically ill patients may be admitted with respiratory or multi-organ failure, exacerbation of an underlying condition such as chronic lung disease, heart failure, or other extrapulmonary complications including stroke, encephalopathy, or encephalitis.

Influenza testing is recommended for all patients requiring hospitalization with suspected influenza, including those admitted to the ICU during influenza season with acute respiratory illness and community-acquired pneumonia, without a clear alternative diagnosis. Furthermore, all individuals requiring critical care outside of influenza season should be tested for influenza if there is a possible epidemiological link to an individual with recent influenza, such as travel to areas with influenza activity or exposure to an institutional influenza outbreak. Special consideration should be given to elderly and immunocompromised patients, as influenza virus infection may not present with typical acute respiratory illness signs and symptoms (e.g. absence of fever). The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2018 Influenza Clinical Practice Guidelines also recommend influenza testing for patients at high risk of complications such as exacerbation of chronic cardiopulmonary disease. Diagnosis of influenza should be made as soon as possible in critically ill patients, and initiation of antiviral treatment should not be delayed while awaiting results of diagnostic tests. Studies have reported an increase in mortality of ICU patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection when diagnosis was delayed, and shorter hospital length of stay when antiviral treatment was initiated within 6 h of admission.
