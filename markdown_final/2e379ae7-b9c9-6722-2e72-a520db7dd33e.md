## Question

A 45-year-old woman is diagnosed with a 4 cm right adrenal mass after presenting with episodic headaches, palpitations, and hypertension. Biochemical testing confirms elevated plasma metanephrines, consistent with pheochromocytoma. She is scheduled for elective laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Her blood pressure is currently 160/100 mmHg, and her heart rate is 98 bpm. The surgical team asks you to advise on preoperative medical management to minimize perioperative complications.

According to current guidelines, what is the recommended approach to preoperative adrenergic blockade in this patient, and what is the rationale for the sequence of medications if both alpha- and beta-blockers are considered?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about preoperative adrenergic blockade for a 45-year-old woman with a 4 cm pheochromocytoma, including the recommended approach, the rationale for sequencing alpha- before beta-blockade, and practical targets and alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and why blockade matters. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines recommend for timing and agent selection. Next, I will examine the evidence comparing selective versus nonselective alpha-blockers. After that, I need to check the rationale for alpha-first sequencing and exceptions. Finally, I will translate this into concrete preoperative targets, monitoring, and contingency plans, while acknowledging controversies and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pathophysiology. Pheochromocytomas secrete catecholamines that cause vasoconstriction, hypertension, and tachycardia; without preparation, anesthesia and tumor manipulation can trigger hypertensive crises, arrhythmias, and profound post-resection hypotension, so the goal of preoperative blockade is to blunt these surges and stabilize hemodynamics intra- and postoperatively [^6ef53bda] [^5c4123d1].

> Next, I should review guideline direction on whether blockade is mandatory. The Endocrine Society and NCCN recommend preoperative alpha-adrenergic blockade for all hormonally active pheochromocytomas for 7–14 days to prevent perioperative cardiovascular complications, with volume repletion and a high-salt diet to mitigate post-resection hypotension. AAES similarly recommends alpha-blockade for at least 7 days and supports either selective or nonselective agents, noting trade-offs in intra- versus postoperative hemodynamics [^6ef53bda] [^f27030ad] [^5810b983].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about agent choice. I need to check comparative data. Historically, nonselective, irreversible alpha-1/2 blockade with phenoxybenzamine has been favored for its noncompetitive antagonism during catecholamine surges, but it carries more postoperative hypotension. Selective alpha-1 blockers like doxazosin are shorter-acting and reversible, with less postoperative hypotension but more intraoperative hypertension. The PRESCRIPT randomized trial found no difference in cumulative time outside blood pressure targets between phenoxybenzamine and doxazosin, though phenoxybenzamine reduced intraoperative hypertensive spikes and overall hemodynamic instability, without increasing postoperative complications when volume was optimized [^c663a500] [^46a0236c] [^b2b8f6f7].

> Wait, let me verify the practical implications of that trade-off. Observational and propensity-matched studies suggest nonselective blockade reduces intraoperative hypertension but increases postoperative hypotension, whereas selective blockade does the opposite. Importantly, AAES notes no significant differences in morbidity or mortality between strategies, so agent selection can be individualized based on team experience, availability, and patient risk profile, with explicit planning for intraoperative vasodilators or postoperative pressors as needed [^b2b8f6f7] [^15dc9c54] [^887c09f2].

> I need to ensure the sequence rationale is sound. Beta-blockers should never be started before adequate alpha-blockade because unopposed alpha-mediated vasoconstriction can precipitate hypertensive crisis. Once alpha-blockade is established for several days, beta-blockers can be added to control tachycardia or tachyarrhythmias, ideally using a beta-1 selective agent and avoiding combined alpha/beta blockers like labetalol early on due to their beta predominance and potential to worsen vasoconstriction if alpha-blockade is incomplete [^2878f8f2] [^f27030ad] [^4e300183].

> Let me think about concrete preoperative targets and monitoring. Most guidelines advise achieving seated blood pressure less than 130/80 mmHg and heart rate around 60–70 bpm seated, recognizing that strict upright targets can be impractical and may herald excessive blockade. Clinically, titration to mild orthostatic hypotension with stable supine blood pressure is a pragmatic endpoint, and patients should receive generous salt and fluids to expand volume and reduce post-resection hypotension risk [^6b39e43d] [^1dfa6477] [^a35757e2].

> But wait, what if we cannot reach targets or the patient is high risk. I should double-check alternatives and contingencies. If alpha-blockade is insufficient, add a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or metyrosine to blunt catecholamine synthesis. Intraoperatively, anticipate hypertensive surges during induction, intubation, pneumoperitoneum, and tumor manipulation, and be ready with nitroprusside, nicardipine, or phentolamine for blood pressure control and esmolol for tachyarrhythmias. After the adrenal vein is ligated, be prepared for abrupt hypotension requiring fluids and norepinephrine, with some patients needing pressor support for hours to days [^f27030ad] [^97e9d7bf] [^d43bbad8].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and acknowledge controversies. A meta-analysis of retrospective comparative studies found no clear benefit of preoperative alpha-blockade versus no blockade on hard outcomes, and contemporary series show low mortality with variable blockade practices. Nonetheless, most high-credibility guidelines continue to recommend alpha-blockade given physiologic rationale and decades of experience, while recognizing that randomized placebo-controlled data are unlikely and that individualized, protocolized care is key [^50f57b80] [^3c5c2cd7] [^6ef53bda].

> Putting this together for this patient, I would initiate alpha-blockade now, favoring phenoxybenzamine if available and acceptable given its noncompetitive profile, or doxazosin if a shorter-acting, reversible agent is preferred. I would titrate over 10–14 days to seated blood pressure under 130/80 mmHg and heart rate around 60–70 bpm, accepting mild orthostatic symptoms, while encouraging a high-salt diet and 1–2 liters of oral fluids daily. If tachycardia persists after 3–5 days of alpha-blockade, I would add a beta-1 selective blocker such as metoprolol, and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled, I would add a calcium channel blocker or metyrosine. On the day of surgery, I would continue the alpha-blocker, avoid starting new beta-blockade, and ensure invasive arterial monitoring with a plan for aggressive management of hypertensive surges and post-resection hypotension [^6ef53bda] [^f27030ad] [^b2b8f6f7].

---

Preoperative alpha-blockade is **essential** for all patients with pheochromocytoma to prevent intraoperative hypertensive crises [^6ef53bda] [^f27030ad]. Start **alpha-blockade 7–14 days preoperatively** [^6ef53bda] and titrate to seated blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg with mild orthostasis [^6b39e43d]; use phenoxybenzamine (nonselective) or doxazosin (selective) based on availability and patient factors [^b2b8f6f7]. Add a **beta-blocker only after adequate alpha-blockade** [^2878f8f2] to control tachycardia, and avoid beta-blockade alone due to risk of unopposed alpha-mediated vasoconstriction [^f27030ad]. Liberal salt and fluids help counter catecholamine-induced volume contraction and reduce postoperative hypotension [^1dfa6477]. This sequence minimizes perioperative hypertensive surges and facilitates safer laparoscopic adrenalectomy [^c663a500].

---

## Rationale for preoperative adrenergic blockade

Pheochromocytomas secrete catecholamines, causing episodic hypertension, tachycardia, and arrhythmias; surgical manipulation can trigger massive catecholamine release, leading to **life-threatening hypertensive crises** [^5c4123d1]. Preoperative alpha-blockade reduces this risk by blunting alpha-mediated vasoconstriction and stabilizing hemodynamics [^6ef53bda].

---

## Recommended preoperative alpha-blockade

- **Initiation**: Start alpha-blockade 7–14 days before surgery [^6ef53bda] to allow blood pressure normalization and volume repletion [^1dfa6477].

- **Agents**: Phenoxybenzamine (nonselective, irreversible) or doxazosin (selective, reversible) are both acceptable; phenoxybenzamine may offer more stable intraoperative control, while doxazosin is shorter-acting and may cause less postoperative hypotension [^b2b8f6f7] [^c663a500].

- **Titration**: Titrate to seated blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg with mild orthostatic hypotension, indicating adequate blockade [^6b39e43d].

- **Duration**: Continue until the day of surgery, with the last dose given the morning of the procedure [^notfound].

---

## Role of beta-blockade

Beta-blockers control tachycardia and arrhythmias but should be started only after **adequate alpha-blockade** to avoid unopposed alpha-mediated vasoconstriction and hypertensive crisis [^2878f8f2]. Typically, begin beta-blockade 2–3 days after alpha-blockade is established, using a beta-1 selective agent (e.g. metoprolol) if tachycardia persists [^2878f8f2].

---

## Volume repletion and dietary considerations

Catecholamine excess causes **volume contraction**; liberal salt intake and fluids (1–2 L/day) [^1dfa6477] help restore intravascular volume and reduce postoperative hypotension. Some centers give 1–2 L IV crystalloid pre-induction, though evidence is mixed and should be individualized [^a35757e2] [^45886b97].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting current recommendations

- **PRESCRIPT RCT**: Phenoxybenzamine and doxazosin achieved similar time outside blood pressure targets; phenoxybenzamine reduced intraoperative hypertensive spikes, suggesting better alpha-blockade during surges [^c663a500] [^46a0236c].

- **Meta-analyses**: Preoperative alpha-blockade reduces intraoperative hypertensive episodes and improves hemodynamic stability, though mortality differences are not clearly established [^notfound].

- **Guidelines**: AAES, Endocrine Society, and NCCN endorse alpha-blockade for all functional pheochromocytomas, with beta-blockade as adjuncts for tachycardia control [^b2b8f6f7] [^6ef53bda] [^f27030ad].

---

## Potential risks and complications of inadequate preoperative blockade

Inadequate alpha-blockade increases **intraoperative hypertensive crises**, arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia, and is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular complications and ICU admission. Post-resection hypotension is more pronounced without preoperative volume repletion and alpha-blockade [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Alpha-blockade | - Initiate 7–14 days preoperatively <br/> - Titrate to seated BP < 130/80 mmHg with mild orthostasis <br/> - Continue to day of surgery [^6ef53bda] [^6b39e43d] |
| Beta-blockade | - Start 2–3 days after adequate alpha-blockade <br/> - Use beta-1 selective agents if tachycardia persists [^2878f8f2] |
| Volume repletion | - Liberal salt and fluids (1–2 L/day) <br/> - Consider 1–2 L IV crystalloid pre-induction if needed [^1dfa6477] [^a35757e2] |

Preoperative alpha-blockade is the cornerstone of pheochromocytoma preparation, with beta-blockade added only after alpha-blockade and volume repletion to mitigate perioperative hypertensive crises and facilitate safe laparoscopic adrenalectomy [^6ef53bda] [^f27030ad].

highest for plasma free metanephrines using receiver operating characteristic curves. Combining different tests did not improve the diagnostic yield beyond that of a single test of plasma free metanephrines. Conclusion Plasma free metanephrines provide the best test for excluding or confirming pheochromocytoma and should be the test of first choice for diagnosis of the. tumor. Pheochromocytomas are chromaffin cell tumors typically arising in the adrenal glands and characterized by excessive production of catecholamines, often leading to increased blood pressure and symptoms of catecholamine excess. If not diagnosed or if left untreated, the excessive secretion of catecholamines by these tumors can have devastating consequences. Thus, although pheochromocytomas. are rare tumors, they must be considered in many patients with hypertension, the latter representing up to a quarter of the adult population in Western countries.

The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma depends crucially on demonstration of excessive production of catecholamines. 1, 2 This step, however, is fraught with difficulties, in particular false-negative. This study examined the diagnostic utility of several biochemical tests in large populations of patients tested for pheochromocytoma because of suggestive signs and symptoms or a predisposition to develop the tumor.

Pheochromocytoma preoperative care — alpha blockade and volume optimization are outlined as follows: In patients with preoperative signs, symptoms, and biochemical evidence of catecholamine excess, alpha-adrenergic blockade should be initiated at least 10 days before surgery; an initial dose of 10 mg PO BID can be titrated upward with regimens of 10–20 mg TID; many have transitioned to shorter acting alpha blockers such as doxazosin; some authors advocate combining alpha blockers with metyrosine, and early data suggest this combination may limit intraoperative hemodynamic instability more than alpha blockade alone; the clinical endpoint is control of hypertension, with adequate blockade confirmed by increasing the dosage until mild orthostatic hypotension; beta-adrenergic blockade should be initiated only after adequate alpha blockade; patients with alpha blockade-induced orthostatic hypotension should receive oral and/or intravenous volume loading during the 24–48 hours before surgery; and all patients should be given 1–2 liters of intravenous crystalloid solution before induction of general anesthesia on the day of surgery.

### The determination of real fluid requirements in laparoscopic resection of pheochromocytoma using minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring: a prospectively designed trial [^45886b97]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

It cannot be excluded that reduction in SVRI in PCC patients is at least partially influenced by preoperative alpha adrenoreceptor blockade, as shown by Groeben et al. Although no patient in the present study received an alpha blocker on the day of surgery, individual pharmacodynamics could be responsible for the duration and amount of the postoperative effect, as the duration of phenoxybenzamine action may vary and depends on the velocity of alpha receptor resynthetization. Advanced low-invasive hemodynamic monitoring may also assist in identifying these patients during operation with prolonged reduction in SVR who might profit most from advanced postoperative care.

Our data suggest that there is no rationale for preoperative fluid therapy as recommended in guidelines or even excessive fluid administration (up to 6 l of saline 0.9% within 48 h preoperatively have been reported even recently). Normalizing hypertension with antihypertensive drugs (in our trial, treatment was started at least 3 weeks before surgery) should help "normalize" fluid status, if at all altered. Therefore, there is no rationale for any additional infusion therapy before surgery, as it is well understood that unnecessary administration of crystalloid fluids (especially saline) may have detrimental effects as well. The results of this trial thereby again underline that targeted and individualized volume management — increasingly claimed in general — is essential but even more important for patients with cardiovascular abnormalities (such as catecholamine excess).

The fact is to be kept in mind that intraoperative courses may prove totally uneventful or definitively turbulent in PCC patients.

Closely monitoring the extremely diverse hemodynamic course during PCC surgery using minimally invasive techniques may help optimize and standardize anesthesiology management and could avoid unnecessary or even harmful liberal use of fluids.

Although this trial was designed as an exploratory study and the small sample size may thus be a limitation, its strengths are its prospective and standardized study design and that the controls received the same surgery with an identical anesthetic protocol performed by the same anesthetist, thereby minimizing confounders. Therefore, providing a higher level of evidence than previous retrospective trials, our results may induce a critical reflexion of current perioperative concepts in perioperative management for laparoscopic adrenalectomy in PCC. Based on our preliminary data, a prospective randomized trial could compare different fluid management strategies regarding hemodynamic stability and outcomes in a larger number of PCC patients.

### Comparison of two preoperative medical management strategies for laparoscopic resection of pheochromocytoma [^df70157a]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the intraoperative and postoperative course of patients undergoing laparoscopic pheochromocytoma resection at 2 institutions (Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic) with differing approaches to preoperative preparation. Patients undergoing adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma typically undergo a preoperative preparation to normalize their blood pressure and intravascular volume. However, no consensus has been reached regarding the best preoperative preparation regimen.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed of 50 Mayo Clinic patients and 37 Cleveland Clinic patients who had undergone laparoscopic pheochromocytoma resection. Mayo Clinic predominantly used the long-lasting nonselective alpha(1,2) antagonist phenoxybenzamine, and Cleveland Clinic predominately used selective alpha(1) blockade. Data regarding the intraoperative hemodynamics and postoperative complications were collected.

Results

Almost all patients at Mayo Clinic received phenoxybenzamine (98%). At Cleveland Clinic, the predominant treatment (65%) was selective alpha(1) blockade (doxazosin, terazosin, or prazosin). Intraoperatively, patients at Cleveland Clinic had a greater maximal systolic blood pressure (209 ± 44 mm Hg versus 187 ± 30 mm Hg, P = 0.011) and had received a greater amount of intravenous crystalloid (median 5000, interquartile range 3400–6400, versus median 2977, interquartile range 2000–3139; P < .010) and colloid (median 1000, interquartile range 500–1000, versus median 0, interquartile range 0–0; P < .001). At Mayo Clinic, more patients had received phenylephrine (56.0% versus 27.0%, P = 0.009). No differences were found in the postoperative surgical outcomes, and the hospital stay was comparable between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

Differences in the preoperative preparation and intraoperative management were associated with differences in intraoperative hemodynamics but not with clinically significant outcomes in patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma at 2 large tertiary care centers.

### Laparoscopic surgery for pheochromocytoma [^821af0b4]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Because of the excessive production of catecholamines, surgery for pheochromocytoma carries a certain risk that can be reduced by accurate preoperative evaluation and by pretreatment with alpha-blockers. The authors' experience and that of other groups suggests that this inherent risk is not enhanced by the laparoscopic approach, and that, following successful surgery, patients benefit from the minimal invasiveness of this technique. Most surgeons recommend the transperitoneal approach that allows direct access to the adrenal vein, facilitating early ligation. This recommendation does not apply to other pathologies of the adrenal gland. Bilateral adrenal tumors are only seen in patients with familial pheochromocytomas. In this setting, adrenal-sparing surgery should be considered, which can also be performed laparoscopically. Previous adrenal surgery is not a contraindication but will render the procedure more difficult. Laparoscopic excision of paragangliomas is also technically feasible. Laparoscopic adrenal surgery for pheochromocytoma is a difficult and demanding task that must be performed by an experienced surgeon in cooperation with a team of specialists including an internist, endocrinologist, and anesthesiologist.

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: executive summary [^ab7df6ff]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Adrenalectomy is the definitive treatment for multiple adrenal abnormalities. Advances in technology and genomics and an improved understanding of adrenal pathophysiology have altered operative techniques and indications.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations to enhance the appropriate, safe, and effective approaches to adrenalectomy.

Evidence Review

A multidisciplinary panel identified and investigated 7 categories of relevant clinical concern to practicing surgeons. Questions were structured in the framework Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparison, and Outcome, and a guided review of medical literature from PubMed and/or Embase from 1980 to 2021 was performed. Recommendations were developed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology and were discussed until consensus, and patient advocacy representation was included.

Findings

Patients with an adrenal incidentaloma 1 cm or larger should undergo biochemical testing and further imaging characterization. Adrenal protocol computed tomography (CT) should be used to stratify malignancy risk and concern for pheochromocytoma. Routine scheduled follow-up of a nonfunctional adrenal nodule with benign imaging characteristics and unenhanced CT with Hounsfield units less than 10 is not suggested. When unilateral disease is present, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is recommended for patients with primary aldosteronism or autonomous cortisol secretion. Patients with clinical and radiographic findings consistent with adrenocortical carcinoma should be treated at high-volume multidisciplinary centers to optimize outcomes, including, when possible, a complete R0 resection without tumor disruption, which may require en bloc radical resection. Selective or nonselective α blockade can be used to safely prepare patients for surgical resection of paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma. Empirical perioperative glucocorticoid replacement therapy is indicated for patients with overt Cushing syndrome, but for patients with mild autonomous cortisol secretion, postoperative day 1 morning cortisol or cosyntropin stimulation testing can be used to determine the need for glucocorticoid replacement therapy. When patient and tumor variables are appropriate, we recommend minimally invasive adrenalectomy over open adrenalectomy because of improved perioperative morbidity. Minimally invasive adrenalectomy can be achieved either via a retroperitoneal or transperitoneal approach depending on surgeon expertise, as well as tumor and patient characteristics.

Conclusions and Relevance

Twenty-six clinically relevant and evidence-based recommendations are provided to assist surgeons with perioperative adrenal care.

### Laparoscopic adrenalectomy of pheochromocytoma following management of severe aortic stenosis with transcatheter aortic valve replacement under monitored anesthesia care sedation: a case report [^26e0bc8d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Preoperative optimization of patients with active pheochromocytomas involves the use of alpha-1 and beta-1 inhibition to mediate the symptoms of their excess catecholamines. However, knowing when they have reached optimization can be difficult due to the variability of pheochromocytoma presentation and the wide array of effects on different organ systems. Furthermore, management can vary based on each patient's characteristics and comorbidities. The physiologic end-points of an optimized pre-operative management still remains unclear. Current arbitrary goals include: blood pressure control for a minimum of 3–5 days, SBP < 130 mmHg, DBP < 80 mmHg, heartrate < 60 beats/min, no evidence of orthostatic hypotension with blood pressure < 80/45 mmHg, no ST-T wave changes on ECG, and Hct < 45. However, patients should also be closely monitored for end-organ damage due to excessive catecholamine release with the heart being the most commonly affected organ. This makes the goals of optimization more difficult in a patient with cardiovascular compromise, as the case with our patient. Ultimately, the patient presentation, their individual factors, and a judicious clinical decision will drive a personalized and optimized set point of when they are permitted for surgery.

Severe aortic stenosis in the setting of a pheochromocytoma remains a high-risk situation requiring a multidisciplinary discussion to plan the safest treatment option for each patient. While it has become a recommended guideline to treat severe AS in patients with severe systemic diseases, the distinctive feature of our case was the anesthesia choice of monitored anesthesia care for a TAVR prior to a laparoscopic adrenalectomy. This case demonstrated the successful usage of TAVR under MAC, which reduced the patient's hemodynamic instability from their pheochromocytoma complicated by severe aortic stenosis. This case report's anesthetic approach and order of clinical decisions led to the patient ultimately experiencing no significant intraperioperative and postoperative complications following both procedures.

### Side-specific factors for intraoperative hemodynamic instability in laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma: a comparative study [^f65e9ca8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Perioperative approaches

All patients underwent a standard operating procedure (SOPS) according to the guidelines. All patients with pheochromocytoma commenced preoperative pharmacological preparations with doxazosin or Bunazocin (a selective alpha-blocker) at an initial dose of 2 mg/day for 2 weeks before surgery, which was later adjusted by endocrinologists based on blood pressure levels, reaching a final dose of 32 mg/day. Phenoxybenzamine (a nonselective, irreversible alpha-blocker) was administered for 3 weeks before surgery. The initial dose was 5 mg daily for 1 week, then 10 mg in two doses daily for a second week, and in the last week, it was raised by 10 mg every day as needed to reach the indicated target criteria. Atenolol (Beta-blockers) at an initial dose of 25 mg/day and a final dose of 50 mg/day) was added in cases of tachycardia episodes after at least 3 days of alpha blockade administration to avoid hypertensive crises due to beta-blockade without alpha blockade. The most common perioperative phases associated with HDI include endotracheal intubation, pneumoperitoneum creation, and intraoperative compression of the tumour. Intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring and treatment have been recommended in these guidelines. During adrenalectomy, alpha-blockers (urapidil) and beta-blockers (labetalol) are administered to manage intraoperative hypertension and sinus tachycardia, respectively. Hypotension during and after surgery was treated with volume expansion or norepinephrine infusion if necessary. When the main adrenal vein was clamped, antihypertensive and beta-blocker administration was stopped and hemodynamics were reassessed. Laparoscopic transperitoneal lateral total adrenalectomy was performed as previously described. All surgeries were performed by experienced endocrine surgeons who had performed > 30 laparoscopic adrenalectomies, as previously reported as the minimum number for a completed learning curve of this procedure. Our anaesthetists were cautious during the induction of pneumoperitoneum due to potential hypertension and tachycardia resulting from the massive release of catecholamines.

In conclusion, a small PPGL size or the absence of symptoms does not reliably predict a low perioperative risk. We do agree that the controversy with respect to the clinical value of presurgical treatment with α-adrenoreceptor blockers in modern-day medicine could be resolved only by a well-designed placebo-controlled trial. Until then, we recommend following the Endocrine Society's guideline that all patients with a PPGL, regardless of blood pressure and tumor size, should undergo preoperative evaluation of cardiac function and blood pressure and receive presurgical treatment with α-adrenoreceptor blockers.

### Meta-analysis of α-blockade versus no blockade before adrenalectomy for phaeochromocytoma [^50f57c80]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative α-blockade in phaeochromocytoma surgery is recommended by all guidelines to prevent intraoperative cardiocirculatory events. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the benefit of such preoperative treatment compared with no treatment before adrenalectomy for phaeochromocytoma.

Methods

A systematic literature search was undertaken in MEDLINE, Web of Science and CENTRAL without language restrictions. Randomized and non-randomized comparative studies investigating preoperative α-blockade in phaeochromocytoma surgery were included. Data on perioperative safety, effectiveness and outcomes were extracted. Pooled results were calculated as an odds ratio or mean difference with 95 per cent confidence interval.

Results

A total of four retrospective comparative studies were included investigating 603 patients undergoing phaeochromocytoma surgery. Mortality, cardiovascular complications, mean maximal intraoperative systolic and diastolic BP, and mean maximal intraoperative heart rate did not differ between patients with or without α-blockade. The certainty of the evidence was very low owing to the inferior quality of studies.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis has shown a lack of evidence for preoperative α-blockade in surgery for phaeochromocytoma. RCTs are needed to evaluate whether preoperative α-blockade can be abandoned.

### Efficacy of α-blockers on hemodynamic control during pheochromocytoma resection: a randomized controlled trial [^06ecbda9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The relevance of a more stable hemodynamic profile seems to be supported by the observation that patients who developed a postoperative cardiovascular complication had a higher hemodynamic instability score, despite the absence of a difference in primary endpoint. This observation is in agreement with other studies describing the adverse effects of hemodynamic instability on postoperative outcome. The rate of cardiovascular complications was not different between the treatment groups, but it should be noted that our study was not powered for this endpoint. Therefore, we were unable to demonstrate whether one of the study drugs resulted in a better clinical outcome. In view of the rarity of PPGL and the current complication rate, it would not be feasible to enroll the number of patients required to demonstrate a relevant difference in perioperative cardiovascular events. The absence of mortality in our study is in agreement with the literature. In the past decades, the perioperative mortality has decreased dramatically, most likely as a result of improvement of the medical management with use of α-adrenergic receptor blockers and major technical advances in both anesthesiology and surgery.

The importance of pretreatment with α-adrenergic receptor blockers has been questioned by some authors. These retrospective studies, however, suffered from a relevant selection bias, as both doctors' and patients' preferences were likely to have influenced the decision whether or not to initiate preoperative treatment with an α-adrenergic receptor blocker. In addition, these studies were confounded by the frequent use of antihypertensive agents other than α-adrenergic receptor blockers, the absence of a standardized management protocol before and during surgery, and the lack of detailed information on the nature and the extent of interventions required to control intraoperative hemodynamics. In view of the many limitations of these previous studies as well as the long-standing experience with preoperative administration of α-adrenergic receptor blockers, the use of these drugs generally remains recommended. The question as to whether pretreatment with an α-adrenergic receptor blocker could safely be omitted can only be answered in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.

Regarding perioperative care for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, more specifically with respect to preoperative alpha-blockers, AAES 2022 guidelines recommend to administer either selective or nonselective α-blockers, depending on the drug availability/cost, experience, and preference of the care team, to safely prepare patients for surgical resection of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Recognize that selective α-blockers (doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) are associated with more intraoperative hemodynamic instability while nonselective α-blockers (phenoxybenzamine) result in more postoperative hypotension, although there is no significant difference in morbidity or mortality between groups.

### The determination of real fluid requirements in laparoscopic resection of pheochromocytoma using minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring: a prospectively designed trial [^f5e556d9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The trial was conducted at the Departments of Anesthesia and Surgery, Medical University of Vienna. It was approved by the local ethics committee (EK 495/2011) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT01425710). All patients signed a written informed consent to all diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.

Patients

A total of 15 patients (PCC: n = 10, HIAT: n = 5 [controls]) were included in this prospective observational study. The patients' baseline data are presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics

Values are mean (± standard deviation) or number

AHM antihypertensive medication, ASA American Society of Anesthesiologists, BMI body mass index, HIAT hormonally inactive adrenal tumor, PCC pheochromocytoma, TC tachycardia

The histological evaluation revealed benign PCC (eight right-side, two left-side) and various benign adrenocortical lesions in the controls (two right-side, three left-side). Preoperative diagnosis of PCC was confirmed both biochemically (plasma nor-/metanephrines, urinary catecholamines and nor-/metanephrines in 24-h urine collection) and radiologically (fluorodopa positron emission tomography/computed tomography). Conn's and Cushing's syndromes were excluded biochemically in the HIAT group.

Preoperative medical preparation

PCC patients received phenoxybenzamine (a nonselective, irreversible alpha blocker) starting 3 weeks before surgery. The initial dose was 5 mg daily for 1 week, then 10 mg in two doses daily for another week and, in the last week, increased by 10 mg every day as needed to achieve the target criteria recommended. The patients were not given alpha blockers on the day of surgery. Already established beta blocker therapy was left unchanged. Other antihypertensive medication was reduced or discontinued to avoid hypotension. The patients did not receive any infusion therapy or special diet. In all subjects, concomitant structural heart disease was initially excluded by transthoracic echocardiography.

Surgical procedure

In all patients, endoscopic adrenalectomy was performed with the transperitoneal flank approach. All tumors were removed en bloc with the surrounding fatty tissue. No selective lymphadenectomy was performed. The specimens were extracted in toto in plastic bags to avoid tumor spillage. Tumor size was measured directly after removal by the surgeon.

### Pheochromocytoma surgery without systematic preoperative pharmacological preparation: insights from a referral tertiary center experience [^e13e3c68]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite significant advances in imaging and genetics, as well as surgical and anesthetic innovations, morbidity in pheochromocytoma surgery remains significant. The aim of this study was to identify the predictive factors of global and cardiovascular morbidity following unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study from a unicentric cohort. All patients who underwent non-converted laparoscopic unilateral adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma between 2000 and 2017 were included. Our patients did not systematically benefit from preoperative pharmacological preparation. It is to be noted that they never received alpha-blockers. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data during follow-ups were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses by logistic regression were performed.

Results

A total of 134 patients were included. Fifty-three percent of patients did not receive preoperative pharmacological preparation (PPP) and 33% neither preoperative antihypertensives nor PPP before surgery. There was no postoperative mortality. The global morbidity was 13.4%, while cardiovascular morbidity was 4.5%. The main factors associated with global morbidity were preoperative diuretics, a medical history of stroke, and the need for pressor amines postoperatively. The main factor associated with cardiovascular morbidity was the need for pressor amines postoperatively. Predictive factors of postoperative need for pressor amines for hypotension were the tumor size, preoperative beta-blockers, and/or diuretics.

Conclusion

In this large cohort of patients, our data revealed no mortality and low global and cardiovascular morbidity rates, showing that pheochromocytoma surgery without systematic PPP and even without preoperative antihypertensives is feasible and safe for selected patients. Our data also highlight the need for a good preoperative evaluation of the patient and the tumor, in order to optimize treatments and to help the detection of high-risk patients. This also allows us to better prevent and anticipate their possible complications.

### Personalized management of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma [^6b39e43d]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Alpha-adrenoceptor blockade

Current recommendations from the US Endocrine Society Practice Guideline and the Working Group on Endocrine Hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension advocate that alpha-adrenoceptor blockade should be given for 7 to 14 days before surgery. The recommendations on preoperative preparation with alpha-adrenoceptor blockade are based on optimal care of patients, both before and during the surgery when a cardiovascular emergency and crisis may occur. It is advised to adequately control blood pressure and heart rate for 1 to 2 weeks before surgery and during surgery to prevent a catecholamine crisis associated with severe hypertension and other dangerous catecholamine-associated side effects.

There is no specific consensus on blood pressure and heart rate targets; however, it is recommended to reach a seated blood pressure target < 130/80 mmHg. Targets for heart rate should be 60 to 70 bpm in a seated and 70 to 80 bpm for an upright position, respectively. Nevertheless, it is often difficult to reach these targets in patients with large primary tumors, multiple catecholamine-secreting primary tumors, or metastatic disease. In addition, alpha-adrenoceptor blockade should be administered to patients with catecholamine-producing PPGLs 7 to 14 days before locoregional or systemic chemo- or radiotherapy, as well as days to 2 to 3 weeks after those therapies, in order to avoid severe catecholamine-related side effects from catecholamines that are released from therapy-induced disrupted tumor cells.

The most frequently used drugs are the nonselective and noncompetitive alpha-1/2-adrenoceptor blocker phenoxybenzamine or the selective competitive alpha-1-adrenoceptor blocker doxazosin. Other alpha-1-adrenoceptor blockers that can be used include prazosin and terazosin.

All alpha-adrenoceptor blockers can be administered 2 to 3 times daily. Phenoxybenzamine, however, has a longer half-life and noncompetitive action, so it is recommended to take an extra dose at midnight instead of the morning before surgery. There is no clear superiority of any single alpha-adrenoceptor blocker over others; however, perioperative hypertension was more effectively prevented with phenoxybenzamine, although with a higher risk of postoperative hypotension, whereas doxazosin was associated with fewer adverse effects. Overall, based on the limited available information, there are no apparent differences in clinical outcomes of patients with either alpha-adrenoceptor blocker.

Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas — medical preparation and perioperative management — Alpha blockade is necessary treatment for all hormonally secreting PCCs and PGLs regardless of clinical symptoms, and patients with PCCs or PGLs should receive alpha-adrenergic blockade with aggressive volume repletion and high-salt diet for 7 to 14 days or until stable as medical preparation for treatment. Alpha 1-selective receptor blockers include terazosin, doxazosin, and prazosin, and non-selective receptor blockers include phenoxybenzamine; if the patient has a hypertensive crisis, consider the addition of nitroprusside, phentolamine, or nicardipine for the treatment of hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias can be managed with esmolol or lidocaine, and treatment with IV fluids for volume expansion with the inclusion of dextrose for glucose levels is recommended. If additional blood pressure control is needed after alpha blockade, the addition of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be used, but calcium channel blockers are not recommended as monotherapy unless the patient cannot tolerate alpha blockade; metyrosine can be used in addition to alpha blockade to control blood pressure, beta blockade (β1-selective blockers or non-selective beta-blockers) can also be added to alpha blockade to control tachycardia, generally, alpha- and beta-blockers should be administered independently, and use of combination beta/alpha-blockers is not recommended; non-selective alpha blockade with phentolamine (IV) can be used intraoperatively for additional blood pressure control.

### Pheochromocytoma: a changing perspective and current concepts [^4e300183]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Presurgical management

Surgery and anesthesia induction, adrenal venography, and arteriography are potential triggers of massive CMN release. – Respectively, the substantial drop in CMN release postoperatively can also lead to hemodynamic instability with hypotension. As a result, guidelines suggest CMN stabilization with antihypertensive medication 7–14 days before surgery.

Twice-daily nonselective α-adrenergic receptor blockers with dosing titration are the method of choice for controlling CMN levels and managing HTN. The most widely used options are phenoxybenzamine (irreversible) and doxazosin (reversible). A recent RCT reports no statistically significant difference in total intraoperative time outside targeted BP [SBP < 160 mm Hg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mm Hg] between the two drugs. Phenoxybenzamine usage, however, seems superior as it is linked to less frequent (p = 0.02), shorter (p < 0.01) SBP spikes, and, most notably, better hemodynamic profile during surgery (p = 0.02)(see Future Directions). A-blockade is unnecessary before IV nonionic contrast administration in patients with suspected or established PPGL. Finally, biochemically silent or pseudo-silent PPGLs should be managed cautiously, as evidence of the efficacy of α-adrenergic blockade is scarce. However, HTN crisis has been described in case reports.

Additional drugs can be used to manage HTN before the operation. Calcium Channel Blockers are an efficient complementary therapy. – They can be used as monotherapy if orthostatic hypotension is not tolerated during the alpha blockade and in patients with normal BP or slight HTN. Complementary tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitors such as metyrosine can also be used; however, with caution, as they can cause sedation.

After successful and sufficient α-adrenergic blockade, administration of β-adrenergic receptor blockers for heart rate (HR) management is feasible. Administration in the inverse order can lead to massive vasoconstriction and HTN crisis. For the same reason, labetalol is contraindicated, as it is a more potent β- than α1-adrenergic receptor blocker. Hypotension prevention from excessive α-adrenergic blockade is also recommended. A high sodium diet and increased fluid intake are recommended, and current guidelines suggest the administration of 1-2L saline 24 h preoperatively to ensure peri- and postoperative normotension, although evidence supporting this is observational.

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: executive summary [^5810b983]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) — testing, preoperative blockade, and surgical considerations include that initial biochemical testing for PPGLs should include measurement of plasma-free or urinary fractionated metanephrines and are typically more than 2 to 3 times the upper limit of normal in functional PPGLs, and following the diagnosis, preoperative blockade for at least 7 days is routinely recommended to prevent dangerous perioperative hemodynamic instability. We recommend that either selective or nonselective α blockade be used to safely prepare patients for surgical resection of PPGL, depending on the drug availability/cost, experience, and preference of the care team; while there is no significant difference in morbidity or mortality between selective and nonselective α blockade, selective blockade (doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) is associated with more intraoperative hemodynamic instability while nonselective blockade (phenoxybenzamine) results in more postoperative hypotension. Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) have the highest heritability of all adrenal tumors (about 40% are due to germline mutations), and genetic testing is recommended. In the presence of bilateral or familial PCC, cortical-sparing adrenalectomy has been successfully used to preserve adrenal cortical tissue, and studies report steroid dependency rates between 9% and 30% with recurrence rates from 9% to 30%.

### Preoperative management of the pheochromocytoma patient [^384e34c7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Pheochromocytomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors with a highly variable clinical presentation, but they most commonly present as spells of headaches, sweating, palpitations, and hypertension. Patients with pheochromocytoma may develop complicated and potentially lethal cardiovascular and other complications, especially in the setting of diagnostic or interventional procedures (e.g. upon induction of anesthesia or during surgery). The serious and potentially lethal nature of such complications is due to the potent effect of paroxysmal release of catecholamines. Because this warrants prompt diagnosis and treatment, the physician should be aware of the clinical manifestations and complications of catecholamine excess and be able to provide proper preoperative management to minimize catecholamine-related pre-, intra-, and postoperative adverse events. The following clinical scenario and discussion aim to enhance the knowledge of the physician regarding the behavior of pheochromocytoma and to outline current approaches to comprehensive preoperative management of patients suffering from this tumor.

### Omitting the escalating dosage of alpha-adrenergic blockade before pheochromocytoma resection: implementation of a treatment strategy in discordance with current guidelines [^7cb0fc52]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study describes the effects of introducing a protocol omitting preoperative α-blockade dose-escalation (de-escalation) in a prospective patient group.

Background

The decline of mortality and morbidity associated with pheochromocytoma resection is frequently attributed to the introduction of preoperative α-blockade. Current protocols require preoperative α-blockade dose-escalation and multiple-day hospital admissions. However, correlating evidence is lacking. Moreover, recent data suggest equal perioperative safety regardless of preoperative α-blockade escalation.

Methods

Single-institution evaluation of protocol implementation, including patients who underwent adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma between 2015 and 2023. Intraoperative hemodynamic control was regulated by active adjustment of blood pressure using vasoactive agents. The primary outcome was intraoperative hypertension, defined as the time-weighted average of systolic blood pressure (TWA-SBP) above 200 mm Hg. Secondary outcomes included perioperative hypotension, postoperative blood pressure support requirement, hospital stay duration, and complications.

Results

Of 102 pheochromocytoma patients, 82 were included; 44 in the de-escalated preoperative α-adrenergic protocol and 38 following the previous dose-escalation protocol. Median [IQR] TWA-SBP above 200 mm Hg was 0.01 [0.0–0.4] mm Hg in the de-escalated group versus 0.0 [0.0–0.1] mm Hg in the dose-escalated group (P = 0.073). The median duration of postoperative continuous norepinephrine administration was 0.3 hours [0.0–5.5] versus 5.1 hours [0.0–14.3], respectively (P = 0.003). Postoperative symptomatic hypotension occurred in 34.2% versus 9.1% of patients (P = 0.005). Median hospital stay was 2.5 days [1.9–3.6] versus 7.1 days [6.0–11.9] (P < 0.001). No significant differences in complication rates were observed.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma employing a de-escalated preoperative α-blockade protocol is safe and results in a shorter hospital stay.

### Α-adrenoceptor blockers and phaeochromocytoma surgery: outdated combination? [^2e1cd625]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, omitting AAB before surgery in patients with phaeochromocytoma does not seem to increase perioperative or postoperative haemodynamic instability, and can shorten both the time in postoperative surveillance units and the overall duration of hospital stay. These data do not, therefore, support current guidelines on phaeochromocytoma management, which recommend treatment with AAB for 7–14 days before surgery to decrease the risk of perioperative haemodynamic instability 1. An RCT using haemodynamic instabilityas endpoint is reasonable and may be feasible.

### Selective versus non-selective α-blockade prior to laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma [^bf33f4c7]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal preoperative α-blockade strategy is debated for patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytomas. We evaluated the impact of selective versus non-selective α-blockade on intraoperative hemodynamics and postoperative outcomes.

Methods

We identified patients having laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytomas from 2001 to 2015. As a marker of overall intraoperative hemodynamics, we combined systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 200, SBP < 80, SBP < 80 and > 200, pulse > 120, vasopressor infusion, and vasodilator infusion into a single variable. Similarly, the combination of vasopressor infusion in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission provided an overview of postoperative support.

Results

We identified 52 patients undergoing unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma. Selective α-blockade (i.e. doxazosin) was performed in 35% (n = 18) of patients, and non-selective blockade with phenoxybenzamine was performed in 65% (n = 34) of patients. Demographics and tumor characteristics were similar between groups. Patients blocked selectively were more likely to have an SBP < 80 (67%) than those blocked with phenoxybenzamine (35%) (p = 0.03), but we found no significant difference in overall intraoperative hemodynamics between patients blocked selectively and non-selectively (p = 0.09). However, postoperatively, patients blocked selectively were more likely to require additional support with vasopressor infusions in the PACU or ICU admission (p = 0.02). Hospital stay and complication rates were similar.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma is safe regardless of the preoperative α-blockade strategy employed, but patients blocked selectively may have a higher incidence of transient hypotension during surgery and a greater need for postoperative support. These differences did not result in longer hospital stay or increased complications.

### SAGES guidelines for minimally invasive treatment of adrenal pathology [^d43bbad8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Medium credibility.

Pheochromocytoma — postoperative care and surveillance after minimally invasive adrenalectomy emphasize hemodynamics, recurrence risk, and monitoring: During the immediate postoperative period, hypotension and hypoglycemia are the most common occurrences, and monitoring in an ICU setting for 24 hours postoperatively is advisable. For patients without evidence of underlying postoperative essential hypertension, all anti-hypertensive medications should be discontinued postoperatively with the possible exception of beta blockers, and in patients who have been treated with long-term preoperative beta blocker therapy, postoperative management may necessitate a slow taper to avoid reflex tachycardia. Recurrence rates in the literature following resection of benign-appearing lesions are approximately 6%-8%, and long disease-free intervals are not atypical, with recurrences often presenting several years to decades after initial surgery; thus, follow-up recommendations include annual blood pressure monitoring as well as serum and/or urinary metanephrines, with abdominal imaging indicated when clinical signs or symptoms of recurrence are present. Histologic features alone are imperfect; a PASS score > 4 indicated an aggressive pathology, and adrenal specimens removed with minimally invasive techniques should be placed in an impervious extraction bag before removal and/or morcellation. Recommendations state that due to the potential for hemodynamic instability after pheochromocytoma resection, all patients should be closely monitored in the immediate postoperative phase (+++, strong), capsular disruptions should be avoided (+, weak), and patients should be monitored long term with regular blood pressure and serum and/or urinary metanephrine levels (++, strong).

### Approach to the patient: perioperative management of the patient with pheochromocytoma or sympathetic paraganglioma [^5c4123d1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Pheochromocytomas and sympathetic paraganglioma (PPGL) are rare chromaffin cell tumors originating in the adrenal medulla and sympathetic paraganglia, respectively, which share the capacity to synthesize and release catecholamines. The incidence of PPGL has increased in recent years. Surgical resection is the only curative treatment for PPGL. Management of patients with PPGL is complex and should be done by a specialized multidisciplinary team in centers with broad expertise. Surgical resection of a PPGL is a high-risk procedure for which optimal pretreatment with antihypertensive drugs is required in combination with state-of-the-art surgical procedures and anesthesiological techniques. In this article we discuss the underlying evidence and the pros and cons of presurgical medical preparation. Finally, the areas of uncertainty and controversies in this field are addressed.

### Impact of surgical technique on hemodynamic instability in patients with pheochromocytoma: a single-centre retrospective cohort study [^5f9e0882]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This is a single-centre retrospective cohort study. The STROBE statement (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) was utilized to report our findings in a comprehensive and transparent manner and was in line with the STROCCS guidelines. There was no predefined study protocol established. This study was approved by Medical Ethics Committee East-Netherlands (METC Oost-Nederland; reference number 2021–8291) and the need for formal informed consent was waived.

Patient selection

Consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic adrenalectomy for PCC were included from a prospectively collected database from 2007 to 2022. All patients were over 18 years of age and operated by TLA or PRA technique. Patients with missing intraoperative data due to incomplete pre-electronic patient files (before 2014), after conversion to open adrenalectomy or switch to another endoscopic technique, or patients for partial or bilateral adrenalectomy and combined surgical procedures, were excluded to ensure a reliable comparison between surgical groups.

Preoperative pharmacological management

The perioperative care is based on The Endocrine Society guidelines for PCC and paraganglioma. All patients with a suspicion of PCC underwent biochemical screening, in case of positive biochemical screening, imaging with preferably CT-scan was performed to locate the tumour. In general, surgical resection was planned within 8 weeks after diagnosing PCC. Patients were preoperatively treated for 14 days with alpha-adrenoreceptor blockers, either phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin, and additional beta-adrenergic blockade and calcium channel antagonist when needed, according to a standardized approach as described previously. Following the inclusion of the so-called PRESCRIPT trial, which demonstrates the non-inferiority of doxazosin for blood pressure control (MAP > 60 mmHg and SBP < 160 mmHg) compared with phenoxybenzamine, the choice of alpha-adrenergic blockade was changed from phenoxybenzamine to routine use of doxazosin from 2013 onwards due to costs.

NCCN Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma — medical preparation for treatment specifies alpha blockade with volume repletion and a high salt diet for 7–14 days or until stable, with consideration of adding dihydropyridine calcium channel blockade, beta blockade, or metyrosine. Alpha blockade is necessary treatment for all hormonally secreting pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs); if additional blood pressure support is needed, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be used, but this is not recommended as monotherapy unless the patient cannot tolerate alpha blockade. Metyrosine can be added to stabilize blood pressure, and beta blockade can be added for tachycardia, with B1 selective or nonselective beta blockers allowed, while combination beta/alpha blockers are not recommended. Alpha 1 selective receptor blockers include terazosin, doxazosin, and prazosin, and non-selective receptor blockers include phenoxybenzamine; therapy for 7–14 days is recommended prior to surgical therapy, and nonselective alpha blockade phentolamine (IV) can be used intraoperatively. Additional cautions include considering a medical alert ID for hormonally secreting PCCs and PGLs, avoiding medications that will precipitate hormone-mediated crisis, and for hypertensive crisis considering nitroprusside, phentolamine, or nicardipine with arrhythmia management using esmolol or lidocaine. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Postoperative outcomes in normotensive and hypertensive pheochromocytomas: an international study [^75fad095]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Baseline Characteristics

This study included 2016 patients with pheochromocytoma undergoing adrenalectomy. Of these, 1034 (51.2%) had preoperative hypertension and 982 (49.8%) were classified as normotensives. The majority of patients underwent LA (81.3%), and most procedures were TPA (67.2%; Table 1). Patients had a median age of 52.0 years and 45.0% were female. The median BMI was of 25.0. In terms of comorbidities, the median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 2.0, and most patients had an ASA of II or III (59.5% and 28.7%, respectively). The median tumor size was 4.0 cm, and there was an equal distribution of right- and left-sided tumors (see Table 1). Overall, the practice for admitting patients before surgery for fluid hydration varied across centers. Of included centers, 10 centers had no patients admitted preoperatively for intravenous fluid hydration, while 13 centers admitted all of their included patients preoperatively for fluid hydration. The remaining centers had between 1.5% and 98.3% of patients admitted preoperatively for intravenous fluid hydration. Of patients, 705 (37.9%) received preoperative admission for intravenous fluid hydration. There was no statistically significant difference in preadmission between the hypertensive and nonhypertensive cohorts (371, 37.2% hypertensive vs 334, 38.8% nonhypertensive; P = 0.533). Importantly, 93.2% of patients received α-blockade with a similar proportion having blockade discontinued the day of surgery (45.3%) and more than 10 days before surgery (49.6%). Only 32.5% of patients also had β-blockade. Detailed information regarding α- and β-blocker molecules and dosage are presented Tables 2 and 3. In summary, when we compared patients with and without α-blockade, we found that patients without α-blockade were more likely to undergo open surgery (14.4% vs 10.9%; P = 0.024) and more likely to have a TPA (82.2% vs 65.8%; P < .001). Moreover, they had a significantly lower starting mean arterial pressure, and they were less likely to require the intensive care unit (ICU) and required fewer blood transfusions. They also had a shorter LOS and significantly fewer complications (10.1% vs 20.6%; P < .001) and were much less likely to require vasopressors at closure (6.9% vs 18.6%; P < .001). Incidental diagnosis was more frequent in the nonhypertensive group (56.4% vs 32.5%; P < .001) (see Table 1).

### Impact of surgical technique on hemodynamic instability in patients with pheochromocytoma: a single-centre retrospective cohort study [^9cf23a24]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) are rare catecholamine producing tumours with an incidence of 0.6 per 100,000 cases. These tumours cause a range of symptoms, including headaches, palpitations, and excessive sweating, due to the episodic release of excessive amounts of catecholamines. Furthermore, these tumours can lead to life-threatening complications, such as hypertensive crisis, arrhythmias, cerebrovascular events and myocardial infarction.

The corner stone of therapy for PCC is surgical resection. Endoscopic surgical techniques, including transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy (TLA) and posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (PRA), are commonly used, but occasionally open surgery is still necessary. Adequate preoperative preparation, including alpha-adrenergic blockade to control blood pressure and prevent intraoperative hypertensive crisis caused by catecholamine release which is triggered by intubation and tumour manipulation, is advocated in international guidelines.

Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas — medical preparation for treatment: Alpha blockade is necessary treatment for all hormonally secreting PCCs and PGLs regardless of clinical symptoms, and patients with PCCs or PGLs should receive alpha-adrenergic blockade with aggressive volume repletion and high-salt diet for 7 to 14 days or until stable as medical preparation for treatment. Alpha 1-selective receptor blockers include terazosin, doxazosin, and prazosin, and non-selective receptor blockers include phenoxybenzamine. If the patient has a hypertensive crisis, consider the addition of nitroprusside, phentolamine, or nicardipine for the treatment of hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias can be managed with esmolol or lidocaine. Treatment with IV fluids for volume expansion with the inclusion of dextrose for glucose levels is recommended. If additional blood pressure control is needed after alpha blockade, the addition of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be used; calcium channel blockers are not recommended as monotherapy unless the patient cannot tolerate alpha blockade. Metyrosine can be used in addition to alpha blockade to control blood pressure. Beta blockade (β1-selective blockers or non-selective beta-blockers) can also be added to alpha blockade to control tachycardia. Generally, alpha- and beta-blockers should be administered independently, and use of combination beta/alpha-blockers is not recommended. Non-selective alpha blockade phentolamine (IV) can be used intraoperatively for additional blood pressure control.

### Surgical anesthesia in a patient with a pheochromocytoma crisis supported by ECMO: a case report [^6c0670b6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

There are several deficiencies in the handling of this case. First, this patient's hormone levels, cardiac function, genetic factors, and imaging findings should have been carefully evaluated before she underwent elective pheochromocytoma resection. Adequate preoperative preparation is necessary, as catecholamines may be released in large amounts during anesthesia induction, endoscopic pneumoperitoneum establishment, and tumor resection. Patients may develop severe hypertension and cardiovascular complications during the perioperative period. Alpha-adrenergic blockers should be used for at least 7 to 14 days when alpha-blockers cannot effectively control the patient's blood pressure. In addition to the use of calcium channel blockers, treatment should also include the inhibition of clinical symptoms caused by a functional PPGL, the restoration of the patient's intravascular blood volume loss after alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade through a high-salt diet and fluid intake (1000–2000 ml/day), and the strict control of the patient's blood pressure and heart rate. Additionally, the patient's blood pressure should be stable and less than 140/90 mmHg before surgery. The optimal heart rate is 60–70 beats/min when sitting and 70–80 beats/min when standing. Because beta-blockers tend to cause catecholamine overdose, leading to hypertensive crises, beta-blockers should not be used as first-line therapy and should only be used for the treatment of tachycardia in PPGL patients. However, due to the urgent change in this patient's condition, there were only 9 days from hospitalization to surgery, and no formal preoperative preparation was carried out. Therefore, the perioperative management of this patient was highly limited, and the patient's circulation fluctuated sharply, which may have caused potential harm. Second, the choice of treatment, especially whether to surgically resect the tumor or intervene with subtumor embolization, is warrants further discussion. This hospital is a prefecture city hospital that lacks experience in interventional tumor embolization, so laparoscopic tumor resection was the only option in this case. However, laparoscopic surgery requires changing the body position, injecting a certain amount of carbon dioxide to maintain pneumoperitoneum, and inducing hypercapnia after carbon dioxide absorption to further stimulate the release of hormones from the tumor mass. These factors present further challenges for the perioperative management of these patients. CRRT is particularly useful in pheochromocytoma crisis since it continuously removes catecholamines from the systemic circulation. Due to the emergency situation at that time, we did not consider CRRT, which is also worth reflecting on.

### Differences in α-blockade practices between endocrine and surgical specialties for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma resection: a single-center retrospective study [^a3757895]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Surgery remains the only definitive cure for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL). The impact of variable α-blockade practices preoperatively has not been explored. This study compared preoperative α-blockade strategies between endocrine and surgical specialties and assessed their differences in perioperative outcomes.

Methods

This retrospective longitudinal cohort study included patients with PPGL who underwent laparoscopic or robot-assisted surgical resection between 2006 and 2023 at a single academic center.

Results

The cohort comprised 78 patients (endocrine group [n = 28] and surgical group [n = 50]). There were no significant differences in baseline hormonal profiles or tumor size between the groups. Both groups more commonly used selective α-blockers over non-selective αgents. Patients in the endocrine group underwent a shorter course of α-blockade (median [IQR]: 17 days [14–39] vs 27 days [17–55]), received higher doses of selective (mean ± SD: 10 mg ± 8.6 vs 6.9 mg ± 4.3) and non-selective α-blockers (60 mg ± 32 vs 35 mg ± 14.5), and had a higher frequency of daily α-blocker administration compared to the surgical group. Despite these variations in practice, perioperative hemodynamic outcomes remained comparable between groups. Across the overall cohort, larger tumor size and higher metanephrine concentrations were associated with both systolic and diastolic hypotension (P < .05 for both). Elevated metanephrine levels and older age correlated with prolonged duration of systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg (P < .05).

Conclusion

Despite differences in α-blockade strategies between the groups, perioperative hemodynamic outcomes were comparable supporting flexibility in management. Tumor burden and patient age were associated with perioperative hemodynamic variability.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) — parathyroid tumor and pheochromocytoma (PCC) evaluation includes serum calcium and targeted imaging, peri-procedural PCC screening with specific biochemical thresholds, and required preoperative medical therapy. For patients with MEN2 who have a parathyroid tumor, serum calcium level should be measured; if elevated, parathyroid hormone and 25‑OH vitamin D should be checked, and a neck ultrasound, parathyroid sestamibi scan with SPECT, or 4D‑CT is also recommended. Patients with MEN2 should be evaluated for a coexisting PCC before administration of anesthetic or any invasive procedure using plasma‑free or 24‑hour urine‑fractionated metanephrines and normetanephrines; concurrent medications should be reviewed, and elevations that are three times above the upper limit of normal are diagnostic. Because patients with PCC have persistent vasoconstriction, alpha blockade with volume repletion and high salt diet is required preoperatively.

### Efficacy of α-blockers on hemodynamic control during pheochromocytoma resection: a randomized controlled trial [^648415ac]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The major strengths of the current study are its randomized controlled design, the use of a well-defined perioperative management protocol, the relatively large sample size of patients with a rare disease, and the comprehensive prospective data collection. Our study also has some limitations. Preoperative blood pressure targets were achieved in only a minority of the participants. In particular, a large majority did not reach the strict upright blood pressure target. It should be noted, however, that these blood pressure targets are mainly based on expert opinion and have never been evaluated prospectively before. Of potential interest, we showed that a preoperative supine blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg is associated with less hemodynamic instability while an upright systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg is associated with more hemodynamic instability, as has been suggested previously. This finding could guide future recommendations concerning preoperative blood pressure targets. Furthermore, we did not include a placebo group, and study drugs were provided in an open-label fashion. Incorporation of a placebo arm was, however, considered to be unethical in view of current guidelines recommending pretreatment with an α-adrenergic receptor blocker. We have chosen for an open-label design because blinded administration of the study drugs would have required a double-dummy design with the ensuing risk of insufficient medication adherence due to the relatively large number of placebo and verum drugs that would need to be ingested by the participants. Limited availability of phenoxybenzamine in several countries likely affects the choice between phenoxybenzamine and doxazosin.

In conclusion, the duration of blood pressure being outside the target range during surgical resection of a PPGL was not different after preoperative treatment with either phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin. Phenoxybenzamine was more effective in preventing intraoperative hemodynamic instability, but it could not be established whether its use was associated with a better clinical outcome.

### International multicentre review of perioperative management and outcome for catecholamine-producing tumours [^3c5c2cd7]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgery for catecholamine-producing tumours can be complicated by intraoperative and postoperative haemodynamic instability. Several perioperative management strategies have emerged but none has been evaluated in randomized trials. To assess this issue, contemporary perioperative management and outcome data from 21 centres were collected.

Methods

Twenty-one centres contributed outcome data from patients who had surgery for phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma between 2000 and 2017. The data included the number of patients with and without α-receptor blockade, surgical and anaesthetic techniques, complications and perioperative mortality.

Results

Across all centres, data were reported on 1860 patients with phaeochromocytoma or paraganglioma, of whom 343 underwent surgery without α-receptor blockade. The majority of operations (78·9 per cent) were performed using minimally invasive techniques, including 16·1 per cent adrenal cortex-sparing procedures. The cardiovascular complication rate was 5·0 per cent overall: 5·9 per cent (90 of 1517) in patients with preoperative α-receptor blockade and 0·9 per cent (3 of 343) among patients without α-receptor blockade. The mortality rate was 0·5 per cent overall (9 of 1860): 0·5 per cent (8 of 517) in pretreated and 0·3 per cent (1 of 343) in non-pretreated patients.

Conclusion

There is substantial variability in the perioperative management of catecholamine-producing tumours, yet the overall complication rate is low. Further studies are needed to better define the optimal management approach, and reappraisal of international perioperative guidelines appears desirable.

### Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^4164c6ca]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate clinical practice guidelines for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL).

Participants

The Task Force included a chair selected by the Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), seven experts in the field, and a methodologist. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force reviewed primary evidence and commissioned two additional systematic reviews.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of the Endocrine Society, European Society of Endocrinology, and Americal Association for Clinical Chemistry reviewed drafts of the guidelines.

Conclusions

The Task Force recommends that initial biochemical testing for PPGLs should include measurements of plasma free or urinary fractionated metanephrines. Consideration should be given to preanalytical factors leading to false-positive or false-negative results. All positive results require follow-up. Computed tomography is suggested for initial imaging, but magnetic resonance is a better option in patients with metastatic disease or when radiation exposure must be limited. (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy is a useful imaging modality for metastatic PPGLs. We recommend consideration of genetic testing in all patients, with testing by accredited laboratories. Patients with paraganglioma should be tested for SDHx mutations, and those with metastatic disease for SDHB mutations. All patients with functional PPGLs should undergo preoperative blockade to prevent perioperative complications. Preparation should include a high-sodium diet and fluid intake to prevent postoperative hypotension. We recommend minimally invasive adrenalectomy for most pheochromocytomas with open resection for most paragangliomas. Partial adrenalectomy is an option for selected patients. Lifelong follow-up is suggested to detect recurrent or metastatic disease. We suggest personalized management with evaluation and treatment by multidisciplinary teams with appropriate expertise to ensure favorable outcomes.

Regarding surgical interventions for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, more specifically with respect to choice of surgical approach, SAGES 2013 guidelines recommend to consider using a laparoscopic approach, performed by a surgeon skilled in advanced laparoscopy and adrenal surgery, in patients with large adrenal tumors without prior intraoperative evidence of primary adrenal cortical carcinoma. Recognize that laparoscopic adrenalectomy may be associated with longer operating room times, greater blood loss, and a higher rate of conversion to open surgery in patients with larger tumors.
Convert to an open approach if any evidence for carcinoma is found intraoperatively.

### Α-adrenoceptor blockers and phaeochromocytoma surgery: outdated combination? [^994099ce]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor

Although recommended by current guidelines, the use of preoperative α-adrenoceptor blockade (AAB) to prevent cardiovascular complications during phaeochromocytoma surgery continues to be debated. Proponents of pretreatment see the widespread adoption of AAB in the 1960sas instrumental in improving surgical results. Opponents of pretreatment, on the other hand, argue that improved diagnostics with increased detection of phaeochromocytoma as adrenal incidentalomas, the advent of minimally invasive surgery, and improved anaesthetic practices have contributed to making contemporary phaeochromocytoma surgery safe. Indeed, a reviewof contemporary management from 21 centres worldwide published in this journal showed varying perioperative practices, and similar results with and without AAB, with an overall cardiovascular complication rate of 5 per cent and mortality rate of 0.5 per cent. However, the evidence base is weak and prospective data are lacking.

In this pilot study conducted at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, the feasibility of phaeochromocytoma surgery without AAB was investigated using a structured prospective protocol. All consecutive patients with newly diagnosed phaeochromocytoma between May 2017 and December 2019 were assessed for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were: newly diagnosed unilateral catecholamine-producing adrenal tumour, age over 18 years, and intended minimally invasive surgery. Exclusion criteria were: haemodynamic instability requiring intensive care, malignant hypertension (severe hypertension with secondary organ damage), symptomatic impaired cardiac function (New York Heart Association class III–IV), and pregnancy. The primary outcome variable was perioperative haemodynamics, defined as number of episodes of systolic BP over 200 or below 70 mmHg, monitored via arterial catheters and registered at least every 5 min. Secondary outcome variables were episodes of SBP over 180 or below 100 mmHg, time needed for surveillance in the postoperative ICU, use of inotropic agents when postoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) reached levels below 65 mmHg, and total duration of inpatient stay. The study was approved by the regional ethical review board in Gothenburg (754–15). Informed consent was signed by all patients in the study group, but was not required for the control group as these patients were included retrospectively.

CONCLUSIONS

For patients undergoing surgery for PPGLs, preoperative nonselective α-blockade was associated with less intraoperative hypertension when compared with selective α-blockade. The choice of preoperative α-blockades does not change postoperative outcomes. Further studies are required to confirm our results.

### Laparoscopic adrenalectomy-is it safe in hands of residents in training? [^a7348a66]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients who underwent surgical treatment of adrenal tumors in our academic teaching hospital and tertiary referral center between January 2013 and March 2018. The inclusion criterion was laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy for adrenal tumors. The indication for surgery was either a hormonally active tumor, or, in the case of non-secreting incidentaloma, size ≥ 40 mm, rapid growth in follow-up studies, or a so-called " radiological malignant phenotype " of the tumor. Exclusion criteria were patients undergoing open adrenalectomy, adrenalectomy as a part of multiorgan resection, bilateral adrenalectomy, adrenalectomy from a posterior approach.

All patients underwent preoperative imaging studies (ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or, if necessary, positron emission computed tomography). Tumor size was estimated in imaging studies (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging). Prior to surgery, a routine panel of laboratory tests was conducted to establish the tumor's hormonal activity. In cases of suspected pheochromocytoma, patients were preoperatively treated with alpha-blockers (doxazosin 20 mg/day and additional beta-blockers in case of co-existing tachycardia). The operative method of choice in our department is laparoscopic transperitoneal lateral total adrenalectomy, which is performed similarly to its description elsewhere. In this paper, we understood the acronym to mean laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy.

The team that performed the surgeries comprised six operators, including four attending surgeons (five surgeons with 2–5 years of specialization during their inclusion to the study and one senior surgeon who was experienced in laparoscopic procedures) and two surgery residents (in their fourth to sixth years of training). Patients were divided into two groups. The first group (Group 1) was operated on by a resident and the second group (Group 2) by a attending general surgeon. Prior to attempting first adrenalectomy, the residents in training were required to acquire an appropriate theoretical background in endocrine surgery and experience in laparoscopic surgery (including obligatory structured training on simulators at the Department of Medical Education, Jagiellonian University Medical College). Every resident had to assist in at least 15 LAs, after which they could perform procedures supervised and assisted by a surgeon with expertise in adrenal gland surgery.

### Pheochromocytoma: recommendations for clinical practice from the first international symposium. October 2005 [^9bae4c9e]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

The First International Symposium on Pheochromocytoma, held in October 2005, included discussions about developments concerning these rare catecholamine-producing tumors. Recommendations were made during the symposium for biochemical diagnosis, localization, genetics, and treatment. Measurement of plasma or urinary fractionated metanephrines, the most accurate screening approach, was recommended as the first-line test for diagnosis; reference intervals should favor sensitivity over specificity. Localization studies should only follow reasonable clinical evidence of a tumor. Preoperative pharmacologic blockade of circulatory responses to catecholamines is mandatory. Because approximately a quarter of tumors develop secondary to germ-line mutations in any one of five genes, mutation testing should be considered; however, it is not currently cost effective to test every gene in every patient. Consideration of tumor location, presence of multiple tumors, presence of metastases, and type of catecholamine produced is useful in deciding which genes to test. Inadequate methods to distinguish malignant from benign tumors and a lack of effective treatments for malignancy are important problems requiring further resolution.

### Pheochromocytoma: presentation, diagnosis and treatment [^be9273f3]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Pheochromocytomas are rare, mostly benign catecholamine-producing tumors of chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla or of a paraganglion. Typical clinical manifestations are sustained or paroxysmal hypertension, severe headaches, palpitations and sweating resulting from hormone excess. However, their presentation is highly variable and can mimic many other diseases. If remaining unrecognized or untreated, they can be a life-threatening condition. Therefore, the most important message of this review is to think of them. The diagnosis of pheochromocytomas depends mainly upon the demonstration of catecholamine excess by 24-h urinary catecholamines and metanephrines or plasma metanephrines. They are localized by a computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of the adrenal glands and abdomen; complementary 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy and 18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine-positron emission tomography are available. Because approximately one out of four pheochromocytomas turn out to be hereditary entities, screening for genetic alterations is important. Laparoscopic and adrenal sparing surgical intervention following preoperative alpha-blockade is the treatment of choice and usually curative. In malignant pheochromocytomas, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are palliative treatment options. This review provides an update on identification and management of pheochromocytomas, emphasizing current developments in diagnosis, including genetic testing, pathophysiology and treatment of pheochromocytomas.

### Present-day diagnosis and treatment of pheochromocytoma… [^7cdeb946]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The histories of 50 patients who were found to have pheochromocytomas have been analyzed in order to identify factors that might be important in diagnosis and prognosis. The hypertension characteristic of pheochromocytoma was paroxysmal in 26 and persistent in 24. The tumors are usually benign, but eight in this series were malignant, and seven of the malignant type occurred in the cases of persistent hypertension. Tests for pheochromocytoma should be carried out on patients who complain of spells of severe headache of unexplained cause with perspiration, thoracic and abdominal pain, and nervousness and on any hypertensive patient who is thin and young, who has hypermetabolism without other signs of hyperthyroidism, who give a paradoxical reaction to ganglion-blocking agents, and who responds to anesthetics with a blood pressure rise.

The tests consist of the administration of histamine base, tetraethyl-ammonium chloride, phentolamine, or piperoxan and determinations of plasma pressoramines under certain standard conditions. For removal of the tumor a transverse upper abdominal incision is recommended because it gives access to both adrenals and permits the inspection of the abdomen for aberrant masses of adrenal tissue, which are especially likely to occur in the region of the great vessels in the abdomen and about the base of the mesentery of the small intestine. During operation constant attention to the blood pressure is necessary because the pressure often rises sharply when the tumor is handled and falls to dangerously low levels when the tumor is removed. When recurrences or metastases are encountered, it is still possible to prolong the life of the patient by surgery or roentgenotherapy. Kvale WF, Roth GM, Manger WM, Priestley JT.

### Is there an optimal preoperative management strategy for phaeochromocytoma / paraganglioma? [^7fd97db8]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are catecholamine secreting neuroendocrine tumours that predispose to haemodynamic instability. Currently, surgery is the only available curative treatment, but carries potential risks including hypertensive and hypotensive crises, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction and stroke, due to tumoral release of catecholamines during anaesthetic induction and tumour manipulation. The mortality associated with surgical resection of PPGL has significantly improved from 20–45% in the early 20th century (Apgar & Papper, AMA Archives of Surgery, 1951, 62, 634) to 0–2·9% in the early 21st century (Kinney et al. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia, 2002, 16, 359), largely due to availability of effective pharmacological agents and advances in surgical and anaesthetic practice. However, surgical resection of PPGL still poses significant clinical management challenges. Preoperatively, alpha-adrenoceptor blockade is the mainstay of management, although various pharmacological strategies have been proposed, based largely on reports derived from retrospective data sets. To date, no consensus has been reached regarding the 'ideal' preoperative strategy due, in part, to a paucity of data from high-quality evidence-based studies comparing different treatment regimens. Here, based on the available literature, we address the Clinical Question: Is there an optimal preoperative management strategy for PPGL?

### Preoperative alpha blockade for normotensive pheochromocytoma: is it necessary? [^f1a16c77]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the intraoperative hemodynamics in normotensive pheochromocytoma patients undergoing tumor resection between those with α-blockade preparation, preoperatively, and those without it.

Methods

From January 2003 to July 2011, patients with adrenal incidentaloma, which was highly suspected as normotensive pheochromocytoma, were divided into two groups. Group 1 recieved α1-blockade doxazosin before adrenalectomy. Group 2 received no α-adrenoceptor, preoperatively. Data regarding the intraoperative hemodynamics was collected. These include peak/nadir blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, vasoactive medication and fluid infusion.

Results

Fifty-nine cases of pheochromocytoma were confirmed by histopathology examination: 38 in group 1 and 21 in group 2. No differences were found in the preoperative demographics, comorbidities, BP and anesthesia. Intraoperative BP and heart rate showed no difference between these two groups. Intraoperative use of nitroglycerin (P < 0.001), norepinephrine (P < 0.001), phentolamine (P < 0.001) and colloid fluid (P = 0.008) was significantly greater in group 1 with doxazosin.

Conclusion

Preoperative α1-adrenoceptor antagonist has no benefit in maintaining intraoperative hemodynamic stability in patients with normotensive pheochromocytoma. It may increase the use of vasoactive drugs and colloid infusion.

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: executive summary [^0ca48abc]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Adrenalectomy — cortical-sparing for bilateral pheochromocytoma (PCC): Because of the decreased rate of steroid dependence, we recommend consideration of cortical-sparing adrenalectomy in patients with bilateral PCCs if technically feasible, with the patient's goals of care and a higher risk of recurrent pheochromocytoma also considered (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Given increased technical difficulty and risk of recurrence in the adrenal remnant, and if an attempt increases concern for tumor disruption or incomplete resection, it may not be appropriate.

### Pheochromocytomas most commonly present as adrenal incidentalomas: a large tertiary center experience [^02efca81]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Preoperative Management

Most patients were treated with α-blockers as soon as pheochromocytoma was diagnosed (N = 163; 97.6%), with doxazosin and phenoxybenzamine being used in 82.8% and 17.2% of cases, respectively (see Table 1). Of those undergoing surgery, 4 (2.4%) patients were not treated with preoperative α-blockade: Two had normal MN and, therefore, pheochromocytoma was not suspected; 1 was hypotensive, and α-blockers were considered inappropriate; and 1 underwent surgery for a presumed renal tumor, but histology was consistent with pheochromocytoma.

The α-blocker dose was titrated according to clinical response, aiming for a blood pressure of less than 120/80 mm Hg. The median total daily dose of doxazosin at the time of adrenalectomy (or at the last follow-up if a patient did not undergo surgery) was 6 mg (range, 1–32 mg) and 40 mg for phenoxybenzamine (range, 10–90 mg). The median total daily dose of doxazosin varied by the mode of presentation; patients with incidental pheochromocytomas and those detected during screening for underlying genetic susceptibility required lower doses (median 4 mg; range, 1–20 mg) than those with adrenergic symptoms/uncontrolled hypertension (median 8 mg; range, 1–32 mg) (P = 0.001) (Fig. 4). There was no relationship between doxazosin dose and tumor size (data not shown). The number of patients treated with phenoxybenzamine was too small to assess for such differences.

### Nonselective compared with selective α-blockade is associated with less intraoperative hypertension in patients with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas: a retrospective cohort study with propensity score matching [^887c09f2]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Does the choice of preoperative α-blockade affect intraoperative hemodynamics and postoperative outcomes in patients with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas?
Findings: Compared with preoperative selective α-blockade, nonselective α-blockade was associated with a reduced risk of intraoperative hypertension but does not change outcomes.
Meaning: Preoperative nonselective α-blocker may be better than selective ones in controlling intraoperative hypertension in patients undergoing surgery for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare catecholamine-secreting tumors originating from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and paraganglia. The prevalence of PPGLs in hospital outpatients with hypertension was reported from 0.1% to 0.6%. – Resection is the main treatment for PPGLs. However, severe and rapid fluctuations in blood pressure (BP) may occur during surgery, which places patients at a significantly increased risk of major morbidities. In the early period, surgery for PPGLs was associated with a mortality up to 25%. Careful preoperative preparation is recommended to prevent life-threatening events, one of which is α-blockade therapy. Studies indicated that preoperative α-blockade significantly improved intraoperative hemodynamics and reduced postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing surgery for PPGLs.

Currently, 2 types of α-blockers are used in clinical practice, that is, selective and nonselective α-blockers. Phenoxybenzamine is a noncompetitive, long-acting, and nonselective antagonist of α1- and α2-receptors. The noncompetitive property is useful during surgery since the α-blockade remains effective even when excessive release of catecholamines occurs. However, the long-acting effect may increase postoperative hypotension; and the inhibition of α2-receptor is associated with some side effects, including reflex tachycardia. Doxazosin, terazosin, and prazosin are competitive, short-acting, and selective antagonists of α1-receptors. The short-acting effect may be beneficial by shortening postoperative hypotension, and the selective α1-blockade means they cause fewer side effects, such as tachycardia. However, as a result of competitive property, the α-blockade may be ineffective during surges of catecholamine release, which may occur when handling the tumor.

### Personalized management of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma [^2878f8f2]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Beta-adrenoceptor blockers should never be administered before initiation of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and in general are only required if catecholamine-induced tachyarrhythmia is present. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers should be administered 2 to 3 days after alpha-adrenoceptor blockade is initiated.

Currently, most experts support the view that there is little need for adrenoceptor blockade for nonfunctional PPGLs or for those that only produce dopamine. Nevertheless, there have been some case reports describing hypertensive crisis or spells during the surgery in apparently "biochemically silent pheochromocytoma". Since negative biochemical test results cannot be used alone to determine whether a PPGL is nonfunctional, and given the associated difficulties in defining a PPGL as biochemically silent, there is need for considerable caution when assessing whether such patients should receive adrenoceptor blockade. More evidence is required for any strong recommendations, but unlikely to become available anytime soon due to the rare nature of nonfunctional PPGLs, beyond those of the head and neck.

Tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor metyrosine

The tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor metyrosine, which inhibits catecholamine synthesis, can additionally help to prevent pre- and intraoperative hemodynamic instability when given in combination with phenoxybenzamine. The combination treatment reduced blood pressure fluctuations and resulted in less need for antihypertensive medication, vasoactive drugs, and fluids intra-operatively, compared with phenoxybenzamine alone. Thus, although alpha-adrenoceptor blockers should be the first choice to prevent hypertensive crisis during surgery, metyrosine may add to better hemodynamic stability pre- and intra-operatively and might be an alternative to alpha-blockers in special clinical settings, if available.

### The determination of real fluid requirements in laparoscopic resection of pheochromocytoma using minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring: a prospectively designed trial [^9d7f65c3]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

The marked increase in HR shown here was not observed in the only comparable study published by Joris et al. However, all patients in their investigation received beta blockers either intraoperatively or preoperatively. It is well known that hypotension due to SVR reduction (e.g. due to spinal anesthesia) results in both compensatory tachycardia and an increase in CO and is thereby best treated by applying alpha adrenoreceptor agonists but not excessive volume administration. Compatible to this, the two patients who required catecholamine infusions by the end of surgery in this study had normal or high CI but markedly reduced SVRI and failed to respond to fluid trials. Interestingly, both subjects were on beta blockers preoperatively and had low HR compared to the other PCC patients. Another patient (PCC #3) had comparably low SVRI (< 1000 dyn s cm −5 m −2) posttumor resection. This patient did not receive beta blocker therapy and had the highest CI, a HR of 110 bpm and normal ABP by the end of surgery. Thus, it seems possible that in the two patients with prolonged hypotension, the beta blockers inhibited compensatory tachycardia which is needed for normalization of ABP. Long-acting beta blockers should therefore be used with caution prior to surgery.

Genetic testing is often recommended in the following situations:

- Patients with a personal or family history of clinical features suggestive of a hereditary pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome.
- Patients with bilateral or multifocal tumors.
- Patients with sympathetic or malignant extra-adrenal paragangliomas.
- Patients diagnosed before age 40 years. Phenoxybenzamine is an effective treatment for catecholamine excess and metyrosine can be added if needed. The test is associated with a relatively high false-positive rate in patients with a lower baseline risk of pheochromocytoma. Measurement of plasma-free metanephrines has a high sensitivity but a relatively low specificity.
- Common medications.
- Physical or emotional stress.
- Inappropriately low reference ranges based on normal laboratory data rather than clinical data sets.
- Common foods that interfere with specific assays and medications. A mildly elevated catecholamine or metanephrine level is usually the result of assay interference caused by drugs or other factors. Patients with symptomatic pheochromocytoma almost always have increases in catecholamines or metanephrines two to three times higher than the upper limits of reference ranges.

### Diagnostic efficacy of unconjugated plasma metanephrines for the detection of pheochromocytoma… [^3073d1b1]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Patients were reexamined 1 and 3 months after surgery. Patients with pheochromocytoma and with histologically proved other adrenal tumors were studied before, during, and after surgery. Results. DIAGNOSIS OF pheochromocytoma still poses considerable problems, as almost half of patients initially have no or only paroxysmal hypertension or may even be asymptomatic. 1 Even the classic symptom triad of bilateral diffuse headache, sweating, and palpitations provides diagnostic accuracy of only 6%. 2 Autopsy studies show that the disease is not recognized in 20% to 75% of patients during life but represents the cause of death in half of them. 3, 4 Proper diagnosis of pheochromocytoma by highly sensitive biochemical tests therefore remains of paramount importance.

The aims of this study were to compare the diagnostic efficacy of plasma catecholamines and metanephrines, to investigate the suggested independence8 of plasma metanephrines of large increases in plasma catecholamine concentrations in patients with pheochromocytoma compared with those with histologically proved other adrenal tumors, and to observe the intraoperative time course of metanephrine and catecholamine levels in patients with pheochromocytoma. We studied 17 patients with pheochromocytoma and 14 patients with histologically verified other adrenal tumors. In 3 patients the diagnosis of MEN 2A was proved by identification of germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene. Fourteen patients with pheochromocytoma had sustained hypertension.

Two other patients had documented periods of intermittent hypertension. All patients with hypertension and an additional patient with normal blood pressure also reported symptoms of pheochromocytoma. Patients with histologically confirmed other adrenal diseases served as a reference group. Blood samples were also drawn from a central venous cannula immediately before and repeatedly after clipping of the adrenal vein to follow the time course of plasma metanephrine and catecholamine levels in 6 patients. All blood samples were transferred into prechilled heparinized tubes, immediately placed on ice, and centrifuged within 15 minutes to separate the plasma. All patients with pheochromcytoma were separated from all patients with other adrenal tumors by determination of plasma normetanephrine level.

Plasma metanephrine testing was falsely negative in 5 of the 17 patients with pheochromocytoma. However, these 5 patients had elevated normetanephrine concentrations. Thus, measurement of plasma normetanephrine with or without metanephrine was positive in all patients with pheochromocytoma. In contrast, plasma norepinephrine level was normal in 4 patients with pheochromocytoma. Plasma epinephrine level was normal in 9 of 17 patients with pheochromocytoma. Three of these patients had elevated plasma norepinephrine concentrations. Both plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were therefore normal in 3 of 17 patients with pheochromocytoma.

### Predictive factors for postoperative morbidity after laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma: a multicenter retrospective analysis in 225 patients [^49ad3adb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Since the 1950s, preoperative medical preparation has been widely applied in patients with pheochromocytoma to improve intraoperative hemodynamic instability and postoperative complications. However, advancements in preoperative imaging, laparoscopic surgical techniques, and anesthesia have considerably improved management in patients with pheochromocytoma. In consequence, there is no validated consensus on current predictive factors for postoperative morbidity. The aim of this study was to determine perioperative factors which are predictive for postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma.

Study Design

It is a retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained databases in five medical centers from 2002 to 2013. Inclusion criteria were consecutive patients who underwent non-converted laparoscopic unilateral total adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma.

Results

Two-hundred and twenty-five patients were included. All-cause and cardiovascular postoperative morbidity rates were 16% (n = 36) and 4.8% (n = 11), respectively. Preinduction blood pressure normalization after preoperative medical preparation had no impact on postoperative morbidity. However, past medical history of coronary artery disease (OR [CI95%] = 3.39; [1.317–8.727]) and incidence of intraoperative hemodynamic instability episodes (both SBP ≥ 160 mmHg and MAP < 60 mmHg) (OR [CI95%] = 3.092; [1.451–6.587]) remained independent predictors for postoperative all-cause morbidity. Similarly, past medical history of coronary artery disease (OR [CI95%] = 14.41; [3.119–66.57]), female sex (OR [CI95%] = 12.05; [1.807–80.31]), and incidence of intraoperative hemodynamic instability episodes (both SBP ≥ 200 mmHg and MAP < 60 mmHg) (OR [CI95%] = 4.13; [1.009–16.90]) remained independent predictors for postoperative cardiovascular morbidity.

Conclusions

This study identifies risk factors for cardiovascular and all-cause postoperative morbidity after laparoscopic adrenalectomy in current clinical setting. These data can help physicians to guide intra-operative blood pressure management and have to be taken into account in further studies.

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are distinctive neuroendocrine tumors which frequently produce excess catecholamines with resultant cardiovascular morbidity. These tumors have a strong genetic component, with up to 40% linked to hereditary pathogenic variants; therefore, germline genetic testing is recommended for all patients. Surgical resection offers the only potential cure in the case of localized disease. Given the potential for catecholaminergic crises, appropriate perioperative management is crucial, and all patients should undergo alpha-adrenergic blockade before resection. Therapeutic options for metastatic disease are limited and include surgical debulking, radiopharmaceutical therapies, and conventional chemotherapy.

### Efficacy of α-blockers on hemodynamic control during pheochromocytoma resection: a randomized controlled trial [^46a0236c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this first randomized controlled trial in patients scheduled for resection of a PPGL, we demonstrated that the cumulative time of blood pressure values outside the target range during PPGL surgery was not different after pretreatment with either phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin. Phenoxybenzamine was, however, more effective in preventing intraoperative systolic blood pressure above the target range and hemodynamic instability.

Treatment with an α-adrenergic receptor blocker prior to resection of a PPGL was first introduced in 1949 and has become part of routine clinical care since. All previous studies on the type of α-adrenergic receptor blocker were retrospective in design and suffered from several biases, such as the use of historical controls and the lack of a well-defined perioperative management protocol. In addition, these studies applied different blood pressure targets during surgery and raised conflicting results.

It should be noted that comparable intraoperative blood pressure levels can be achieved with the administration of a variable amount of vasoactive drugs and intravenous fluids by the anesthesiologist. The extent of these interventions has been acknowledged as a fundamental marker of hemodynamic instability. Therefore, we have recently developed and validated a clinical score for assessment of hemodynamic instability during surgery. Using this score as a secondary endpoint, we found a lesser degree of intraoperative hemodynamic instability after pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine. In particular, patients in the phenoxybenzamine group demonstrated a shorter duration of systolic blood pressure above 160 mmHg, a lower peak systolic blood pressure, and a concomitant lower requirement of vasodilating drugs. This might suggest that phenoxybenzamine offers a more effective inhibition of the α-adrenergic receptor than doxazosin, which could be explained by its noncompetitive antagonism compared to the competitive binding provided by doxazosin. Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine did not result in more severe or a longer duration of postoperative hypotension, as previously suggested. We assume that this risk was minimized by the concomitant use of a high-sodium diet and the intravenous administration of saline the day before surgery. The higher rate of co-administration of β-adrenergic receptor blockers among patients allocated to phenoxybenzamine can be explained by the occurrence of reflex tachycardia as a result of inhibition of the presynaptic α 2 -adrenergic receptor. Of note, neither the primary endpoint nor the hemodynamic instability score was affected by preoperative use of β-adrenergic receptor blockers.

Exploratory analyses

The primary endpoint in patients with (n = 11) or without (n = 123) a cardiovascular complication was 11.8% (4.9–33.0) and 11.3% (5.0–20.0), respectively (P = 0.26). The associated HI-scores were 59.0 (43.8–73.0) and 42.5 (29.3–59.0), respectively (P = 0.03). In patients with (n = 104) or without (n = 30) preoperative use of a β-adrenergic receptor blocker, the primary endpoint was 11.4% (5.2–21.0) and 10.8% (2.5–17.4), respectively (P = 0.32). In addition, the associated HI-scores were 43.5 (32.3–59.0) and 49.0 (23.8–59.8) (P = 0.84), respectively.

Univariate analysis demonstrated that tumor size, total plasma-free metanephrines, and total plasma catecholamines were positively associated with the primary endpoint. Use of doxazosin, tumor size, total plasma-free metanephrines, and total plasma catecholamines were positively associated with the HI-score. These variables were subsequently tested in the multivariable linear regression model with the HI-score as a dependent variable. Total plasma-free metanephrines did not contribute significantly to the model and was removed. Achievement of different blood pressure targets was added. The final model demonstrated that the use of doxazosin, tumor size, and total plasma catecholamines were positively associated with the HI-score. The total model accounted for only a minority of the variance in HI-score (adjusted R 2 = 0.16). Achievement of a supine blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg, irrespective of the upright blood pressure, was negatively associated with the HI-score. Upright systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg was independently associated with an increased HI-score.

### The mount sinai clinical pathway for the management of pheochromocytoma [^3a05d373]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Pheochromocytomas are complex tumors that require a comprehensive and systematic management plan orchestrated by a multidisciplinary team.

Methods

To achieve these ends, The Mount Sinai Adrenal Center hosted an interdisciplinary retreat where experts in adrenal disorders assembled with the aim of developing a clinical pathway for the management of pheochromocytomas.

Results

The result was a consensus for the diagnosis, perioperative management, and postoperative management of pheochromocytomas, with specific recommendations from our team of adrenal experts, as well as a review of the current literature.

Conclusion

Our clinical pathway can be applied by other institutions directly or may serve as a guide for institution-specific management.

### Efficacy of α-blockers on hemodynamic control during pheochromocytoma resection: a randomized controlled trial [^405857dc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

The primary endpoint of our study was the cumulative intraoperative time outside the blood pressure target range, expressed as a percentage of the time interval between induction of anesthesia (ie, first administration of propofol) and suturing of the incision. As a secondary efficacy endpoint, we used the Hemodynamic Instability score (HI-score), a validated semiquantitative score reflecting the degree of hemodynamic instability. In short, the HI-score consists of 3 intraoperative components: hemodynamic variables (ie, blood pressure and heart rate), cumulative dosage of vasoactive medication, and fluid therapy. For each of these 3 components, incremental points are attributed according to the magnitude of deviation from predefined thresholds as well as infusion rates of vasoactive drugs and fluids. Thus, a higher HI-score represents a higher degree of overall hemodynamic instability. For the present study, we modified the original HI-score by including the dosages of vasodilating drugs and β-adrenergic receptor blockers.

Other secondary efficacy endpoints were (i) the frequency, duration, and magnitude of a systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg; mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg; and heart rate > 100 bpm; (ii) number and cumulative dosages of intraoperatively administered vasoactive drugs; and (iii) duration of postoperative administration of vasopressive drugs. Safety endpoints were cardiovascular complications and mortality from the first administration of study medication until 30 days after surgery. In addition, the frequency of postoperative glucose levels ≤ 3.5 mmol/L and length of hospital stay were assessed. Preoperative adverse events were assessed and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.

### Nonclassic presentation of pheochromocytoma: difficulties in diagnosis and management of the normotensive patient [^ccf7f3d2]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report an unusual presentation of pheochromocytoma along with challenges in diagnosis and management.

Methods

We report a clinical case history and describe diagnostic methods and pitfalls. The preoperative medical preparation in a normotensive patient is described.

Results

A 33-year-old man fell off a ladder, resulting in C6 paraplegia. After C7-T1 laminectomy, he was transferred to a rehabilitation center where he reported lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and chest pain during therapy sessions. A left adrenal mass was incidentally discovered during the workup to rule out a pulmonary embolism. He reported no history of hypertension, and no elevated blood pressure readings had been documented. Magnetic resonance imaging of the adrenal glands showed a well-defined left adrenal mass measuring 3.9 x 3.2 x 3.3 cm, which was hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Twenty-four hour urinary catecholamine concentrations were unremarkable; urinary metanephrines were markedly elevated. During hospital admission, blood pressure was in the low to normotensive range, requiring a cautious approach to alpha-adrenergic blockade and surgical preparation. He under-went uneventful laparoscopic left adrenalectomy; surgical pathology was consistent with pheochromocytoma.

Conclusions

This case illustrates a nonclassic presentation of pheochromocytoma and demonstrates that urinary catecholamines alone are not sufficient for a biochemical diagnosis of large pheochromocytomas. Preoperative preparation in normotensive patients can be achieved with alpha-adrenergic blockade, hydration, and liberal salt intake.

### Preoperative α-blockade in phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma: is it always necessary? [^7c725760]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Resection of phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) is traditionally preceded by alpha-blockade to prevent complications of haemodynamic instability intraoperatively. While there is general agreement on preoperative alpha-blockade for classic PPGLs presenting with hypertension, it is less clear whether alpha-blockade is necessary in predominantly dopamine-secreting tumours, normotensive PPGLs, as well as tumours that appear to be biochemically 'silent'. Preoperative management of these 'atypical' PPGLs is challenging and the treatment approach must be individualized, carefully weighing the risk of intraoperative hypertension against the possibility of orthostatic and prolonged postoperative hypotension. Consideration of antihypertensive medication pharmacology in the light of catecholamine physiology and PPGL secretory profile will facilitate the formulation of individualized preoperative preparatory strategies.

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: executive summary [^9fa3a3a4]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Adrenalectomy — operative approach and minimally invasive technique: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy has become accepted as the gold-standard approach for most small benign adrenal pathology because studies show decreased pain, shorter hospitalizations, and more rapid recovery compared with open adrenalectomy, although there have been no prospective randomized trials comparing laparoscopic to open adrenalectomy. Both laparoscopic transabdominal adrenalectomy and posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy (PRA) are effective and safe; some studies suggest less pain and faster recovery after PRA and additional advantages in patients with extensive abdominal surgical history and/or bilateral tumors. When patient and tumor characteristics are appropriate, we recommend minimally invasive adrenalectomy over open adrenalectomy because of improved perioperative morbidity (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence), and we recommend either a retroperitoneal or transperitoneal approach because of similar perioperative outcomes, with approach choice determined by surgeon expertise and tumor/patient characteristics (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Regarding surgical interventions for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, more specifically with respect to indications for adrenalectomy, ES 2014 guidelines recommend to consider performing partial adrenalectomy in selected patients (hereditary pheochromocytoma, small tumors undergone contralateral complete adrenalectomy), in order to spare the adrenal cortex and prevent permanent hypocortisolism.

Results

Participants

A total of 144 patients were enrolled in the trial. Four patients were excluded from all analyses because the allocated treatment was never initiated, leaving 140 patients who completed the study. Notably, in 6 patients the final pathology report did not reveal a PPGL. Thus, a total of 134 patients met the criteria for the modified intention-to-treat population (phenoxybenzamine group: n = 66, doxazosin group: n = 68). The safety analysis was performed using the data of all 140 patients who completed the study.

Baseline characteristics and preoperative blood pressure values are presented in Table 1. There were no differences between the 2 groups with respect to demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical score, plasma free (nor)metanephrine, or catecholamine secretion patterns. The median duration of pretreatment was 14 days in both groups, and patients received a median dosage of 120 (78–140) mg phenoxybenzamine or 40 (32–48) mg doxazosin on the day before surgery. A calcium channel blocker was administered to 42.4% of the patients in the phenoxybenzamine group compared to 39.7% in the doxazosin group (P = 0.86). A higher proportion of patients in the phenoxybenzamine group received metoprolol (89.4% vs. 66.2%, P < .01), which was also prescribed at higher dosages.

### Sensitivity of diagnostic and localization tests for pheochromocytoma in clinical practice… [^c8050e05]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Background Although pheochromocytomas are believed to account for fewer than 0. 3% of all cases of hypertension, aggressive diagnostic and surgical intervention is recommended whenever a pheochromocytoma is suspected because uncontrolled catecholamine release from the tumors can lead to catastrophic consequences. Many biochemical diagnostic and imaging localization tests exist for detecting pheochromocytomas. We sought to evaluate the sensitivity of these tests used over a 35-year period at a single institution. The most sensitive laboratory diagnostic tests in our study were plasma total catecholamines and urine total metanephrines. Testing for urine vanillylmandelic acid, while less expensive and easier to perform than many other tests, had a slightly lower sensitivity. The most sensitive imaging tests in the study were magnetic resonance imaging and iodine I-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy.

The more often used computed tomography had only 88% sensitivity. Localization was safely and successfully performed on two pregnant patients using magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound. PHEOCHROMOCYTOMAS arise from pheochromocytes, the primary cells of the adrenal medulla, which are also found in the paraganglia near the aorta and in the sympathetic nervous system ganglia. Most frequently, symptoms are present when large amounts of catecholamines enter the circulation, which can be triggered by changes in position, increased abdominal pressure, trauma, labor, anesthesia, surgery, stress, or the ingestion of certain drugs or foods. 1 Although pheochromocytomas are believed to account for fewer than 0.

3% of all cases of hypertension, aggressive diagnostic and surgical intervention is recommended whenever a pheochromocytoma is suspected because the uncontrolled catecholamine release from the tumors can lead to malignant hypertension, cerebrovascular accidents, or myocardial infarction. 2, 3. Because approximately 10% of pheochromocytomas are extra-adrenal and 10% are bilateral, accurate preoperative localization of the tumor is imperative for safe, expeditious surgical management. 4 Older imaging techniques, including retroperitoneal air insufflation, angiography., and venography, have largely been replaced by ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and iodine I-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy.

4 Computed tomography is believed to be the best available technique for detecting adrenal lesions, and ultrasound and MRI are useful in pregnant patients; MIBG scintigraphy has been especially useful in localizing extra-adrenal and recurrent pheochromocytomas.
4. Biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is traditionally performed by examining plasma and total urinary levels of catecholamines and their metabolites over 24 hours. 1, 5–10 Recent studies have indicated that urine total metanephrines is the most sensitive laboratory test for pheochromocytoma. 1, 6, 7, 10, 11. After institutional review board approval, all patients who were treated for pheochromocytoma at the University of Chicago Hospitals were identified from records found in the tumor registry and the surgery, pathology, and anesthesia departments. Of the 51 cases identified, 37 had complete records available from the medical records department.

### Efficacy of α-blockers on hemodynamic control during pheochromocytoma resection: a randomized controlled trial [^c663a500]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Pretreatment with α-adrenergic receptor blockers is recommended to prevent hemodynamic instability during resection of a pheochromocytoma or sympathetic paraganglioma (PPGL).

Objective

To determine which type of α-adrenergic receptor blocker provides the best efficacy.

Design

Randomized controlled open-label trial (PRESCRIPT; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01379898).

Setting

Multicenter study including 9 centers in The Netherlands.

Patients

134 patients with nonmetastatic PPGL.

Intervention

Phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin starting 2 to 3 weeks before surgery using a blood pressure targeted titration schedule. Intraoperative hemodynamic management was standardized.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary efficacy endpoint was the cumulative intraoperative time outside the blood pressure target range (ie, SBP > 160 mmHg or MAP < 60 mmHg) expressed as a percentage of total surgical procedure time. Secondary efficacy endpoint was the value on a hemodynamic instability score.

Results

Median cumulative time outside blood pressure targets was 11.1% (interquartile range [IQR]: 4.3–20.6] in the phenoxybenzamine group compared to 12.2% (5.3–20.2)] in the doxazosin group (P = 0.75, r = 0.03). The hemodynamic instability score was 38.0 (28.8–58.0) and 50.0 (35.3–63.8) in the phenoxybenzamine and doxazosin group, respectively (P = 0.02, r = 0.20). The 30-day cardiovascular complication rate was 8.8% and 6.9% in the phenoxybenzamine and doxazosin group, respectively (P = 0.68). There was no mortality after 30 days.

Conclusions

The duration of blood pressure outside the target range during resection of a PPGL was not different after preoperative treatment with either phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin. Phenoxybenzamine was more effective in preventing intraoperative hemodynamic instability, but it could not be established whether this was associated with a better clinical outcome.

### Takotsubo syndrome as initial presentation of pheochromocytoma in young children: case report and literature review [^f5d26285]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Adrenalectomy remains the only definitive treatment for pheochromocytoma. In our case, multidisciplinary collaboration — particularly with cardiology — was instrumental in identifying the underlying etiology and ensuring perioperative stability. Most of the literature we can find about PHEO-TLC didn't mention the preoperative blood pressure, except for one case of hypotension on rare occasions. In contrast, part of the literature describes poor blood pressure control before surgery. In our review, five cases did not meet the international consensus recommendations for preoperative optimization. Due to the absence of pediatric-specific guidelines for the treatment of pheochromocytoma, we referred to adult guidelines and international consensus, which advise 7–14 days of pharmacologic preparation to achieve hemodynamic goals. Specifically, target blood pressure should be below the 90th percentile for age, and heart rate should fall between the 10th and 90th percentiles based on age-based reference charts. This consensus also note that longer durations may be necessary in pediatric patients. Nonetheless, even with alpha-blockade, perioperative hemodynamic instability remains common. Some studies have further suggested that prolonged alpha-blockade may increase the risk of intraoperative hypotension. More recently, evidence has emerged indicating that in selected cases, pheochromocytoma surgery may be safely performed without routine preoperative pharmacologic preparation, without significantly increasing complications.

While we recognize the importance of achieving hemodynamic stability to reduce intraoperative fluctuations and the risk of cardiogenic shock, we recommend proceeding with surgery in pediatric patients who fail to achieve target blood pressure and heart rate after more than two weeks of medical management, in order to prevent irreversible cardiovascular complications. In our case, involvement of a multidisciplinary team — including the pediatric cardiologists — was instrumental in identifying the underlying etiology and ensuring perioperative stability.

### Unexpected pheochromocytoma leading to cardiac arrest during the perioperative period: a case report and literature review [^0683ede9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The perioperative period of patients with PCCs requires comprehensive management. Without adequate preparation of PCCs, the release of excessive amounts of CAs, especially during anaesthetic induction or surgical removal, can produce life-threatening cardiovascular complications and other systemic disturbances. Preoperative sequential use of alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade and volume expansion followed by beta blockade is helpful for achieving cardiovascular stability and decreasing uncontrolled intraoperative surges in blood pressure. The use of β-blockers should be maintained when tachycardia and tachyarrhythmias are present, but they should always be administered after effective control of hypertension with α-blockade; on average, β-blockers may be used 3 days after the introduction of α-blockade. Compared with anaesthetic drugs and procedures, surgery for PCC removal is associated with hypertensive emergencies, and tumour size and location affect the number of crises and the dose of antihypertensives used. Therefore, for anaesthesiologists, sufficient preoperative preparation should include determining the location and size of the tumour. Safe anaesthesia still depends on adequate preoperative preparation and assessment together with careful monitoring during the perioperative period. In terms of anaesthesia methods for patients with PCC, combined epidural-general anaesthesia was not effective in attenuating hypertensive responses but could have exacerbated perioperative hypotension. Perioperative haemodynamic management in patients with PCC requires a thorough understanding of the pharmacology of various drugs. Additional antihypertensive (mainly alpha-blocking) agents are also essential to prevent and overcome hypertensive crises during anaesthesia. Preoperative and intraoperative beta-blockade can only be used as adjuvant therapy, mainly to control tachycardia and other rhythm disturbances. Nonselective β-adrenergic blockade should not be used as the treatment of choice for PCC patients before α-blockade is administered because cardiovascular collapse may occur. Compared with esmolol, landiolol is a better choice because of its high cardioselectivity, high β1 selectivity and receptor affinity, resulting in a more potent chronotropic effect and a less potent hypotensive effect. As reported in our case, if a PCC is misdiagnosed, preoperative preparation is incomplete, and serious cardiovascular events may occur during anaesthesia induction. When severe hypertension and tachycardia occur, the importance of alpha-blocking agents should be prioritized, since excessive and frequent use of esmolol might be associated with severe secondary hypotension and cardiac arrest. Fortunately, we identified cardiac arrest early and implemented cardiopulmonary resuscitation as early as possible, which provided valuable time for the recovery of the patient's heart function. The patient was saved because multidisciplinary comprehensive treatment was performed during the perioperative period.

Men2 — pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma evaluation and surveillance — patients with MEN2 should be evaluated for a coexisting PCC before anesthesia or any invasive procedure using plasma‑free or 24‑hour urine‑fractionated metanephrines and normetanephrines, and concurrent medications should be reviewed for those that may interfere with plasma metanephrines evaluation; elevations that are three times above the upper limit of normal are diagnostic, both catecholamines and metanephrines/normetanephrines can represent false‑positive results, and preoperative medical therapy with alpha blockade, volume repletion, and high salt diet is required. Genetic counseling and testing should be offered to individuals with a clinical diagnosis of MEN2, and surveillance PCC/PGL should start by age 11 for high‑ and highest‑risk children and by age 16 for moderate‑risk children; surveillance comprises an annual measurement of plasma‑free metanephrines or 24‑hour urine for fractionated metanephrines and adrenal imaging with CT or MRI in patients with positive biochemical results.
