lung adenocarcinoma meta to femur, cause pathological frature

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how lung adenocarcinoma metastasis to the femur causes pathological fracture and what that implies for diagnosis, risk assessment, surgical management, and prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological mechanisms by which lung adenocarcinoma destroys bone. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and anatomic predilection in the femur. Next, I will review how to identify impending versus completed fractures and quantify risk. After that, I need to examine surgical decision-making and fixation choices, including when to use nailing versus arthroplasty. I will then consider perioperative radiation and bone-modifying agents. Finally, I should assess prognosis and survival, and close with a concise synthesis that ties mechanism to management and outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the biological mechanism. Lung adenocarcinoma typically produces osteolytic bone metastases via cytokine-mediated osteoclast activation, leading to cortical destruction and loss of structural integrity, which predisposes to pathological fracture even with minimal trauma or normal weight-bearing, and this lytic phenotype is well described in lung cancer bone metastases [^111mKLVV] [^112vaWZN].

> I need to check the epidemiology and anatomic distribution. Bone metastases occur in roughly 20–40% of patients with lung cancer, and among those with bone metastases, about 9–29% will sustain a pathological fracture, with the femur being the most common site of appendicular involvement and accounting for a large proportion of fractures, which aligns with imaging series and guideline summaries [^117NiB7B] [^112vaWZN] [^114VQ7YV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fracture risk without quantification. I should verify how we identify impending versus completed fractures. Clinically, impending fractures present with progressive pain and pain with weight-bearing, while radiographically we look for lytic lesions and cortical involvement; the Mirels score remains widely used, but I should double-check its limitations and whether newer tools outperform it. Indeed, Mirels has modest specificity and interobserver variability, whereas CT-based structural rigidity analysis and CT-derived strain fold ratio improve prediction, and a simple radiographic threshold of axial cortical involvement greater than 30 mm strongly predicts fracture risk, which I should integrate into decision-making [^112bpJar] [^116eKPn7] [^117GAY4e] [^115KvnW1].

> Next, I should review surgical indications and timing. Let me verify guideline recommendations: for long-bone metastases with a solitary well-defined lytic lesion involving more than 50% of the cortex, or persistent pain despite radiation, and with expected survival beyond about 4 weeks, prophylactic fixation is recommended to prevent pathological fracture, with intramedullary nailing preferred for femoral shaft and peritrochanteric lesions when bone stock permits, and arthroplasty favored for femoral neck or head involvement or extensive proximal disease [^111dnzzU] [^112xm5Dj] [^113typN9].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative outcomes of prophylactic versus post-fracture fixation. Prophylactic stabilization is associated with less blood loss, shorter hospital stay, higher likelihood of discharge to home, and better ambulation recovery compared with fixation of completed fractures, and observational data suggest improved survival with prophylaxis, although confounding by disease burden is likely; nonetheless, the functional advantages are consistent and clinically meaningful [^116UnSUV] [^11579se2] [^112tZPLe].

> I will now examine fixation choices and durability. Intramedullary nailing provides immediate load sharing and pain relief with low rates of local progression around the implant, though actual fractures and prior radiotherapy increase risks of implant breakage and revision, which argues for cement augmentation in selected cases and closer follow-up after completed fractures; for proximal femoral lesions involving the head/neck or with extensive bone loss, modular endoprosthetic replacement offers durable reconstruction and may reduce the need for adjuvant radiation, albeit with higher complication rates such as dislocation [^1134vR3R] [^116zG1L3] [^112Gb1HP] [^113U3UeR].

> But wait, what if the lesion is solitary and the diagnosis is uncertain. I should confirm the role of biopsy. In new solitary proximal femoral lesions, biopsy changes management in a meaningful minority by revealing sarcoma, hematologic malignancy, or a second primary, so obtaining histology before definitive fixation is prudent to avoid inappropriate non-oncologic surgery and to guide systemic therapy and prognosis [^111igvSX] [^113S32ES] [^113hAk9W].

> Next, I should review perioperative radiation and bone-modifying agents. Postoperative radiation is commonly recommended 2–4 weeks after fixation to improve local control and function, and although high-quality randomized evidence is limited, retrospective series and guidelines support its use; multi-fraction regimens may reduce fracture risk compared with single-fraction in some contexts, while single-fraction 8 Gy remains effective for pain palliation but with higher re-treatment rates, so regimen choice should balance pain control, fracture risk, and life expectancy [^112xm5Dj] [^114N1yHB] [^111VdJoM] [^1172a8B5].

> I need to ensure bone health therapy is addressed. Bone-modifying agents such as denosumab and zoledronic acid reduce skeletal-related events and can modestly improve survival in lung cancer with bone metastases; denosumab may prolong time to first SRE more than zoledronic acid, and both should be considered in appropriate patients with attention to renal function for bisphosphonates and hypocalcemia risk for denosumab [^117NiB7B] [^114LGBGH] [^116chsGd].

> Now, prognosis and survival. Let me verify the figures. Median survival after bone metastasis from lung cancer is approximately 7–12 months, with 1-year survival around 30–44% and 2-year survival near 11–26%, and worse outcomes in patients with pathological fractures, poor performance status, visceral metastases, and non-responders to modern systemic therapy; responders to biologic agents or targeted therapy have markedly better postoperative survival, and early mortality after femur surgery is driven by intertrochanteric location, low albumin, leukocytosis, and elevated ALT, which should inform surgical selection and perioperative planning [^1178gyhb] [^117Dk2uz] [^113ii1Nx] [^117K65Fr].

> Hold on, I should verify perioperative risks and complications. Thirty-day mortality after pathological femur fracture surgery is about 2–3% in large series, with higher risks in older patients, those with lung cancer, higher comorbidity, and those requiring transfusion; complications include infection, implant failure, and cement-related events such as bone cement implantation syndrome, which, while rare, can be fatal and mandates vigilant intraoperative monitoring and preparedness [^117K65Fr] [^114Rdhpr].

> Let me synthesize the causal pathway to ensure coherence. Lung adenocarcinoma metastasizes to bone and induces osteolytic destruction, particularly in weight-bearing regions like the proximal femur; progressive cortical loss and pain with load predict impending fracture, and without prophylactic stabilization, many progress to pathological fracture, which worsens pain, mobility, and survival; timely fixation, tailored to lesion location and bone quality, plus adjuvant radiation and bone-modifying therapy, restores function and mitigates skeletal-related events in appropriately selected patients [^111mKLVV] [^111dnzzU] [^113typN9].

Lung adenocarcinoma metastasis to the femur causes **pathological fractures** by replacing bone with tumor, leading to cortical destruction and mechanical failure [^112vaWZN]. These fractures typically occur in the proximal femur [^113S32ES] and present with pain, deformity, and loss of function [^111mKLVV]. Management is **multidisciplinary**, with surgical stabilization (intramedullary nailing or arthroplasty) [^112xm5Dj] followed by radiotherapy [^111dnzzU] and bone-modifying agents (denosumab or zoledronic acid) [^117NiB7B] to relieve pain, restore function, and reduce skeletal-related events [^113typN9]. Prognosis is poor, with median survival of 6–12 months [^1178gyhb]; survival is better with solitary lesions, good performance status, and systemic therapy [^1178gyhb].

## Pathophysiology of pathological fracture in lung adenocarcinoma

- **Bone invasion**: Tumor cells replace normal bone, causing osteolysis and cortical thinning [^112vaWZN].
- **Mechanical failure**: Cortical destruction reduces load-bearing capacity, causing fracture with minimal trauma [^112vaWZN].
- **Common sites**: Proximal femur is the most frequent site of pathological fracture due to weight-bearing stress [^113HHTKg].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Pain**: Persistent, progressive pain in the hip or thigh, often worsened by weight-bearing [^112nofFL].
- **Deformity**: Visible deformity or shortening of the limb [^notfound].
- **Functional impairment**: Difficulty walking or inability to bear weight [^116YUVAc].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Weight loss, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms from the primary tumor [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging studies

- **Plain radiographs**: First-line to identify lytic lesions and cortical destruction [^112vaWZN].
- **CT scan**: Assesses extent of bone destruction and soft tissue involvement [^notfound].
- **MRI**: Evaluates marrow involvement and soft tissue extension [^112nofFL].
- **Bone scan**: Detects additional metastatic lesions [^notfound].

---

### Laboratory tests

Laboratory tests include a **complete blood count** to assess anemia and overall health, and a **biochemical profile** to evaluate calcium, renal, and liver function. Tumor markers such as CEA and CA-125 may be elevated but are nonspecific [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Surgical management

- **Intramedullary nailing**: Preferred for diaphyseal and subtrochanteric lesions; allows immediate weight-bearing and pain relief [^112xm5Dj].
- **Arthroplasty**: Used for proximal femur lesions involving the femoral head or neck; provides durable reconstruction [^112xm5Dj].
- **Prophylactic fixation**: Recommended for impending fractures with > 50% cortical involvement or persistent pain despite radiation [^1174aoXT].

---

### Non-surgical management

Non-surgical management includes **external beam radiation therapy** for pain relief and local control [^115zLe1n], and **bone-modifying agents** such as denosumab or zoledronic acid to reduce skeletal-related events and improve survival [^117NiB7B] [^114LGBGH].

---

## Prognosis and survival

Median survival after pathological femur fracture is **6–12 months** [^notfound], with better outcomes in patients with solitary bone lesions, good performance status, and those receiving systemic therapy [^113ii1Nx]. Poor prognostic factors include multiple bone metastases, visceral metastases, and poor performance status [^117K65Fr].

---

## Complications

Complications include **infection** — both surgical site and deep infections — as well as implant failure, including hardware breakage and loosening [^116zG1L3]. Pulmonary complications such as pneumonia and pulmonary embolism can occur, and recurrence of pain or fracture may necessitate additional interventions [^112URPAU].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

A **team-based approach** involving orthopedic surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and palliative care specialists is essential for optimal outcomes [^116jYSPP]. Goals of care focus on pain control, restoration of function, and improvement of quality of life [^111mKLVV].

---

Lung adenocarcinoma metastasis to the femur causes **pathological fractures** through bone destruction and mechanical failure. Management requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, with surgical stabilization, radiotherapy, and bone-modifying agents to relieve pain, restore function, and reduce skeletal-related events. Prognosis remains poor, but selected patients with solitary lesions and good performance status may benefit from aggressive systemic therapy [^1178gyhb].

### What factors are associated with early mortality in patients undergoing femur surgery for metastatic lung cancer? [^117Dk2uz]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pathologic fractures of the femur resulting from metastasis severely increase mortality in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, factors associated with early mortality after surgery have not been elucidated.

Questions/Purposes

The purpose of this study was to identify clinical and laboratory factors available to surgeons before surgery for a metastatic femur in patients with metastatic lung cancer that might be associated with mortality at 1 and 3 months.

Methods

Between 2010 and 2014 we treated 126 patients for pathologic fracture of the femur caused by NSCLC. Of those, complete data sets for the parameters of interest (including clinical factors, laboratory factors, and survivorship) were available in 105 (83%). The factors we considered included sex, age, fracture location, surgical procedure, postoperative complications, blood cell counts, serum biomarkers, genetic alterations of primary cancer, chemotherapeutic agents, preoperative radiation therapy, pleural effusion, bone and internal organ metastasis, performance scores, and medical center where the treatment was performed. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with mortality at 1 and 3 months.

Results

Intertrochanteric location was associated with a higher risk of death (odds ratio [OR], 17.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.65–109.5), lower serum albumin level was associated with an increased risk of death (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.028–0.60), and availability of a suitable chemotherapeutic target agent was associated with a lower risk of death (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.08–0.91) within 3 months of surgery. Undergoing reconstruction with an endoprosthesis was associated with a higher risk of death (OR, 48.3; 95% CI, 1.7–1329) and elevated serum leukocyte count (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.4) and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were associated with a higher risk of death (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0–1.2) within 1 month of surgery.

Conclusions

Although the risk factors for early mortality need to be validated by prospective studies, surgical options need to be reconsidered in patients with femoral metastases from NSCLS showing high ALT or leukocytosis on the preoperative blood test.

Musculoskeletal emergencies

Pathological fracture

The bone is a very common site of metastatic disease, with lung cancer being the second most common primary tumour following breast cancer. Ultimately 30–65% of patients with metastatic lung cancer will have bone metastases and 9–29% of patients with bone metastases will develop a pathological fracture. Ninety percent of pathological fractures will need to be treated surgically. Pathological fractures have a significant negative effect on quality of life and increase mortality. A pathological fracture is defined as a fracture that occurs in abnormal bone, either malignant or non-malignant in nature. Non-malignant pathological fractures are mainly caused by osteoporosis induced by longstanding use of corticoid steroids (Fig. 12). Most common sites of a pathological fracture in metastatic tumours are the femur (44%), lumbar column (17%) and humerus (11%). A pathological fracture should be suspected when a fracture occurs after a minor trauma or during daily activities.

Fig. 12
Subcapital insufficiency fracture of the right femur in a 77-year-old woman with stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. The patient developed extensive radiation pneumonitis, which was treated with high-dose glucocorticoids for 1 year, probably causing a greater rate of bone loss with subsequent insufficiency fracture. a Coronal non-enhanced CT image in bone window, performed 1 month prior to the fracture, shows no signs of metastatic bone involvement in the right hip. b Supine X-ray of the right hip shows a subcapital fracture of the right femur without associated osteolytic bone destruction. Absence of malignancy was confirmed on histopathological examination of the femoral head after total hip replacement

Conventional radiography is the first-line imaging modality of choice. Pathological fractures in lung cancer patients are typically caused by osteolytic metastasis, visible as radiolucent areas. CT can be useful in areas which are difficult to assess due to overlying bone structures such as the spine and pelvis. A mass around the fracture site (which is often better appreciated on MRI) is indicative of an underlying neoplasm (Fig. 13). In contrast to other primaries, lung cancer commonly spreads to the cortical bone with formation of the typical cortical metastases or so-called "cookie-bite lesions".

Long bone metastasis operative management — intramedullary nailing is generally regarded as the preferred operative approach, and standard total joint arthroplasty of the proximal femur is very useful for pathologic fractures of the femoral head and neck and for intertrochanteric fractures that have metastases in the neck and head of the femur. Operative intervention for metastatic fractures of long bones provides a good functional result in approximately 80% to 85% of patients; a good analgesic effect is accomplished in the majority of patients. Radiotherapy should be performed 2 to 4 weeks following the orthopedic procedure, with a typical schedule of 30 Gy in 10 fractions, although The British Association of Surgical Oncologists guidelines recommends 20 Gy in 5 fractions.

### The importance of awaiting biopsy results in solitary pathological proximal femoral fractures: Do we need to biopsy solitary pathological fractures? [^111igvSX]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Taking into account the urgent need to establish a definitive diagnosis prior to a surgical intervention, the impact of delay caused by initiating a biopsy (inpatient stay, postoperative complications, or overall morbidity and mortality) should be minimized.

One in 12 patients had a discrepancy between biopsy and post-resection histology; in this cohort, the morbidity associated with biopsy and the delay in initiating treatment may be viewed as unnecessary because the biopsy did not influence the final histology. However, in 24% of patients with new solitary lesion with a history of previous malignancy, the biopsy differed from the previous malignancy, i.e. a second malignancy was diagnosed.

Metastatic patterns of disease from autopsy reports and cancer registries show prostate, breast, lung, and renal carcinoma are the main causes of bone metastases. However, bone metastases are often not specified by the primary site. Approximately 60% of impending or complete pathological fractures are located in the proximal femur causing disability and reduced quality of life. – The present study describes the incidence of tumor types in patients with solitary proximal femoral (impending) fractures and highlights that a substantial proportion of solitary pathological fractures have a primary bone sarcoma or hematological malignancy, with and without a previous history of malignancy. This therefore justifies to biopsy these lesions to prevent inadvertent or inappropriate treatments in a significant number of patients.

The exact histological diagnosis is of clinical significance to the surgical management of pathological fractures by informing accurate prognosis. – The representation of histotypes with intent-to-cure options in both patients with (> 30%) and without (60%) malignant history was higher than expected. Zhang et. al. reported that over one-fifth of new bone lesions in patients with previous malignancy were second malignancies, of which 3.4% were newly discovered primary malignant bone tumors. Previous literature reported up to 18% of biopsy results identified new bone tumors unrelated to a previous malignancy. – The present study shows a greater proportion of patients (24%) in whom a second primary malignancy was identified. This may reflect the nature of a tertiary referral center, a supraregional orthopedic oncology center responsible for the management of patients with primary malignant bone tumors. Referrals may be subject to a certain degree of prereferral selection bias and reflect an intention to exclude sarcoma. Lesions that are more likely to represent metastases from a carcinoma or hematological malignancy may not be referred to as often as those in which the radiology is less indicative or where a real diagnostic conundrum exists.

### Should the use of biologic agents in patients with renal and lung cancer affect our surgical management of femoral metastases? [^113ii1Nx]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Biologic agents may prolong survival of patients with certain kidney and lung adenocarcinomas that have metastasized to bone, and patient response to these agents should be considered when choosing between an endoprosthesis and internal fixation for surgical treatment of femoral metastases.

Questions/Purposes

Among patients undergoing surgery for femoral metastases of lung or renal cell carcinoma, (1) Does survival differ between patients who receive only cytotoxic chemotherapy and those who either respond or do not respond to biologic therapy? (2) Does postsurgical incidence of local disease progression differ between groups stratified by systemic treatment and response? (3) Does implant survival differ among groups stratified by systemic treatment and response?

Methods

From our institutional longitudinally maintained orthopaedic database, patients were identified by a query initially identifying all patients who carried a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma or lung carcinoma. Patients who underwent internal fixation or prosthetic reconstruction between 2000 and 2016 for pathologic fracture of the femur and who survived ≥ 1 year after surgery were studied. Patients who received either traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy or a biologic agent were included. Patients were classified as responders or nonresponders to biologic agents based on whether they had clinical and imaging evidence of a response recorded on two consecutive office visits over ≥ 6 months. Endpoints were overall survival from the time of diagnosis, survival after the femoral operation, evidence of disease progression in the femoral operative site, and symptomatic local disease progression for which revision surgery was necessary. Our analysis included 148 patients with renal (n = 26) and lung (n = 122) adenocarcinoma. Fifty-one patients received traditional chemotherapy only. Of 97 patients who received a biologic agent, 41 achieved a response (stabilization/regression of visceral metastases), whereas 56 developed disease progression. We analyzed overall patient survival with the Kaplan-Meier method and used the log-rank test to identify significant differences (p < 0.05) between groups.

Results

One-year survival after surgery among patients responsive to biologic therapy was 61% compared with 20% among patients nonresponsive to biologics (p < 0.001) and 10% among those who received chemotherapy only (p < 0.009). With the number of patients we had to study, we could not detect any difference in local progression of femoral disease associated with systemic treatment and response. Radiologic evidence of periimplant local disease progression developed in three (7%) of 41 patients who responded to biologic treatment, two (3%) of 56 patients nonresponsive to biologics, and one (2%) of 51 patients treated with traditional chemotherapy. With the numbers of patients we had, we could not detect a difference in patients who underwent revision. All three patients responsive to biologics who developed local recurrence underwent revision, whereas the two without a response to biologics did not.

Conclusions

Biologic therapy improves the overall longevity of some patients with lung and renal metastases to the femur in whom a visceral disease response occurred. In our limited cohort, we could not demonstrate an implant survival difference between such patients and those with shorter survival who may have had more aggressive disease. However, an increased life expectancy beyond 1 year among patients responsive to biologics may increase risk of mechanical failure of fixation constructs.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: treatment of metastatic carcinoma and myeloma of the femur [^114VQ7YV]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline — management of metastatic or myelomatous lesions of the femur — provides a practical and vetted set of recommendations based on a systematic review and expert consensus, and the goal is not to dictate patient care; although final surgical decision-making resides with surgeons, the guideline will assist medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and primary care physicians, and recommendations are relevant regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, or socioeconomic status. The skeleton is a frequent site of metastatic carcinoma and myeloma, with National Cancer Institute estimates of new cases in 2017 at 252,710 for breast, 222,500 for lung, 161,360 for prostate, and 63,990 for kidney; autopsy studies report bone metastases of approximately 70% in patients with breast or prostate cancer and 35% in patients with lung or kidney cancer, and the annual incidence of multiple myeloma in the United States is 3–4 cases/100,000 people. Skeletal related events (SREs) are typically defined as pathologic fracture (vertebral and/or nonvertebral), radiation therapy to bone, surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression, and the definition may or may not include hypercalcemia of malignancy; SREs have been seen in 43% of breast cancer patients with bone metastases and 20–50% of patients with bone metastases from lung cancer. In patients with breast cancer bone metastases, studies have shown a fracture rate of 17% and mortality rates in the post-SRE period of 21% for patients with a single SRE and 33.5% for patients with multiple SREs.

Palliation of bone metastases — initial approach and goals: Bone metastases are a common manifestation of malignancy that can cause severe and debilitating effects, and the presence of bone metastases represents stage IV disease; thus, cure essentially is not possible, so elimination or reduction of pain is the primary goal of treatment. There are no randomized prospective studies that directly compare radiation to pharmacotherapy for the management of pain due to bony metastases, and if a metastasis occurs in a weight-bearing bone, prophylactic surgical stabilization should be considered before a pathologic fracture occurs. Periosteal inflammation and elevation is the most common mechanism behind the pain from bone metastases, lung cancer metastases to bone are predominantly lytic, and external-beam radiation should therefore be considered as the initial nonpharmacologic method.

### The importance of awaiting biopsy results in solitary pathological proximal femoral fractures: Do we need to biopsy solitary pathological fractures? [^116bTPGn]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Survival in Patients with Solitary Lesions

Patients with a solitary lesion and a previous history of cancer (n = 24) had a median OS of 9 months (range 4–22), and 1-, 2- and 5-year survival rates from diagnosis of 44% (95% CI 23–62%), 26% (95% CI 11–45%), and 16% (95% CI 4–34%), respectively (Table 1, Fig. 3).

The median overall survival for patients with solitary lesions without a history of cancer (n = 61) was 12 months (range 4–31). The 1-, 2- and 5-year survival rates from presentation were 61% (95% CI 47–73%), 49% (95% CI 35–62%), and 18% (95% CI 7–32%), respectively. Seventeen patients had no evidence of disease (NED; n = 11) or were alive with disease (AWD; n = 6) at final follow-up (Table 1, Fig. 3). Those with a diagnosis of a hematological malignancy demonstrated the best overall survival based on histological diagnosis (1- and 2-year survival of 100 and 90% [95% CI 47–99%], respectively), and patients with carcinoma of unknown origin had the worst (1- and 2-year overall survival of 29% [95% CI 4–61%] and 14% [95% CI 1–47%], respectively).

Demographics and collected variables can be found in Table 1. All patients underwent staging computed tomography (CT) scans of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis (CT-TAP), blood tests including myeloma screen and appropriate tumor markers (e.g. prostate-specific antigen [PSA]). Patients were classified as (1) Those with multiple metastases to bone and viscera; (2) Those with a solitary proximal femoral lesion (n = 85), (2a) with a history of cancer (n = 24, of which 23 were biopsied), and (2b) without a history of cancer (n = 61, of which 58 were biopsied). Patients with multiple metastases on staging (n = 43, of which 31 underwent biopsy), were excluded from the subsection analysis regarding secondary outcomes.

Potential benefits, harms, and contraindications — "This document potentially benefits providers, patients, and third parties", but "one potential risk is that guidelines are incomplete or inaccurate due to the paucity of well-controlled studies on the efficacy of fracture prevention with medical and radiation interventions"; the page warns that "if a non-surgical intervention is selected and the patient suffers a pathologic fracture of the femur, there would be significant additional harm", and states "it is thus important for clinicians to examine all relevant clinical information and use appropriate judgement in deciding when to make referrals to surgical specialists and for surgeons when deciding to undertake prophylactic internal fixation to prevent fractures".

### The importance of awaiting biopsy results in solitary pathological proximal femoral fractures: Do we need to biopsy solitary pathological fractures? [^111TWqVw]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical resection and durable reconstruction are advocated for patients with pathological fractures due to potentially curable (bone sarcoma, hematological malignancy) or solitary metastases (renal, breast, thyroid). The current study demonstrates that while reliable at distinguishing between the main tumor types (sarcoma, hematological or carcinoma), a biopsy was less effective at differentiating between histological subtypes (e.g. carcinomas). This is of relevance when considering surgical management, as prognosis predicates surgical management. This effect is even seen within subtypes of the same cancer entity, e.g. breast cancer, where prognosis differs between types (ductal, lobular) and hormone status (estrogen receptor [ER]/human epidermal growth factor receptor [HER]). The overall prognosis for newly diagnosed patients with breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers has globally increased, largely due to improvements in the medical management of the primary disease and of any subsequent metastatic disease. This will undoubtedly affect the incidence and prevalence of MBD in carcinoma patients, which makes the differentiation between subtypes all the more relevant.

Controversy exists on the impact of impending versus complete pathological fractures on outcomes of surgery. Some studies show impending fractures have better outcomes compared with surgery over actual pathological fractures. – The current study found no significant survival difference between impending and actual proximal femoral fractures, justifying the inclusion of impending fractures in the analysis.

Limitations of the present study are excluding patients with inadvertent procedures at the expense of decreasing patient numbers, which aimed to reduce the heterogeneity of the cohort. Histology groups (sarcomas, carcinomas and hematological malignancies) are an oversimplification of cancer biology, but it is clinically relevant as these groups are managed by different multidisciplinary teams, and the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant, non-surgical treatment modalities differs between these groups. Stratification by primary carcinoma was not included in this study, partly because biopsy in this context is so poor at discriminating between metastatic carcinomas. In clinical practice, this could lead to an overly optimistic or pessimistic survival prediction in more aggressive carcinoma subtypes, such as epidermal growth factor receptor-positive lung cancer or hormone-resistant prostate cancer. New developments in genomics, molecular analysis and the use of validated prognostic toolsmay offer targeted therapeutic regimens and improve the estimation of prognosis to aid surgical decision making.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: treatment of metastatic carcinoma and myeloma of the femur [^112RNygQ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Efficacy of radiation therapy — femoral metastatic carcinoma and multiple myeloma: Clinicians should consider the use of radiation therapy to decrease the rate of femur fractures in patients with metastatic carcinoma or multiple myeloma lesions who are deemed at increased risk based on the combination of imaging findings and lesion-related pain. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate ★★★ (Upgraded), with supporting evidence described as "Evidence: Evidence from two or more "Moderate" quality studies with consistent findings recommending for or against the intervention, prognostic factors, or diagnostic test". Rationale includes that an observational study among patients with metastatic lung cancer "indicates a higher risk of fracture among patients with femoral metastases not treated with radiation therapy, as compared to those treated with radiation therapy", and "Other risk factors included lytic femur metastasis morphology and female gender"; although "there is no randomized evidence to guide practice". This recommendation "addresses the question of whether radiation by itself can reduce the risk of fracture" and "is not intended to alter current clinical practice wherein patients who are felt to be at high risk of pathologic fracture first undergo prophylactic stabilization".

### Complications and postoperative mortality rate after surgery for pathological femur fracture related to bone metastasis: analysis of a nationwide database [^117K65Fr]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Currently, there are few reports regarding predictors of postoperative complications and short-term mortality after surgery for pathological femur fracture related to bone metastasis.

Methods

Using data from the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination Database from 2007 to 2012, we retrospectively identified 1497 patients who underwent internal fixation (n = 1073) or proximal femur resection and endoprosthetic reconstruction of the proximal femur (n = 424) for pathological femur fracture related to bone metastasis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship of various factors with postoperative complications and 30-day mortality.

Results

The overall 30-day mortality after surgery was 2.6%, and the proportion of postoperative complications was 12.1%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that postoperative complications overall were significantly associated with older age [odds ratio (OR), 2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23–3.74 for age ≥ 80 vs. ≤ 59 years]; lung carcinoma (OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.47–2.86); esophageal carcinoma (OR 4.41; 95% CI 1.57–12.43); higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.03–2.18 for ≥ 9 vs. 8); and blood transfusion (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.14–2.15). Thirty-day mortality also was significantly higher in patients with rapid-growth tumors, visceral metastasis, internal fixation, and no postoperative chemotherapy in the univariate analysis.

Conclusions

Older age, type of primary tumor, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, and blood transfusion were associated with higher morbidity. These findings can provide important information to assess perioperative risk in patients with pathological femur fracture related to bone metastasis.

### Which bone-modifying agent is associated with better outcomes in patients with skeletal metastases from lung cancer? A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117NiB7B]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Metastatic bone disease occurs in 20% to 40% of patients with lung cancer, and these patients often present with pain or skeletal-related events (SREs) that are associated with decreased survival. Bone-modifying agents such as denosumab or bisphosphonates are routinely used; however, to our knowledge, there has been no quantitative synthesis of randomized controlled trial data to determine the most effective pharmacologic treatment of metastatic bone disease because of lung cancer.

Questions/Purposes

We aimed to perform a network meta-analysis of randomized trials to identify the bone-modifying agent that is associated with the (1) highest overall survival, (2) longest time to SRE, (3) lowest SRE incidence, and (4) greatest likelihood of pain resolution.

Methods

We conducted our study according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol and pre-registered the analysis on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42019124364). We performed a librarian-assisted search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data. We included randomized controlled trials reporting outcomes specifically for patients with lung cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab. SREs included pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, hypercalcemia of malignancy, or pain resulting in surgical intervention or radiation therapy. We excluded trials exclusively reporting surrogate outcomes such as changes in bone turnover markers. Screening, data extraction, risk of bias evaluation, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation evaluations were performed in duplicate. We included 131 randomized controlled trials that evaluated 11,105 patients with skeletal metastases from lung cancer. The network meta-analysis was performed using a frequentist model and the R statistical software. Results are reported as relative risks or mean differences, and the I2 value is reported for heterogeneity. The P-score, a measure of ranking certainty that accounts for standard error, is reported for each outcome. Heterogeneity in the network was considered moderate for overall survival and time to SRE, mild for the incidence of SRE, and low for pain resolution.

Results

For overall survival, denosumab was ranked above zoledronic acid and estimated to confer a mean of 3.3 months (95% CI 0.3–6.3) of increased overall survival compared with untreated patients (P-score = 89%). For the time to SRE, denosumab was ranked first with a mean of 9.1 additional SRE-free months (95% CI 6.7–11.5) compared with untreated patients (P-score = 99%), while zoledronic acid conferred an additional 4.8 SRE-free months (95% CI 3.6–6.1). Reduction in the incidence of SREs was not different between patients treated with denosumab (relative risk 0.54; 95% CI 0.33–0.87) and those treated with zoledronic acid (relative risk 0.56; 95% CI 0.46–0.67). Patients treated with the combination of ibandronate and systemic therapy were more likely to experience successful pain resolution than untreated patients (relative risk 2.4; 95% CI 1.8–3.2).

Conclusion

In this comprehensive synthesis of all available randomized controlled trial evidence guiding the pharmacologic treatment of bone metastases from lung cancer, denosumab was ranked above zoledronic acid for overall survival and time to SRE and was not different for reducing the incidence of SRE. Both were superior to no treatment for each of these outcomes. Given this, we encourage physicians to consider the use of denosumab or zoledronic acid in treating this patient population. The combination of ibandronate and systemic therapy was the most effective at reducing pain because of metastases. No cost-effectiveness analysis has yet been performed for denosumab and zoledronic acid on patients with metastatic lung cancer, and this represents an avenue for future research.

### What is the adverse event profile after prophylactic treatment of femoral shaft or distal femur metastases? [^114Xs7XP]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prophylactic surgical treatment of the femur is commonly offered to patients with metastatic disease who have a high risk of impending pathologic fracture. Prophylactic fixation is associated with improved functional outcomes in appropriate patients selected based on established criteria, but the perioperative complication profile has received little attention. Given the substantial comorbidity in this population, it is important to characterize surgical risks for surgeons and patients to improve treatment decisions.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What is the incidence of postoperative adverse events after prophylactic surgical stabilization of metastatic lesions of the femoral shaft or distal femur? (2) How does this complication profile compare with stabilization of pathologic fractures adjusted for differences in patient demographics and comorbidity?

Methods

We performed a retrospective study using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. We identified patients undergoing prophylactic treatment of the femoral shaft or distal femur by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Patients undergoing treatment of a pathologic fracture were identified by CPT code for femur fracture fixation as well as an International Classification of Diseases code indicating neoplasm or pathologic fracture. We tracked adverse events, operative time, blood transfusion, hospital length of stay, and discharge to a facility within 30 days postoperatively. There were 332 patients included in the prophylactic treatment group and 288 patients in the pathologic fracture group. Patients in the prophylactic treatment group presented with greater body mass index (BMI), whereas the pathologic fracture group presented with a greater incidence of disseminated cancer. The odds of experiencing adverse events were initially compared between the two groups using bivariate logistic regression and then using multivariate regression controlling for age, sex, BMI, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class and disseminated cancer causing marked physiological compromise per NSQIP guidelines.

Results

With multivariate analysis controlling for age, sex, BMI, and ASA class, patients with pathologic fracture were more likely to experience any adverse event (odds ratio [OR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.29; p = 0.036), major adverse events (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.01–2.55; p = 0.043), death (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.07–3.38; p = 0.030), blood transfusion (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.08–2.27; p = 0.017), and hospital stay ≥ 9 days (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.05–2.19; p = 0.028) compared with patients undergoing prophylactic treatment. However, when additionally controlling for disseminated cancer, the only difference was that patients with pathologic fractures were more likely to receive a blood transfusion than were patients undergoing prophylactic fixation (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.12–2.36; p = 0.011).

Conclusions

After controlling for differences in patient characteristics, prophylactic treatment of femoral metastases was associated with a decreased likelihood of blood transfusion and no differences in terms of the frequency of other adverse events. In the context of prior studies supporting the mechanical and functional outcomes of prophylactic treatment, the findings of this cohort suggest that the current guidelines have achieved a reasonable balance of morbidity in patients with femoral lesions and further support the current role of prophylactic treatment of impending femur fractures in appropriately selected patients.

### Symptom management in patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1174aoXT]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer bone metastases — prophylactic long bone surgery is recommended for specified indications and contraindications are defined. Prophylactic surgery is recommended for the following situations when long bones are involved: Persistent or increasing local pain despite the completion of radiation therapy; A solitary well-defined lytic lesion circumferentially involving > 50% of the cortex; Involvement of the proximal femur associated with a fracture of the lesser trochanter; Diffuse involvement of a long bone. Contraindications to surgical treatment of metastatic disease to long bones include a survival expectancy < 4 weeks and a poor general condition that is an obstacle to a safe operation. No randomized, prospective, controlled trials have compared surgery alone, surgery plus radiation therapy, or radiation therapy alone for metastatic long bone disease. Postoperative radiotherapy is commonly recommended regardless of the surgical procedure for bony metastases. A retrospective study of 60 patients compared adjuvant surgery plus radiation therapy (35 sites) to 29 sites that were treated with surgery alone, where univariate analysis revealed that combined therapy (P = 0.02) and prefracture functional status (P = 0.04) were the only predictors of patients achieving a good functional status after surgery, and on multivariate analysis, only postoperative radiation therapy was significantly associated with attaining a good level of function after surgery (P = 0.02).

### What factors are associated with local metastatic lesion progression after intramedullary nail stabilization? [^1134vR3R]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pathologic fracture of the long bones is a common complication of bone metastases. Intramedullary nail stabilization can be used prophylactically (for impending fractures) or therapeutically (for completed fractures) to preserve mobility and quality of life. However, local disease progression may occur after such treatment, and there is concern that surgical instrumentation and the intramedullary nail itself may seed tumor cells along the intramedullary tract, ultimately leading to loss of structural integrity of the construct. Identifying factors associated with local disease progression after intramedullary nail stabilization would help surgeons predict which patients may benefit from alternative surgical strategies.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Among patients who underwent intramedullary nail stabilization for impending or completed pathologic fractures of the long bones, what is the risk of local progression, including progression of the existing lesion and development of a new lesion around the nail? (2) Among patients who experience local progression, what proportion undergo reoperation? (3) What patient characteristics and treatment factors are associated with postoperative local progression? (4) What is the difference in survival rates between patients who experienced local progression and those with stable local disease?

Methods

Between January 2013 and December 2019, 177 patients at our institution were treated with an intramedullary nail for an impending or completed pathologic fracture. We excluded patients who did not have a pathologic diagnosis of metastasis before fixation, who were younger than 18 years of age, who presented with a primary soft tissue mass that eroded into bone, and who experienced nonunion from radiation osteitis or an avulsion fracture rather than from metastasis. Overall, 122 patients met the criteria for our study. Three fellowship-trained orthopaedic oncology surgeons involved in the care of these patients treated an impending or pathologic fracture with an intramedullary nail when a long bone lesion either fractured or was deemed to be of at least 35% risk of fracture within 3 months, and in patients with an anticipated duration of overall survival of at least 6 weeks (fractured) or 3 months (impending) to yield palliative benefit during their lifetime. The most common primary malignancy was multiple myeloma (25% [31 of 122]), followed by lung carcinoma (16% [20 of 122]), breast carcinoma (15% [18 of 122]), and renal cell carcinoma (12% [15 of 122]). The most commonly involved bone was the femur (68% [83 of 122]), followed by the humerus (27% [33 of 122]) and the tibia (5% [6 of 122]). A competing risk analysis was used to determine the risk of progression in our patients at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. A proportion of patients who ultimately underwent reoperation due to progression was calculated. A univariate analysis was performed to determine whether lesion progression was associated with various factors, including the age and sex of the patient, use of adjuvant therapies (radiation therapy at the site of the lesion, systemic therapy, and antiresorptive therapy), histologic tumor type, location of the lesion, and fracture type (impending or complete). Patient survival was assessed with a Kaplan-Meier curve. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

The cumulative incidence of local tumor progression (with death as a competing risk) at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery was 1.9% (95% confidence interval 0.3% to 6.1%), 2.9% (95% CI 0.8% to 7.5%), 3.9% (95% CI 1.3% to 8.9%), and 4.9% (95% CI 1.8% to 10.3%), respectively. Of 122 patients, 6% (7) had disease progression around the intramedullary nail and 0.8% (1) had new lesions at the end of the intramedullary nail. Two percent (3 of 122) of patients ultimately underwent reoperation because of local progression. The only factors associated with progression were a primary tumor of renal cell carcinoma (odds ratio 5.1 [95% CI 0.69 to 29]; p = 0.03) and patient age (difference in mean age 7.7 years [95% CI 1.2 to 14]; p = 0.02). We found no associations between local disease progression and the presence of visceral metastases, other skeletal metastases, radiation therapy, systemic therapy, use of bisphosphonate or receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitor, type of fracture, or the direction of nail insertion. There was no difference in survivorship curves between those with disease progression and those with stable local disease (= 0.36; p = 0.54).

Conclusion

Our analysis suggests that for this population of patients with metastatic bone disease who have a fracture or impeding fracture and an anticipated survival of at least 6 weeks (completed fracture) or 3 months (impending fracture), the risk of experiencing local progression of tumor growth and reoperations after intramedullary nail stabilization seems to be low. Lesion progression was not associated with the duration of survival, although this conclusion is limited by the small number of patients in the current study and the competing risks of survival and local progression. Based on our data, patients who present with renal cell carcinoma should be cautioned against undergoing intramedullary nailing because of the risk of postoperative lesion progression.

### Is there an association between prophylactic femur stabilization and survival in patients with metastatic bone disease? [^11579se2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The femur is the most common site of metastasis in the appendicular skeleton, and metastatic bone disease negatively influences quality of life. Orthopaedic surgeons are often faced with deciding whether to prophylactically stabilize an impending fracture, and it is unclear if prophylactic fixation increases the likelihood of survival.

Questions/Purposes

Is prophylactic femur stabilization in patients with metastatic disease associated with different overall survival than fixation of a complete pathologic fracture?

Methods

We performed a retrospective, comparative study using the national Veterans Administration database. All patient records from September 30, 2010 to October 1, 2015 were queried. Only nonarthroplasty procedures were included. The final study sample included 950 patients (94% males); 362 (38%) received prophylactic stabilization of a femoral lesion, and 588 patients (62%) underwent fixation of a pathologic femur fracture. Mean followup duration was 2 years (range, 0–7 years). We created prophylactic stabilization and pathologic fracture fixation groups for comparison using Common Procedural Terminology and ICD-9 codes. The primary endpoint of the analysis was overall survival. Univariate survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method; between-group differences were compared using the log-rank test. Covariate data were used to create a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model for survival to adjust for confounders in the two groups, including Gagne comorbidity score and cancer type.

Results

After adjusting for comorbidities and cancer type, we found that patients treated with prophylactic stabilization had a lower risk of death than did patients treated for pathologic femur fracture (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI, 0.62–0.89; p = 0.002).

Conclusions

In the national Veterans Administration database, we found greater overall survival between patients undergoing prophylactic stabilization of metastatic femoral lesions and those with fixation of complete pathologic fractures. We could not determine the cause of this association, and it is possible, if not likely, that patients treated for fracture had more aggressive disease causing the fracture than did those undergoing prophylactic stabilization. Currently, most orthopaedic surgeons who treat pathological fractures stabilize the fracture prophylactically when reasonable to do so. We may be improving survival in addition to preventing a pathological fracture; further study is needed to determine whether the association is cause-and-effect and whether additional efforts to identify and treat at-risk lesions improves patient outcomes.

### Symptom management in patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115zLe1n]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer bone metastasis palliation — radiation, systemic agents, surgery, and vertebral procedures: In patients with lung cancer who have pain due to bone metastases, external radiation therapy is recommended for pain relief (Grade 1A); a single fraction of 8 Gy is equally effective for immediate relief of pain and more cost-effective than higher fractionated doses of external radiation therapy. In patients with lung cancer who have painful bone metastases, bisphosphonates are recommended in addition to external beam radiation therapy for pain relief (Grade 1A). In patients with lung cancer who have painful bone metastases to long and/or weight bearing bones and a solitary well-defined lytic lesion circumferentially involving > 50% of the cortex and an expected survival > 4 weeks with satisfactory health status, surgical fixation is recommended to minimize the potential for a fracture (Grade 1C); intramedullary nailing is the preferred approach, especially for the femur or the humerus, and radiotherapy should follow the orthopedic management 2–4 weeks later. In patients with lung cancer who have vertebral compression fractures causing pain, vertebral augmentation procedures are recommended to reduce pain (Grade 1A).

### Predictors of survival in patients with bone metastasis of lung cancer [^1178gyhb]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2008). Low credibility.

The prognosis of patients with bone metastasis from lung cancer has not been well documented. We assessed the survival rates after bone metastasis and prognostic factors in 118 patients with bone metastases from lung cancer. The cumulative survival rates after bone metastasis from lung cancer were 59.9% at 6 months, 31.6% at 1 year, and 11.3% at 2 years. The mean survival was 9.7 months (median, 7.2 months; range, 0.1–74.5 months). A favorable prognosis was more likely in women and patients with adenocarcinoma, solitary bone metastasis, no metastases to the appendicular bone, no pathologic fractures, performance status 1 or less, use of systemic chemotherapy, and use of an epithelial growth factor receptor inhibitor. Analyses of single and multiple variables indicated better prognoses for patients with adenocarcinoma, no evidence of appendicular bone metastases, and treatment with an epithelial growth factor receptor inhibitor. The mean survival period was longer in a small group treated with an epithelial growth factor receptor inhibitor than in the larger untreated group. The data preliminarily suggest treatment with an epithelial growth factor receptor inhibitor may improve survival after bone metastasis.

### Lung carcinoma presenting with pathologic femur fracture and false-positive pregnancy test result [^112NNA56]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

β-Human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) assays are routinely used to test for pregnancy. However, βhCG may be elevated in conditions other than pregnancy. We describe a case of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma presenting with a pathologic femur fracture and a false-positive urine pregnancy test. Lung cancer is the most common nongestational malignancy that produces βhCG among reproductive-age women. Emergency physicians should consider this rare cause of a positive pregnancy test result in women who deny recent sexual intercourse, especially if the patient is older than 40 years, has a history of tobacco use, or presents with respiratory complaints.

### Surgical management of metastatic disease of the proximal part of the femur [^116YUVAc]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

➤ Pathologic fracture of the proximal part of the femur resulting from metastatic disease causes severe pain and an inability to walk. Surgical stabilization can be challenging because of bone loss resulting from the underlying metastatic lesions, the potential for major blood loss, and the poor health of the patient.➤ The goal of surgical treatment is the creation of a stable construct to allow early weight-bearing.➤ Pathologic femoral neck fractures secondary to metastases are best managed with arthroplasty.➤ The treatment of intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures is more controversial. Surgical stabilization may be performed with cephalomedullary nailing or arthroplasty. The choice of implant and operative technique is dependent on careful consideration of multiple factors, including the patient's life span, the type of tumor, the perceived response to other therapies, the need for adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the location and number of metastatic lesions, and the degree of bone involvement.➤ While the potential for complications is high, surgical stabilization of the proximal part of the femur decreases pain and improves function.

Radiotherapy is also an important treatment to ease symptoms in NSCLC. As discussed above, it also plays a key role in the management of bone metastases. Radiotherapy can be considered following spinal cord compression and for stabilisation following surgery associated with pathological fractures.

In treatment of lung cancer, there is also precedence that early palliative intervention is beneficial. A recent study demonstrated the value of early palliative care in the course of metastatic NSCLC. As well as improvements in QoL and a reduced need for aggressive end-of-life care, early palliative intervention prolonged survival by ∼2 months.

### Metastatic carcinoma of the long bones [^1139gYT5]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Breast, prostate, renal, thyroid, and lung carcinomas commonly metastasize to bone. Managing skeletal metastatic disease can be complex. Pain is the most common presenting symptom and requires thorough radiographic and laboratory evaluation. If plain-film radiography is not sufficient for diagnosis, a bone scan may detect occult lesions. Patients with lytic skeletal metastases may be at risk for impending fracture. Destructive lesions in the proximal femur and hip area are particularly worrisome. High-risk patients require immediate referral to an orthopedic surgeon. Patients who are not at risk for impending fracture can be treated with a combination of radiotherapy and adjuvant drug therapy. Bisphosphonates diminish pain and prolong the time to significant skeletal complications.

### Risk factors for same-admission mortality after pathologic fracture secondary to metastatic cancer [^112URPAU]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The skeleton is the third most common site of cancer metastases. Approximately 10% of patients with bone metastases will develop a pathologic fracture, with significant associated morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for same-admission mortality after pathologic fractures secondary to metastatic cancer.

Methods

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was queried from 2002 to 2013 for hospitalized patients with diagnoses of pathologic fracture and a primary cancer at high risk for skeletal metastasis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine risk factors associated with same-admission mortality after fracture.

Results

A total of 371,163 patients were identified. The spine was the most common site of pathologic fracture (68.0%) followed by lower extremity (25.0%) and upper extremity (8.7%). The following factors were independently associated with increased mortality (p < 0.001): cancer of lung or unspecified location; fracture of upper or lower extremity; male gender; age ≥ 65; non-Medicare insurance; coexisting congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, renal failure, or liver disease; and postoperative surgical site infection, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia. Closed reductions were associated (p < 0.001) with increased mortality while open or percutaneous surgical treatments were protective (p < 0.001) against mortality.

Conclusions

Pathologic fractures are a devastating consequence of metastatic bone disease, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality. Numerous demographic and medical factors are associated with increased same-admission mortality. This data is useful for counseling patients with skeletal metastatic disease and should be taken into consideration when conducting routine skeletal surveillance in patients with metastatic cancer.

### Intramedullary nailing for treatment of pathologic femoral fractures due to metastases [^115rrChA]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

Pathologic fractures of the femur because of bone metastases seriously affect the quality of life of cancer patients. Different surgical options are indicated to achieve a durable and solid fixation, depending on several clinical, prognostic and mechanical factors. Locked intramedullary nailing is currently used to treat pathologic femoral fractures in patients with multiple metastases when the trochanteric region or shaft is mainly involved. This study evaluates intramedullary nailing for treatment of patients with pathologic femoral fractures, focussing on complications, clinical and functional outcomes and survival rates. The series included 80 pathologic fractures treated with a titanium alloy Proximal Nail (Standard or Antirotation) or Lateral Anterograde Femoral Nail (PFN, PFNA or LAFN, Synthes) inserted in a locked static mode. Acrylic cement was used to fill the bone cavity after nail insertion in eight patients; percutaneous cementoplasty was simultaneously performed in 11 cases of severe ipsilateral acetabular osteolysis. Postoperative outcomes focussed on pain relief, postoperative mobility and quality of life and they were analysed retrospectively using QOL-ACD and ECOG. Eleven patients (13.75%) suffered from non-fatal DVT post-surgery, with no pulmonary embolism. Six patients (7.5%) developed superficial wound infections and two patients (2.5%) developed pnaeumonia. There was no loss of reduction, breakage, screw pull out, or hardware or implant failure that required component substitution or revision. Lung histotype and the contemporary presence of cerebral and visceral metastases appeared to be predisposing factors in reducing survival time. All patients attained satisfactory pain relief, early deambulation and a marked clinical improvement during the first 6–10 postoperative months, with gradual worsening thereafter from deterioration of their general condition due to cancer progression. The patients' survival rate was 40% at 1 year, 25% at 2 years and 15% at 3 years. Results confirm that multiple factors related to patients and primary cancer may affect survival rate after femoral fracture. Intramedullary nailing should be indicated for pathologic fractures at femoral diaphysis and metaphysis when cancer is in an advanced stage. This procedure offers good and durable stability, and enables pain relief, early postoperative mobilisation and weight-bearing, thus improving the quality of life of cancer patients.

### Is a cephalomedullary nail durable treatment for patients with metastatic peritrochanteric disease? [^112QYKyQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although cephalomedullary nail fixation is often used for metastatic peritrochanteric lesions of the femur, there is concern regarding the durability of the implant in comparison to endoprosthetic reconstruction. Previous studies have reported the proportion of patients who undergo reoperation for loss of stability, but the adequacy of the construct has not been critically evaluated in a competing risk analysis that incorporates death of the patient in the calculation.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What is the cumulative incidence of reoperation of cephalomedullary nails with death as a competing risk for metastatic lesions of the proximal femur? (2) What is the survival of patients with metastases to the proximal femur after cephalomedullary nailing? (3) What clinical factors are associated with implant stability in these patients?

Methods

Between 1990 and 2009, 11 surgeons at one center treated 217 patients with cephalomedullary nails for metastatic proximal femoral lesions. This represented 40% (217 of 544) of the patients undergoing surgery for metastases in this location during the study period. In general, we used cephalomedullary nails when there was normal bone in the femoral head, no fracture in the neck, and a moderate-sized lesion; we favored bipolar hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fractures and disease affecting the femoral head; finally, we used proximal femoral endoprosthetic replacement for large lesions with severe bone destruction. A retrospective study was conducted of 199 patients with cephalomedullary nails for peritrochanteric metastases from 1990 to 2009. Pathologic fracture, defined as a breach in cortex with a clear fracture line either with or without displacement, was present in 61 patients. The most common primary cancers were breast (42 of 199 patients [21%]), lung (37 of 199 patients [18%]), and renal cell (34 of 199 patients [17%]). A competing risk analysis was performed to describe the cumulative incidence of implant revision. Patient overall survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survivorship. A univariate analysis was performed to determine whether there was an association between revision surgery and various patient factors, including tumor histology, pathologic fracture, cementation, and radiation.

Results

Loss of implant stability necessitating revision surgery occurred in 19 of 199 patients (10%). In a competing risk analysis with death of the patient as the competing event, the cumulative incidence of revision surgery was 5% (95% confidence interval, 3%-9%) at 12 months and 9% (95% CI, 5%-13%) at 5 years. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, the overall patient survival was 31% (95% CI, 25%-37%) at 12 months and 5% (95% CI, 3%-9%) at 60 months. Patients with lung cancer had the shortest overall survival of 11% (95% CI, 1%-21%) at 12 months, and patients with multiple myeloma had the longest overall survival of 71% (95% CI, 49%-94%) at 12 months (p < 0.001). Duration of patient survival beyond the median 7 months was the only factor associated with a greater likelihood of revision surgery. Factors not associated with revision included tumor histology, pathologic fracture, closed versus open nailing, cementation, gender, age, and postoperative radiation.

Conclusions

The competing risk analysis demonstrates a relatively low cumulative incidence of reoperation and suggests that cephalomedullary nailing is reasonable for patients with moderate-sized proximal femoral metastasis not affecting the femoral head. For the large majority of patients, the construct achieves the goal of stabilizing the femur for the duration of the patient's life. Longer patient survival was associated with greater risk of revision surgery, but no particular tumor histology was found to have a greater cumulative incidence of reoperation. Future work with a larger number of patients and stricter surgical indications may be needed to corroborate these findings.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: treatment of metastatic carcinoma and myeloma of the femur [^112Gb1HP]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Arthroplasty for pathologic fractures from metastatic carcinoma in the femur — clinicians may consider arthroplasty to improve patient function and decrease the need for post-operative radiation therapy in patients with pathologic fractures from metastatic carcinoma in the femur. Strength of recommendation is Limited. Arthroplasty may be indicated in select patients with longer expected survival and higher performance status, with benefits including improved function as determined by Harris Hip Scores and a decreased need for adjuvant radiotherapy for disease control; differences in outcomes between arthroplasty and internal fixation are small and therefore both treatment options are reasonable. Despite these benefits, these procedures carry a higher risk of post-operative complications such as dislocation.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: treatment of metastatic carcinoma and myeloma of the femur [^112nofFL]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline — Imaging and clinical findings: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that the combination of imaging findings and lesion-related pain is predictive of risk of pathologic femur fracture. There is no reliable evidence to suggest that MRI is a strong predictor of femur fracture. Strength of Recommendation: Consensus. Description: In the absence of reliable evidence, the clinical practice guideline development group is making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion. Although advanced imaging can demonstrate radiographic depictions of proximal femur damage, the available literature fails to define specific parameters that can accurately predict fracture risk, and although MRI evaluation can accurately demonstrate the intra and extraosseous extent of lesions, there is no reliable evidence that this modality can be used as a predictor for fracture; combining clinical factors, particularly tumor pain and pain with weight bearing, may aid clinicians in deciding when to intervene surgically in order to prevent a frank pathological fracture and the associated morbidities which may then occur.

### Grade III bone cement implantation syndrome in malignant lung cancer patient: a case report [^114Rdhpr]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bone cement implantation syndrome is a known complication causing mortality during perioperative period particularly in patients with malignancy. With rise in aging population with malignancy in low income country, the syndrome is more likely to be encountered.

Case presentation

We present a case of 66 years old male patient with metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma of lung with pathological proximal femur fracture of left hip that underwent a cemented endoprosthesis under combined spinal epidural anesthesia who succumbed to intraoperative mortality due to grade III bone cement implantation syndrome even after aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressor use, and mechanical ventilation.

Conclusions

Careful identification of risk factors with aggressive vigilance and intervention in part of surgeons and anesthesia both during intraoperative and postoperative period can mitigate the risk of bone cement implantation syndrome.

### A bone metastasis of non-small cell lung carcinoma with prominent clear cell features [^112kEtYy]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a 78-year-old man with multiple bone tumours and three round, smooth nodules in the right lung. He was referred to our hospital because of the left femoral neck pathological fracture. The histological characteristics of the femoral tumour corresponded to clear cell carcinoma, and bone and lung lesions were regarded as metastatic from an unknown primary site, since there was no clinical evidence of renal carcinoma. His general conditions gradually declined, and he died 2 months after the operation. At autopsy, no neoplasia lesion was found in the kidneys. Although clear cell components were histologically dominant in the affected organs such as the lungs, bones and liver, neoplastic tubular structures also existed. Immunohistochemically, atypical cells were positive for napsin-A. The final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma of the lung origin with prominent clear cell features.

### Is there a role for early palliative intervention in frail older patients with a neck of femur fracture? [^111RW1Ap]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neck of femur (NOF) fractures present an ever-increasing health-care challenge. They are the commonest serious injury in older people and the commonest cause of accidental death. The total health and social service bill in the United Kingdom is over 1 billion pounds annually. Across the United Kingdom, the mean length of stay is 21.6 days. Following the introduction of robust management pathways and best practice tariff for patients with NOF fractures, mortality rates have declined; however, the mean 30-day mortality remains 6.7%. The percentage of the population aged 65 years and older is set to increase from 18% in 2016 to over 24% in 2046. Combined with an expanding population, this represents an increasing burden to our health-care services.

Palliative care has become recognized as an independent specialty; the World Health Organization formally defined the term in 1989. Since then, it has grown substantially with the aim of providing physical, emotional, spiritual, and social support. Care provided to both patients with cancer and other chronic disease leads to positive outcomes. - Early integration of palliative care is associated with improved continuity and coordination of care, greater quality of life, improved symptom control, and a reduction in health-care costs. Carers may also benefit from the additional expertise. Temel and colleagues demonstrated a significantly lower rate of depression coupled with a survival benefit in patients with metastatic small-cell lung cancer. Bakitas et al demonstrated improved mood and quality of life following the integration of a palliative care program for patients with a variety of cancers. Patients with nononcological disease may also benefit from the early integration; a reduction in symptom burden has been demonstrated in patients with refractory breathlessness. In the trauma ICU environment, care plans and "Do-not-attempt-resuscitation" orders were initiated earlier, resulting in a reduced length of stay without an increase in mortality. Several of the palliative interventions described in the literature can be delivered by trained individuals under the supervision of specialist palliative care physicians. This distinction is important when considering the financial implications of any initiatives.

The aim of this study was to investigate treatment escalation plans and end-of-life management of inpatients with NOF fractures at a major trauma center. Focus was placed on the duration of medical therapy, the involvement of palliative care teams, and the timing of end-of-life management plans. An assessment of the predictability of inpatient mortality was performed.

### The importance of awaiting biopsy results in solitary pathological proximal femoral fractures: Do we need to biopsy solitary pathological fractures? [^113S32ES]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Advances in the diagnosis and management of patients with non-sarcomatous malignancy have improved in recent decades, resulting in an increased prognosis, even in the presence of metastatic disease. – Coupled with the advancing age of the population, the prevalence of metastatic disease increases. The proximal femur is one of the most common skeleton sites to develop metastatic disease and the most common site for pathological fractures.

Pathological fractures are classically present with prodromal pain and an injury mechanism inconsistent with the injury. Impending fractures are often identified on radiographs investigating hip pain or during staging or surveillance following previous malignancy. Discriminating the underlying cause of pathological fractures is crucial to avoid inadvertent surgery which could compromise limb salvage and survival. The optimal surgical intervention for confirmed metastatic bone disease (MBD) is determined by an amalgamation of radiographic, patient, and tumoral factors. With the management of MBD, it must be remembered that (1) Pathological fractures will often not unite; (2) In certain cancer subtypes, excision of solitary deposits can result in improvement of overall survival (OS); and (3) The reconstruction must allow early weight-bearing, return of function, and outlive the patient's lifetime.

Imperative to this decision making process is the underlying histological diagnosis. Inadvertent surgical intervention of sarcoma can be significantly detrimental to the patient's prognosis and probability of achieving a cure. The indication for biopsy seems invariable to guide management in a patient presenting with a solitary lesion of bone, or with polyostotic disease of unknown origin.

This study aimed to identify the diagnostic accuracy, morbidity and sarcoma incidence of biopsy results for patients presenting with an (impending) pathological fracture of the proximal femur, in an attempt to answer the question, "is it mandatory to biopsy patients with a pathological or impending fracture of the proximal femur"?

### Fat embolism: special situations bilateral femoral fractures and pathologic femoral fractures [^114Nooyu]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

Few data are available in the literature regarding fat embolism in cases of bilateral femoral and pathological femoral fractures. The incidence of bilateral femoral fractures ranges from 2–9.5% of the total number of patients with femoral fractures, and they usually occur in high energy trauma and multi-trauma patients. Although injury severity scores tend to underestimate the severity of these injuries, fat embolism seems to occur in increased frequency ranging from 4.8–7.5%. Intramedullary nailing, which is the preferred surgical treatment, triggers a systemic inflammatory response that poses an additional burden to pulmonary function. In addition, the femur is a common site of metastatic bone disease. The treatment of impending and actual pathological fractures is complicated by increased rates of lung damage due to various factors. Fat embolism during treatment — mainly with intramedullary nails — generally seems to range from 0–10%.

### When and where do patients with bone metastases actually break their femurs? [^117GAY4e]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Accurate estimations of the risk of fracture due to metastatic bone disease in the femur is essential in order to avoid both under-treatment and over-treatment of patients with an impending pathological fracture. The purpose of the current retrospective in vivo study was to use CT-based finite element analyses (CTFEA) to identify a clear quantitative differentiating factor between patients who are at imminent risk of fracturing their femur and those who are not, and to identify the exact location of maximal weakness where the fracture is most likely to occur.

Methods

Data were collected on 82 patients with femoral metastatic bone disease, 41 of whom did not undergo prophylactic fixation. A total of 15 had a pathological fracture within six months following the CT scan, and 26 were fracture-free during the five months following the scan. The Mirels score and strain fold ratio (SFR) based on CTFEA was computed for all patients. A SFR value of 1.48 was used as the threshold for a pathological fracture. The sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predicted values for Mirels score and SFR predictions were computed for nine patients who fractured and 24 who did not, as well as a comparison of areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC of the ROC curves).

Results

The sensitivity of SFR was 100% compared with 88% for the Mirels score, and the specificity of SFR was 67% compared with 38% for the Mirels score. The AUC was 0.905 for SFR compared with 0.578 for the Mirels score (p = 0.008).

Conclusion

All the patients who sustained a pathological fracture of the femur had an SFR of > 1.48. CTFEA was far better at predicting the risk of fracture and its location accurately compared with the Mirels score. CTFEA is quick and automated and can be incorporated into the protocol of CT scanners. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2020;102-B(5):638–645.

### Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lung presenting as pathological humeral fracture: a case report and novel surgical treatment [^111if379]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We present a 73-year-old woman who presented with a pathological fracture of her right humerus. Further imaging and biopsy indicated a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lung as the primary neoplasm. This represents the first published case of a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lung presenting as a metastatic lesion of the humerus. Operative management of pathological fractures of the humerus has typically included either intramedullary nailing or the use of single-plating or double-plating techniques. The authors describe a novel technique using both intramedullary fixation augmented with a locking plate, steel cables and bone cement, with good outcome.

### CT-based structural rigidity analysis is more accurate than mirels scoring for fracture prediction in metastatic femoral lesions [^116eKPn7]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy continues regarding the appropriate assessment of fracture risk in long bone lesions affected by disseminated malignancy.

Questions/Purposes

The purpose of this ongoing Musculoskeletal Tumor Society-sponsored, multi-institutional prospective cross-sectional clinical study is to compare CT-based structural rigidity analysis (CTRA) with physician-derived Mirels scoring for predicting pathologic fracture in femoral bone lesions. We hypothesized CTRA would be superior to Mirels in predicting fracture risk within the first year based on (1) sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value; (2) receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis; and (3) fracture prediction after controlling for potential confounding variables such as age and lesion size.

Methods

Consented patients with femoral metastatic lesions were assigned Mirels scores by the individual enrolling orthopaedic oncologist based on plain radiographs and then underwent CT scans of both femurs with a phantom of known density. The CTRA was then performed. Between 2004 and 2008, six study centers performed CTRA on 125 patients. The general indications for this test were femoral metastatic lesions potentially at risk of fracture. The enrolling physician was allowed the choice of prophylactic stabilization or nonsurgical treatment, and the local treating oncology team along with the patient made this decision. Of those 125 patients, 78 (62%) did not undergo prophylactic stabilization and had followup sufficient for inclusion, which was fracture through the lesion within 12 months of CTRA, death within 12 months of CTRA, or 12-month survival after CTRA without fracture, whereas 15 (12%) were lost to followup and could not be studied here. The mean patient age was 61 years (SD, 14 years). There were 46 women. Sixty-four of the lesions were located in the proximal femur, 13 were in the diaphysis, and four were distal. Osteolytic lesions prevailed (48 lesions) over mixed (31 lesions) and osteoblastic (15 lesions). The most common primary cancers were breast (25 lesions), lung (14 lesions), and myeloma (11 lesions). CTRA was compared with Mirels based on sensitivity/specificity analysis, ROC, and fracture prediction by multivariate analysis. For the CTRA, reduction greater than 35% in axial, bending, or torsional rigidities at the lesion was considered at risk for fracture, whereas a Mirels score of 9 or above, as suggested in the original manuscript, was used as the definition of impending fracture.

Results

CTRA provided higher sensitivity (100% versus 66.7%), specificity (60.6% versus 47.9%), positive predictive value (17.6% versus 9.8%), and negative predictive value (100% versus 94.4%) compared with the classic Mirels definition of impending fracture (≥ 9), although there was considerable overlap in the confidence intervals. ROC curve analysis found CTRA to be better than the Mirels score regardless of what Mirels score cutoff was used. After controlling for potential confounding variables including age, lesion size, and Mirels scores, multivariable logistic regression indicated that CTRA was a better predictor of fracture (likelihood ratio test = 10.49, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

CT-based structural rigidity analysis is better than Mirels score in predicting femoral impending pathologic fracture. CTRA appears to provide a substantial advance in the accuracy of predicting pathological femur fracture over currently used clinical and radiographic criteria.

### Management of pathologic fractures of the proximal femur: state of the art [^116jYSPP]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2004). Low credibility.

Metastases to bone are the most common cause of a destructive lesion of the skeleton in an adult. The proximal femur is the most commonly affected bone with metastatic disease in the appendicular skeleton. A systematic approach to patient management is critical, so as to avoid complications that will delay systemic therapy. The orthopedic traumatologist is often the first physician to see the patient with a pathologic fracture. As a result, the surgeon must be aware of the indications for resection versus internal fixation, as well as options for reconstruction. Polymethyl methacrylate and curettage can be useful in the appropriately selected patient. Postoperative external beam irradiation can significantly reduce disease progression and subsequent loss of fixation. A multidisciplinary approach to this patient group will help optimize prognosis as well as function. This article reviews the evaluation, management, and complications of treatment of pathologic fractures of the proximal femur, with an emphasis on metastatic disease and multiple myeloma.

### The importance of awaiting biopsy results in solitary pathological proximal femoral fractures: Do we need to biopsy solitary pathological fractures? [^113hAk9W]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Overall, 153 patients presenting with impending and complete pathological fractures of the proximal femur between 2000 and 2019 were identified. After exclusion of patients who had undergone inadvertent procedures (n = 25), 128 patients remained, of whom 112 underwent biopsy and were used for further analysis (Fig. 1). Of the 16 patients where no biopsy was performed, the indication for no biopsy was due to the presence of advanced disease where management was purely palliative and biopsy would not have affected treatment. An overview of patient characteristics and oncological variables of patients with solitary lesions is presented in Table 1.

Diagnostic Accuracy of Biopsy for Impending and Complete Pathological Fractures

Overall, 112 biopsies were performed that identified 30 (27%) sarcomas, 21 (19%) hematological malignancies, 55 (49%) carcinomas, and 5 (6%) unknown malignancies; 1 biopsy was non-malignant. In 25/55 (45%) carcinomas, biopsy failed to identify the primary site. After surgical resection, four patients had a different final diagnosis compared with their preoperative biopsy. Therefore, in 9 (8%) patients, biopsy resulted in an inconclusive or false-positive result. The PPV of a biopsy to differentiate between the major histology groups (carcinoma, sarcoma, hematological malignancy) was 0.96 (95% CI 0.91–0.99), while the PPV of a biopsy to differentiate between sarcoma and non-sarcoma in all patients was 1.00 (95% CI 0.88–1.00). The PPV decreased to 0.82 (95% CI 0.74–0.89) when discriminating carcinoma subtypes (determining the primary site of the metastasis).

### Limited short-term effect of palliative radiation therapy on quantitative computed tomography-derived bone mineral density in femora with metastases [^1117A9Qq]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bone metastases are most frequently seen in patients with primary tumors in the breast, prostate, lung, kidney, or thyroid. These lesions can have a lytic, blastic, or mixed radiological appearance. Lytic lesions result from disproportionate bone resorption by osteoclasts and leads to progressive destruction of the bone tissue and a subsequent risk of pathological fracturing. Blastic lesions are characterized by excessive bone formation and are hypothesized to decrease bone strength because the newly formed bone has a reduced structural integrity.

External beam radiation therapy (RT) plays an important role in the palliative care of patients with bone metastases because it reliefs pain. Additionally, some studies report a beneficial effect of RT on bone mineral density (BMD), which is also the clinical experience of medical specialists. In contrast, this beneficial effect was not confirmed in a recent systematic review. Moreover, the relationship between pain relief and BMD is unclear. Some authors suggest there is no relationship, whereas others state that improved BMD contributes to long-lasting pain relief, increased bone stability, and decreased risk of fractures.

In patients with cancer and bone metastases in the femur, the ability to walk and remain mobile is very important for the overall quality of life. Therefore, it is important to assess not only pain but also the risk for fractures when determining RT dose schedules. If the expected risk for fractures is low, RT is administered in one, relatively high dose (single fraction [SF]) to relieve pain. Patients with a high expected risk for fractures who are not eligible for or do not want surgery can receive RT in multiple fractions (MF) to induce remineralization and prevent pathological fracturing. Previous research suggested that 24 Gy in 4 fractions postponed pathological fractures when compared with a single dose of 8 Gy. However, studies on the effect of RT doses on BMD are limited, and the reported responses differ between studies. To date, only Koswig et al compared SF and MF in terms of BMD and found a greater response after MF RT.

### Metastatic disease of the femur: surgical treatment [^116UnSUV]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

The senior author's 12-year consecutive series of surgery for metastatic disease of the femur was reviewed. Treatment of 97 impending pathologic fractures yielded better results than treatment of 85 completed pathologic fractures with less average blood loss (438 cc versus 636 cc), shorter hospital stay (7 days versus 11 days), greater likelihood of discharge to home as opposed to an extended care facility (79% versus 56%) and greater likelihood of resuming support-free ambulation (35% versus 12%). Internal stabilization with a reconstruction-type intramedullary nail provided satisfactory pain relief and functional preservation for most patients with impending pathologic femur fractures (69 of 97, 71%), although alternate forms of internal fixation (21 of 97, 22%) or cemented arthroplasty (seven of 97, 7%) were used successfully. Completed pathologic fractures were more likely to require some form of arthroplasty (47 of 85, 55%), although reconstruction-type nails (20 of 85, 24%), and other internal fixation techniques (18 of 85, 21%) also were used. Modular oncology-type arthroplasty systems offered a viable salvage option in both groups. In the absence of conflicting goals or contraindications, internal stabilization of impending pathologic fractures before the completion of the fracture seems to be reasonable and appropriate.

### Bisphosphonates versus denosumab for prevention of pathological fracture in advanced cancers with bone metastasis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111ooXth]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Metastasis to the bone is one of the most common complications associated with advanced cancer. Approximately 350,000 of individuals in the United States die each year with bone metastases, and this figure increases considering patients currently living with bone metastases. Bone metastases typically stem from malignant breast (73%), prostate (68%), and lung (36%) cancers. Patients with bone metastases are at risk of devastating skeletal related events (SREs), including pathological fractures, requiring prompt referral to an orthopedic surgeon for appropriate management.

Bisphosphonates are the main treatment used to reduce the number of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma or bone metastases from advanced cancers (breast, prostate, or solid tumors). Zoledronic acid (ZA) is a diphosphonate regarded as one of the current benchmark treatments to reduce, but not completely eliminate, SREs from bone metastases, despite the increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw and restrictions in renal insufficiency. Therefore, alternate therapies are needed to further reduce the frequency of SREs with fewer adverse effects. Denosumab, a human monoclonal antibody, binds to the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL) and has been shown as a noninferior alternative to ZA.

The aim of our study was to investigate the efficacy of ZA versus denosumab in the prevention of pathological fractures in cancer patients by evaluating randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Simple radiographic parameter predicts fracturing in metastatic femoral bone lesions: results from a randomised trial [^114VEpKw]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

In the randomised Dutch Bone Metastasis Study on the palliative effect of a single fraction (SF) of 8 Gy versus six fractions of 4 Gy on painful bone metastases, 14 fractures occurred in 102 patients with femoral metastases. Purpose of the present study was to identify lesional risk factors for fracturing and to evaluate the influence of the treatment schedule.

Material and Methods

Pretreatment radiographs of femoral metastases were collected. Three observers separately measured the lesions and scored radiographic characteristics.

Results

Ten fractures occurred after median 7 weeks in 44 SF patients (23%) and four after median 20 weeks in 58 multiple fraction patients (7%) (UV, P = 0.02). In 110 femoral metastases, an axial cortical involvement > 30 mm significantly predicted fracturing (MV, P = 0.02). Twelve out of 14 fractured lesions and 40 out of 96 non-fractured metastases had an axial cortical involvement > 30 mm (negative predictive value, 97%). When correcting for the axial cortical involvement, the treatment schedule was not predictive anymore (MV, P = 0.07).

Conclusions

Fracturing of the femur mostly depended on the amount of axial cortical involvement of the metastasis. We recommend to treat femoral metastases with an axial cortical involvement ≤ 30 mm with an SF of 8 Gy for relief of pain. If the axial cortical involvement is > 30 mm, prophylactic surgery should be performed to minimize the risk of pathological fracturing or, if the patient's condition is limited, irradiation to a higher total dose.

### Radiation therapy in conjunction with surgical stabilization of impending or pathologic fractures secondary to metastasis: is there a difference between single and multifraction regimens? [^112cFJqa]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods and Materials

With institutional review board approval, we conducted a retrospective review of patients with impending or pathologic bone fractures secondary to biopsy-proven metastases who underwent surgical fixation and perioperative RT treated between 2004 and 2016. Patients were identified using billing codes, which were then matched to an institutional database of patients treated with radiation. Patients were considered to have an impending or pathologic fracture requiring surgical fixation based on imaging review by both a radiologist and orthopedic surgeon and clinical examination by an orthopedic surgeon. The determination of need for prophylactic surgical fixation was not made using strict quantifiable criteria, but typically was the product of a combination of factors such as lytic tumor, tumor location, extent of cortical destruction, and pain with movement or weight bearing.

Patients were included if radiation to the surgical site occurred within 5 weeks before or 10 weeks after surgery with neoadjuvant or adjuvant intent, respectively, and the patient completed the planned course of therapy. Patients were excluded if radiation was not delivered to the area of surgical fixation, postoperative radiation was performed due to a preceding surgery's failure, or if surgery was performed due to failure of the preceding RT course (eg, incomplete pain relief or fracture after radiation). Cohort selection with inclusion and exclusion criteria is shown in Figure 1.

### Radiation therapy in conjunction with surgical stabilization of impending or pathologic fractures secondary to metastasis: is there a difference between single and multifraction regimens? [^1163TuLi]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The role of single fraction radiation has been well-established by multiple randomized controlled trials in patients with uncomplicated bone metastases. A recent meta-analysis of treatment outcomes with single versus multifraction RT without surgery for uncomplicated bone metastases found only a 3% absolute difference in response rates favoring multifractionated regimens and a 2.4 pooled odds ratio of reirradiation if treated with a single fraction course of RT, with otherwise equivalent outcomes. Our study extends this concept further by providing evidence for the role of single fraction radiation in patients with complicated metastases requiring surgical intervention.

The median survival of patients in our study compares favorably to other study cohorts with surgical fixation and perioperative radiation, suggesting the generalizability of our results. Although some studies have shown a trend toward improved overall survival with the addition of RT to surgical fixation, we would generally not expect a local palliative treatment in the setting of metastatic disease to improve overall survival. This might be theoretically possible if the addition of RT were to decrease the risk of pathologic fracture, risk of reoperation, or improve functional/performance status. Unfortunately, there are minimal data on survival outcomes that delineate differences in outcomes between those patients treated with surgery alone and those who receive RT, making comparisons difficult. Because the question addressed by this study was regarding single versus multifraction treatment, we did not include a surgery-only cohort in the analysis to assess the benefit of perioperative RT.

### Simultaneous nailing of skeletal metastases: is the mortality really that high? [^112p6EMZ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The risk of death during simultaneous nailing of pathologic and impending fractures in patients with metastatic disease is believed to be so high that some authors have advocated a staged approach, especially for impending fractures. However, there are limited data to either support or refute the appropriateness of staging of multiple impending or pathologic fractures.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore determined the rate of pulmonary mortality and morbidity in patients who underwent simultaneous nailing for metastatic disease of the skeleton.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 16 patients who underwent simultaneous intramedullary nailing of impending or pathologic fractures between 1993 and 2009. There were 10 men and six women with a mean age of 60 years (range, 40–78 years). The intramedullary nailings included 15 femurs, 17 humeri, and one tibia. Thirty-one nails were reamed and two were unreamed.

Results

Three of 16 patients died before discharge; two of these deaths were presumed to be the direct result of acute pulmonary complications related to simultaneous nailing and one was intraoperative. For the 13 patients who survived after discharge, there were three pulmonary complications. There were no intraoperative or perioperative deaths in the prophylactic nailing group.

Conclusions

Simultaneous nailing of impending and pathologic fractures can be performed with lower mortality rates than previously reported. Patients with impending fractures did not appear to be at higher risk than patients with pathologic fractures.

### Contemporary management of appendicular skeletal metastasis by primary tumor type [^114oKYtQ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Skeletal metastases exert a profound effect on patients and society, and will be encountered by most orthopedic surgeons. Once a primary malignancy is diagnosed, multidisciplinary management should focus on maximizing the quality of life while minimizing disease- and treatment-related morbidity. This may be best achieved with discerning attention to the unique characteristics of primary cancer types, including pathologic fracture healing rates, longevity, and efficacy of adjuvant therapies. Some lesions may respond well to nonsurgical measures, whereas others may require surgery. A single surgical intervention should allow immediate unrestricted activity and outlive the patient. In certain scenarios, a therapeutic benefit may be provided by excision with a curative intent. In these scenarios, or when endoprosthetic reconstruction is necessary, patients may be best referred to an orthopedic oncologist.

### What factors are associated with implant breakage and revision after intramedullary nailing for femoral metastases? [^116zG1L3]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Actual and impending pathologic fractures of the femur are commonly treated with intramedullary nails because they provide immediate stabilization with a minimally invasive procedure and enable direct weightbearing. However, complications and revision surgery are prevalent, and despite common use, there is limited evidence identifying those factors that are associated with complications.

Questions/Purposes

Among patients treated with intramedullary nailing for femoral metastases, we asked the following questions: (1) What is the cumulative incidence of local complications? (2) What is the cumulative incidence of implant breakage and what factors are associated with implant breakage? (3) What is the cumulative incidence of revision surgery and what factors are associated with revision surgery?

Methods

Between January 2000 and December 2015, 245 patients in five centers were treated with intramedullary nails for actual and impending pathologic fractures of the femur caused by bone metastases. During that period, the general indications for intramedullary nailing of femoral metastases were impending fractures of the trochanter region and shaft and actual fractures of the trochanter region if sufficient bone stock remained; nails were used for lesions of the femoral shaft if they were large or if multiple lesions were present. Of those treated with intramedullary nails, 51% (117) were actual fractures and 49% (111) were impending fractures. A total of 60% (128) of this group were women; the mean age was 65 years (range, 29–93 years). After radiologic followup (at 4–8 weeks) with the orthopaedic surgeon, because of the palliative nature of these treatments, subsequent in-person followup was performed by the primary care provider on an as-needed basis (that is, as desired by the patient, without any scheduled visits with the orthopaedic surgeon) throughout each patient's remaining lifetime. However, there was close collaboration between the primary care providers and the orthopaedic team such that orthopaedic complications would be reported. A total of 67% (142 of 212) of the patients died before 1 year, and followup ranged from 0.1 to 175 months (mean, 14.4 months). Competing risk models were used to estimate the cumulative incidence of local complications (including persisting pain, tumor progression, and implant breakage), implant breakage separately, and revision surgery (defined as any reoperation involving the implant other than débridement with implant retention for infection). A cause-specific multivariate Cox regression model was used to estimate the association of factors (fracture type/preoperative radiotherapy and fracture type/use of cement) with implant breakage and revision, respectively.

Results

Local complications occurred in 12% (28 of 228) of the patients and 6-month cumulative incidence was 8% (95% confidence interval, 4.7–11.9). Implant breakage occurred in 8% (18 of 228) of the patients and 6-month cumulative incidence was 4% (95% CI, 1.4–6.5). Independent factors associated with increased risk of implant breakage were an actual (as opposed to impending) fracture (cause-specific hazard ratio [HR_cs], 3.61; 95% CI, 1.23–10.53, p = 0.019) and previous radiotherapy (HR_cs, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.13–7.82, p = 0.027). Revisions occurred in 5% (12 of 228) of the patients and 6-month cumulative incidence was 2.2% (95% CI, 0.3–4.1). The presence of an actual fracture was independently associated with a higher risk of revision (HR_cs, 4.17; 95% CI, 0.08–0.82, p = 0.022), and use of cement was independently associated with a lower risk of revision (HR_cs, 0.25; 95% CI, 1.20–14.53, p = 0.025).

Conclusions

The cumulative incidence of local complications, implant breakage, and revisions is low, mostly as a result of the short survival of patients. Based on these results, surgeons should consider use of cement in patients with intramedullary nails with actual fractures and closer followup of patients after actual fractures and preoperative radiotherapy. Future, prospective studies should further analyze the effects of adjuvant therapies and surgery-related factors on the risk of implant breakage and revisions.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: treatment of metastatic carcinoma and myeloma of the femur [^114LGBGH]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Histology-specific evidence and implementation considerations for BMAs indicate that in multiple myeloma, zoledronic acid has been found to be superior to clodronate for skeletal related events, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), whereas denosumab is non-inferior to zoledronic acid for skeletal related events and OS, but associated with a longer PFS. In breast cancer, denosumab is shown to be superior to zoledronic acid for reduced rates of skeletal related events, prolonged time to first skeletal related event and improved quality of life; in prostate cancer, denosumab prolonged time to first skeletal related event compared to zoledronic acid; and in non-small cell lung cancer with bone metastases, denosumab compared to zoledronic acid was associated with improved OS. Benefits include decreased fracture rates, avoiding surgical intervention and associated pain, reduction in other skeletal related events and improved survival, while harms include osteonecrosis of the jaw and hypocalcemia; clinicians should note renal insufficiency is observed more commonly for zoledronic compared to denosumab, whereas hypocalcemia is more frequently observed with denosumab.

### Fracture of the femoral neck, the risk of serious underlying pathology [^1177i2FB]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

Between 1997 and 2003, a total of 2223 patients presented to our hospital with the neck of femur fracture. This retrospective study examines the histological results of 90 patients (4%) suspected of having a fracture associated with serious underlying pathology. The mean age at the time of fracture was 80 years (44–97). The patients were divided into four groups. Group I: 34 patients with fracture without history of fall or trauma. Group II: 21 patients with suspicious lesions on the standard pelvic radiograph taken on admission. Group III: 27 patients with past history of malignancy without known bone metastases. Group IV: 8 patients with past history of malignancy and known bone metastases. None of the patients in groups I and II had significant abnormalities other than osteoporosis. Four patients (15%) in group III and six patients (75%) in group IV had metastases on histological examination. It is concluded that only groups III and IV are likely to have fractures due to metastatic disease.

Case presentation

We present a case of 66 years old male from Nuwakot district of Nepal, farmer by occupation, referred from private hospital to our center with pain in left hip, on and off for last 5 months with suspected malignancy. The patient had normal X-ray findings. He also didn't respond to analgesic regimen. Repeat X-ray of the pelvis (Fig. 1) shows pathological lesion suggestive of suspicious malignancy in neck of femur with differential of metastatic lymphoma or multiple myeloma. He also had history of pulmonary tuberculosis treated with chemotherapy 20 years back. He was a heavy smoker for last 30 years and occasionally takes alcohol. Initial workup for multiple myeloma including M-bands was negative. Biopsy of the hip suggested metastatic adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2). Immunohistochemistry of the specimen showed Bronchogenic origin. By this time, patient had difficulty bearing weight and was admitted for impending fracture of proximal femur with traction in situ.

### Radiation therapy in conjunction with surgical stabilization of impending or pathologic fractures secondary to metastasis: is there a difference between single and multifraction regimens? [^117WNuiq]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2020, there will be an estimated 1.8 million new cancer diagnoses in the United States, of which an estimated 151,000 will be diagnosed with or develop metastatic bone disease, and up to 34% of these patients will be diagnosed with or develop a pathologic fracture. Impending and pathologic fractures can lead to significant pain, neurologic dysfunction, and a decline in performance status. Management has historically been surgical fixation, with the goal of local tumor control, restoring structural integrity, and improving function. Several studies have demonstrated that incorporating radiation therapy (RT) with surgical fixation of impending or pathologic fractures has been associated with improved overall survival, functional status of the affected extremity, decreased rates of reoperation, and lower rates of local failure. Given these results, treating pathologic and impending fractures with surgical fixation and perioperative RT has become common clinical practice.

To date, there have been no published reports comparing single versus multifraction RT regimens for patients with impending or pathologic fractures treated with surgery in conjunction with RT. Given this lack of data, we sought to assess differences in the rates of local failure, reirradiation, reoperation, and complications in this clinical setting.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: treatment of metastatic carcinoma and myeloma of the femur [^114NvQx8]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline — introduction and scope for metastatic carcinoma and myeloma of the femur — notes that multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy in which 70–80% of patients present with lytic lesions in the skeleton and that bone lesions may require radiation therapy, surgery or both. The femur is described as the most common long bone affected by carcinoma and myeloma, and fractures of the femur almost always require surgery and, particularly when about the hip, dramatically alter patients' quality of life and potentially survival. Previous guidelines addressing bone targeted agents and palliative radiotherapy refer to reductions in skeletal related events (SREs), a broad term that encompasses pathologic fractures of any bone, need for surgery or radiation, and hypercalcemia, and have been primarily focused on short-term pain control and long-term radiation-induced side effects, without significant consideration to modifying the risk of pathologic fracture or the need for subsequent surgical intervention. For evidence development, search criteria required that all studies included had at least 10 patients per group and populations primarily comprised of metastatic carcinoma or multiple myeloma of the femur; the project design included 15 PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) questions, yet only four PICO questions yielded sufficient information meeting inclusion and quality standards to make evidence-based recommendations, and remaining recommendations were formulated based on workgroup consensus using the available literature.

The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society, in partnership with American Society of Clinical Oncology and American Society for Radiation Oncology, has developed a clinical practice guideline to assist providers with the care of patients with metastatic carcinoma and myeloma of the femur. The guideline was developed by an Expert Panel consisting of representatives of all three organizations by American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) methodologists using the AAOS standardized guideline development process. A systematic review of the available evidence was conducted, and the identified evidence was rated was rated for quality and potential for bias. Recommendations were developed based on this evidence in a standardized fashion. The guideline was approved by the guideline approval bodies of all three organizations. Thirteen recommendations were synthesized covering relevant subtopics such as imaging, use of bone-modifying agents, radiation therapy, and surgical reconstruction. The consensus of the expert panel was that bone-modifying agents may assist in reducing the incidence of femur fracture, regardless of tumor histology. The panel recommended the use of radiation therapy to decrease the rate of femur fractures for patients considered at increased risk. The panel recommended arthroplasty be considered to improve patient function and decrease the need of postoperative radiation therapy in patients with pathologic fractures in the femur.

### Axial cortical involvement of metastatic lesions to identify impending femoral fractures; a clinical validation study [^115KvnW1]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Patients with advanced cancer may develop painful bone metastases, potentially resulting in pathological fractures. Adequate fracture risk assessment is of key importance to prevent fracturing and maintain mobility. This study aims to validate the clinical reliability of axial cortical involvement with a 30 mm threshold on conventional radiographs to assess fracture risk in femoral bone metastases.

Materials and Methods

All patients with bone metastases who received radiotherapy for pain included in two multicentre prospective studies were selected. Conventional radiographs obtained at a maximum of two months prior to radiotherapy were collected. Three experts independently measured lesions and scored radiographic characteristics. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated.

Results

Hundred patients were included with a median follow-up of 23.0 months (95%CI: 10.6–35.5). Two fractures occurred in lesions with axial cortical involvement < 30 mm, and 12 in lesions ≥ 30 mm. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of axial cortical involvement for predicting femoral fractures were 86%, 50%, 20% and 96%, respectively. Patients with lesions ≥ 30 mm had a 5.3 times higher fracture risk than patients with smaller lesions.

Conclusion

Our validation study confirmed the use of 30 mm axial cortical involvement to assess fracture risk in femoral bone metastases. Until a more accurate and practically feasible method has been developed, this clinical parameter remains an easy method to assess femoral fracture risk to aid patients and clinicians to choose the optimal individual treatment modality.

### The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society clinical practice guideline on the management of metastatic humeral disease [^116k3KnX]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

Metastatic humeral disease epidemiology — In metastatic bone disease (MBD), the most common sites for involvement are the spine, pelvis, ribs, and proximal femur; approximately 20% of MBD occurs in the upper extremity, with half of that occurring in the humerus, and metastatic disease in the humerus accounts for 16–39% of all impending or completed pathologic fractures in long bones; such involvement can dramatically affect the ability to perform activities of daily living. With rare exceptions of oligometastatic disease in the setting of breast, thyroid, or renal cancer, the diagnosis of MBD involvement portends an incurable diagnosis, and the possibility of multiple interventions over the remaining lifetime of treatment is noted.

### Impending fracture: a difficult diagnosis [^1153p565]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The concept of impending fracture has been developed to help address this difficult skeletal-related problem. There is no consensus on the subject in the literature and a specific definition of impending fracture has not been outlined.

Discussion

There is disagreement in the literature on the best criteria for the diagnosis of impending fracture. A method of discrimination for patients who need preventative treatment for a metastatic lesion has not yet been established.

Conclusions

Current score systems consider variables like size, location and treatment response and are easy to remember. However, these score systems have never been evaluated prospectively and rigorously, their sensitivity is low and they do not take into account potentially relevant factors that can influence patient prognosis. A consistent tool to evaluate impending fractures would be of great value to guide the treatment of metastatic bone disease.

### Metastatic disease in long bones: a proposed scoring system for diagnosing impending pathologic fractures. 1989 [^113ew7Mm]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

A weighted scoring system is proposed to quantify the risk of sustaining a pathologic fracture through a metastatic lesion in a long bone. This system objectively analyzes and combines four roentgenographic and clinical risk factors into a single score. Retrospective analysis of metastatic long bone lesions was completed in 78 lesions that had been irradiated without prophylactic surgical fixation. Clinical data and roentgenograms were scored prior to irradiation by independent observers. The outcome identified 51 lesions that did not fracture during the subsequent six months and 27 lesions that fractured within six months. A mean score of 7 was found in the nonfracture group, whereas the fracture group had a mean score of 10. The percentage risk of a lesion sustaining a pathologic fracture could be predicted for any given score. As the score increased above 7, so did the percentage risk of fracture. It is suggested that all metastatic lesions in long bones be evaluated prior to irradiation. Lesions with scores of 7 or lower can be safely irradiated without risk of fracture, while lesions with scores of 8 or higher require prophylactic internal fixation prior to irradiation.

### In brief: classifications in brief: mirels' classification: metastatic disease in long bones and impending pathologic fracture [^112bpJar]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Mirels' criteria for pathologic fracture" for bone metastasis.

The Mirels' criteria is a clinical scoring system used to predict the risk of pathologic fracture in patients with metastatic bone disease. This calculator is particularly useful in the management of patients with bone metastases, as it helps clinicians decide whether prophylactic fixation surgery is necessary to prevent a potential fracture. The Mirels' criteria takes into account four factors: the site of the lesion, the nature of the lesion (blastic, lytic, or mixed), the size of the lesion, and the presence of pain. Each factor is scored from 1 to 3, and a total score of 9 or more suggests a high risk of fracture, indicating the need for surgical intervention. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it should be noted that this scoring system is not applicable to patients without bone metastases.

The Mirels' criteria calculator helps determine the risk of pathological fractures based on specific characteristics of bone lesions. By evaluating details about the lesion's site, size, nature, and the level of pain experienced, this tool suggests appropriate intervention strategies.

Responses are scored as follows:

Site of lesion:

- Upper limb = 1
- Lower limb = 2
- Trochanteric region = 3

Size of lesion:

- Less than 1/3 of cortex = 1
- Between 1/3 and 2/3 of cortex = 2
- Greater than 2/3 of cortex = 3

Nature of lesion:

- Blastic = 1
- Mixed = 2
- Lytic = 3

Pain:

- Mild = 1
- Moderate = 2
- Functional = 3

To compute the score, add up the numbers assigned to the user's responses. The total score can range from 4 to 12. This score leads to different interpretations:

- Scores of 7 or below suggest a low risk of fracture, where options like radiotherapy and observation should be considered.
- A score of 8 implies a 15% risk of fracture. In this case, clinical judgment is crucial to guide further action.
- Scores of 9 or greater indicate a high risk of fracture, recommending prophylactic fixation to prevent fractures.

These interpretations guide healthcare professionals in deciding the best course of treatment to manage potential or existing bone lesions efficiently.

### Development and validation of an early diagnosis model for bone metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer based on serological characteristics of the bone metastasis mechanism [^112EXRff]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, characterized by high incidence and mortality rates. Notably, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases. A significant proportion of NSCLC patients, between 26% and 36%, develop bone metastasis. Studies have shown that the median survival duration for NSCLC patients after developing bone metastasis ranges from 5 to 11.5 months. The bone destruction associated with metastasis can lead to skeletal-related events (SREs), such as bone pain, fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia, significantly affecting patients' survival and quality of life. Therefore, the prompt identification, diagnosis, and management of bone metastasis in NSCLC are crucial for improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

Currently, the primary clinical approach for diagnosing tumor bone metastasis relies on imaging techniques. However, these methods have limited sensitivity, resulting in a delayed diagnosis and exposure to radiation. Imaging is also unsuitable for frequent disease monitoring. Furthermore, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) screening guidelines in the United States similarly discourage imaging assessments for asymptomatic patients. Consequently, there is a pressing need for an effective and easily accessible tool for the early diagnosis and risk assessment of NSCLC bone metastasis.

Background

Metastatic lesions to the proximal femur occur frequently and require special consideration due to the high risk of pathologic fractures. Type of surgery might influence patient survival considering the growing concept of oligometastases. In fact, the use of modular tumor megaprosthesis is increasing in the last decades compared to intramedullary nailing. Aim of this study was to evaluate oncological and functional results of treatment in patients with pathologic or impending fracture of the proximal femur, with patient survival being the primary, complications the secondary, and functional results the tertiary endpoint.

Methods

Between 2016 and 2017, 40 patients with pathologic fracture (29 cases) or impending fracture according to the Mirels score (11 cases) of the proximal femur, were treated in our Institute and prospectively collected. There were 29 females (72.5%) and 11 males (27.5%), with a mean age at diagnosis of the metastasis of 63.6 years (range 35 to 92 years). Patients were treated due to bone metastases (commonly develop from breast cancer) or hematologic malignancies. Considering number of lesions, 17 patients had less than three bone metastases. Surgical procedures included intramedullary nailing (7 patients), conventional endoprosthesis (4 patients) and modular endoprosthetic replacement (29 patients). Adjuvant treatments included chemotherapy (13 cases), radiation therapy (8 cases) or both (15 cases), and selective arterial embolization (6 pre-op). Oncological results were evaluated considering the survival of patients. Functional results were assessed as pain intensity in VAS score and MSTS score.

Results

The mean follow-up of patients was 10.2 months (range 6–26.3 years). At the latest evaluation, 23 patients were alive with disease, 3 patients were alive without evidence of disease and 14 patients were dead with disease. There was a significant better survival in patients treated with PFR compared to IMN and EPR groups (p = 0.0080). No differences in term of survival were found comparing impending vs actual pathological fracture and oligo vs multiple metastases. After surgery, all patients experienced improvement in quality of life resulting from reduction in pain. Mean MSTS score was 22.4. The overall complications rate was 22.5%. The most frequent complication was dislocation followed by wound dehiscence and deep infections.

Conclusion

Modular tumour prosthesis for proximal femur replacement provides good functional outcome, relative low incidence of complications and higher life quality in the medium term. Oncologic results were influenced by type of surgery, biased by the correct indications for resection and nailing. Preoperative general health condition, life expectancy and ambulatory capacity may influence treatment strategy. With the numbers available, the patients with actual pathologic or impending fracture of the proximal femur treated with resection had a significantly higher survival, especially those with metastases from renal carcinoma or multiple myeloma.

### Predictive factors for failed nonsurgical management of long bone metastasis and myeloma [^112Pz8kE]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Bone is the third most common organ affected by metastatic carcinoma, with the incidence of metastatic bone disease estimated to be more than 280,000 patients per year in the United States. Osseous metastases can cause substantial morbidity related to pain, impaired mobility, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. In addition, pathologic fractures afflict up to one third of cancer survivors and may necessitate reconstructive surgeries, subjecting patients to potential complications. Systemic treatment alone is typically not sufficient to eradicate bone metastasis, so additional local control is often needed to relieve pain, avoid fracture, and allow continued mobility. Radiation is helpful in this respect, but local progression and pathologic fracture can occur even after radiation therapy; for example, postradiation fracture has been reported to occur in 7.7% of femoral metastasis. As such, long bone metastases that are considered at risk for fracture are typically treated with a combination of surgical stabilization and radiation therapy. When indicated, surgical intervention should be performed sooner rather than later to reduce the morbidity of activity restriction and potential fracture. However, prophylactic fixation carries its own morbidity and risk, so appropriate patient selection is critical.

Over the past several decades, multiple systems have been proposed to assess fracture risk and thereby help determine those patients who may benefit from prophylactic stabilization. Mirels criteria, originally published in 1989, has become a historical standard of practice and may still be the most commonly used system; however, it does not account for primary tumor histology, bone modifying agents, and other patient-specific factors that may influence fracture risk. Furthermore, some argue that Mirels score lacks specificity, leading to overtreatment, and high interobserver variance results in poor reproducibility. Indeed, when measuring the lesion size, Howard et al.claims that many practicing physicians are unclear if the "thirds" in the Mirels size criterion is referring to the proportion of bone shaft or cortical involvement. Newer published guidelines describe femoral shaft metastatic lesions of 30 mm or more in the greatest dimension of axial cortical involvement on CT as predictive of fracture risk; however, this criterion is less practical as CT imaging is not routinely performed during the assessment of fracture risk, and most clinical decisions are made using plain radiographs.

### Clinical outcomes among patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy to femur metastases for oligometastatic disease control or reirradiation: results from a large single-institution experience [^113HHTKg]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bone metastases impact up to 20% of patients with advanced cancer. Skeletal-related events can impair quality of life and increase the risk of death. The proximal femur is the most common site of pathologic involvement in the appendicular skeleton and at particular risk of fracture due to its role in weight-bearing.

Palliative radiation has commonly been used to alleviate painful femur metastases and reduce fracture risk. Patients who may benefit from prophylactic fixation may be identified using the Mirels criteria, which combines radiographic and clinical factors to identify long bones at high risk of fracture after irradiation. Systemic treatment, and pain or bone-modifying agents, or radiopharmaceuticals, also play important roles for femur management, which frequently involves a multimodal approach.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) enables the delivery of ablative doses of radiation and has become increasingly adopted to address oligometastatic bone disease, in the setting of radioresistant histologies, reirradiation, and for potential benefits in pain control. However, there remains limited data regarding the safety or efficacy of femur SBRT. The SABR-COMET, trial demonstrated survival benefits of comprehensive SBRT for patients with oligometastatic disease and a controlled primary tumor but excluded patients with femur metastases. A randomized clinical trial comparing single-fraction SBRT to conventional palliative radiation therapy (RT) for nonspine bone metastases included only 18% of patients with extremity lesions. A recent retrospective multicenter pooled analysis of SBRT for long bones included 84 patients with femur metastases and reported a 6% rate of femur fracture (n = 5) and identified a significant association of extraosseus extension with fracture and local failure risk across all long bone sites. It remains less clear whether the potential benefits of SBRT in local control outweigh the potential risks of toxicity for this weight-bearing location. Spinal SBRT-induced vertebral compression fracture has been associated with dose per fraction or underlying instability as per the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Scoring system but less is known of predictive factors for fracture after nonspine bone SBRT.

### Not all secondary bone tumours are secondaries. concurrent metastatic breast carcinoma and chondrosarcoma of the femur [^1153sY2S]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We present a case of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast in a patient who sustained a pathological fracture of the distal femur. Histology of the distal femur lesion excised at the time of endoprosthetic replacement confirmed this to be a primary chondrosarcoma. We have reviewed the literature and identified previously documented cases of concurrent breast carcinoma and chondrosarcoma of bone. A high index of suspicion is warranted and the diagnosis must be first confirmed before rushing to internal fixation (therapeutic or prophylactic) assuming them to be secondary bone lesions from the known primary cancer even in patients with multiple metastases.

### Lack of clinical evidence for postoperative radiotherapy after surgical fixation of impending or actual pathologic fractures in the long bones in patients with cancer; a systematic review [^113tEskr]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with disseminated cancer and bone metastases have a limited life expectancy and therefore any treatment should have a clear beneficial effect, outweighing all possible downsides. This systematic review aims to identify and evaluate available evidence regarding function, pain, quality of life, survival and complications of postoperative radiotherapy (RT) after surgical stabilization of impending or actual pathologic fractures of the long bones due to bone metastases. A literature search resulted in two articles reporting on 64 and 110 patients of whom 55% and 28% received postoperative RT, respectively. Both studies were retrospective cohort studies and postoperative RT had been administered depending on the surgeons' choice. The first study reported better outcomes regarding function, re-interventions and survival in patients receiving postoperative RT. The second study reported no significant difference regarding complications between the two groups. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the observational character of both studies, risk of indication bias, small study sizes, use of non-standardized outcome measures, and limited statistical analyses. The current available literature is insufficient to conclude whether postoperative RT after surgical stabilization should be standard care. It is important to realize this lack of clear evidence when calling upon RT as adjuvant palliative treatment.

### Ambulation recovery after surgery for metastases to the femur [^112tZPLe]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

From our results, postoperative ambulation status, as a part of PS, contributes to decision making of further treatment. The surgical goal of bone metastases is durable skeletal stabilization, which reduces pain and enables immediate weight bearing, and achieving bone union at the fracture site, osteosynthesis, is not an ultimate goal. The surgeon should also consider surgical options that could minimize the impact on future treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy postoperatively 2, 3. Forsberg et al. recently confirmed that their Bayesian model‐based survival estimation system, which could assess postoperative 1‐month and 6‐month survival, is valid for clinical use 16.

Regarding the effect of prophylactic fixation for impending fracture, even though it was not statistically significant, we could find a tendency that impending fracture group had a better outcome with ambulation recovery than pathologic fracture group (p = .055). Many studies suggested the advantage of prophylactic fixation of impending fracture in perspective of orthopedic surgeon 16, 17, 18, 19. Mirels suggested a scoring system with criteria such as lesion site, characteristic, and size and degree of pain. When the lesion has a score of more than 8, the metastatic lesion requires prophylactic internal fixation because of a higher risk of pathologic fracture 18. In Arvinius et al. 's retrospective study with 65 femoral metastasis cases, preventive fixation with intramedullary nailing showed both a higher survival and ambulation rate at 6 months postoperatively 20. Moreover, we found that patients with impending fracture had better survival compared with patients with complete pathologic fracture (Table 4). Therefore, early detection and surgery of femoral impending fractures seems important for ambulation recovery and subsequent survival in patients with femur metastases.

Regarding specific circumstances for bone metastasis, more specifically with respect to patients with femoral metastasis (radiotherapy), AAOS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering radiotherapy to decrease the rate of femur fractures in patients with metastatic carcinoma or multiple myeloma lesions deemed at increased risk based on the combination of imaging findings and lesion-related pain.

### Prognostic patterns in the histopathology of pulmonary adenocarcinoma… [^117B44Tz]. ASCO (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary neoplasia is exceptional in this regard because it can cause marked functional impairment that leads to death in the absence of definitive, pathology-proven invasion. A single layer of pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells may spread along the expanse of alveolar surfaces without invading alveolar septal stroma in a pattern of growth that has come to be referred to as lepidic because of its vague resemblance in cross-section to a butterfly. Furthermore, this process is commonly multifocal. Enlarged and poorly functional malignant alveolar cells may block gas exchange and cause respiratory failure and death without destroying underlying lung tissue. As Liebow predicted, the 1999/2004 WHO classification that redefined BAC as an in situ lesion proved to be a source of confusion.

Reference to invasive BAC or BAC with nonpulmonary metastases continued to appear on pathology reports and in the medical literature, thus defying the premise that the term BAC be constrained to preinvasive lesions. Several interesting observations emerge from this study of surgically resected tumors. First, there is a picture of the approximate frequency of the carefully defined lesions described in the new classification and a preliminary assessment of prognostic differences among the various categories. The prevalence and prognostic significance of these newly defined categories will require additional study, and the implementation of multiple early screening strategies is likely to increase the frequency with which such lesions are identified. 6found that prognosis that was tracked with the dominant histologic pattern and documentation of secondary pattern provided no additional prognostic information.

In fact, the authors were able to stratify patterns into three groups to augment statistical power and found that overall survival, disease-specific survival, and disease-free survival were all improved in lepidic-predominant tumors in comparison with acinar-predominant tumors and that survival in both of these tumor patterns was better than for pattern 3. Another important finding in this study is the impact of invasive tumor size compared with overall tumor size on prognosis. Improved prognostic value was conferred when the invasive component was used to stratify patients instead of overall lesion size. This finding confirms the premise behind inclusion of a new category of minimally invasive adenocarcinoma to distinguish the relatively improved prognosis in patients with these tumors.

Although the new recommendations provide guidance for pathologists in measuring the invasive component when distributed across multiple sections, this approach remains to be validated and is likely to also be subject to a high degree of variability between observers.
