## Question

Low platelet with alcohol intox

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about low platelet count in the setting of alcohol intoxication, including mechanisms, clinical implications, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and quantify "low platelets" and the clinical context of alcohol intoxication. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, distinguishing acute effects from chronic liver disease. Next, I will review the clinical implications, including bleeding risk and prognostic signals. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach and thresholds that matter. Finally, I will consider management strategies, including transfusion thresholds, pharmacologic options, and peri-procedural planning, and I will close with special scenarios and a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and context so I don't jump to conclusions: thrombocytopenia is typically defined as a platelet count less than 150 × 10⁹/L, and "alcohol intoxication" spans acute ingestion with measurable blood alcohol concentration to chronic harmful use with or without liver disease. I need to ensure I separate acute ethanol effects from chronic liver disease, because the mechanisms and management differ substantially [^53b5bbef] [^7b1ac934].

> Now, I will examine the pathophysiology in acute intoxication. Wait, let me verify the direct marrow-suppressive effect of ethanol: classic inpatient studies show that alcohol ingestion produces a biphasic platelet decline with an early transient drop and a more gradual fall after 48–72 hours, with recovery after cessation, indicating impaired production and turnover rather than just sequestration or destruction, and this occurs even without liver disease or folate deficiency, which I should keep in mind when I see a low platelet count in an intoxicated patient without cirrhosis [^e7424cd3] [^7c1e4c06].

> Hold on, I should also review functional platelet effects because count and function are not identical. Moderate alcohol acutely inhibits platelet aggregation and thrombus formation ex vivo, with effects persisting beyond the time blood alcohol returns to baseline, which can compound bleeding risk even when the platelet number is only modestly reduced. This functional impairment is clinically relevant in trauma and procedural contexts [^dafefeb2] [^dc7f2a7e].

> Next, I should review chronic alcohol-related liver disease mechanisms. Splenic sequestration from portal hypertension and reduced thrombopoietin production in cirrhosis are major drivers of thrombocytopenia, and alcohol itself can suppress marrow, while nutritional deficiencies like folate deficiency further worsen production. I need to remember that in compensated cirrhosis, platelet adhesion may be partially restored by increased vWF and decreased ADAMTS-13, so the relationship between platelet count and bleeding is not linear, which affects transfusion thresholds [^30313a26] [^7b1ac934] [^bde9eefb].

> I will now examine the clinical implications. Let me think about bleeding risk first: in liver disease, many patients remain hemostatically competent at surprisingly low platelet counts due to rebalanced coagulation, but when counts fall below about 50 × 10⁹/L, procedural bleeding risk rises, and for neurosurgical or TBI contexts, higher thresholds are typically used. I should double-check that these thresholds are evidence-based rather than dogma, and yes, trauma and neurocritical care guidelines endorse > 50 × 10⁹/L for ongoing bleeding and > 100 × 10⁹/L for TBI or intracerebral hemorrhage, acknowledging that liver disease nuances may modify decisions [^c02a4c05] [^9dc75d51] [^30313a26].

> But wait, what if the low platelet count is a prognostic marker rather than just a bleeding risk? In alcohol-associated hepatitis, higher platelet counts at presentation associate with histologic alcoholic hepatitis and worse short-term mortality, whereas very low platelets suggest advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis rather than pure alcoholic hepatitis. In cirrhosis cohorts, lower platelets predict decompensation and mortality, and in transplant waitlists, higher platelets predict delisting for clinical improvement, so I should interpret platelet count in disease-phase context rather than in isolation [^3105b78d] [^0ca6f475] [^21953d19] [^9af05971].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. I need to ensure I distinguish acute alcohol-induced thrombocytopenia from chronic liver disease, sepsis-related consumption, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, and immune etiologies. A careful history of intake pattern, liver disease stigmata, infection, and medications, plus CBC, smear, liver panel, INR, and renal function, are essential. In suspected alcoholic hepatitis, platelet and white cell counts can help differentiate histologic alcoholic hepatitis from decompensated cirrhosis, but I should confirm that biopsy remains the gold standard when feasible [^e26122a8] [^3105b78d] [^820caba5].

> Let me consider management in acute intoxication without cirrhosis. The priority is alcohol cessation and supportive care, because platelets typically recover over 7–10 days as marrow production normalizes. I should confirm that no immediate transfusion is needed unless there is active bleeding or a high-risk procedure, and in most noncirrhotic, nonbleeding patients, observation with repeat counts is reasonable while addressing withdrawal and nutrition [^e7424cd3] [^7c1e4c06].

> For chronic liver disease with thrombocytopenia, I should verify transfusion thresholds by procedural risk. For low-risk procedures, many patients do not require prophylactic platelets above 50 × 10⁹/L, whereas high-risk procedures or active bleeding often prompt a target of ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L, and neurosurgery or TBI generally uses ≥ 100 × 10⁹/L. I need to ensure I also consider fibrinogen and viscoelastic testing when available to guide therapy, and avoid over-transfusing given limited increments and risks [^c02a4c05] [^9dc75d51] [^5f1af8ec].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacologic options for persistent thrombocytopenia. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists such as lusutrombopag or avatrombopag can raise platelet counts in chronic liver disease and reduce transfusion needs before procedures, though they take 7–14 days to peak effect and are not for acute bleeding. I should confirm that guidelines endorse their use in selected elective scenarios, which they do, particularly when repeated transfusion is undesirable or ineffective [^5eedf9f7] [^b36e0300].

> I need to check special scenarios where platelet count modifies risk. In alcohol withdrawal, lower platelets independently predict progression to delirium tremens, so a low count should heighten vigilance for complicated withdrawal and may support proactive benzodiazepine protocols. In trauma, alcohol intoxication blunts catecholamine responses and may worsen hypotension, so even modest thrombocytopenia plus coagulopathy can be consequential, reinforcing early correction of coagulopathy and careful resuscitation planning [^cce9b274] [^869068cc].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. In acute alcohol intoxication without cirrhosis, low platelets largely reflect direct marrow suppression and impaired turnover, with recovery after cessation. In chronic alcohol use with liver disease, thrombocytopenia is multifactorial from splenic sequestration, reduced thrombopoietin, marrow suppression, and nutritional deficits, and the platelet count tracks disease severity and prognosis. Management should be risk-adapted, using restrictive transfusion thresholds, leveraging TPO receptor agonists for elective procedures, and prioritizing alcohol abstinence and supportive care to allow endogenous recovery [^e7424cd3] [^30313a26] [^5eedf9f7].

---

Low platelets in alcohol intoxication are most often due to **direct marrow suppression** from ethanol [^e7424cd3], with additional contributions from **splenic sequestration** in chronic drinkers [^30313a26] and **nutritional deficiencies** (notably folate) [^7c1e4c06]. Thrombocytopenia is common, typically mild to moderate, and usually recovers within 1–2 weeks of abstinence [^e7424cd3]. Management is supportive: stop alcohol, correct deficiencies, and monitor counts; transfuse only if there is active bleeding or a procedure requires it, using standard thresholds (≥ 50×10⁹/L for most procedures, ≥ 100×10⁹/L for neurosurgery/TBI) [^c02a4c05] [^9dc75d51]. Persistent or severe thrombocytopenia warrants evaluation for liver disease, hypersplenism, or other causes [^bde9eefb].

---

## Pathophysiology of low platelet count in alcohol intoxication

Several mechanisms contribute to **thrombocytopenia** in acute and chronic alcohol use:

- **Direct marrow suppression**: Ethanol inhibits megakaryocyte proliferation and platelet production, causing a dose-dependent decline in platelet counts [^e7424cd3] [^7c1e4c06].

- **Splenic sequestration**: Portal hypertension from alcoholic liver disease causes splenomegaly and platelet pooling, reducing circulating counts [^30313a26] [^bde9eefb].

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Chronic alcohol use often causes folate deficiency, impairing DNA synthesis and platelet production [^7c1e4c06].

- **Increased platelet destruction**: Alcohol-related liver disease can trigger immune-mediated platelet destruction or consumptive coagulopathy [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and severity

Thrombocytopenia in alcohol intoxication is **usually mild to moderate** (50–150×10⁹/L) and often asymptomatic, though it increases bleeding risk, especially with trauma or invasive procedures [^30313a26]. Severe thrombocytopenia (< 50×10⁹/L) is less common and suggests advanced liver disease, hypersplenism, or an alternative diagnosis [^8ea8eaa9].

---

## Clinical implications and complications

Low platelet counts in alcohol intoxication can lead to:

- **Increased bleeding risk**: Easy bruising, petechiae, mucosal bleeding, and prolonged bleeding after injury or procedures [^38ebc93f].

- **Exacerbation of gastrointestinal bleeding**: Alcohol-related gastritis, varices, or ulcers may bleed more profusely [^notfound].

- **Delayed wound healing**: Impaired clot formation can complicate recovery from injuries or surgery [^8b0e6c25].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **supportive care** and addressing the underlying cause:

- **Alcohol cessation**: The most critical step; platelet counts typically recover within 1–2 weeks of abstinence [^e7424cd3].

- **Nutritional support**: Replace folate, thiamine, and other deficiencies; provide a balanced diet [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Track platelet counts and clinical bleeding; most cases resolve spontaneously with abstinence [^e7424cd3].

- **Platelet transfusion**: Reserve for active bleeding or procedures requiring hemostasis; use standard thresholds (≥ 50×10⁹/L for most procedures, ≥ 100×10⁹/L for neurosurgery/TBI) [^c02a4c05] [^9dc75d51].

- **Treat underlying liver disease**: Manage cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hypersplenism as indicated [^5eedf9f7].

---

## Prognosis and recovery

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with alcohol cessation and supportive care; platelet counts usually normalize within 1–2 weeks [^e7424cd3]. Persistent thrombocytopenia beyond this window should prompt evaluation for ongoing alcohol use, liver disease, hypersplenism, or alternative diagnoses [^8ea8eaa9].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention centers on **alcohol education**, counseling, and treatment for alcohol use disorder, along with nutritional supplementation to prevent deficiencies that worsen thrombocytopenia [^8b0e6c25].

---

Low platelets in alcohol intoxication are common and usually reflect direct marrow suppression, splenic sequestration, or nutritional deficits; with abstinence and supportive care, counts typically recover within 1–2 weeks, and transfusion is reserved for bleeding or procedural needs.

### Effects of alcohol ingestion post-exercise on platelet aggregation [^dc7f2a7e]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

The present study examined the influence of ingesting a moderate dose of alcohol on platelet count and platelet aggregation during recovery following exercise. Nineteen subjects (11 male and 8 female) were studied immediately after a standardised cycle ergometer test and during the 24-h period of recovery. In random order, alcohol (0.7 g/kg body mass) was given 1 h after exercise on one test occasion, while an equal volume of alcohol-free solution was administered on the other. Venous blood samples were obtained at baseline, post-exercise, and at 1, 5, and 22 h post-alcohol ingestion. Blood alcohol level increased significantly 1 h after the ingestion of alcohol, but decreased and returned to the resting baseline level at 5 h during recovery. Males and females subjects exhibited similar mean values of platelet count, platelet aggregation, and beta-thromboglobulin concentration at rest and following exercise and recovery. A significant increase in platelet count and a decrease in platelet aggregation using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was found following exercise. Although plasma beta-thromboglobulin level (pooled data for males and females) showed an increase by 26.0% (from a mean pre-exercise value of 22.3–28.1 IU/ml), this rise was not significant (P > .05). The post-exercise increase in platelet count was mainly due to exercise-induced plasma volume loss. During recovery, while the increase in platelet count post-exercise returned to the baseline level in control and alcohol trials, the optical density of platelet aggregation remained significantly depressed at 5-h during recovery in the alcohol trial but not in the normal control condition. It is concluded that exercise induces significant reduction in platelet aggregation and the consumption of alcohol after physical exercise delays the normal return of platelet aggregation to the resting baseline levels during recovery.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we have shown that the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis is difficult on clinical grounds; we have also found two clinical parameters that can assist the clinician with the diagnosis. This may in time prove to be very useful when determining treatment strategies.

### Acute and delayed antithrombotic effects of alcohol in humans [^dafefeb2]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Alcohol intake, especially in the form of red wine, has been shown to inhibit platelet function. However, whether alcohol in spirits may inhibit platelet-dependent thrombosis in humans up to 6 hours after ingestion is unknown and was assessed in this study. Platelet thrombus that is formed on exposure of an aortic media (simulating deep arterial injury or plaque rupture) to flowing blood was assessed in an ex vivo Badimon's superfusion chamber at shear rates of 754 or 2,546 seconds(-1) (simulating flow in normal or stenosed arteries). Twelve healthy subjects were studied before and at 20 minutes and 6 hours after consumption of 2 ounces of 40% alcohol. Blood alcohol level was 1.1 ± 0. 1, 8.2 ± 0.7, and 1.3 ± 0.2 mmol/L at baseline, 20 minutes and 6 hours, respectively, after alcohol consumption (analysis of variance [ANOVA] p = 0.0001). Compared with baseline, platelet thrombus formation at the low shear rate flow was significantly decreased by 57% and 61% at 20 minutes and 6 hours, respectively, after alcohol intake (ANOVA p = 0.0001). Platelet thrombus deposition at the high shear rate was similarly inhibited to 68% and 64% of baseline values at 20 minutes and 6 hours, respectively (ANOVA p = 0.003). Men and women showed equal benefit. Thus, moderate alcohol intake in humans significantly inhibited platelet thrombus deposition under low and high shear rates of arterial flow conditions. This antithrombotic effect of a single alcohol drink, persisting for 6 hours and even after blood alcohol level has returned to baseline, may be clinically relevant to the cardioprotective effects of alcohol in men and women.

### Peri-operative identification and management of patients with unhealthy alcohol intake [^06fd3077]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Intra‐operative

The systemic effects of harmful alcohol intake, in combination with other potential issues such as acute illness and secondary organ dysfunction, may warrant modification of anaesthesia techniques (Table 2). It should be noted that there are few outcome data supporting neuraxial techniques over general anaesthesia in patients with established liver disease.

Table 2
Anaesthetic considerations for patients with harmful alcohol intake (with or without associated organ disease) particularly those with hepatic, cardiac and autonomic dysfunction.

Given the challenges encountered in patients with harmful alcohol consumption, it may be more appropriate to consider performing surgery using regional or local anaesthetic techniques. Potential intra‐ and postoperative benefits include avoidance of the cardiorespiratory and neurological effects of general anaesthesia in a high‐risk cohort; enhanced seizure detection in patients who are awake; and mitigation of pharmacological effects of systemic medications. Due consideration should be given to factors influencing the suitability of regional techniques in these patients, including appropriateness of techniques for surgical procedures and their duration; reduced patient cooperation or reduction in mental capacity due to intoxication or chronic neurological impairment; presence of coagulopathy and/or thrombocytopenia; and the influence of hypoproteinaemia (secondary to malnutrition and/or hepatic synthetic dysfunction) on local anaesthetic distribution and dosing limits.

Pharmacological issues

Chronic harmful alcohol intake and related organ dysfunction, as well as acute intoxication, may significantly influence the efficacy and safety of commonly used medications, with a commensurate requirement to modify or avoid their use. Where there is alcohol‐related secondary organ dysfunction, judicious administration of intra‐operative anaesthetic drugs is warranted (Table 3). This reflects vulnerability to the cardiorespiratory effects of such medications, as well as the widely recognised changes in drug pharmacokinetics seen in alcohol‐related liver disease.

### White cell count and platelet count associate with histological alcoholic hepatitis in jaundiced harmful drinkers [^6b05580e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

For pragmatic reasons, treatment decisions are often made without liver biopsy in those patients with suspected severe alcoholic hepatitis. These reasons include the availability and safety of transjugular liver biopsy. They also reflect the trials of therapy in severe alcoholic hepatitis. While there have been positive trials of steroids where all patients were biopsied, there have also been positive studies where biopsy was not a requirement. This leaves the hepatology community in two camps regarding the importance of biopsy, and this is reflected in practice guidelines where precise indications for liver biopsy are not well established. Recent EASL Guidelines recognise that many centres rely on clinical criteria, and do not consider biopsy as routine practise. However the guidance includes biopsy in the therapeutic algorithm and recommends that it should be considered in high risk patients according to prognostic assessment with Maddrey's for example.

### Effects of alcohol on hemostasis [^e2af9911]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Several epidemiologic studies have shown that moderate intake of alcohol is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the mechanism is not fully elucidated. One of the proposed mechanisms of the protective effect of moderate alcohol intake is its beneficial effect on hemostasis. The aim of this review is to summarize the effect of ethanol intake on platelet aggregation and activation, coagulation factors including von Willebrand factor (vWF), and the fibrinolytic system. With regard to the effect of alcohol on platelet function, evidence in the literature suggests both platelet activation and platelet inhibition by ethanol. A unifying hypothesis is that platelets are partially activated by ethanol, with partial degranulation allowing for continued circulation of platelets with impaired function. Evidence also exists showing that ethanol intake decreases fibrinogen, factor VII, and vWF levels. In addition, alcohol intake has been found to increase fibrinolysis by increasing tissue plasminogen activator activity. The effect of ethanol on platelets, coagulation factors, and the fibrinolytic system is likely to contribute to protection against CVD.

### Peri-operative identification and management of patients with unhealthy alcohol intake [^5f1af8ec]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Haematological issues

The treatment of coagulation abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis before surgery has become increasingly complex. For low‐risk procedures, routine administration of blood products such as fresh frozen plasma to achieve a specific laboratory coagulation value has little benefit and may cause harm. Where bleeding is considered likely, such as in those undergoing major surgery, it is reasonable to target specific endpoints such as a platelet count of > 50 × 10 9 cells.l ‐1 or a fibrinogen concentration of > 1 g.l ‐1 in decompensated disease. Appropriate haematological involvement, supplemented by investigations such as viscoelastic testing, is critical for decision‐making in complex cases.

The literature on the efficacy and safety of peri‐operative tranexamic acid in patients with chronic harmful alcohol intake and associated liver disease is incomplete. Recent recommendations from NICE advise routine prophylaxis in particular circumstances, in keeping with several large meta‐analyses. This contrasts with a recent, large multicentre randomised controlled trial indicating that tranexamic acid use in acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, a known complication of cirrhosis, does not reduce 5‐day mortality from bleeding and may slightly increase the risk of venous thromboembolism and seizures. The authors highlighted the divergent findings in this study compared with a preceding Cochrane review, attributing this in part to the potential for erroneous results in meta‐analyses of small studies.

Literature examining tranexamic acid use for the management of bleeding in other emergency settings predominantly consists of single‐centre studies and has not demonstrated an increased thrombotic risk, although high doses may increase the risk of seizures. These studies do not specifically focus on patients with harmful alcohol intake or liver disease and the true risk/benefit of antifibrinolytic therapy in this group therefore remains controversial. In the absence of definitive evidence or a specific contraindication, it remains reasonable to give tranexamic acid for the prevention or management of acute haemorrhage in most circumstances. Avoidance of high doses is advised where seizure risk is elevated, such as acute withdrawal states or when patients are at risk of this.

### Enhanced platelet-activating factor synthesis facilitates acute and delayed effects of ethanol-intoxicated thermal burn Injury [^5f6ee9d1]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Thermal burn injuries in patients who are alcohol-intoxicated result in greater morbidity and mortality. Murine models combining ethanol and localized thermal burn injury reproduce the systemic toxicity seen in human subjects, which consists of both acute systemic cytokine production with multiple organ dysfunction, as well as a delayed systemic immunosuppression. However, the exact mechanisms for these acute and delayed effects are unclear. These studies sought to define the role of the lipid mediator platelet-activating factor in the acute and delayed effects of intoxicated burn injury. Combining ethanol and thermal burn injury resulted in increased enzymatic platelet-activating factor generation in a keratinocyte cell line in vitro, human skin explants ex vivo, as well as in murine skin in vivo. Further, the acute increase in inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, and the systemic immunosuppressive effects of intoxicated thermal burn injury were suppressed in mice lacking platelet-activating factor receptors. Together, these studies provide a potential mechanism and treatment strategies for the augmented toxicity and immunosuppressive effects of thermal burn injury in the setting of acute ethanol exposure, which involves the pleotropic lipid mediator platelet-activating factor.

### Contusion progression following traumatic brain injury: a review of clinical and radiological predictors, and influence on outcome [^771ab88e]. Neurocritical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Coagulopathy is a common finding in TBI, with up to 63% of patients with severe TBI displaying abnormal coagulation tests on admission. The predictive value of admission coagulopathy on lesion progression has predominantly been studied in the context of progressive hemorrhagic injury, with few studies examining its role in predicting progression of contusions specifically. Despite its common occurrence, the reliability of coagulopathy in predicting contusion progression therefore remains controversial. This is also likely due to varying definitions of coagulopathy between studies, early administration of coagulation products, and potential exclusion of patients with an initial coagulopathy due to emergent surgical evacuation; Allison et al. have reported a reduced risk of progression in patients who receive early red blood cell transfusion.

Many studies on contusion progression report no association with coagulopathy. Among those in which coagulopathy does predict progression, INR and platelet count appear to be of particular importance. For each unit increase in INR, risk of contusion progression increases sevenfold, with patients who exhibit an INR > 1.2 being almost three times more likely to experience progression than those with an INR ≤ 1.2. In a study by Juratli et al. a platelet count < 100 × 10 9 /L was associated with a close to sixfold increased risk of progression. History of anticoagulation or anti-platelet use does not appear to be associated with progression.

Low triglyceride levels (< 150 mg/dL) are associated with a fourfold increased risk of contusion progression. Since triglycerides contribute to overall cholesterol levels, an important constituent of cell membranes, patients with low triglyceride levels may have more fragile endothelium which is more prone to fracturing following TBI. Additionally, studies have shown higher frequency of cerebral microbleeds in patients with low triglyceride levels.

Alcohol intoxication is known to impair platelet function and contribute to coagulopathy. Although Carnevale et al. found blood alcohol level to correlate with contusion size on follow-up scan, they, along with several other studies, did not find this to be predictive of presence of progression. In addition to its anti-platelet effects, alcohol reduces vascular tone; systemic hypotension may therefore counteract the anti-platelet effects of alcohol on contusion progression.

### White cell count and platelet count associate with histological alcoholic hepatitis in jaundiced harmful drinkers [^d46e72fd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is defined by a constellation of histological abnormalities. These consist of liver cell damage (in the form of ballooning degeneration), a neutrophil inflammatory cell infiltrate, Mallory bodies and pericellular fibrosis. This fibrosis characteristically commences in the perivenular zone and has a "chicken wire appearance". These histological features are associated with a clinical syndrome of alcoholic hepatitis, but the severity of the clinical syndrome does not closely reflect the severity of the histology. The clinical syndrome can be mild with non-specific symptoms and mild liver transaminase abnormalities, or severe with jaundice, ascites and encephalopathy.

Prognosis in alcoholic hepatitis correlates with the severity of the underlying histological lesion. In severe cases, however, this prognostic information is hard to obtain as transabdominal liver biopsy is precluded on the grounds of coagulopathy associated with the liver failure. Transjugular liver biopsy is an alternative but is not always available. In addition, it has a small but definite mortality in this population. For this reason, prognostic scores based on clinical parameters such as the prothrombin time, bilirubin, white cell count and renal function have been developed. These are now used in many units to make treatment decisions, particularly to decide whether to give the patient corticosteroids or not. The clinical utility of these scores means that many physicians do not confirm the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis with biopsy but treat according to Maddrey's Discriminant Function (DF) or the Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score This has a pragmatic attraction, particularly in centres where transjugular liver biopsy is not available. There is a concern however that some cases that are treated are not alcoholic hepatitis at all but decompensated cirrhosis. The outcome of these patients when treated with steroids is not known.

In this study, our aims were to report on the frequency with which the clinical diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis is inaccurate and to determine if there were any clinical differences between the group with or without alcoholic hepatitis on biopsy. We also sought to assess the clinical utility of any observed differences between the two groups.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^5eedf9f7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Figure 1 — Risk mitigation and perioperative hemostasis management advises to "Refer to high-volume liver surgery and/or transplant center" and implement supportive measures including "Alcohol and tobacco cessation for all patients", treatment of reversible hepatic insults, and optimization of decompensation management. For coagulation, if "Thromboelastography available?" it is used as "Thromboelastography used to guide correction of coagulopathy"; if not, assess "Severe thrombocytopenia (< 50,000)?", where a positive branch recommends "Thrombopoietin agonist dosed per baseline platelet count, initiated approximately 10 days prior to surgery, to reduce need for transfusions and possibly reduce bleeding risk", and a negative branch states "No routine correction of platelets", after which patients proceed to "SURGERY".

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^7b1ac934]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Coagulation in cirrhosis — nonhepatic modifiers of bleeding and clotting include anemia severity, von Willebrand factor (vWF) changes, AICF, renal failure, and alcohol. When bleeding causes anemia, once the hematocrit drops below approximately 25%, the erythrocyte concentration is insufficient to push platelets toward vessel walls, which impairs coagulation. In cirrhosis, The vWF amount and length are increased and vWF levels may further increase as lipopolysaccharide blood concentration increases. During decompensation, patients may develop AICF; high factor VIII levels help distinguish AICF from disseminated intravascular coagulation, and AICF is best characterized as a form of hyperfibrinolysis with premature clot dissolution and clinically evident mucosal oozing and puncture wound bleeding. Patients with renal failure have unique impairments to platelet function with reduced serotonin in their α-granules, disrupted intracellular calcium flux, and dysregulated formation of thromboxane A2, leading to decreased adhesive and aggregative properties. Alcohol intoxication can affect coagulation with bidirectional effects, as alcohol can impair platelet production and initial clot formation but can also decrease fibrinolysis.

### Mean platelet volume and mortality in patients with alcohol use disorder [^d4f83bea]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Several recent studies have pointed out the relationship of platelet size with increased mortality or adverse clinical course. Most studies show that increased mean platelet volume (MPV) may be associated with a deleterious outcome in different settings such as sepsis or neoplasia, whereas other researchers have found the opposite. In inflammatory conditions there is an altered secretion of several cytokines, some of them exerting a marked influence on platelet biogenesis and/or on platelet activation and aggregation. Alcohol use disorder is a chronic situation characterized by a protracted low-grade inflammation. In this study we analyze the relationship between proinflammatory cytokines and MPV and their relationships with mortality in patients with alcohol abuse. We determined serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and routine laboratory variables among 184 patients with alcohol use disorder admitted to our hospital and followed-up for a median of 42 months. We found that MPV was inversely related to TNF-α (ρ = -0.34), and directly to IL-8 (ρ = 0.32, p < 0.001 in both cases) and to IL-6 (ρ = 0.15; p = 0.046). Reduced MPV was related both with short-term (< 6 months) and long-term mortality. Conclusion: These results suggest that inflammatory cytokines are strongly related to MPV. A low MPV is associated with a poor prognosis among patients with alcohol use disorder.

### White cell count and platelet count associate with histological alcoholic hepatitis in jaundiced harmful drinkers [^3105b78d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with suspected alcoholic hepatitis and a Discriminant Function ≥ 32 underwent liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Of these (n = 58), 43 had histological features of alcoholic hepatitis and 15 (25%) did not.

We aimed to determine the laboratory features that differentiated those patients with a histological diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis from those without, and assess potential clinical utility.

Methods

Laboratory investigations at presentation for each of the histologically confirmed cases of alcoholic hepatitis (n = 43) were compared to those without (n = 15) to determine whether there were differences between the two groups. Univariate analysis was by Mann Whitney U Test and Multivariate analysis was by a stepwise approach.

Results

White cell count (16.2 ± 10.5 v 6.9 ± 3.5 (× 10 9 /L); p = 0.0001) and platelet count (178 ± 81 v 98.4 ± 43 (× 10 9 /L); p = 0.0005) were higher in the patients with histological features of alcoholic hepatitis than in those without. The area under the ROC curve for AH diagnosis was estimated to be 0.83 (0.73, 0.94) and 0.81 (0.69, 0.93) for white cell count and platelet count respectively.

Conclusions

Clinicians cannot accurately differentiate patients with or without alcoholic hepatitis without liver biopsy. This is critically important when deciding on specific therapies such as corticosteroids or when interpreting data from future trials in which biopsy is not mandated. In situations where liver biopsy is unsuitable or unavailable the white cell and platelet counts can be used to determine the likelihood of histological alcoholic hepatitis and guide treatment.

### Alcohol-induced metabolomic differences in humans [^5a4885ab]. Translational Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Ether lipids (for example, PC ae C30:2 and PC ae C40:6) have a role as precursor of platelet-activating factor. Platelet-activating factor is an important mediator in hemostasis and has an important role in platelet aggregation (that is, thrombotic effects). A number of studies indicate that ethanol directly affects hemostasis via a number of mechanisms, including platelet aggregation and activation. This mechanism is still not fully understood; however, based on our results, it can be hypothesized that reduced platelet-activating factor levels in response to moderate-to-heavy alcohol consumption might form a bottleneck in the process of platelet activation leading to poor platelet aggregation and to alcohol-related hemorrhagic events. This is supported by studies from the United States and Sweden showing that the baseline incidence of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding increased by threefold as alcohol consumption increased from ≤ 1 drink to > 20 drinks per week.

Conclusion and outlook

Our study provides new insights into the impact of alcohol consumption on human metabolism. Our results suggest that metabolomic profiles based on PCs, lysoPCs, ether lipids and sphingolipids form a new class of biomarkers for alcohol consumption. This may be of great value for the clinical assessment of alcohol use, alcohol-specific disease detection and drug-therapy monitoring. Side effects of alcohol consumption on specific organs as liver could be investigated by future studies using an association study analysing metabolite concentrations in relation to concentrations of liver biomarkers as, for example, γ-glutamyltransferase. The current analysis is based on a targeted metabolomics approach that is limited to a subset of 131 currently known metabolites in human (for example, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism). A study using a broader metabolomics approach that quantifies a bigger number of metabolites would be needed to investigate alcohol effects on other areas of metabolism. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact underlying mechanisms. A prospective study in large sample would help validate the predictive potential of these results.

### White cell count and platelet count associate with histological alcoholic hepatitis in jaundiced harmful drinkers [^3412699e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with suspected alcoholic hepatitis and a Discriminant Function ≥ 32 underwent liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Of these (n = 58), 43 had histological features of alcoholic hepatitis and 15 (25%) did not. We aimed to determine the laboratory features that differentiated those patients with a histological diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis from those without, and assess potential clinical utility.

Methods

Laboratory investigations at presentation for each of the histologically confirmed cases of alcoholic hepatitis (n = 43) were compared to those without (n = 15) to determine whether there were differences between the two groups. Univariate analysis was by Mann Whitney U Test and Multivariate analysis was by a stepwise approach.

Results

White cell count (16.2 ± 10.5 v 6.9 ± 3.5 (×109/L); p = 0.0001) and platelet count (178 ± 81 v 98.4 ± 43 (×109/L); p = 0.0005) were higher in the patients with histological features of alcoholic hepatitis than in those without. The area under the ROC curve for AH diagnosis was estimated to be 0.83 (0.73, 0.94) and 0.81 (0.69, 0.93) for white cell count and platelet count respectively.

Conclusions

Clinicians cannot accurately differentiate patients with or without alcoholic hepatitis without liver biopsy. This is critically important when deciding on specific therapies such as corticosteroids or when interpreting data from future trials in which biopsy is not mandated. In situations where liver biopsy is unsuitable or unavailable the white cell and platelet counts can be used to determine the likelihood of histological alcoholic hepatitis and guide treatment.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in remote environments: 2014 update [^f7e15ae5]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society acute pain — nonopioid analgesia: Combining acetaminophen with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) should be used as the first-line medication treatment of acute pain in the wilderness, unless there is a specific patient allergy or other contraindication (Recommendation grade: 1A). As the basis of medical therapy for acute injury, these medications should be regularly dosed throughout the acute injury period. NSAIDs do have adverse effects, including renal injury (especially in dehydrated patients) and inhibition of platelet function that can increase bleeding; giving NSAIDs with food can alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, and if significant abdominal pain develops, the medication should be stopped. Short-term use for up to 10 days of over-the-counter NSAIDs with standard dosing has been shown to be extremely safe and well tolerated, and an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/d or less or naproxen at 660 mg/d or less has no greater risk than placebo. For acetaminophen, prescription-dose acetaminophen up to 4 g/d in an adult is still appropriate for short-term use; it is considered safe in intoxicated patients, but care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and patients with hepatic dysfunction.

### White cell count and platelet count associate with histological alcoholic hepatitis in jaundiced harmful drinkers [^0ca6f475]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

We wanted to know the frequency with which a patient with a clinical presentation suspicious of alcoholic hepatitis and a DF > 32 had alcoholic hepatitis on liver biopsy. In addition, we wanted to know whether laboratory factors could be used to improve accuracy.

We found that 74% of patients with a high clinical suspicion of alcoholic hepatitis had this confirmed histologically. Had the group not undergone biopsy, 25% (n = 15) of the total number would have undergone specific treatment without having the clinical condition the treatment was specifically targeted to. This supports the conclusions of the EASL guideline for the use of liver biopsy in the setting of alcoholic hepatitis.

When we analysed the laboratory features at presentation we found two interesting findings. The first is that the group with alcoholic hepatitis on liver biopsy had a higher platelet count (178 ± 81 v 98.4 ± 43 (× 10 9 /L); p = 0.0005) than those without alcoholic hepatitis. This is likely to be due to the fact that patients with no AH have more advanced fibrotic liver disease with portal hypertension leading to decompensation. The second was that the group with alcoholic hepatitis on liver biopsy had a higher mean white cell count (16.2 ± 10.5 v 6.9 ± 3.5 (× 10 9 /L); p = 0.0001). Using a cut off value of > 10.75 × 10 9 /L for white cell count and > 147.5 × 10 9 /L for platelet count, accurately diagnoses AH with a combined specificity 100%. A lower boundary of < 5.95 × 10 9 /L and < 86 × 10 9 /L for white cell count and platelet count respectively, accurately rules out AH as a diagnosis with a combined sensitivity of 98%. There are two important clinical ramifications of this finding. The first is that there should be suspicion regarding labelling patients with a normal white cell count as alcoholic hepatitis. The second is that alcoholic hepatitis is an inflammatory condition and a high white cell count is entirely in keeping with this. A raised white cell count should not therefore be used as a reason not to give treatment because of concerns about infection when there are no other features of overt sepsis.

### How I approach bleeding in hospitalized patients [^30313a26]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is common in patients with liver disease, primarily because of splenic sequestration in patients with portal hypertension but also because of reduced thrombopoietin in those with cirrhosis. Thrombocytopenia may be further exacerbated by marrow suppression because of an infection, acute illness, ongoing alcohol use, or nutritional deficiencies such as inadequate folate intake. Although standard transfusion goals, including platelet counts of ≥ 50 × 10 3 /μL in noncentral nervous system bleeds and platelet counts ≥ 100 × 10 3 /μL for central nervous system bleeds are often used, it is unclear whether this is truly necessary because platelet adhesion to the subendothelium appears to be restored in some patients with liver disease. This is believed to be partially due to decreased ADAMTS-13 and increased VWF levels. Thrombin generation appears to be preserved at platelet counts as low as 60 × 10 3 /μL in patients with cirrhosis. In addition to the standard approach of platelet transfusion to a specific goal, which may be difficult to achieve because of splenic sequestration and/or shortages of blood products, thrombopoietin receptor agonists may be used to increase platelet levels before procedures. Because it can take up to 2 weeks to achieve optimal effect, this is not an adequate solution for acute bleeding. Of note, decreased hemoglobin has also been shown to inversely correlate with an increased bleeding time, supporting improved platelet function; although the impact of this on clinical outcomes has not been studied. Nonetheless, appropriately resuscitating with red blood cells is an important component of managing acute bleeding.

### Peri-operative identification and management of patients with unhealthy alcohol intake [^8b0e6c25]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

As for inpatient surgery, consideration should be given to deferring surgery for planned community withdrawal under appropriate supervision for all high‐risk patients. Potential benefits from abstinence for at least 2 weeks include improved platelet function and therefore reduced bleeding risk, while cessation of alcohol intake for 8 weeks or longer may improve wound healing. Patients may refuse to engage with a pre‐operative intervention as well as advice for the postoperative period, such as non‐consumption of alcohol for 24 h. This may affect the patients' appropriateness for day‐case procedures and should carefully be explored, with appropriate risk/benefit discussions and development of an individualised management plan in consultation with the wider team. Patients who present acutely intoxicated on the day of surgery should have surgery postponed with appropriate follow up.

There may be a particular role for regional techniques, including peripheral nerve blockade if feasible and safe, to facilitate same‐day discharge while potentially reducing home analgesic requirements. The use of short‐acting anaesthetic drugs provides an additional margin of safety by minimising the risk of pharmacological interaction with alcohol consumed after surgery. Caution should be exercised when prescribing take‐home postoperative systemic drugs where there is evidence of alcohol‐related liver disease (Table 1).

Table 1
Peri‐operative considerations for systemic analgesia in patients with harmful alcohol intake with or without established alcoholic liver disease. Adapted from.

All patients with harmful alcohol intake should have a clearly documented plan for safe discharge following day surgery. Consideration should be given to social circumstances in high‐risk patients, given the potential for home alcohol withdrawal and the interaction of alcohol consumed at home with peri‐operative medications. Such patients may not be suitable for 'home alone' discharge as described elsewhere and should return home with a responsible adult. Nurse‐led discharge on the day of surgery should otherwise follow explicit criteria according to local protocols, with additional vigilance for signs of withdrawal in the recovery area. Provision of written patient discharge material, with details of surgical procedure, follow‐up planning and key contacts such as community alcohol liaison services as relevant, is critical for ongoing patient safety.

### Peri-operative identification and management of patients with unhealthy alcohol intake [^b25d2fcb]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopaenia may be present secondary to bone marrow suppression, folate deficiency or hypersplenism, possibly reflecting underlying portal hypertension. Leucocytosis may also be present due to hepatitis‐related leukaemoid reaction. As discussed, severity of liver disease may be assessed by the Child‐Turcotte‐Pugh score. Key components of this are serum albumin; serum bilirubin; and prothrombin time. Additionally, elevated (conjugated) bilirubin may suggest active alcoholic steatohepatitis, even in the absence of cirrhosis.

Electrolyte disturbances, particularly hyponatraemia, are common with alcohol excess even in the absence of advanced or cirrhotic liver disease. Hypokalaemia and hypophosphataemia may cause muscle weakness, while hypomagnesaemia may worsen hypokalaemia and may cause seizures. Urea and creatinine can be elevated by pre‐renal causes of acute kidney injury more commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis, while hepatorenal syndrome only occurs in the setting of ascites or significant portal hypertension. Isolated uraemia may be due to active gastrointestinal bleeding.

Biochemical markers for alcohol‐related liver disease have been employed historically to assess liver dysfunction; however, abnormal liver enzymes are poorly predictive of underlying liver disease with only 3.9% of patients with an abnormal value in this domain shown to develop significant liver disease within 5 years of testing. Liver enzyme values should, therefore, be interpreted in the context of wider clinical findings and other test results.

Harmful alcohol intake increases the risk of cardiovascular disease ranging from hypertension and atrial arrhythmias to more serious problems such as cardiomyopathy. The incidence of stroke (haemorrhagic or ischaemic) is also increased. Diagnosis can be aided by using a 12‐lead ECG, while echocardiography can show structural damage to the heart caused by alcohol misuse such as a dilated left ventricle with decreased mass and wall thickness or systolic dysfunction. Echocardiography should be reserved for those patients with recognised criteria such as those displaying signs and symptoms of cardiac failure. In selected cases, cardiopulmonary exercise testing may be of value to identify systolic dysfunction that is masked by the hyperdynamic circulation of liver impairment.

### Naltrexone (Vivitrol) [^1ef154ed]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Common Adverse Reactions

Alcohol Dependence

Table 1 lists all treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions, regardless of causality, occurring in ≥ 5% of patients with alcohol dependence, for which the incidence was greater in the combined VIVITROL group than in the placebo group. A majority of patients treated with VIVITROL in clinical studies had adverse reactions with a maximum intensity of "mild" or "moderate".

Opioid Dependence

In the open-label, long-term safety study conducted in the US, the commonly reported adverse reactions among the opioid-dependent patients in the study were similar to those commonly observed events in the alcohol-dependent populations in VIVITROL clinical trials as displayed in Table 1, above. For example, injection site reactions of all types, nausea and diarrhea occurred in more than 5% of patients on VIVITROL in the open-label study. In contrast, 48% percent, of the opioid-dependent patients had at least one adverse event in the "Infections and Infestations" Body System. Adverse Reactions/Preferred Terms of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and sinusitis were most commonly reported.

In the placebo-controlled study in opioid-dependent patients conducted in Russia, the overall frequency of adverse events was lower than in the U.S. population described above. Table 2 lists treatment-emergent clinical adverse events, regardless of causality, occurring in ≥ 2% of patients with opioid dependence, for which the incidence was greater in the VIVITROL group than in the placebo group. All adverse events were assessed as having a maximum intensity of "mild" or "moderate".

Eosinophil Count

In clinical trials, subjects on VIVITROL had increases in eosinophil counts relative to subjects on placebo. With continued use of VIVITROL, eosinophil counts returned to normal over a period of several months.

Platelet Count

VIVITROL 380 mg was associated with a decrease in platelet count. In clinical trials, alcohol-dependent patients treated with VIVITROL experienced a mean maximal decrease in platelet count of 17.8 × 103/μL, compared to 2.6 × 103/μL in placebo patients.

After 24 weeks of treatment, opioid-dependent patients treated with VIVITROL experienced a mean maximal decrease in platelet count of 62.8 × 103/μL, compared to 39.9 × 103/μL in placebo patients. In randomized controlled trials, VIVITROL was not associated with an increase in bleeding-related adverse events.

### Clinical predictors for delirium tremens in patients with alcohol withdrawal seizures [^cce9b274]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium tremens (DT) is the severest form of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, frequently after alcohol withdrawal seizures. Delirium tremens occurs in a small proportion of patients with alcohol withdrawal seizures; nevertheless, early identification of high-risk patients is important for intensive preventive management of unexpected episodes due to agitation and its associated increased mortality. However, there are limited studies on clinical predictors of the development of DT in patients with alcohol withdrawal seizures.

Methods

Patients who visited the emergency department with acute seizures were included in the study when alcohol withdrawal was the only or the strongest precipitating factor for seizures. All patients were carefully observed for at least 48 hours in the intensive care unit after the initial assessment to closely monitor vital signs and development of DT. Clinical and laboratory findings were analyzed for predicting the development of DT.

Results

Of the 97 patients (82 males; mean age, 48.6 ± 13.3 years) with alcohol withdrawal seizures, 34 (35.1%) developed DT. Low platelet count, high blood level of homocysteine, and low blood level of pyridoxine were associated with the subsequent development of DT. Low platelet count and high blood level of homocysteine were independent risk factors with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the development of DT.

Conclusions

The study indicated that some easily determined parameters are potential clinical predictors for the development of DT in patients with alcohol withdrawal seizures. These findings would be helpful in clinical identification and management patients at high risk for DT.

### Use of biomarkers for alcohol use disorders in clinical practice [^8da1aaca]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Biomedical markers may provide additive objective information in screening and confirmation of acute or recent consumption, intoxication, relapse, heavy drinking, hazardous/harmful use/abuse and dependence and alcohol use related organ dysfunction (alcohol use-related disorders: AUDs).

Aims

To review the use of biomarkers in clinical practice to detect AUDs.

Findings

About one-fifth of the patients seen in clinical practice have AUDs, which offer a variety of treatment options if diagnosed. The diagnosis of AUDs relies on clinical and alcohol-related history, physical examination, questionnaires and laboratory values. No clinical available laboratory test [e.g. for acute abuse: alcohol in blood or breath; for chronic alcohol abuse: gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT)] is reliable enough on its own to support a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, harmful use or abuse. Sensitivities, specificities and the predictive values may vary considerably according to patient and control group characteristics (e.g. gender, age or related comorbidity). In patient groups with limited cooperation markers may be helpful when considering treatment options.

Conclusions

More research is needed to determine the value of markers (single or combined, with questionnaires) in the context of clinical decision-making algorithms in defined settings and with defined dichotomous outcome variables.

Thrombocytopenia, usually defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000/μL, is a common reason for a hematology consult in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. In most patients, the cause of the thrombocytopenia can be identified and treated. This article reviews the clinical approach to the patient with thrombocytopenia, the mechanisms that underlie it, and the laboratory tests available to investigate it. A practical approach to the investigation and management of thrombocytopenia in the clinical settings commonly encountered by the hematology consultant is then described.

### Alcohol-induced severe acute pancreatitis followed by hemolytic uremic syndrome managed with continuous renal replacement therapy [^e833fcb6]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A previously healthy 38-year-old female, non-smoker and non-alcoholic, was hospitalized following acute alcohol intoxication. She had drunk more than 500 mL of alcohol in about 2 hours and subsequently lost consciousness. Prior to losing consciousness she complained of severe epigastric pain and frequent vomiting. On admission, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC) count, electrolytes, and liver function tests were within normal ranges. Serum amylase was 1728 IU/L (normal, < 100 IU/L). Ultrasound revealed the body and tail of the pancreas to be edematous, the biliary tree was not dilated, and there was sludge in the gallbladder. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed an edematous pancreas with necrotic tissue in the left parieto-colic area. The diagnosis was alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis.

During the next 2 days her renal function progressively deteriorated, and her urine output decreased to < 400 mL per 24 hours. On the third day of admission her urea and creatinine were 12.8 mmol/L (normal range: 4.5–6.7 mmol/L) and 420 μmol/L (normal range: 50–110 μmol/L), respectively. Her hemoglobin level had dropped from 14.9 g/dL to 8.8 g/dL, with a reticulocyte count of 75,000/mm 3 (normal range: 25,000–120,000/mm 3), her platelet count was 32 × 10 9 /L (normal range: 100–300 × 10 9 /L), and haptoglobin was 0.05 g/L (normal range: 0.2–2.4 g/L). Peripheral blood smear revealed schistocytes, and the Coombs' test was negative. The level of fibrin degradation products was normal, and her prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR) was 1.5–2.5. Early in the disease course plasma LDH is elevated in patient (856U/L, compared to normal LDH level: 35-123U/L), and LDH levels gradually decline with CRRT treatment and mitigation of pancreatitis. Her clinical symptoms of acute kidney injury and her treatment reaction were not consistent with a diagnosis of DIC. Renal biopsy was not performed because the patient refused invasive examinations. A diagnosis of HUS was made, and she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).

### Vancomycin-induced thrombocytopaenia in a patient with severe pancreatitis [^239722f5]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia is a rare side effect of a commonly used drug that may cause life-threatening disease. A 51-year-old man was treated for an episode of acute severe alcohol-induced pancreatitis complicated by development of a peripancreatic fluid collection. He developed fever of unknown origin and was treated with intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin with tazobactam. On day 6 of vancomycin therapy his platelet count dropped to 46×10(9)/L (237×10(9)/L on day 1 of treatment) and by day 8 of therapy platelets had fallen to a nadir of 9×10(9)/L. The patient at this stage displayed a florid purpuric rash and haematoma formation on attempted intravenous cannulation. A clinical diagnosis of vancomycin-induced thrombocytopaenia was made and the drug withdrawn. After 3 days a significant improvement in the platelet count was noted, rising to 56 × 10(9)/L. Immunofluorescence testing (PIFT) ruled out teicoplanin and heparin as causes of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.

### Assessing the impact of alcohol consumption on the genetic contribution to mean corpuscular volume [^77a904ae]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol misuse and abuse is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. In 2016, global statistics suggested that 5.1% (~3 million) of deaths and 5.3% (~133 million) of disability-adjusted life years were caused by the harmful use of alcohol. Early identification of individuals who are misusing alcohol is critical for interventions to stop progression towards alcohol dependence and alcohol-related end-organ damage. Unfortunately, a history from a patient is not always reliable, and laboratory tests vary in their diagnostic accuracy, availability and usage. In clinical practice, therefore, it is usual to use a combination of history (including alcohol intake and symptoms consistent with organ damage), physical examination (to look for features of organ damage) and laboratory markers that support alcohol misuse as the underlying aetiology. The most widely used laboratory tests are (a) liver function tests (in particular, gamma-glutamyl transferase), which indicates liver damage, and (b) the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), a measure of the mean size and volume of erythrocytes, which is a non-specific marker of alcohol misuse.

### Alcohol consumption, drinking patterns, and ischemic heart disease: a narrative review of meta-analyses and a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of heavy drinking occasions on risk for moderate drinkers [^9b25dd52]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of death and disease burden in the US, Europe, and globally, and alcohol consumption is one of the leading risk factors for mortality and morbidity. There are well-established risks from neuro-toxic, hepato-toxic, and carcinogenic effects caused by alcohol consumption (for example, the risk for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, injuries, and liver cirrhosis). However, there has been much debate about a beneficial effect of alcohol consumption on IHD. High prevalence of both exposure and disease make this question a frequent topic among general practitioners, researchers, media, and the public. Aside from numerous individual studies, several meta-analyses published in the last decade have summarized the association between alcohol consumption and IHD risk.

Most meta-analyses of epidemiological data have shown a mix between a beneficial and detrimental association from alcohol consumption on IHD that depends on the level of average consumption. This relationship is most often described as curvilinear, or 'J-shaped', but also sometimes as a flattened-out inverse association. The specific shape of the risk curve seems to depend at least on sex and IHD outcome (mortality versus morbidity). Findings of a beneficial effect are supported by a substantial number of short-term experimental studies on the effect of alcohol consumption on several surrogate biomarkers for IHD in a dose-dependent relationship, including improved lipid profiles, inhibition of platelet activation, reduction of fibrinogen levels, and anti-inflammatory effects. In particular, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels have a clear dose-response relationship with alcohol consumption, with the highest levels observed in people with the highest alcohol consumption. Many criticisms have arisen over the last three decades questioning the relationship found in epidemiological studies because of limited quality of alcohol assessment, the influence of drinking pattern, adjustment for confounding, or the inability for observational studies to determine causality. Although criteria for a causal relationship seem to be fulfilled (see also), a direct link for alcohol consumption on IHD risk from long-term randomized trials is currently, and for the foreseeable future, missing. Thus, epidemiological studies, as is the case for many other IHD risk factors, play an important role in assessing the role of alcohol consumption on disease risk. The objective of this review is to examine the evidence available to define the relationship between alcohol consumption and IHD based mainly on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, with a focus on the reference group (that is, the use of lifetime abstainers and not current abstainers as the reference group because of the 'sick-quitter' effect); the influence of drinking pattern (in particular episodic heavy drinking among on average moderate drinkers); and the influence of several other important risk factors for IHD, such as age, smoking status, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI), all of which might confound risk estimates for alcohol.

### Utility of platelet count for predicting cirrhosis in alcoholic liver disease: model for identifying cirrhosis in a US population [^8ea8eaa9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombocytopenia has been shown to be the single most useful laboratory investigation for identifying subclinical cirrhosis of varying etiologies. However, alcohol per se can result in thrombocytopenia, and hence it is unclear whether platelet count can identify cirrhosis in patients who are alcoholic.

Objectives

To characterize the utility of clinical predictors, especially platelet count, for identifying the presence of cirrhosis in alcoholics. To develop a simple, objective model for identifying cirrhosis in alcoholics.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Participants

A total of 2,471 consecutive hospitalized patients with abnormal liver enzyme levels were screened, from which 272 patients with a history of recent and ongoing alcohol intake, negative diagnostic studies for alternative etiologies of chronic liver disease, and recent liver imaging with ultrasound or CT scan were included.

Main Measures

Results of liver imaging and admission laboratory studies including liver enzymes, coagulation studies, and blood counts.

Key Results

One hundred twenty-nine patients (47%) had cirrhosis based on imaging; 143 patients (53%) had no cirrhosis. A pre-sobriety platelet count (during ongoing alcohol intake) of less than 70*10(3) cells/mm(3) was effective for ruling in cirrhosis (positive likelihood ratio [LR] 6.8, 95% CI: 3.4, 14); platelet count greater than 200*10(3) was useful for ruling out cirrhosis in alcoholics (negative LR 0.18, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.35). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified international normalized ratio (INR) (p < 0.01) and pre-sobriety platelet count (p < 0.01) as independent predictors of cirrhosis. A Model for identifying Cirrhosis in Alcoholic Liver Disease (MCALD) was developed using the INR and pre-sobriety platelet count; it had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit chi(2) (p value) of 8.9 (0.35) for predicting cirrhosis in alcoholics. A MCALD score > 5.5 corresponded to an increased likelihood of cirrhosis (LR: 6.5, 95% CI: 4.3, 11.0) and a MCALD score < 5.5 corresponded to decreased likelihood of cirrhosis in alcoholics (LR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.36). Sobriety platelet count (after alcohol abstinence) at a cutoff of 160*10(3) had positive LR of 7.9 (95% CI: 4.4, 14) and negative LR of 0.42 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.52) for predicting cirrhosis in alcoholics.

Conclusions

A simple model of platelet count and INR has good diagnostic accuracy for identifying cirrhosis in alcoholics.

### White cell count and platelet count associate with histological alcoholic hepatitis in jaundiced harmful drinkers [^6bde4c5d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients with suspected alcoholic hepatitis and a DF ≥ 32 underwent liver biopsy to "confirm" alcoholic hepatitis. Most of these patients underwent biopsy prior to entry into a randomized controlled trial of antioxidants versus placebo in alcoholic hepatitis, which was carried out in the Freeman Hospital Liver Unit in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. The inclusion criteria were a recent history of alcohol excess, jaundice and a discriminant function ≥ 32. Exclusion criteria were active infection, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, upper GI bleed and previous cardiac or respiratory disease. All patients that fulfilled the criteria were biopsied to confirm or refute the clinical suspicion of alcoholic hepatitis. Some patients were subsequently excluded because they had no histological features of alcoholic hepatitis. To increase patient numbers we have included patients subsequently admitted to our unit who were biopsied to investigate presumed alcoholic hepatitis and were found not to have the relevant histological features, using the same criteria.

Laboratory data (full blood count, serum bilirubin, liver enzymes, prothrombin time (PT), creatinine and albumin) from the time of admission were collected. From these data, the Child-Pugh Score and Discriminant Function were derived. Liver biopsies were reviewed, classified and staged by an expert pathologist (ADB) according to criteria published previously.

Descriptive statistics are provided as the mean (± SD), median and range or percentage for quantitative and qualitative variables, respectively. Comparisons between groups were performed with the Mann–Whitney U test. For multivariate analysis a stepwise approach was used. Fisher's exact test was used to test the association of histological stage with presence of histological AH. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the utility of White Cell Count and Platelet Count in the diagnosis of AH. IBM SPSS 17 was used to perform all analyses.

Patients gave written informed consent for entry into the trial. Ethics for the original antioxidant trial was granted by Newcastle and North Tyneside Local Ethics Committee; research was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.

### Low alcohol consumption influences outcomes in individuals with alcohol-related compensated cirrhosis in a French multicenter cohort [^21953d19]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

The harmful impact of heavy alcohol consumption and recurrence in patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis is long-established, although this is based on old studies. However, the drivers of long-term outcome still need to be clearly investigated.

Method

All patients with biopsy-proven compensated alcohol-related cirrhosis included in the CIRRAL cohort (22 centers) were prospectively studied. Prognostic variables of survival and liver event-free survival were assessed using multivariable Cox models with stepwise selection. The prognostic impact of alcohol recurrence during follow-up (computed in glass-years in the same way as pack-years for tobacco) was assessed using a time-dependent covariable.

Results

From 2010 to 2016, 650 patients were included. The median age at baseline was 58.4 years, 67.4% were men and the median BMI was 27.8 kg/m 2, 63.8% had a history of liver decompensation, and 70.2% had discontinued alcohol. At 5 years, recurrence occurred in 30.9% of abstinent patients and this risk was higher in patients with a history of drug abuse and in those with shorter alcohol discontinuation times. Median survival was 97 months. Age, alcohol consumption at baseline, platelet count and Child-Pugh score > 5 were associated with overall and liver event-free survival on multivariate analysis. Alcohol consumption of more than 25 glass-years during follow-up was independently associated with lower survival and with a trend toward lower liver event-free survival, with the risk increasing from 1 glass-year, though not significantly. Simon & Makuch plots confirm the benefit of no alcohol consumption (< 1 glass/week) on both outcomes and the dose-dependent impact of alcohol over time.

Conclusion

This prospective study in patients with compensated alcohol-related cirrhosis identifies factors predictive of alcohol recurrence during follow-up and shows that moderate alcohol consumption during follow-up negatively impacts outcomes. Patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis should be advised to completely stop drinking alcohol.

Registration

CIRRAL (NCT01213927) cohort was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov and the full protocol is available at the following link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01213927.

Impact and Implications

In patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis, data are lacking about the impact of the amount of alcohol consumed on both survival and liver-related events. The present study based on the CIRRAL cohort demonstrates that alcohol recurrence occurs in more than 30% of patients with compensated cirrhosis and that even a moderate recurrence strongly influences outcomes. Patients with compensated alcohol-related cirrhosis should be advised to completely discontinue alcohol consumption, even in small amounts, as the present study shows that no alcohol consumption can be regarded as safe when cirrhosis has developed.

### Alcohol consumption, drinking patterns, and ischemic heart disease: a narrative review of meta-analyses and a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of heavy drinking occasions on risk for moderate drinkers [^80a9c012]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Experimental evidence

Long-term randomized studies on alcohol exposure and IHD mortality or morbidity in the general population are unavailable. Regular alcohol intake has been found to have beneficial, dose-dependent effects on surrogate biomarkers for IHD risk in short-term experimental studies, mainly by increasing HDL cholesterol levels, inhibiting platelet activation, reducing fibrinogen levels, and producing anti-inflammatory effects. The increase in HDL cholesterol was also evident in experimental studies with regular heavy drinking (≥ 60 g/day every day), and the highest levels of HDL cholesterol are found in people with AUD. Despite elevated levels of HDL cholesterol even in regular heavy alcohol consumers, an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and other detrimental effects of episodic and chronic heavy alcohol consumption on heart disease risk seem to negate those beneficial effects, resulting in an overall neutral or detrimental association. The detrimental effect on blood pressure and arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation, in particular from episodic and chronic heavy drinking, might play a role here, in combination with anti-atherosclerotic and anti-thrombotic processes. Although systematic experimental evidence for the effect of episodic heavy drinking is limited, the biochemical effects might involve HDL and LDL cholesterol levels, arrhythmias, and thrombosis. It seems that episodic heavy drinking increases LDL cholesterol levels without a favorable effect on HDL, and possibly a transient detrimental effect on thrombosis, hypertension, and arrhythmias. Prolonged chronic heavy drinking can result in the most extreme form of cardiac tissue damage, cardiomyopathy.

### Heavy alcohol intake and intracerebral hemorrhage: characteristics and effect on outcome [^9f1d00a9]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify associated factors and influence on long-term outcome of heavy alcohol intake in a large prospective cohort of consecutive patients with a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).

Methods

Between November 2004 and March 2009, we prospectively recruited 562 consecutive adults with a spontaneous ICH. We excluded patients without information on drinking habit (n = 22). Heavy alcohol intake was defined as a regular consumption of more than 300 g alcohol/week. We performed bivariate and multivariate analyses (logistic regression) based on demographic and radiologic models. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier statistics.

Results

Among 540 patients with ICH, 137 (25) were heavy alcohol drinkers (median age 60 vs 74 years in nonabusers; p < 0.0001). In the multivariate demographic model, heavy alcohol drinkers were less likely to be older (odds ratio [OR] 0.97 per 1-year increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95–0.98) and to have a history of ischemic heart disease (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15–0.77) and more likely to be smokers (OR 3.96, 95% CI 2.43–6.46). In the radiologic model, independent factors were nonlobar location of ICH (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.05–2.77) and less severe leukoaraiosis (OR 0.76 per 1-step increase, 95%CI 0.62–0.73). Platelet counts and prothrombin ratio were significantly lower among heavy alcohol drinkers (respectively, p = 0.01 and p = 0.017). Heavy alcohol intake was predictive of 2 years mortality only among patients younger than 60 years with nonlobar ICH (hazard ratio 1.96, 95% CI 1.06–3.63).

Conclusion

Heavy alcohol intake is associated with the occurrence of ICH at a young age. However, the underlying vasculopathy remains unexplored in these patients. Indirect markers suggest small-vessel disease at an early stage that might be enhanced by moderate hemostatic disorders.

### Reduced alcohol consumption and major adverse cardiovascular events among individuals with previously high alcohol consumption [^b1d634da]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The potential neuroprotection of mild to moderate alcohol consumption has been reported based on a U-shaped or curvilinear dose-response relationship for the incidence or mortality of stroke. However, no studies have addressed the implications of alcohol-related behavioral changes in heavy drinking across different stroke subtypes. In the present study, we conducted a dedicated analysis to explore the differential benefits of less alcohol intake by individual stroke subtypes. Reduced alcohol consumption in individuals who drank heavily resulted in a 34% decrease in risk of ischemic stroke (PSM HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51–0.86); however, this preventive association did not correspond to hemorrhagic stroke. Theoretically, this discrepancy may be attributed to the altered platelet function and coagulation factors following moderate alcohol consumption that leads to higher susceptibility to hemorrhagic stroke. The findings from the present study are congruous with those of previous studies that reported on the differential association between alcohol consumption and distinct stroke types. Additionally, a previous study demonstrated that reduced drinking was associated with lower risk of AF. Taken together, these findings suggest a potential to reduce ischemic events but a neutral or inverse association with hemorrhagic events. Another important aspect to consider is that ischemic stroke is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disease. Given its intricate pathophysiological processes, a substantial knowledge gap persists concerning the divergent implications of mild to moderate alcohol consumption according to different subtypes of ischemic stroke. Future studies should clarify these issues to enhance the understanding of the cerebrovascular implications of alcohol-reduction interventions.

WARNING: THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND GLOMERULONEPHRITIS

Thrombocytopenia

TEGSEDI causes reductions in platelet count that may result in sudden and unpredictable thrombocytopenia, which can be life-threatening. One clinical trial patient died from intracranial hemorrhage.

TEGSEDI is contraindicated in patients with a platelet count below 100 x 109/L [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Prior to starting TEGSEDI, obtain a platelet count [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. During treatment, monitor platelet counts weekly if values are 75 x 109/L or greater, and more frequently if values are less than 75 x 109/L [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If a patient develops signs or symptoms of thrombocytopenia, obtain a platelet count as soon as possible. The patient should not receive additional TEGSEDI unless a platelet count is determined to be interpretable and acceptable by a medical professional [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Following discontinuation of treatment for any reason, continue to monitor platelet count for 8 weeks, or longer if platelet counts are less than 100 x 109/L, to verify that platelet counts remain above 75 x 109/L [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Blood testing — basics and use in addiction treatment are summarized: Blood is mainly composed of plasma, serum, white blood cells and red blood cells, and blood testing allows precise measurement of drug concentration levels that can be used to interpret dose or timing, which can be very useful in emergency situations. The relevance of blood testing is limited mostly to emergency situations where there is a need to assess impairment and degree of intoxication, and it is primarily used to assess alcohol use, with drawbacks including the need for staff trained in phlebotomy, the invasiveness of drawing blood, and that collected samples are hazardous to handle.

### Thrombocytopenia and liver disease: pathophysiology and periprocedural management [^bde9eefb]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

Abnormal bleeding in patients with liver disease may result from elevated portal pressure and varix formation, reduced hepatic synthesis of coagulation proteins, qualitative platelet dysfunction, and/or thrombocytopenia. Major mechanisms of thrombocytopenia in liver disease include splenic sequestration and impaired platelet production due to reduced thrombopoietin production. Alcohol and certain viruses may induce marrow suppression. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) may co-occur in patients with liver disease, particularly those with autoimmune liver disease or chronic hepatitis C. Drugs used for the treatment of liver disease or its complications, such as interferon, immunosuppressants, and antibiotics, may cause thrombocytopenia. Periprocedural management of thrombocytopenia of liver disease depends on both individual patient characteristics and the bleeding risk of the procedure. Patients with a platelet count higher than or equal to 50 000/µL and those requiring low-risk procedures rarely require platelet-directed therapy. For those with a platelet count below 50 000/µL who require a high-risk procedure, platelet-directed therapy should be considered, especially if the patient has other risk factors for bleeding, such as abnormal bleeding with past hemostatic challenges. We often target a platelet count higher than or equal to 50 000/µL in such patients. If the procedure is elective, we prefer treatment with a thrombopoietin receptor agonist; if it is urgent, we use platelet transfusion. In high-risk patients who have an inadequate response to or are otherwise unable to receive these therapies, other strategies may be considered, such as a trial of empiric ITP therapy, spleen-directed therapy, or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement.

Clinical Question

Are pathogen-reduced platelets as effective as standard platelets for the prevention of bleeding in people of any age requiring platelet transfusions?

Bottom Line

In people with cancer who have a low platelet count due to their disease or its treatment, pathogen-reduced platelet transfusions increase risk of platelet refractoriness and platelet transfusion requirement (high-quality evidence) but probably do not effect all-cause mortality, risk of clinically significant or severe bleeding, or risk of a serious adverse event (moderate-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence for people with other diagnoses.

### HS-CRP modifies the prognostic value of platelet count for clinical outcomes after ischemic stroke [^7b782544]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Baseline Characteristics

The baseline characteristics of the patients included in this study were essentially balanced with those excluded from CATIS population (Table S1). A total of 3267 individuals (2093 men and 1174 women) with an average age of 62.4 years were included. Among the patients with high HS‐CRP levels, those with higher platelet counts tended to be women, had a lower rate of alcohol drinking and smoking, had a higher prevalence of diabetes, and had higher low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and blood glucose levels and white blood cell counts. Among the patients with low HS‐CRP levels, those with higher platelet counts were more likely to be younger and women and have lower systolic BP levels, lower rates of alcohol drinking and diabetes, higher white blood cell counts and triglycerides, total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and a longer time from onset to randomization (Table 1).

Investigations

Blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 5190/μL without abnormal fractionation. His haemoglobin (Hb) was 7.8 g/dL (normal range 13.5–17.6 g/dL), mean corpuscular volume was 107.4 fl (normal range 83–93 fl), reflecting macrocytic anaemia. Platelet count was 11.7×10 4 /μL (normal range 13.1×10 4–36.2×10 4 /μL), reflecting mild thrombocytopaenia. Aspartate aminotransferase was 477 IU/L (normal range 7–97 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase was 155 IU/L (normal range 6–43 IU/L), blood urea nitrogen was 26.7 mg/dL (normal range 10–20 mg/dL), creatinine 2.41 mg/dL (normal range 0.6–1.0 mg/dL), that is, liver and kidney dysfunction were also observed. Blood glucose level was normal (137 mg/dL). Ammonia level increased up to 166 μg/dL (normal range 30–80 μg/dL). His serum ferritin also significantly increased up to 9506 ng/mL (normal range 39.4–340 ng/mL). C-reactive protein was 5.89 mg/dL (normal range 0.0–0.3 mg/dL). However, urinary white blood cells and bacterial urine were negative, thus excluding pyelonephritis. In addition, ascites had no bacteria, while white blood cell count in ascites was 32/μL, thus also excluding spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The following data are reference values because these blood tests were investigated after vitamin ingestion at the emergency department; serum vitamin B1 91 ng/mL (normal range 24–66 ng/mL) and serum vitamin B12 > 1500 pg/mL (normal range 180–914 pg/mL). Prothrombin time (PT) was 16.5 s (normal range 11–14 s), PT% was 51.9% (normal range 80–120%). Head CT revealed no abnormality, however, abdominal CT showed an advanced fatty liver and a massive amount of ascites.

Since he ramped and was uncooperative with our investigation, it was impossible to conduct a detail examination such as with upper gastrointestinal endoscope to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding. MRI of the spine and brain to confirm the cause of being unable to walk was also not possible.

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^6950a17d]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

Four RCTs (n = 1132) testing low-dose platelets (defined as approximately one half of the standard dose of 3 to 4 × 10^11 platelets) showed no difference in hemostasis (OR, 0.91 [CI, 0.70 to 1.19]), and in 2 RCTs high-dose platelets (approximately double the standard dose) did not reduce bleeding versus standard-dose (OR, 1.05 [CI, 0.79 to 1.40]).

### Acute ethanol intoxication and the trauma patient: hemodynamic pitfalls [^869068cc]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Many trauma patients are acutely intoxicated with alcohol. Animal studies have demonstrated that acute alcohol intoxication inhibits the normal release of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin in response to acute hemorrhage. Ethanol also increases nitric oxide release and inhibits antidiuretic hormone secretion. This article studies the effects of alcohol intoxication (measured by blood alcohol level, BAL) on the presentation and resuscitation of trauma patients with blunt hepatic injuries. A retrospective registry and chart review was conducted of all patients who presented with blunt liver injuries at an ACS-verified, level I trauma center. Data collected included admission BAL, systolic blood pressure, hematocrit, International Normalized Ratio (INR), liver injury grade, Injury Severity Score (ISS), intravenous fluid and blood product requirements, base deficit, and mortality. From September 2002 to May 2008, 723 patients were admitted with blunt hepatic injuries. Admission BAL was obtained in 569 patients, with 149 having levels > 0.08%. Intoxicated patients were more likely to be hypotensive on admission (p = 0.01) despite a lower liver injury grade and no significant difference in ISS. There was no significant difference in the percent of intoxicated patients requiring blood transfusion. However, when blood was given, intoxicated patients required significantly more units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) than their nonintoxicated counterparts (p = 0.01). Intoxicated patients also required more intravenous fluid during their resuscitation (p = 0.002). Alcohol intoxication may impair the ability of blunt trauma patients to compensate for acute blood loss, making them more likely to be hypotensive on admission and increasing their PRBC and intravenous fluid requirements. All trauma patients should have BAL drawn upon admission and their resuscitation should be performed with an understanding of the physiologic alterations associated with acute alcohol intoxication.

### Ethanol intoxication is associated with a lower incidence of admission coagulopathy in severe traumatic brain injury patients [^fa76dbc5]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of ethanol (ETOH) on the incidence of severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI)-associated coagulopathy and to examine the effect of ETOH on in-hospital outcomes in patients sustaining sTBI. Patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit from June 2005 through December 2008 following sTBI, defined as a head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score ≥ 3, were retrospectively identified. Patients with a chest, abdomen, or extremity AIS score > 3 were excluded to minimize the impact of extracranial injuries. Criteria for sTBI-associated coagulopathy included thrombocytopenia and/or elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR) and/or prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). The incidence of admission coagulopathy, in-hospital complications, and mortality were compared between patients who were ETOH positive [ETOH (+)] and ETOH negative [ETOH (-)]. During the study period, there were 439 patients with ETOH levels available for analysis. Overall, 46.5% (n = 204) of these patients were ETOH (+), while 53.5% (n = 235) were ETOH (-). Coagulopathy was significantly less frequent in the ETOH (+) patients compared to their ETOH (-) counterparts (5.4% versus 15.3%; adjusted p < 0.001). In the forward logistic regression analysis, a positive ETOH level proved to be an independent protective factor for admission coagulopathy [OR (95% CI) = 0.24 (0.10,0.54; p = 0.001]. ETOH (+) patients had a significantly lower in-hospital mortality rate than ETOH (-) patients [9.8% versus 16.6%; adjusted p = 0.011; adjusted OR (95% CI) = 0.39 (0.19,0.81)]. For brain-injured patients arriving alive to the hospital, ETOH intoxication is associated with a significantly lower incidence of early coagulopathy and in-hospital mortality. Further research to establish the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying any potential beneficial effect of ETOH on the coagulation system following sTBI is warranted.

Treatment

The prognosis in cases of severe poisoning is critically dependent upon prompt elimination of the drug, which may be achieved by inducing vomiting, irrigating the stomach, and by taking appropriate steps to diminish absorption. If these measures cannot be implemented without risk on the spot, the patient should be transferred at once to a hospital, while ensuring that vital functions are safeguarded. There is no specific antidote.

Elimination of the Drug: Induction of vomiting.

Gastric lavage. Even when more than 4 hours have elapsed following ingestion of the drug, the stomach should be repeatedly irrigated, especially if the patient has also consumed alcohol.

Measures to Reduce Absorption: Activated charcoal, laxatives.

Measures to Accelerate Elimination: Forced diuresis.

Dialysis is indicated only in severe poisoning associated with renal failure. Replacement transfusion is indicated in severe poisoning in small children.

Respiratory Depression: Keep the airways free; resort, if necessary, to endotracheal intubation, artificial respiration, and administration of oxygen.

Hypotension, Shock: Keep the patient's legs raised and administer a plasma expander. If blood pressure fails to rise despite measures taken to increase plasma volume, use of vasoactive substances should be considered.

Convulsions: Diazepam or barbiturates.

Warning: Diazepam or barbiturates may aggravate respiratory depression (especially in children), hypotension, and coma. However, barbiturates should not be used if drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase have also been taken by the patient either in overdosage or in recent therapy (within 1 week).

Surveillance: Respiration, cardiac function (ECG monitoring), blood pressure, body temperature, pupillary reflexes, and kidney and bladder function should be monitored for several days.

Treatment of Blood Count Abnormalities: If evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops, the following recommendations are suggested: (1) stop the drug, (2) perform daily CBC, platelet, and reticulocyte counts, (3) do a bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy immediately and repeat with sufficient frequency to monitor recovery.

Special periodic studies might be helpful as follows: (1) white cell and platelet antibodies, (2) 59Fe-ferrokinetic studies, (3) peripheral blood cell typing, (4) cytogenetic studies on marrow and peripheral blood, (5) bone marrow culture studies for colony-forming units, (6) hemoglobin electrophoresis for A2 and F hemoglobin, and (7) serum folic acid and B12 levels.

A fully developed aplastic anemia will require appropriate, intensive monitoring and therapy, for which specialized consultation should be sought.

If these measures cannot be implemented without risk on the spot, the patient should be transferred at once to a hospital, while ensuring that vital functions are safeguarded. There is no specific antidote.

Elimination of the Drug: Induction of vomiting.

Gastric lavage. Even when more than 4 hours have elapsed following ingestion of the drug, the stomach should be repeatedly irrigated, especially if the patient has also consumed alcohol.

Measures to Reduce Absorption: Activated charcoal, laxatives.

Measures to Accelerate Elimination: Forced diuresis.

Dialysis is indicated only in severe poisoning associated with renal failure. Replacement transfusion is indicated in severe poisoning in small children.

Respiratory Depression: Keep the airways free; resort, if necessary, to endotracheal intubation, artificial respiration, and administration of oxygen.

Hypotension, Shock: Keep the patient's legs raised and administer a plasma expander. If blood pressure fails to rise despite measures taken to increase plasma volume, use of vasoactive substances should be considered.

Convulsions: Diazepam or barbiturates.

Warning: Diazepam or barbiturates may aggravate respiratory depression (especially in children), hypotension, and coma. However, barbiturates should not be used if drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase have also been taken by the patient either in overdosage or in recent therapy (within 1 week).

Surveillance: Respiration, cardiac function (ECG monitoring), blood pressure, body temperature, pupillary reflexes, and kidney and bladder function should be monitored for several days.

Treatment of Blood Count Abnormalities: If evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops, the following recommendations are suggested: (1) stop the drug, (2) perform daily CBC, platelet, and reticulocyte counts, (3) do a bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy immediately and repeat with sufficient frequency to monitor recovery.

Special periodic studies might be helpful as follows: (1) white cell and platelet antibodies, (2)59Fe-ferrokinetic studies, (3) peripheral blood cell typing, (4) cytogenetic studies on marrow and peripheral blood, (5) bone marrow culture studies for colony-forming units, (6) hemoglobin electrophoresis for A2and F hemoglobin, and (7) serum folic acid and B12levels.

A fully developed aplastic anemia will require appropriate, intensive monitoring and therapy, for which specialized consultation should be sought.

### A notable proportion of liver transplant candidates with alcohol-related cirrhosis can be delisted because of clinical improvement [^9af05971]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

To what extent patients with alcohol-related decompensated cirrhosis can improve until recovery from decompensation remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the probability of recovery and delisting due to improvement in patients with alcohol-related decompensated cirrhosis on the waiting list (WL) for liver transplantation (LT).

Methods

We conducted a registry-based, multicenter, retrospective study including all patients admitted to the LT WL in Catalonia (Spain) with the indication of alcohol-, HCV-, cholestasis- or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-related decompensated cirrhosis between January 2007 and December 2018. Competing-risk analysis was used to investigate variables associated with delisting due to improvement in patients with alcohol-related decompensated cirrhosis. Criteria for delisting after improvement were not predefined. Outcomes of patients after delisting were also studied.

Results

One-thousand and one patients were included, 420 (37%) with alcohol-related decompensated cirrhosis. Thirty-six (8.6%) patients with alcohol-related decompensated cirrhosis were delisted after improvement at a median time of 29 months after WL admission. Lower model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, higher platelets and either female sex or lower height were independently associated with delisting due to improvement, while time of abstinence did not reach statistical significance in multivariate analysis (p = 0.055). Five years after delisting, the cumulative probability of remaining free from liver-related death or LT was 76%, similar to patients with HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis delisted after improvement.

Conclusions

A significant proportion of LT candidates with alcohol-related cirrhosis can be delisted due to improvement, which is predicted by low MELD score and higher platelet count at WL admission. Women also have a higher probability of being delisted after improvement, partially due to reduced early access to LT for height discrepancies. Early identification of patients with potential for improvement may avoid unnecessary transplants.

Lay Summary

Patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis can improve until being delisted in approximately 9% of cases. Low model for end-stage liver disease score and high platelet levels at admission predict delisting after improvement, and women have higher probabilities of being delisted due to improvement. Long-term outcomes after delisting are generally favorable.

### A population-based study of an Italian genetic isolate reveals that mean platelet volume is not a risk factor for thrombosis [^b09cb46d]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Several studies revealed that mean platelet volume (MPV) was larger in the acute phase of arterial and venous thrombosis and predicted a poor clinical outcome. It has been suggested that MPV is a risk factor for thrombosis. However, it is unclear whether increased platelet size is a cause or a consequence of thrombosis. It was the objective of this study to verify whether MPV is a risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis.

Methods

We search for associations between platelet parameters and thrombosis by a population-based study in 11,084 inhabitants of an Italian genetic isolate characterized by wide variability of platelet parameters. To validate this methodology of investigation, we also evaluated whether it was able to identify several well known thrombotic risk factors in the study population.

Results

Statistical analysis confirmed that male gender, ageing, hypertension, high total cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, diabetes, obesity and smoking were risk factors for arterial thrombosis, while alcohol consumption had a protective effect. Female gender, ageing, pregnancy, estroprogestinic treatment, obesity, varicose veins were associated with venous thrombosis. At variance, MPV and platelet count were unrelated to previous thrombotic events. However, MPV was negatively correlated with the time since the last thrombotic event.

Conclusions

This study indicated that an epidemiologic study of a population isolate is appropriate for the identification of thrombotic risk factors, but it failed to identify such a role for MPV. Thus, we suggest that the increased MPV previously described in subjects with acute thrombosis was a consequence instead of a cause of thrombosis.

### Drug-induced thrombocytopenia [^979bdc91]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced thrombocytopenia was first described in the 19th century, yet our understanding of its pathogenesis continues to evolve. The list of drugs implicated in drug-induced thrombocytopenia is extensive and growing. Many, if not most, of these medications induce thrombocytopenia by immune mechanisms. Because the degree of thrombocytopenia can put patients at risk for serious bleeding, a prompt diagnosis is key to clinical management. The laboratory approach to diagnosing drug-induced thrombocytopenia is 2-pronged. First, nondrug causes of thrombocytopenia must be ruled out. Second, testing for drug-dependent platelet antibodies, available at specialized reference laboratories, often can identify the offending medication, although usually not in time for initial clinical management. Once a medication is suspected of causing thrombocytopenia, it must be discontinued promptly, and the patient should be monitored closely. Thrombocytopenia generally resolves quickly after offending medication withdrawal, and the prognosis of drug-induced thrombocytopenia is then excellent.

Evidence cited on the page states that "attainment of higher platelet transfusion thresholds (above 10 × 10^9/μL) has not been associated with a decreased risk of bleeding". Safety considerations are highlighted: "Platelet transfusions, although usually well tolerated, can have significant adverse effects after multiple transfusions, thus exposing children to an increased risk for acute transfusion reactions, viral and bacterial infections, and platelet alloimmunization". Scope limits are specified: "the ASH-ASPHO recommendation is not intended to include children younger than 1 year of age… and is not relevant to patients with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia".

### Alcohol induced thrombocytopenia… [^7c1e4c06]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Alcoholism may be the trigger mechanism of a chain reaction resulting in many and varied syndromes. The alcoholic with neurologic disease, malnutrition, or cirrhosis is a patient familiar to the house officers of any large city hospital. That this patient may also manifest hematologic signs has become increasingly evident during the past decade. The depressant effect of alcohol on erythropoiesis is often associated with folic acid deficiency and resultant megaloblastosis, 1 and occasionally pancytopenia. A recent study suggests that alcoholism is also associated with a defect in cellular iron utilization manifested by a high incidence of ringed sideroblasts in the marrow. 2 These changes have been described in patients who have low serum and red cell folate levels along with megaloblastosis. Recently evidence has begun to accrue that alcohol may induce thrombocytopenia quite apart from its effects on other formed elements of the blood and without relationship to folic acid deficiency.

### Ethanol consumption produces a small increase in circulating miR-122 in healthy individuals [^a5cb1c20]. Clinical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

MicroRNA 122 (miR-122) is a new circulating biomarker for liver injury, which increases earlier than conventional markers in patients with acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. However, as co-ingestion of ethanol is common with drug overdose, a confounding effect of acute ethanol consumption on serum miR-122 must be examined.

Methods

Blood was collected from healthy volunteers before and after recreational consumption of ethanol. Routine biochemistry and haematology measurements were performed, and serum miR-122 was measured by qPCR. The primary outcome was the difference in serum miR-122 with ethanol consumption.

Results

We recruited 18 participants (72% male). Their mean serum ethanol concentration was 113 mg/dl (95% confidence interval [CI] 91–135 mg/dl) after consuming ethanol. Serum miR-122 increased from a mean of 71.3 million (95% CI 29.3–113.2 million) to 139.1 million (95% CI 62.6–215.7 million) copies/ml (2.2-fold increase). There was no significant difference in serum alanine aminotransferase activity before and after ethanol consumption.

Conclusion

miR-122 increased with moderate ethanol consumption, but the fold change was modest. As increases with acetaminophen toxicity are 100- to 10 000-fold, moderate ethanol intoxication is unlikely to confound the use of this biomarker of hepatotoxicity.

### Alcoholic thrombocytopenia in three inpatient drinking alcoholics… [^e7424cd3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Three known alcoholics without medical complications were given alcohol ad lib. Platelets were counted periodically during and following the period of drinking. There was an initial transient decline in platelet levels. A more gradual decline then occurred after the second day. Upon cessation of drinking there was a slow recovery of platelet values. None of the subjects showed evidence of liver disease, folate deficiency, or intravascular coagulation. The results suggest that alcohol has a direct effect on platelet turnover.

### A nomogram for predicting the transition from recurrent acute pancreatitis to chronic pancreatitis [^f706d7fa]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

Based on the univariate results, platelet count was included in our model. In our study, the increase in platelet count increased the possibility of CP. Previous studies have used platelet count to construct a prognostic scoring model for CP. Studies have shown a relationship between pancreatitis and extrahepatic portal venous system thrombosis in 35% of patients with acute/chronic alcoholic pancreatitis. Splanchnic venous thrombosis is a kind of vascular complication of CP. While platelets are widely recognized for their role in thrombosis, there is a growing acceptance of platelets as immune cells that also play a significant role in inflammation. Although the involvement of platelets in chronic inflammation has been extensively documented, no studies have been found specifically addressing their role in CP. Although platelet counts are not explicitly mentioned, earlier researches have highlighted the significant role of platelet-activating factors (PAF) in both acute AP and CP. Researchers investigated the role of PAF in AP by analyzing the levels of endogenous PAF in pancreatic tissue and evaluating the protective effects of TCV-309, a specific blocker of PAF, in rats with cerulein-induced pancreatitis. During the chronic phase of obstructive pancreatitis induced by duct ligation, the levels of pancreatic PAF significantly increase. Furthermore, recent research findings have revealed the unexpected role of platelets in the regulation of insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. Further studies are needed to confirm the mechanism of platelet count in the progression of CP.

The function of pancreatic lipase is the hydrolysis of dietary triacylglycerols into diacylglycerols and then free fatty acids. Lipase elevation more than 3 times the upper limit of normal is included in the diagnosis of AP. Serum lipase appears more specific and remains elevated longer than amylase after disease presentation. However, it is not only the pancreas that can secrete lipase. Elevated lipase levels may also be associated with other diseases, such as cholecystitis or biliary obstruction. Combined with the relationship between biliary cause and the risk of CP, there may be a connection between biliary cause, lipase level, and the CP event. In our study, the higher the lipase level, the greater the probability of CP. Interestingly, studies report that low serum pancreatic lipase level is related to CP diagnosis. Although this study found that lipase levels were associated with CP in patients with RAP, the mechanism is unclear.

Alcohol and Cardiovascular Mortality: The J‐Shaped Curve

Observational and prospective studies have consistently shown a lower risk of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality in people with low levels of alcohol consumption when compared with abstainers, with the highest risks occurring in people with high levels of consumption (the 'J‐shaped' or 'U‐shaped' curve) 5, 6, 11, 12. Xi and colleagues 5 examined the association between alcohol consumption and mortality risk in US adults, using data from the National Health Interview Surveys of 333 247 participants ≥ 18 years of age and categorizing participants according to self‐reported alcohol consumption patterns. Compared with life‐time abstainers, individuals who were classified as light or moderate consumers were at reduced risk of all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, but that risk increased significantly with heavy alcohol consumption. This is seen in the J‐shaped curves in Figs 1 and 2. A meta‐analysis of 34 studies including more than a million people found a maximum potential benefit at half to one drink daily for women [18% lower all‐cause mortality; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 13–22%] 13. In men, maximal potential was seen at one to two drinks/day, with an associated reduction of 17% (95% CI = 15–19%) in all‐cause mortality 13. Consumption of more than 2.5 drinks/day in women and four drinks/day in men was associated with higher death rates in a dose‐dependent manner.

Beverages such as red wine that are high in polyphenols have anti‐oxidant, anti‐inflammatory and antiplatelet effects. However, ethanol appears to be the main driver of potential health benefits at low doses and the toxic effects at high doses. Increased high‐density lipoprotein (HDL), reduced plasma viscosity, decreased fibrinogen concentration, increased fibrinolysis, decreased platelet aggregation and coagulation and enhanced endothelial function are some of the potentially beneficial mechanisms 11, 14.

### How I use platelet transfusions [^ba0baa0b]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Platelet transfusions are commonly administered for the prevention or treatment of bleeding in patients with acquired thrombocytopenia across a range of clinical contexts. Recent data, including randomized trials, have highlighted uncertainties in the risk-benefit balance of this therapy, which is the subject of this review. Hemovigilance systems report that platelets are the most frequently implicated component in transfusion reactions. There is considerable variation in platelet count increment after platelet transfusion, and limited evidence of efficacy for clinical outcomes, including prevention of bleeding. Bleeding events commonly occur despite the different policies for platelet transfusion prophylaxis. The underlying mechanisms of harm reported in randomized trials may be related to the role of platelets beyond hemostasis, including mediating inflammation. Research supports the implementation of a restrictive platelet transfusion policy. Research is needed to better understand the impact of platelet donation characteristics on outcomes, and to determine the optimal thresholds for platelet transfusion before invasive procedures or major surgery (eg, laparotomy). Platelet transfusion policies should move toward a risk-adapted approach that does not focus solely on platelet count.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) — diagnosis and severity criteria include heavy alcohol use thresholds, required histology for definite diagnosis, characteristic labs, and risk stratification cutoffs. Heavy use is defined as more than 3 standard drinks per day for women (approximately 40 g of alcohol) and 4 standard drinks per day for men (approximately 50–60 g of alcohol). Liver biopsy is required to make a diagnosis of definite AAH. Typical labs show serum bilirubin > 3 mg/dL (> 50 μmol/L), aspartate transaminase > 50 IU/mL, and an aspartate transaminase to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio > 1.5. Severe AAH has usually been defined by a Maddrey discriminant function (MDF) score ≥ 32 predicting mortality of up to 30% at 30 days, and for treatment trials severe AAH has been defined by MDF ≥ 32 or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score > 20.

### Higher levels of neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio predict increased mortality risk in patients with liver cirrhosis: a retrospective cohort study [^54904bc3]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

As the ratio of two easily accessible parameters, NPAR possess advantages in convenience and feasible approach. The relationship between high NPAR levels and poor prognosis has been confirmed in several diseases. Previous studies proved that higher NPARs were associated with an increased risk of short-time and long-time mortality in critically ill patients with septic shock, coronary artery diseases and cardiogenic shock after adjustments for possible confounding factors. And NPAR > 15.7 showed an increase of 90% in the risk of contrast-associated acute kidney injury.

In this study, we first proved that patients with higher NPAR showed severer liver dysfunctions, cirrhosis-related complications and higher mortality risk. Previous studies have proved that inflammatory processes are one of the main mechanisms in the progression of alcoholic-related cirrhosis patients. This may explain the higher proportion of alcoholic cirrhosis in the high NPAR group. And in the multivariate Cox regression, NPAR was independent of other clinical indexes, including bilirubin, INR, etc. Although both neutrophil percentage and albumin are associated with the poor prognosis in liver cirrhosis, NPAR showed better predictive power than either neutrophils or albumin alone (P = 0.003 and 0.041, separately). This may be explained that inflammation resulted in a reverse response to neutrophil and albumin, and the ratio of neutrophil/albumin may further enhance the effect of inflammation. Therefore, NPAR proved to be more sensitive and reliable compared with neutrophil and albumin alone. And NPAR showed a similar prognostic value compared with relatively complex MELD, indicating the validity and reliability of NPAR. Besides, in subgroup analysis, the effect of NPAR on mortality tends to be strengthened in patients with higher platelet count and bilirubin. Increasing evidence suggests that platelets play critical roles in regulating inflammation. In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients, circulating platelets present a proinflammatory phenotype and antiplatelet therapy in NASH mice helps prevented NASH. The participation of platelets in systemic inflammation may explain the enhanced effect of NPAR on mortality in higher platelet count.

### A diagnosis of haemolytic-uraemic syndrome blurred by alcohol abuse [^60d8dade]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 60-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for status epilepticus. At first, laboratory and imagery findings were almost normal, and the symptoms were attributed to severe alcohol withdrawal due to a history of gastroenteritis reported by his family. But, during the following days, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and ischaemic and haemorrhagic lesions seen on a cerebral CT scan led to the diagnosis of haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS). Despite these severe complications, the patient made a good recovery following ICU and plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), but cognitive deficit still existed after 1 month. It is important to know that neurological manifestations can precede typical biological and radiological signs in HUS, and to not be misled in the diagnosis process, especially when a more common differential diagnosis is possible.

### Peri-operative identification and management of patients with unhealthy alcohol intake [^6b4fc77d]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Day‐case surgery

There are few published data relating to day surgery in patients with harmful alcohol intake. However, day‐case procedures are potentially advantageous in this group as they can avoid the withdrawal states associated with inpatient hospital stays. Many general aspects of management are encompassed within pre‐existing guidelines. At all stages, appropriate involvement of the multidisciplinary team is vital for decision‐making regarding day‐case suitability and timing of other elements, such as controlled withdrawal programmes. Case‐by‐case decision making may vary depending on individual patient characteristics, local resources and personnel, particularly when planning safe postoperative discharge.

In high‐volume, nurse‐led pre‐assessment settings, the addition of the AUDIT‐C to other commonly used scoring systems provides a valuable, rapidly applicable measure for seeking further clinician involvement such as discussion with an anaesthetist. Day surgery‐specific pre‐operative assessment should otherwise be undertaken by practitioners competent in eliciting symptoms and signs indicative of complications from chronic alcohol use. Cardiovascular and hepatic manifestations such as dilated cardiomyopathy and cirrhosis are particularly relevant to day‐case suitability. The presence of coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia, with their attendant bleeding risks, should also influence decision‐making. It may be safer for some patients to be managed as inpatients, depending on the nature of the planned surgical intervention and outcomes of appropriate multidisciplinary discussions.

Monitoring and Dosing

Patients who are not able to adhere to the recommended laboratory monitoring or to the related treatment recommendations must not receive TEGSEDI. Do not initiate TEGSEDI in patients with a platelet count below 100 x 109/L. Follow recommended monitoring and treatment recommendations for platelet count [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of thrombocytopenia, obtain a platelet count as soon as possible, and hold TEGSEDI dosing unless the platelet count is confirmed to be acceptable. Recheck the platelet count as soon as possible if a platelet measurement is uninterpretable (e.g., clumped sample) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Hold TEGSEDI dosing until an acceptable platelet count is confirmed with an interpretable blood sample.

Concomitant Medications with Platelet Effects

When considering use of TEGSEDI concomitantly with antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants, be aware of the risk of potential bleeding from thrombocytopenia with TEGSEDI, and consider discontinuation of these drugs in patients with a platelet count less than 50 x 109/L [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Symptoms of Thrombocytopenia

Symptoms of thrombocytopenia can include unusual or prolonged bleeding (e.g., petechiae, easy bruising, hematoma, subconjunctival bleeding, gingival bleeding, epistaxis, hemoptysis, irregular or heavier than normal menstrual bleeding, hematemesis, hematuria, hematochezia, melena), neck stiffness or atypical severe headache. Patients and caregivers should be instructed to be vigilant for symptoms of thrombocytopenia and seek immediate medical help if they have concerns.

Severe Thrombocytopenia: Treatment with Glucocorticoids

Glucocorticoid therapy is strongly recommended in patients with a platelet count below 50 x 109/L, and in patients with suspected immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. Avoid using TEGSEDI in patients for whom glucocorticoid treatment is not advised.

5.3	Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT and HITT.

5.4	Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative

Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants.

Serious and fatal adverse reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and low-birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved formulation in infusion solutions, including HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations.

When prescribing HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION (HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION contains 9.45 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Prevalence and clinical impact of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in alcohol-associated hepatitis And the potential role of prophylaxis: a multinational, retrospective cohort study [^f872a65b]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Prevalence, severity, and risk factors

The clinical features of AWS during hospitalization are described in Table 2. During hospitalization, 32.4% (n = 140) of patients developed AWS. In most cases (95%), symptoms of AWS started within the initial three days of hospitalization and lasted for 5 days. Next, we explored the clinical and laboratory parameters associated with the development of AWS (Supplementary Table S2). There was no significant difference in the degree of liver dysfunction based on MELD score between patients with and without AWS. Among patients who underwent liver biopsy, histologic severity of AH determined by alcoholic hepatitis histologic score (AHHS) was not associated with the development of AWS (Supplementary Table S3). In the univariate analysis, patients who developed AWS were younger (46 vs. 49 years, p = 0.0060) and more commonly had a previous history of AWS (37.1% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.0010). Among laboratory parameters at admission, platelet levels were inversely associated with the rate of AWS (124.1/dL vs. 139.7/dL, p = 0.045). To identify independent predictors of AWS, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. After controlling for age and MELD score, previous history of AWS (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.31–3.33) and lower platelet levels (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.05–2.48) were independently associated with a higher rate of AWS (Supplementary Table S2). Importantly, we found that the use of prophylaxis at the time of admission decreased the risk of AWS by 42% (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36–0.93, p = 0.024).

Results

The efficacy of lusutrombopag

Table 1 shows the characteristics of all 31 patients at the first administration of lusutrombopag. There were 23 (74.2%) and 8 (25.8%) patients in groups A and B, respectively. Group B was characterized by a male predominance, low platelet count at baseline, platelet increase > 20,000/µL, and a high splenic volume. However, there were no significant differences in age, duration of lusutrombopag treatment, history of platelet transfusion, Child–Pugh grade and score, ALBI score, FIB4 index or Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer, and the days from the staring lusutrombopag to the procedure between groups A and B. In addition, etiology is unlikely to contribute to the effect of lusutrombopag.

Table 1
The characteristics of patients who received lusutrombopag

HCV hepatitis C virus, HBV hepatitis B virus, NASH non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, ALC alcohol, ALBI albumin–bilirubin, FIB-4 fibrosis-4, M2BPGi mac2 binding protein glucosylation isomer, TACE transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, RFA radiofrequency ablation, EVL endoscopic variceal ligation, EIS endoscopic injection sclerotherapy

Lusutrombopag significantly increased the platelet count in all 31 patients with a mean increase of 31,000/µL (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1 a, left panel). The degree of increase in the platelet count in group A was larger than that in group B (Fig. 1 a, middle and right panels). In group A, 87.0% (20/23) of the patients showed a platelet increase of ≥ 20,000/µL. In contrast, only 25.0% (2/8) of the patients in group B showed a platelet increase of ≥ 20,000/µL (Table 1). The days required to reach the maximum platelet counts did not differ between groups A and B. Among 8 patients in group B, 7 received platelet transfusions due to a low platelet count of < 50,000/µL, even after lusutrombopag treatment (one patient failed to receive a platelet transfusion). However, the increase in the platelet count after platelet transfusion was not statistically significant (Fig. 1 b).

5.3	Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Neonates and Infants due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative

Use preservative-free FRAGMIN in neonates and infants.

Serious and fatal adverse reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and low-birth weight infants treated with medications that contain the preservative benzyl alcohol. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing FRAGMIN in infants, consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including FRAGMIN multiple-dose vial (contains 14 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Because benzyl alcohol may cross the placenta, use caution when administering FRAGMIN preserved with benzyl alcohol to pregnant women. If anticoagulation with FRAGMIN is needed during pregnancy, use preservative-free formulations where possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.4	Laboratory Tests

Periodic routine complete blood counts, including platelet count, blood chemistry, and stool occult blood tests are recommended during the course of treatment with FRAGMIN. When administered at recommended prophylaxis doses, routine coagulation tests such as Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) are relatively insensitive measures of FRAGMIN activity and, therefore, unsuitable for monitoring the anticoagulant effect of FRAGMIN. Monitor anti-Xa level periodically in pediatric patients. Anti-Xa may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of FRAGMIN, such as in patients with severe renal impairment or if abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding occurs during FRAGMIN therapy.
