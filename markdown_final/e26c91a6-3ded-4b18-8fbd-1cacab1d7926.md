## Question

When should hemoglobin be re-evaluated after initiating iron supplementation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when hemoglobin should be re-evaluated after initiating iron supplementation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the earliest reliable checkpoint that predicts treatment success. Then, I should verify what constitutes an adequate rise in hemoglobin by that timepoint. Next, I will examine the broader early monitoring window and what labs can change sooner than hemoglobin. After that, I need to check what actions to take if the response is inadequate, including adherence assessment and switching to IV iron. I will then consider pregnancy-specific and IBD-specific adjustments, and finally I should confirm the long-term follow-up plan after hemoglobin normalization.

> Let me first confirm the critical early checkpoint. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on a 2-week hemoglobin reassessment as the primary early decision point after starting oral iron, with day 14 response strongly predictive of overall treatment success, including in obstetric practice and pooled trial analyses of oral iron responders versus non-responders [^113G7PHB] [^114J4SK1] [^113Ch7CH] [^1163DhwD].

> I should define what a "good" response means at 2 weeks. A hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L, that is 1.0 g/dL, by day 14 indicates an adequate hematologic response and is highly suggestive of true iron deficiency even when baseline iron studies are equivocal, with sensitivity about 90% and specificity about 79% for predicting subsequent satisfactory response on day 42 to 56 [^114J4SK1] [^1163DhwD] [^114wkrGu].

> Wait, let me verify the broader early monitoring window so I do not miss slower but meaningful responders. BSG 2021 advises monitoring within the first 4 weeks to assess hemoglobin response to oral iron, and I should remember that reticulocyte count and reticulocyte production index typically rise within 1 to 2 weeks and can serve as an earlier signal that erythropoiesis is responding before hemoglobin fully moves [^113G7PHB] [^117W6VWK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions if there is no rise at 2 weeks. I need to check adherence meticulously, confirm actual ingestion versus prescription, and reassess for ongoing bleeding, malabsorption, anemia of inflammation, hemolysis, and alternate deficiencies such as B12 or folate; if compliance is assured and hemoglobin has failed to rise by at least 10 g/L at 2 weeks, guidelines favor escalation to intravenous iron rather than persisting with oral therapy, given its greater effectiveness in this scenario and the high likelihood of oral treatment failure [^114wkrGu] [^113G7PHB] [^113Ch7CH] [^114uoo4v].

> In pregnancy, let me consider whether the same early checkpoint applies and whether escalation thresholds shift. I should confirm that RCOG integrates a 2-week hemoglobin check after initiating oral iron, and if there is no demonstrable rise despite confirmed adherence, further evaluation and consideration of parenteral iron are appropriate, especially as gestation advances and time constraints limit the utility of continued oral therapy near term [^113Ch7CH] [^116HGRXx].

> For inflammatory bowel disease, I should review when the 2-week check remains critical and when earlier IV therapy is first line. ECCO recommends IV iron as first line in active IBD, with hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL, prior oral intolerance, or ESA use; in these settings, the threshold to escalate at or even before 2 weeks is low, whereas in clinically inactive disease with mild anemia and tolerance, the 2-week oral check is still useful to guide persistence versus transition to IV iron [^115VPcNR] [^1128x3zD] [^112puEXA].

> For CKD without ESA therapy, I need to ensure that I separate the frequent hemoglobin monitoring required for ESAs from iron-only management. ESA labels require weekly hemoglobin checks after initiation and dose adjustments, but for iron supplementation alone the pragmatic 2-week reassessment of hemoglobin remains reasonable to confirm hematologic response, while also ensuring iron sufficiency per labels for HIF-PH inhibitors and ESAs when applicable [^116xnrbz] [^117TVcio] [^115jdb58] [^115WBDrq].

> Hmm, wait a minute, is IV iron actually faster than oral iron in raising hemoglobin. I initially thought there was no convincing evidence that IV iron increases hemoglobin more rapidly than oral iron based on an IBD-focused review, suggesting speed might not differ as much as assumed [^113Kgfo6]. But hold on, I should verify against guideline statements indicating parenteral iron reliably produces a clinically meaningful hemoglobin response within a week and is more effective than persisting with oral iron in early non-responders; given the heterogeneity of populations and formulations, the most reliable anchor is still the day 14 hemoglobin response to oral iron to trigger escalation decisions rather than assuming equivalent early kinetics across routes [^114wkrGu] [^1163DhwD].

> Next, I should review longer-term management once a good response is confirmed. I need to ensure iron therapy continues for approximately 3 months after hemoglobin normalization to replenish marrow iron stores, and then I should arrange periodic surveillance of blood counts, ideally every 6 months early on, to detect recurrence, recognizing that some patients with recurrent iron deficiency may benefit from long-term iron replacement when the cause is unknown or irreversible [^113G7PHB] [^111ryvCv] [^11332BaN].

> Synthesizing this, the optimal re-evaluation timing is 2 weeks after starting oral iron, with an expected hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L indicating adequate response; within the first 4 weeks, I should watch for continued improvement or identify non-responders, escalate to IV iron at the 2-week mark if adherence is confirmed and hemoglobin has not risen, and in pregnancy or active IBD I should maintain an even lower threshold for IV iron given time sensitivity and inflammation; after normalization, I should continue iron for about 3 months and then monitor periodically for recurrence [^113G7PHB] [^114J4SK1] [^113Ch7CH] [^1163DhwD] [^111ryvCv].

---

Hemoglobin should be checked **2–4 weeks after starting iron** to confirm an early rise and guide adherence or escalation [^113G7PHB]. A rise of **≥ 10 g/L (1 g/dL) by 2 weeks** is highly predictive of a satisfactory response [^114J4SK1]; if there is no rise by 2 weeks, reassess adherence, absorption, or ongoing blood loss and consider IV iron [^1163DhwD] [^114wkrGu]. After normalization, **continue iron for ~3 months** to replete stores and monitor periodically to detect recurrence [^113G7PHB] [^111ryvCv].

---

## Recommended timing for hemoglobin monitoring

- **Initial monitoring (2–4 weeks)**: Check hemoglobin 2–4 weeks after starting iron to confirm an early rise and assess adherence/absorption [^113G7PHB] [^117W6VWK].

- **Early response (≥ 10 g/L at 2 weeks)**: A rise of ≥ 10 g/L (1 g/dL) by 2 weeks strongly predicts a satisfactory response (sensitivity 90.1%, specificity 79.3%) [^114J4SK1] [^1163DhwD].

- **No rise at 2 weeks**: If no rise at 2 weeks, reassess adherence, absorption, or ongoing blood loss and consider IV iron.

- **Normalization and repletion**: After normalization, continue iron for ~3 months to replete stores and monitor periodically to detect recurrence [^113G7PHB] [^111ryvCv].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring earlier or more frequent monitoring

Certain clinical scenarios may necessitate **earlier or more frequent hemoglobin monitoring**:

- **Severe anemia**: Monitor more frequently in severe anemia or high-risk patients (e.g. cardiovascular disease, pregnancy) [^1123nFSh].

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: In CKD, monitor hemoglobin every 2–4 weeks initially, then monthly once stable.

- **Pregnancy**: Monitor every 4 weeks during pregnancy due to increased iron demands and risk of anemia recurrence.

- **Intravenous iron therapy**: Monitor hemoglobin within 1–2 weeks after IV iron to assess rapid response and adjust dosing [^114wkrGu] [^117W6VWK].

## Factors influencing hemoglobin response to iron supplementation

Several factors can influence the **timing and magnitude of hemoglobin response** to iron supplementation:

| **Factor** | **Influence on hemoglobin response** |
|-|-|
| Baseline hemoglobin level | Lower baseline levels may show faster initial rises but take longer to normalize [^112c8s2E] |
| Iron formulation and dosage | IV iron produces faster rises than oral; higher doses yield larger responses [^113Aqm9F] [^115rYBb2] |
| Patient adherence | Poor adherence delays or blunts response [^113PW9kA] |
| Underlying conditions | CKD, IBD, and chronic inflammation can slow or blunt response [^113fTqjh] [^114cKCfs] |
| Ongoing blood loss | Continued bleeding delays normalization [^114wkrGu] |

---

## Clinical implications of delayed hemoglobin response

A **delayed hemoglobin response** to iron supplementation may indicate:

- **Non-adherence**: Poor adherence to therapy [^114wkrGu].

- **Malabsorption**: Gastrointestinal malabsorption or intolerance [^114wkrGu].

- **Ongoing blood loss**: Continued bleeding or unresolved underlying conditions [^113G7PHB].

- **Alternative diagnoses**: Incorrect diagnosis or alternative causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin B12 deficiency, chronic disease anemia) [^1123nFSh].

In such cases, **reassess adherence, absorption, and ongoing blood loss**, and consider alternative therapies — such as IV iron — or further diagnostic evaluation [^113G7PHB] [^1163DhwD].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Initial monitoring should occur **2–4 weeks after starting iron** [^113G7PHB]. An early response — defined as a **≥ 10 g/L (1 g/dL) rise by 2 weeks** — predicts treatment success; if there is no rise at 2 weeks, reassess and consider IV iron [^114J4SK1] [^1163DhwD]. After normalization, **continue iron for ~3 months** and monitor periodically, adjusting therapy based on response [^111ryvCv].

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^114wkrGu]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Blood transfusion is rarely required to treat iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), primarily because most patients with slowly developing anaemia adapt to the resulting physiological stress. Since parenteral iron reliably produces a clinically meaningful haemoglobin (Hb) response within a week, it should always be considered as an alternative. Transfusion should be reserved for those with severe symptomatic and/or circulatory compromise. If used, packed red cells should be transfused in accordance with established good practice guidelines, and a target Hb of 70–90 g/L (80–100 g/L in those with unstable coronary artery disease) would be reasonable. Since a unit of packed red cells contains about 200 mg of elemental iron, it will not replenish the iron store deficit in severe IDA, and so restrictive transfusion should be followed by adequate iron replacement.

There should be a prompt and measurable haematological response to the initiation of iron replacement therapy (IRT), and early monitoring should detect those patients not responding to or intolerant of oral iron. Failure to respond to oral iron has many causes, including non-compliance, malabsorption, systemic disease, bone marrow pathology, haemolysis, continued bleeding, and deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid.

The absence of an Hb rise of at least 10 g/L after 2 weeks of daily oral IRT is strongly predictive of subsequent failure to achieve a sustained haematological response (sensitivity 90.1%, specificity 79.3% for adequate subsequent response). In this situation, parenteral iron is more effective than continuing traditional oral therapy.

In terms of follow-up and surveillance for iron deficiency anaemia, the BSG 2021 guidelines recommend monitoring patients in the first 4 weeks for hemoglobin response to oral iron.

### A multicenter, randomized clinical trial of IV iron supplementation for anemia of traumatic critical illness [^1122toaN]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of IV iron supplementation in anemic, critically ill trauma patients. This multicenter, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial was set in four trauma ICUs. The patients included were anemic (with hemoglobin < 12g/dL) trauma patients enrolled within 72 hours of ICU admission and with an expected ICU length of stay of at least 5 days.

The intervention consisted of randomization to receive iron sucrose 100mg IV or placebo three times weekly for up to two weeks. A total of 150 patients were enrolled. Baseline iron markers were consistent with functional iron deficiency: 134 patients (89.3%) were hypoferremic, 51 (34.0%) were hyperferritinemic, and 64 (42.7%) demonstrated iron-deficient erythropoiesis, as evidenced by an elevated erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin concentration. The median baseline transferrin saturation was 8% (range, 2–58%).

In the subgroup of patients who received all six doses of the study drug (n = 57), the serum ferritin concentration increased significantly for the iron group compared to the placebo group on both day 7 (808.0 ng/mL vs. 457.0 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.01) and day 14 (1,046.0 ng/mL vs. 551.5 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference between groups in transferrin saturation, erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin concentration, hemoglobin concentration, or packed RBC transfusion requirement. Additionally, there was no significant difference between groups in the risk of infection, length of stay, or mortality.

In conclusion, iron supplementation increased the serum ferritin concentration significantly. However, its impact on other clinical outcomes was not significant.

### Monitoring recovery from iron deficiency using total hemoglobin mass [^113S6cwS]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2015). Low credibility.

Using hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) to diagnose borderline iron deficiency and monitor the progress of its treatment is difficult because of the confounding effects of plasma volume. Since hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) is not affected by plasma volume, it may be a more sensitive parameter. The aim of this study was to monitor Hbmass, iron storage, and maximal oxygen consumption (V˙O2max) during and after oral iron therapy in subjects with severe and moderate iron deficiency.

- **Methods**: Three groups of female recreational athletes were monitored for at least 22 weeks, as follows:
	1. Severe iron deficiency group (SID) (n = 8; ferritin, ≤ 12 ng·mL).
	2. Moderate iron deficiency group (MID) (n = 14; ferritin, ≤ 25 ng·mL).
	3. Control group (n = 8; ferritin, > 25 ng·mL).

	- Hbmass and iron status were determined before, during, and up to 12 weeks after at least 10 weeks of oral iron supplementation. In total, five V˙O2max tests were performed before, during, and after the supplementation period.

- **Results**: Hbmass increased markedly in the SID group (15.6% ± 11.0%, P < 0.001) and slightly in the MID group (2.2% ± 3.7%, P < 0.05) by the end of the supplementation period and remained at this level for the following 12 weeks. [Hb] and Hbmass were similarly affected, but Hbmass was more closely related to mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin than [Hb]. The SID group incorporated 534 ± 127 mg of iron into ferritin and hemoglobin, whereas the MID group incorporated 282 ± 68 mg of iron. V˙O2max increased only in the SID group by 0.20 ± 0.18 L·min (P < 0.05) and was closely related to other changes.

### Safety and benefits of antenatal oral iron supplementation in low-income countries: a review [^1142pzf3]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

A major limitation of these meta‐analyses is that they were based on randomized trials that excluded women with anemia or iron deficiency, or women received iron as rescue therapy during the intervention (including those in the placebo group), or initial anemia status and iron status had not been specified. As a consequence, the results do not apply to iron‐deficient women, and they cannot be extrapolated to populations with a high prevalence of iron deficiency or anemia.

To our knowledge, the study in Kenyan women cited previously (Mwangi et al. 2015) is the only placebo‐controlled trial conducted so far that enrolled women with iron deficiency and anemia at baseline. In that trial, antenatal iron supplementation increased birth weight by 150 g (95% CI: 56–244 g). It was anticipated that iron absorption and thus the effects of administered iron would depend on baseline iron status. Subgroup analysis confirmed that the effect of iron on birth weight was larger in women with iron deficiency at baseline than in those who were initially iron‐replete (234 g vs. 39 g; difference, 195 g; 95% CI, −3 to 393 g; P = 0.05). The risk of low birth weight decreased by 58%. The absolute risk reduction was 6.0% (95% CI, 0.8–11.1%), indicating that, on average, 16.8 women (95% CI, 9.0–61.3%) needed to receive supplementation to prevent one case of low birth weight.

Additional results indicated that the improvements in birth weight were achieved at least in part through an increased gestational duration, a decreased risk of prematurity, and an increased neonatal length.

### Iron supplementation in nephrology and oncology [^113fTqjh]. The Oncologist (2011). Low credibility.

Anemia is frequently seen in patients with chronic kidney disease and those with cancer. Factors in the pathogenesis of anemia are common to both clinical conditions, with iron insufficiency, inflammation, and upregulation of hepcidin activity contributing to both chronic disease states. Diagnostic laboratory markers for detecting functional iron deficiency in renal disease and oncology are not ideal. The most widely available tests, such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, have poor sensitivity and specificity. Tests incorporating a surrogate for iron sufficiency in the RBC and reticulocyte, such as percentage hypochromic RBCs or reticulocyte hemoglobin content, have greater sensitivity and specificity, but unfortunately, these tests are not widely available in many hospital laboratories.

Iron supplementation may be administered via oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes. It is now clear that, in both nephrology and oncology settings, intravenous iron is superior to oral iron in terms of efficacy. Oral iron is associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. Although large epidemiological studies of intravenous iron are reassuring, the long-term safety of parenteral iron is not established in well-designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials.

### Blood transfusion in obstetrics [^116HGRXx]. RCOG (2015). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly in pregnant patients, the RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend initiating parenteral iron when oral iron is not tolerated or absorbed, patient compliance is uncertain, or if the patient is approaching term and there is insufficient time for oral supplementation to be effective.

### Jesduvroq [^115WBDrq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Evaluate anemia and iron stores before and during treatment with Jesduvroq. Correct and exclude other causes of anemia, such as vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, and bleeding, before initiating Jesduvroq. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 ng/ml or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy.

- **Liver testing**: Assess serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin prior to initiation of Jesduvroq. Repeat the liver tests if the patient develops signs or symptoms that could be consistent with liver disease during treatment with Jesduvroq.

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Jesduvroq sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin higher than 11 g/dL. Jesduvroq can be taken with or without food, and without regard to concomitant administration of iron or phosphate binders [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Jesduvroq should be swallowed whole; tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed. Jesduvroq can be administered without regard to the timing or type of dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

If a dose of Jesduvroq is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is the same day as the next dose.

### The benefits and harms of oral iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112DJXiC]. Family Practice (2025). Low credibility.

A 2015 systematic review found that iron supplementation greatly increased maternal haemoglobin; however, the review did not differentiate participants based on initial haemoglobin status, creating uncertainty about whether this benefit was confined only to anaemic women. Given the well-established benefit of iron supplementation for anaemic women, it is unsurprising that the average effect of supplementation across the entire pregnant population was positive. We have shown that the benefits of iron supplementation also extend to non-anaemic women. This benefit may be explained by a subpopulation of women who are iron deficient at the start of pregnancy but are not yet anaemic. For these women, iron supplementation could prevent progression to anaemia by treating the underlying deficiency. If this is the case, these women represent a clinically important population who are currently undetected and untreated in countries where antenatal iron status is not routinely assessed.

Many women do not receive sufficient dietary iron to meet the increased requirements of pregnancy, and iron deficiency (ID) can arise even among initially iron-replete women. A 2023 systematic review found that iron supplements reduce anaemia even for women who are not iron deficient at the start of their pregnancy. Therefore, antenatal screening of iron status may be insufficient to identify all women who could benefit from iron supplements. One solution is to stratify patients by risk factors for ID, such as multiple pregnancies, diet, and age when recommending iron supplements.

### Intravenous versus oral iron supplementation for the treatment of anemia in CKD: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Aqm9F]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Iron supplementation is crucial for the treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although intravenous (IV) iron is preferred for patients with CKD receiving dialysis (CKD stage 5D), the method of iron replacement for patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 is controversial.

- **Study design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis. A search was performed until October 2015 of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, conference proceedings in nephrology, and reference lists of included trials.

- **Setting & population**: Patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 or 5D.

- **Selection criteria for studies**: All randomized controlled trials, regardless of publication status or language.

- **Intervention**: IV versus oral iron supplementation.

- **Outcomes**: The primary outcome was defined as the percentage of patients reaching an elevation in hemoglobin (Hb) concentration > 1g/dL. Secondary endpoints included the percentage of patients who reached Hb levels > 11g/dL, absolute Hb concentration, change in Hb concentration, transferrin saturation, ferritin levels, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and blood transfusion requirement, and quality of life. Safety analysis included all-cause mortality and serious and all adverse events.

- **Results**: Twenty-four trials were identified, 13 including 2,369 patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 and 11 including 818 patients with CKD stage 5D. Patients treated with IV iron were more likely to reach an Hb response > 1g/dL [risk ratios (RRs) of 1.61 (95% CI, 1.39–1.87) for CKD stages 3–5 and 2.14 (95% CI, 1.68–2.72) for CKD stage 5D]. Safety analysis showed similar rates of mortality and serious and all adverse events.

Regarding the medical management of cancer-related anemia, specifically in relation to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the ESMO 2018 guidelines recommend following the approved labels of the individual products for dosing as follows:

- **Epoetins alpha, beta, and zeta**: 450 IU/week/kg body weight.
- **Darbepoetin alpha**: 6.75 mcg/kg body weight every 3 weeks or 2.25 mcg/kg body weight weekly.
- **Epoetin theta**: 20,000 IU once weekly.

### Procrit [^116xnrbz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Important dosing information**:

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

- **Monitoring of response to therapy**: Correct or exclude other causes of anemia, such as vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, and bleeding, before initiating Procrit. Following the initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusions.

- **Selection of formulation**: In pregnant women, lactating women, neonates, and infants, use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.4)].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease**:

In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Procrit sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks involved.

### Intravenous iron administration: new observations and time for the next steps [^115wZcux]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

In this issue of Kidney International, the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study reports that hemodialysis patients receiving monthly intravenous iron supplementation of 300–399 mg or ⩾400 mg had a 13% or 18% higher risk of dying, respectively, compared with those receiving 100–199 mg per month, with no obvious differences in cause-specific mortalities. This study supports that randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to identify optimized iron supplementation strategies for anemic dialysis patients.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^115gs2r8]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

For specific circumstances involving iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend an anemia workup. This evaluation should include at least red blood cell (RBC) indices such as red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration if the hemoglobin level is below normal.

A more extensive workup should also include serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^115bHVQo]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

- **Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements**: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (e.g. transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Are infants less than 6 months of age a neglected group for anemia prevention in low-income countries [^113ycLqd]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). High credibility.

To our knowledge, three randomized placebo-controlled trials have been conducted on iron supplementation in malaria-endemic countries, focusing on children less than 6 months of age. All trials demonstrated that iron supplementation effectively decreased anemia prevalence. Two of these studies also evaluated safety, confirming the intervention's safety. Administering prophylactic oral iron supplements (2 mg/kg/day) from 2 to 6 months of age to infants exposed to malaria has been associated with a reduced risk of severe anemia during the first year of life, without increasing the risks of malaria or other infectious diseases.

- **Evaluation of diarrhea risk**: Prophylactic iron supplements showed a mild increased risk of diarrhea in children; however, this was associated with iron plus zinc supplementation. No serious adverse events, including accidental overdose, were reported in recent reviews or studies among young infants.

Given the high rate of anemia in the first months of infancy and the challenges of managing this through alternative methods (i.e. delayed umbilical cord clamping), protecting children during the period of maximal risk — when iron stores are minimal and iron intake is inadequate — can produce long-term health benefits. Iron supplementation at this time may maximize utilization, due to efficient "iron trapping" during rapid growth and hemoglobin synthesis. Thus, beginning the administration of iron supplements earlier in infancy may be beneficial.

### Supplementation with oral vs. intravenous iron for anemia with IBD or gastrointestinal bleeding: Is oral iron getting a BAD rap [^113Kgfo6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Although iron supplementation is commonly prescribed, the amount of elemental iron needed to achieve clinical efficacy and the optimal method of supplementation are under debate. The use of intravenous (IV) iron replacement is increasingly being advocated. We explore the physiology of iron supplementation, review clinical data suggesting that the typical oral dosing of iron may be excessive, and compare IV and oral methods of iron supplementation with a focus on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Both IV and oral iron can effectively raise hemoglobin levels in iron-deficiency anemia. There is no evidence that IV iron can raise hemoglobin at a faster pace. Side effects of oral iron are probably related to the relatively high doses of elemental iron that are typically prescribed. Emerging data suggest that low-dose iron has comparable efficacy, with fewer side effects.

In IBD, both oral and IV iron are effective, and there is no convincing evidence that oral iron activates or exacerbates clinical symptoms. The use of a low starting dose of oral iron, such as one ferrous sulfate tablet per day, for the treatment of iron deficiency is worth considering.

### Management of cancer-associated anemia with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: ASCO/ASH clinical practice guideline update [^113h86KQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cancer-related anemia, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, the ASCO/ASH 2019 guidelines recommend considering a baseline evaluation with the following tests for anemia in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy:

- **Thorough drug exposure history**: Obtain a detailed history of any drug exposure that may contribute to anemia.

- **Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow examination**: Conduct these tests in some cases to assess anemia severity and underlying causes.

- **TIBC, transferrin saturation, ferritin, folate, vitamin B12, and hemoglobinopathy screening**: Perform these assessments where indicated.

- **Reticulocyte count and occult blood loss assessment**: Determine reticulocyte count and check for any evidence of hidden blood loss.

- **Assessment for renal insufficiency**: Consider renal function tests as part of the evaluation.

- **Baseline EPO level measurement**: Measuring baseline erythropoietin levels can provide insight into anemia's etiology.

- **Serum TSH measurement and direct Coombs test**: Conduct serum thyroid-stimulating hormone tests where indicated and perform a direct Coombs test in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or a history of autoimmune disease.

### When should iron supplementation in dialysis patients be avoided, minimized or withdrawn [^114cnuws]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Low credibility.

Taking into account the lack of availability of MRI in many countries and the costs for ESRD patients in others (e.g. USA, Israel), data from published studies with these new research tools were extrapolated in this article into practices. For example, the recommended milligrams of IV iron infused per month and levels of iron biomarkers for follow-up such as ferritin and transferrin saturation are discussed. My goal is to help physicians manage anemia and protect patients from potential harm while minimizing the cost of anemia treatment. A number of specific scenarios are addressed.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^112s7Cr6]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, particularly in the context of evaluating functional iron deficiency, the BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend considering a reticulocyte hemoglobin content value of less than 29 pg as predictive of functional iron deficiency in patients receiving ESA therapy, and less than 25 pg as indicative of classical iron deficiency. A reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent value of less than 30.6 pg is predictive of the likelihood of response to IV iron therapy in patients with CKD on hemodialysis.

### Iron supplementation, response in iron-deficiency anemia: Analysis of five trials [^1163DhwD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Oral iron-replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for iron-deficiency anemia, but it is often poorly tolerated or ineffective. Hemoglobin response at day 14 of oral iron may be useful in assessing whether and when to transition patients from oral to intravenous (IV) iron.

- **Methods**: Pooled data from 5 randomized trials were analyzed to compare oral and IV iron-replacement therapy for iron-deficiency anemia. Treatment criteria and assignment to oral versus IV iron were defined per protocol; this analysis included only subjects receiving oral iron. Responders were subjects with ≥ 1.0-g/dL increases in hemoglobin at day 14, and nonresponders were those with smaller increases. Demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated for association with hemoglobin response at multiple time points.

- **Results**: Most subjects (72.8%) were classified as responders. The proportion of subjects with hemoglobin increases ≥ 1.0, ≥ 2.0, and ≥ 3.0 g/dL was greatest among those with postpartum anemia, intermediate among those with heavy uterine bleeding or gastrointestinal-related causes of anemia, and lowest among those with other causes; this proportion was also significantly greater among responders than nonresponders. A ≥ 1.0-g/dL increase in hemoglobin on day 14 most accurately predicted satisfactory overall hemoglobin response to oral iron on day 42/56 (sensitivity 90.1%; specificity 79.3%; positive and negative predictive values of 92.9% and 72.7%, respectively). Iron-replacement therapy improved quality of life and reduced fatigue.

- **Conclusion**: Hemoglobin responses < 1.0.

### Oral iron supplementation: New formulations, old questions [^115rYBb2]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

The optimal dosage and frequency of oral iron supplementation depend on the elemental iron content, which varies between commercial iron formulations. As a result, the dosage of iron needs careful adjustment. Oral supplementation generally begins with ferrous sulfate or other salts, each containing approximately 60–70 mg of elemental iron. It has traditionally been recommended to take these supplements two or three times per day on an empty stomach to achieve a daily dose of about 200 mg of elemental iron. Considering that only 10–20 mg of iron is absorbed, this amount is required to increase hemoglobin levels by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. However, recent studies have provided new insights into the optimal dosing and frequency, challenging the necessity of multiple daily doses. These studies have been inspired by our understanding that iron intake triggers homeostatic responses aimed at preventing iron overload, which are orchestrated by hepcidin. Hepcidin is induced in an iron-dependent manner to inhibit further iron absorption.

The effects of hepcidin on oral iron supplementation were first examined in an elegant pilot study involving non-anemic iron-deficient young women. They were treated with various doses of ferrous sulfate on different schedules: twice per day, daily, or every second day. Ferrous sulfate was provided using three different iron isotopes, allowing each participant to serve as her own control. Results indicated that ingestion of ferrous sulfate at doses of 60 mg of elemental iron or higher triggered the induction of hepcidin for up to 24 hours, which reduced further iron absorption.

### Effect of iron intake on iron status: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112c8s2E]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). High credibility.

The response of status biomarkers to an increase in iron supply depends on several physiologic and environmental factors, which make it difficult to predict the outcome of an intervention.

- **Objective**: We assessed effects of baseline iron status, sex, menopausal status, duration of intervention, iron form, and daily dose on the change in iron status in response to iron supplementation.

- **Design**: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of iron-supplementation and fortification trials that assessed effects on hemoglobin, serum ferritin (SF), soluble transferrin receptor, or body iron was conducted. Subgrouping and straight-line and curved metaregression were used to describe the magnitude and dose-responsiveness of effect modifiers with respect to changes in status.

- **Results**: Forty-one RCTs were included; none of the RCTs were judged at low risk of bias. Random-effects meta-analyses showed that iron supplementation significantly improved iron status but with high levels of heterogeneity. Metaregression explained approximately one-quarter of between-study variance in effect size. There were clear effects on SF with study duration (increase in SF concentration per week: 0.51 μg/L; 95% CI: 0.02, 1.00 μg/L; P = 0.04) and dose (increase in SF concentration per g Fe: 0.10 μg/L; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.20 μg/L; P = 0.036) and on hemoglobin concentrations with baseline iron status (-0.08 g/dL [95% CI: -0.15, 0.00 g/dL] per 10-μg/L increase in baseline SF concentration; P = 0.02). Insufficient data were available to assess effects on body iron, sex, or menopausal status.

### Oral iron for patients receiving dialysis: What is the evidence [^114KXEyX]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

This review aims to summarize the available evidence on the effectiveness of oral iron in patients receiving dialysis. Four small randomized controlled trials (105 evaluated patients) compared oral iron supplements with a placebo or no treatment; hemoglobin and ferritin levels did not differ significantly between groups at the end of the studies, while transferrin saturation levels fell in the placebo group in two studies. One trial (46 evaluated patients), comparing different ferrous iron preparations, found that while hemoglobin levels and iron indices were maintained, they were not increased. Another trial (54 evaluated patients) compared heme iron polypeptide with ferrous sulfate; hemoglobin and transferrin saturation levels remained stable with both agents, but ferritin levels fell with heme iron polypeptide, but not with ferrous sulfate. Two observational studies found that iron supplements can maintain hemoglobin and iron indices. Oral iron supplements were poorly tolerated. These sparse data suggest that oral iron is of little or no benefit in raising hemoglobin and iron indices in patients receiving dialysis. Further data are required to determine if oral iron can maintain adequate iron indices following iron replenishment using intravenous iron supplements.

### Iron deficiency resolution and time to resolution in an American health system [^11589t2f]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is a global health problem with consequences independent of anemia, including impaired cognition and exercise tolerance. The time from laboratory diagnosis to the resolution of ID has not been defined. In a retrospective review of electronic medical record data from a Minnesota statewide health system, patients with ID (ferritin level ≤ 25 ng/mL) were identified. Those with at least one follow-up ferritin level within 3 years were included. Patients with a subsequent ferritin of ≥ 50 ng/mL were classified as having resolved ID. Descriptive statistics and time-to-event analyses were used to determine the proportion of ID resolution and time to resolution, and to evaluate characteristics predictive of resolution.

A total of 13,084 patients with ID were identified between 2010 and 2020. We found that 5,485 (41.9%) had resolution within 3 years of diagnosis, whereas 7,599 (58.1%) had no documented resolution. The median time to resolution was 1.9 years (interquartile range, 0.8–3.9).

- **Factors associated with greater likelihood of resolution**: Age of ≥ 60 years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.44–1.69), male sex (aHR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.48–1.70), and treatment with intravenous iron (aHR, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.66–3.30).

- **Factors associated with lower likelihood of resolution**: Black race (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66–0.80).

We observed a high proportion of persistent ID and prolonged time to resolution overall, with a greater risk of lack of resolution among females and Black individuals. Targeted knowledge translation interventions are required to facilitate better outcomes.

### When to start supplementary iron to prevent iron deficiency in early childhood in sub-Saharan Africa setting [^112zJJqv]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

This study investigates the efficacy of oral ferrous fumarate, an inexpensive and readily available preparation, on preventing iron deficiency in infants in Africa.

- **Procedure**: Four-month-old infants (group 1, n = 252) and 6- to 18-month-old infants (group 2, n = 360) attending four primary health care centers (PHCs) for vaccination and well-child visits in Benin were studied. Additionally, 96 pregnant women over 36 weeks gestational age attending the same PHCs during the study period were also assessed. Infants received a 2-month supplementation with oral powdered generic ferrous fumarate (GFF), at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day of elemental iron, administered twice daily. They were re-evaluated 2 months later for hematological indices. The prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency among pregnant women was assessed using hematological indices and transferrin saturation.

- **Results**: The prevalence of anemia was found to be 42.0% in group 1, 61.9% in group 2, and 37.5% among pregnant women. All anemic pregnant women were iron deficient. Hemoglobin levels shifted towards higher values after supplementation. Moreover, 24 infants from group 1, whose mothers interrupted the treatment, showed a significant decrease in hemoglobin levels, followed by similar improvement after two additional months of supplementation.

- **Conclusion**: Programs aiming to prevent iron deficiency in Africa should utilize inexpensive iron preparations, commence during pregnancy, continue in infants starting at 3 months of age, and address issues of noncompliance.

### VAFSEO [^115WRUmV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pre-treatment and on-treatment evaluations of anemia, iron stores, and liver tests**: Correct and exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before the initiation of VAFSEO. Evaluate iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy. Measure hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and as recommended in section 2.4.

	- **Liver testing**: Measure serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin prior to the initiation of VAFSEO and monthly after initiation for the first 6 months, then monitor as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Discontinue VAFSEO if there are persistent ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or if ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times ULN are accompanied by a bilirubin increase greater than 2 times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g/dL. VAFSEO can be taken with or without food. It should be swallowed whole; tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed. VAFSEO can be administered without regard to the timing or type of diet.

### Adapting iron dose supplementation in pregnancy for greater effectiveness on mother and child health: protocol of the ECLIPSES randomized clinical trial [^112653gH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

This visit will take place only in case of the participant's withdrawal from the study at any time outside the scheduled timetable. The exact date and reason for discontinuation will be registered. If possible, the healthcare professional will assess the woman's health status via clinical history notes and an ultrasound. A blood sample will be solicited for routine tests. The adherence to the iron supplementation up until the discontinuation of the treatment will be recorded, as will any adverse events. All the questionnaires will be filled in, including: FFQ, IPAQ, STAI, Fagerstrom_Q. In case of having given birth, all the variables related to delivery and the newborn will be collected and a questionnaire on post-partum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; EPDS) and the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) will be applied.

- **Primary outcomes**: Principal variables in the pregnancy are iron status of the mother at each clinical visit (anemia, ferropenic anemia, risk of hemoconcentration) and birth weight of the baby.

- **Definition of main outcome variables**: Anemia is defined as Hb 130 g/L in the 2nd and 3rd trimester.

- **Participant timeline**: Clinical follow-up of the pregnancy in the PCC will be according to the program set by ASSIR. The participant timeline is detailed in Figure 1.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^113jDSob]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Follow-up and reIDA:

- **Hb levels**: Hb levels normalize with iron replacement therapy (IRT) in most cases of IDA, but IDA recurs in a minority of these on long-term follow-up (evidence quality — low, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

- **Long-term IRT**: We recommend that long-term IRT may be an appropriate strategy when the cause of reIDA is unknown or irreversible (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

- **Monitoring blood count**: After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect reIDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

IDA should be treated with IRT as detailed in the Treatment section, and if the initial investigation reveals the cause, it should obviously be addressed as appropriate. However, the majority of individuals presenting with unexplained IDA will have negative BDE, no evidence of CD, no other symptoms, and a complete and sustained hematological response to IRT. In this situation, the outlook is generally favorable, and there is no need for further investigation other than a periodic blood count after completion of IRT to check for reIDA. In an era of limited resources, we would suggest checks at perhaps 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

Further investigation is warranted if there is any evidence of active undiagnosed pathology. Pointers to this possibility include symptoms such as ongoing weight loss or chronic unexplained diarrhea, persistently elevated inflammatory markers, and persistent…

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^114Wx4vx]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits versus harms of screening.

Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age.

- **Normocytic anemia**: This may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function.

- **Macrocytic anemia**: Although uncommon in children, macrocytic anemia warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

### The impact of different doses of oral iron supplementation during pregnancy: a pilot randomized trial [^113PW9kA]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

Oral iron is a first-line medication for iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. We conducted a pilot randomized trial to investigate the impact of different doses of oral iron supplementation started early in pregnancy on women without anemia, focusing on four main outcomes: recruitment and protocol compliance, adherence, maintenance of maternal hemoglobin, and side effects.

At antenatal clinic visits, participants were allocated to one of three trial arms in a 1:1:1 ratio: 200 mg ferrous sulfate daily, alternate days, or three times per week. The participants were followed to delivery. Baseline characteristics of 300 recruited participants were well-matched between trial arms. The mean proportion of tablets taken as expected per participant was 82.5% overall, with 72.3%, 89.6%, and 84.5% for the daily, alternate days, and three times a week arms, respectively.

There was a lower overall adherence rate in the daily arm (47%) compared to the alternate days (62%) and the three times per week (61%) arms. A reduction in hemoglobin between randomization and 28 weeks' gestation seemed smaller for the daily arm. A range of side effects were commonly reported at baseline before starting the interventions and at later antenatal visits. Many side effects of iron overlapped with normal pregnancy symptoms.

A daily iron dosing schedule might provide the best opportunity for delivering an adequate iron load during pregnancy in women without anemia. Further randomized trials powered on clinical outcomes are needed to establish the clinical effectiveness of oral iron supplementation to prevent iron deficiency anemia.

- **Important dosing information**:

	- **Evaluation of iron stores and nutritional factors**: Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

	- **Monitoring of response to therapy**: Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc) before initiating RETACRIT. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

	- **Selection of formulation**: In pregnant women, lactating women, neonates, and infants, use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.4)].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease**: In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of RETACRIT sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the associated risks.

### Adapting iron dose supplementation in pregnancy for greater effectiveness on mother and child health: Protocol of the ECLIPSES randomized clinical trial [^115yttmC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Our hypotheses are that:

- **In women without anemia at the start of pregnancy**: With normal hemoglobin values between 110–130 g/L, an iron intake of 40 or 80 mg/day, depending on initial serum ferritin levels and the presence of genetic alterations in the HFE gene, would be more effective in preventing iron deficiency without increasing the risk of hemoconcentration by the end of pregnancy. This would help optimize mother-child health status.

- **In women without anemia and with normal-high hemoglobin values of > 130 g/L**: An iron intake of 20 or 40 mg/day, depending on initial serum ferritin levels and the presence of genetic alterations in the HFE gene, will be more effective in ameliorating the risk of hemoconcentration by the end of the pregnancy without leading to iron deficiency.

The objective of the study is to determine the best grade of effectiveness on mother-newborn health status, of an iron supplement adapted to the hemoglobin levels at the start of the pregnancy, relative to the usually prescribed dose.

### When should iron supplementation in dialysis patients be avoided, minimized or withdrawn [^116KYVpt]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Low credibility.

Most hepatologists avoid iron therapy (both oral and parenteral) in HCV-infected patients without kidney disease to prevent an increase in viral replication, aggravation of histological lesions, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), it is impossible to withhold iron supplementation due to inevitable blood loss, which results in depletion of iron stores and severe iron deficiency. Thus, iron replacement should be used cautiously and with careful monitoring in HCV-infected ESRD patients. It was recently proposed to employ a minimalist Japanese strategy in such cases of iron therapy.

The Japanese Society for Dialysis, concerned about iron overload, proposed as early as 2011 that minimal intravenous (IV) iron (up to 650 mg during the induction phase) should be given to hemodialysis patients only in cases of true iron deficiency, when ferritin is less than 100 µg/L. They also warned against maintenance IV iron therapy. This careful strategy of iron repletion allowed for adequate hemoglobin levels with low ferritin and moderate transferrin saturation without any detrimental effect on survival and was again advocated this year for Japanese dialysis populations.

### Complex anemia in tuberculosis: The need to consider causes and timing when designing interventions [^1155ckre]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Anemia is common in tuberculosis, and multiple etiologies necessitate targeted interventions. The proportion of iron-responsive anemia due to iron deficiency compared with iron-unresponsive anemia due to impaired iron absorption or redistribution from tuberculosis-associated immune activation or inflammation is unknown. This uncertainty impedes the selection of safe and effective treatment and appropriate intervention timing.

- **Methods**: Baseline hemoglobin, ferritin, hepcidin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and transferrin were measured in 45 patients with confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (cases), 47 tuberculin skin test (TST)-positive controls, and 39 TST-negative controls in The Gambia. Tuberculosis cases were additionally followed 2 and 6 months after tuberculosis treatment initiation. Mutually exclusive anemia categories based on iron biomarker concentrations were iron deficiency anemia (IDA), anemia of inflammation (AI), and multifactorial anemia (IDA+AI).

- **Results**: Anemia was more frequent in tuberculosis cases (67%) than in TST-positive (36%) or TST-negative (21%) controls. AI was the predominant anemia at tuberculosis diagnosis, declining from 36% to 8% after 6 months of treatment; however, a corresponding reduction was not evident for anemia with iron-responsive components (IDA, IDA+AI). Iron biomarkers discriminated between active tuberculosis and TST-positive or TST-negative controls, as well as between active untreated and treated tuberculosis. This was most noticeable for hepcidin, which decreased from a median of 84.0 ng/mL at diagnosis to 9.7 ng/mL after 2 months.

Limitations of the review:

- **Patient involvement**: This review was inspired by the author's encounters with patients in primary care, highlighting the importance of the topic. However, patients were not specifically involved in the design and interpretation of the study, which means outcomes important to patients might have been missed. For example, we focused on once-daily iron intake as it is the most common dosing regimen; however, this may not align with real-world preferences. This limitation was partially mitigated by including all reported outcomes from included studies, but future research should be co-designed with patients.

- **Ethical obligations**: Researchers had an ethical obligation to treat participants in the control group if they became anaemic during the trial. Some studies excluded these participants, artificially increasing the control groups' haemoglobin. Other studies analyzed these participants in their original group, which may have obscured differences between control and intervention groups. Consequently, our analysis may underestimate both the benefits and harms of iron supplementation, though this effect is probably less important given the high variability observed between studies.

- **Methodological heterogeneity**: To maximize the quantity of data included in this review, a wide range of studies were incorporated. This introduced methodological heterogeneity, with substantial differences in variables such as dose, duration, and authors' definitions of anaemia. These differences may have altered the true effect of intervention in each study, so the combined effect estimate may not correspond to a clinical reality.

### The complex relationship between iron status and anemia in pregnant and postpartum women in India: Analysis of two Indian study cohorts of uncomplicated pregnancies [^113JDYBZ]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Low credibility.

In India and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), low hemoglobin in pregnancy is used as an indication for iron supplementation and treatment, although anemia and iron deficiency do not completely overlap. Our study demonstrates this and shows that low hemoglobin is not a useful indicator of iron deficiency anemia. There is a need to measure iron biomarkers to ascertain the need for supplementation and treatment. Non-anemic iron deficiency has been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes in non-pregnant populations. If based on hemoglobin measurement only, pregnant women who are iron deficient but not anemic are not treated for iron deficiency, this would put them at greater risk of developing anemia later and could increase the risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Conversely, others who are anemic but not iron deficient are being unnecessarily supplemented, putting them at risk of being exposed to excess iron.

Ineffective erythropoiesis is observed in hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia, hereditary sideroblastic anemias, and certain myelodysplastic syndromes, in which anemia is associated with iron overload. The latter results from increased iron absorption and mobilization of iron from the stores mediated by relative hepcidin deficiency. A significant proportion of our study population with high ferritin had abnormal hemoglobin types (35% in the antenatal and 41% in the postnatal cohort). Therefore, these conditions should be investigated before treating women with iron, assuming that the observed anemia is due to iron deficiency.

Hepcidin levels are known to increase dramatically.

### The benefits of iron supplementation following blood donation vary with baseline iron status [^112JyXXN]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Whole blood donation rapidly removes approximately 10% of a donor's blood volume and stimulates substantial changes in iron metabolism and erythropoiesis. We sought to identify donors who benefit from iron supplementation, describe the nature of the benefit, and define the time course for recovery from donation. Blood samples were collected over 24 weeks following whole blood donation from 193 participants, with 96 participants randomized to 37.5 mg daily oral iron.

- **Modeling iron changes**: Changes in total body, red blood cell (RBC), and storage iron, hepcidin, erythropoietin, and reticulocyte count were modeled using semiparametric curves in a mixed model. The changes were compared among six groups defined by baseline ferritin (< 12, 12–50, ≥ 50 ng/mL) and iron supplementation.

- **Findings on ferritin levels**: The effect of oral iron on storage and RBC iron recovery was minimal in donors with baseline ferritin ≥ 50 ng/mL but sizeable when ferritin was < 50 ng/mL. Iron initially absorbed went to RBC and storage iron pools when ferritin was < 12 ng/mL but went mostly to RBCs when ferritin was ≥ 12 ng/mL. Donors with ferritin ≥ 12 ng/mL had a "ripple" increase in reticulocytes approximately 100 days after donation, indicating physiological responses occur months following donation.

Thus, iron supplements markedly enhance recovery from whole blood donation in donors with ferritin < 50 ng/mL. However, full recovery from donation requires over 100 days when taking iron. The findings also highlight the value of studying blood donors for understanding human hemoglobin and iron metabolism, and their usefulness for future studies as additional biomarkers are discovered.

### Oral iron supplementation after blood donation: a randomized clinical trial [^116DWek1]. JAMA (2015). High credibility.

Although blood donation is allowed every 8 weeks in the United States, the recovery of hemoglobin to the currently accepted standard (12.5 g/dL) is frequently delayed, and some donors become anemic.

- **Objective**: To determine the effect of oral iron supplementation on hemoglobin recovery time (measured as days to recovery of 80% of hemoglobin removed) and recovery of iron stores in iron-depleted ("low ferritin", ≤ 26 ng/mL) and iron-replete ("higher ferritin", > 26 ng/mL) blood donors.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a randomized, nonblinded clinical trial of blood donors stratified by ferritin level, sex, and age, conducted in four regional blood centers in the United States in 2012. The study included 215 eligible participants aged 18 to 79 years who had not donated whole blood or red blood cells within the past four months.

- **Interventions**: Participants received either one tablet of ferrous gluconate (37.5 mg of elemental iron) daily or no iron for 24 weeks (168 days) after donating a unit of whole blood (500 mL).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes measured were the time to recovery of 80% of the post-donation decrease in hemoglobin and the recovery of ferritin level to baseline as an indicator of iron stores.

- **Results**: The mean baseline hemoglobin levels were comparable between the iron and no-iron groups. In the low-ferritin group, hemoglobin declined from a mean (SD) of 13.4 (1.1) g/dL to 12.0 (1.2) g/dL after donation. In the higher-ferritin group, hemoglobin decreased from 14.2 (1.1) g/dL to 12.9 (1.2) g/dL. Compared with participants who did not receive iron supplementation, those who did receive supplementation had a shortened time to 80% hemoglobin recovery in both the low-ferritin and higher-ferritin groups.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^111f7YBB]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

- **Case descriptions**: Existing literature predominantly addresses treatment outcomes in children with iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia (IRIDA), while adults have distinct clinical needs and presentations, as illustrated in cases from our iron expertise centre. These cases provide insights into the pathophysiology underlying treatment variability, highlighting the need for individualized approaches in both adults and children.

- **Case 1**: The course of haemoglobin, ferritin, and TSAT levels in three female IRIDA patients shows specific trends. For this patient, Hb and iron metrics were observed over six years. Initially, IV iron therapy was administered at irregular intervals due to being lost to follow-up. At age 26, six years post-diagnosis (time point t = 0), regular IV iron therapy was initiated. Over the subsequent years, she received a cumulative dose of 2500 mg of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) via five 500 mg infusions, resulting in a sharp rise in ferritin (> 900 μg/L) and TSAT (up to 25%). Despite persistently high ferritin (> 700 μg/L), Hb only briefly peaked and remained within the lower normal range.

- **Case 2**: The patient's Hb and iron metrics were tracked over four years, which included two pregnancies (indicated by horizontal bars in Figure 2 [not shown]). At diagnosis (t = 0), the 32-year-old patient began monthly IV iron therapy. After accumulating a dose of 1700 mg FCM, the patient unknowingly became pregnant at the time of the last administration. During the first pregnancy, TSAT remained stable, and the Hb decrease was less pronounced than during non-pregnancy periods.

- **Case 3**: Over a period of 20 years, the patient's Hb, CRP, and iron metrics were monitored. Regular IV iron administration contributed to maintaining these parameters effectively.

### Randomized controlled trial of 2 prenatal iron supplements: Is there a dose-response relation with maternal hemoglobin [^1154Gou2]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). High credibility.

The most appropriate dose of iron to prevent maternal anemia remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the dose-response relation between maternal hemoglobin and two prenatal iron supplements.

- **Design**: An intention-to-treat, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted in rural Burkina Faso. It compared 30 mg of iron with folic acid and 13 other micronutrients (UNIMMAP; UNICEF/WHO/UNU multiple micronutrient supplement for pregnant and lactating women) to 60 mg of iron with folic acid (IFA) only. Home visitors directly observed tablet intake, and mixed-effects models were used for data analysis.

- **Results**: At inclusion, 43.2% of the 1268 participants were anemic. On average, hemoglobin concentration decreased over gestation in both the IFA and UNIMMAP groups by 0.019 g/dL per week (95% CI: 0.012, 0.025 g/dL). An increment in hemoglobin concentration per micronutrient tablet [β (± SE) = 0.006 ± 0.001 g/dL; P < 0.0001] was observed only in women who were anemic at inclusion, whereas a decrease was observed in other mothers (-0.003 ± 0.001 g/dL; P = 0.002, P for interaction < 0.0001). This finding was consistent across both the IFA and UNIMMAP groups. Women with baseline anemia achieved the same hemoglobin concentration (mean ± SD: 11.1 ± 0.64 g/dL) as their counterparts who received ± 180 tablets of either UNIMMAP or IFA. Despite this, micronutrient intake did not significantly prevent anemia (51.0% in the third trimester) but was a risk factor for hemoconcentration (odds ratio per tertile of tablet intake: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.12, 3.94), independent of supplement type or initial hemoglobin levels.

### Effects of daily iron supplementation in 2- to 5-year-old children: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117V7sKv]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common cause of anemia worldwide, with the prevalence highest among preschool-aged children. Iron is widely administered to children with or at risk for ID, but evidence of benefit among 2- to 5-year-old children has not been evaluated by systematic review. We summarize the evidence for the benefit and safety of daily iron supplementation with regard to hematologic, growth, and cognitive parameters in 2- to 5-year-olds.

- **Methods**: Electronic databases, regional databases, thesis repositories, gray literature, and references of studies and previous reviews were searched. We included randomized controlled trials that compared daily oral iron supplementation with control in 2- to 5-year-olds. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to synthesize predefined outcomes reported by at least two studies.

- **Results**: Out of 9169 references, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, none of which were at low risk of bias. Children receiving iron supplementation had a mean endpoint hemoglobin of 6.97 g/L (P < .00001; I(2) = 82%) greater than controls, whereas mean endpoint ferritin was 11.64 µg/L (P < .0001; I(2) = 48%) greater. No trials reported the effects of iron supplementation on ID or iron deficiency anemia, and only one reported on anemia. Limited evidence suggested that iron supplementation produced a small improvement in cognitive development but had no effect on physical growth.

- **Conclusions**: In 2- to 5-year-olds, daily iron supplementation increases hemoglobin and ferritin. There is a concerning lack of data on the effect of iron.

### Anemia, iron deficiency, and iron supplementation in relation to mortality among HIV-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy in Tanzania [^1164NiRw]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Low credibility.

Anemia in HIV-infected patients improves with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART); however, it may still be associated with mortality among patients receiving treatment. We examined the associations of anemia severity and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) at HAART initiation and during monthly prospective follow-up with mortality among 40,657 adult HIV-infected patients receiving HAART in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations of anemia severity and IDA at HAART initiation and during follow-up with mortality. A total of 6,261 deaths were reported.

Anemia severity at HAART initiation and during follow-up was associated with an increasing risk of mortality (trend tests P < 0.001). There was significantly higher mortality risk associated with IDA at HAART initiation and during follow-up versus no anemia or iron deficiency (both P < 0.001). These associations differed significantly by gender, body mass index, and iron supplement use (all interaction test P < 0.001). The magnitude of association was stronger among men.

Mortality risk with severe anemia was 13 times greater versus no anemia among obese patients, whereas it was only two times greater among underweight patients. Higher mortality risk was observed among iron supplement users, irrespective of anemia severity. Anemia and IDA were significantly associated with a higher mortality risk in patients receiving HAART. Iron supplementation indicated an increased mortality risk, and its role in HIV infections should be examined in future studies.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^114rZfZL]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the 2015 ECCO guidelines recommend considering the initiation of oral iron supplementation in patients with clinically inactive IBD and mild anemia, provided they are not intolerant to oral iron.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117W6VWK]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The goal of iron supplementation should always be complete normalization of hemoglobin (Hb) and iron storage. It should be kept in mind that even after normalization of Hb levels, iron storage is still not replenished because anemia is only the endpoint of iron deficiency. Iron treatments should be followed up clinically and using laboratory tests at least within 4 weeks in asymptomatic patients and more frequently in symptomatic patients. An important surveillance factor is the well-being of the patient. Clinically, quality of life (QoL) can improve within a few days after the initiation of iron therapy and previous symptoms of anemia may decrease.

An adequate erythropoietic response has been defined as an increase of Hb of at least 2 g/dl or normalization within 4 weeks. As described previously, reticulocyte count and reticulocyte production index are faster parameters of successful treatment and will increase within 1–2 weeks following oral or intravenous iron with or without erythropoietin (EPO).

Iron storage can be assessed using ferritin and transferrin saturation. During oral or intravenous iron supplementation, transferrin saturation can be falsely elevated. Ferritin levels also overestimate the iron available for erythropoiesis in the bone marrow during intravenous iron treatment. Therefore, assessment of iron storage should only be performed a minimum of 4 weeks after the last intravenous iron application. After the termination of iron therapy, the parameters of iron storage should be above the lower limits of normal. A recent study has pointed out that the time until reoccurrence of iron deficiency may vary depending on the patient's initial condition.

For pregnant patients with iron deficiency anemia, the RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend initiating a trial of oral iron supplementation as first-line therapy in cases of normocytic or microcytic anemia. If there is no demonstrable rise in hemoglobin at 2 weeks, and compliance has been assured, further testing should be obtained.

### Iron status during pregnancy: Setting the stage for mother and infant [^113osqLy]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Supplementation with iron is generally recommended during pregnancy to meet the iron needs of both mother and fetus. When detected early in pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with a more than twofold increase in the risk of preterm delivery. Maternal anemia, when diagnosed before midpregnancy, is also associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. Results of recent randomized clinical trials in the United States and in Nepal, which involved early supplementation with iron, showed some reduction in the risk of low birth weight or preterm low birth weight but not preterm delivery.

During the third trimester, maternal anemia usually is not associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and may be an indicator of an expanded maternal plasma volume. High levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin are associated with an increased risk of fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and preeclampsia. While iron supplementation increases maternal iron status and stores, factors that underlie adverse pregnancy outcomes are considered to result in this association, not iron supplements.

On the other hand, iron supplements and increased iron stores have recently been linked to maternal complications (e.g. gestational diabetes) and increased oxidative stress during pregnancy. Consequently, while iron supplementation may improve pregnancy outcomes when the mother is iron deficient, it is also possible that prophylactic supplementation may increase risk when the mother does not have iron deficiency or IDA. Anemia and IDA are not synonymous, even among low-income minorities.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^1123nFSh]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

We check for nutritional deficiencies with iron studies and vitamin B12 and folate levels, keeping in mind the following caveats: iron deficiency often reflects bleeding rather than true nutritional deficiency; low B12 does not establish B12-deficient anemia without correction after B12 treatment; and folate deficiency is rare, prompting some clinicians to omit it unless risk factors are identified. In addition, serum folate levels may reflect recent dietary intake of folate, which may be from a variety of sources such as fortified foods or supplements. RBC folate is more reflective of long-term folate status; however, methods and reference ranges vary in each laboratory and testing is not widely available in every laboratory. Finally, we check thyroid studies and eGFR and perform a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. Such studies facilitate determination of other causes of anemia that may be contributory, such as hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, or anemia of inflammation, respectively.

For stable mild anemia, we do not recommend routine bone marrow (BM) biopsy. If there are "red flag signs", which include MCV > 96 fL, additional cytopenias (absolute neutrophil count < 1000 cells per μL and/or platelets < 120 × 10⁹/L), family history of blood cancers, dysplasia or blasts on peripheral smear, or severe (hemoglobin < 9 g/dL) or worsening unexplained anemia, we generally perform a BM aspirate and biopsy. Careful morphologic inspection should be supplemented by cytogenetics with or without fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutational studies to differentiate potential underlying conditions.

### Mircera [^115jdb58]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will require supplemental iron during the course of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy.

- **Monitoring of response to therapy**: Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc) before initiating Mircera. Following the initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion.

- **Individualization of dosing**: Individualize and use the lowest dose of Mircera sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL for adult patients. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse events.
