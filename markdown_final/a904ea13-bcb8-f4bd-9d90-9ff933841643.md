## Question

When to treat mixed hyperlipidemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to treat mixed hyperlipidemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining mixed hyperlipidemia and confirming diagnostic thresholds. Then, I should verify the overarching treatment principle and risk stratification. Next, I will examine lifestyle-first management and when to escalate to pharmacotherapy. After that, I need to check first-line drug choices, second-line combinations, and special populations. Finally, I should review monitoring, safety, and synthesize a practical decision framework with explicit triggers for treatment and targets to aim for.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic thresholds so I don't anchor on the wrong phenotype. Mixed hyperlipidemia is concurrent elevation of triglycerides and LDL-C, with the National Lipid Association noting that when triglycerides exceed roughly 300–400 mg/dL, impaired VLDL-to-LDL conversion can mask LDL-C and complicate interpretation, so non–HDL-C becomes particularly important in that context [^116Qcsi5]. I should also remember that apoB ≥ 120 mg/dL with TG ≥ 133 mg/dL aligns with the Fredrickson IIb pattern and familial combined hyperlipidemia, which reinforces the concept of cumulative atherogenic particle burden beyond LDL-C alone [^114QKxJb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment intensity before I establish the principle. The cornerstone is that therapy should be proportional to absolute cardiovascular risk, with LDL-C lowering as the primary driver of benefit and non–HDL-C as a key secondary target, especially in mixed dyslipidemia where remnant lipoproteins contribute to risk [^116NJinJ] [^116Qcsi5]. I need to ensure I apply risk categories correctly: high risk generally warrants at least a 50% LDL-C reduction and on-treatment LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, while very high risk targets < 55 mg/dL, and non–HDL-C is typically targeted about 30 mg/dL above the LDL-C goal in line with guideline logic [^116NJinJ] [^111tgRQW].

> Next, I should review lifestyle therapy as first-line and verify how long to trial it before escalating. Therapeutic lifestyle changes, including diet, weight loss, exercise, alcohol moderation, and glycemic optimization, are foundational and should be initiated in all patients, with a reasonable trial of about 3 months before adding drugs unless risk is very high or triglycerides are severely elevated, in which case earlier pharmacotherapy is justified [^115DtLXC] [^116Qcsi5]. Wait, let me verify the pancreatitis threshold: fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL warrant drug therapy to prevent pancreatitis even if ASCVD risk is not yet high, so I should not delay treatment in that scenario [^114QPd75].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacotherapy, and I need to ensure I don't overcomplicate this. Statins are first-line to lower LDL-C and non–HDL-C, with selection and dose matched to risk and percent-reduction goals; moderate-intensity statins typically reduce LDL-C by 30–49% and high-intensity by ≥ 50%, and statins also modestly lower triglycerides and raise HDL-C, which helps in mixed dyslipidemia [^116NJinJ] [^115TFjF7]. Let me double-check the magnitude of TG effect: atorvastatin and rosuvastatin can reduce triglycerides by roughly 15–30% depending on baseline and dose, which is clinically meaningful in many patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^115TFjF7] [^113mnzmN].

> But wait, what if LDL-C or non–HDL-C goals are not met on maximally tolerated statin, or statin intolerance limits dose? I should confirm the sequence of add-on therapy. Ezetimibe is the preferred second agent because it provides an additional ~20–25% LDL-C reduction with a favorable safety profile and is guideline-endorsed for patients who do not reach targets on statins or cannot tolerate higher-intensity statins [^116DRwdN] [^1166TWF4]. I need to check the evidence base: multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show consistent LDL-C lowering when ezetimibe is added to statins, supporting its role as first-line add-on in mixed dyslipidemia when LDL-C remains above goal [^113DbuBg].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of PCSK9 inhibitors and when they are appropriate. In very high-risk patients who fail to achieve LDL-C goals on statin ± ezetimibe, or who are statin-intolerant, PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies such as alirocumab or evolocumab reduce LDL-C by about 60–75% and are reasonable to add, with ODYSSEY and LAPLACE-2 demonstrating robust LDL-C and non–HDL-C reductions in mixed dyslipidemia populations, including those with diabetes [^116oACdb] [^11187jNq]. Let me reconsider cost and access: while highly effective, PCSK9 inhibitors are generally reserved for high or very high risk with persistent LDL-C elevation despite optimized therapy due to expense and long-term outcomes considerations [^114QPd75].

> I need to check the role of fibrates, especially for persistent triglyceride elevation despite statin therapy. Fenofibrate or fenofibric acid can be added to a statin to address high triglycerides and low HDL-C, with pooled analyses showing greater improvements in HDL-C and triglycerides versus statin alone, though outcome benefits are mixed overall and most pronounced in subgroups with high TG and low HDL-C, such as the ACCORD-Lipid subgroup with TG ≥ 204 mg/dL and HDL-C ≤ 34 mg/dL [^1175Zws4] [^114QPd75]. I should confirm safety: fenofibrate is preferred over gemfibrozil when combining with statins because gemfibrozil increases myopathy risk via CYP-mediated interactions, and meta-analyses suggest fenofibrate–statin combinations are generally well tolerated with low myopathy rates when monitored appropriately [^117K93fA] [^114QPd75].

> Let me think about omega-3 fatty acids, and I should double-check the indication and dose. For adults with triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL on statin who have ASCVD or diabetes with at least two additional risk factors, adding EPA 4 g/day reduces cardiovascular events in high-risk populations per REDUCE-IT, whereas 1 g/day mixed EPA/DHA has not shown outcome benefit in this context, so the indication is specific to high-dose EPA rather than low-dose mixed omega-3s [^1175Zws4]. I should confirm that this applies to mixed dyslipidemia with persistent triglyceride elevation after lifestyle and statin optimization, and that it complements rather than replaces LDL-C–directed therapy [^1175Zws4].

> Next, I should review special populations and make sure I don't miss important caveats. In chronic kidney disease, statins remain foundational, but fibrates require dose adjustment and careful monitoring due to myopathy risk, and ezetimibe is generally safe across CKD stages, which shapes the combination choices in mixed dyslipidemia with CKD [^116a5GxD]. In diabetes, mixed dyslipidemia is common and non–HDL-C is a better risk marker; intensifying statin therapy and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibition when needed is aligned with risk-based strategies, and fenofibrate may be considered for persistent high TG/low HDL-C after statin optimization, acknowledging modest outcome data and the need for renal caution [^116NJinJ] [^114QPd75]. For severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL), I should prioritize pancreatitis prevention with a fibrate or high-dose EPA and address secondary causes before layering additional therapies [^114QPd75].

> I should confirm monitoring and safety protocols so we catch adverse effects early. Baseline liver enzymes, creatine kinase, and renal function should be obtained, with periodic rechecks after initiating or changing therapy, and patients counseled on myopathy symptoms; when combining a statin with a fibrate, I need to ensure we avoid gemfibrozil and monitor closely for muscle symptoms, while recognizing that fenofibrate–statin combinations have a low but real myopathy signal in meta-analyses and labels [^117K93fA] [^114QPd75]. Wait, let me verify the lab cadence: repeating lipids 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change is reasonable to titrate therapy toward LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and TG goals, with earlier checks if symptoms arise [^113AE1EV].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I should double-check that it aligns with the evidence. Treat when any of the following are present: LDL-C is above risk-stratified thresholds or the patient fails to achieve the required percent LDL-C reduction on maximally tolerated therapy; non–HDL-C remains above goal; triglycerides are ≥ 500 mg/dL (to prevent pancreatitis); or the patient is at very high cardiovascular risk where aggressive lipid lowering is indicated even with modest baseline abnormalities [^116NJinJ] [^114QPd75]. Start with lifestyle therapy for about 3 months unless triglycerides are ≥ 500 mg/dL or risk is very high, then escalate to pharmacotherapy; begin with a statin and titrate to intensity matched to risk, add ezetimibe if goals are not met or intolerance limits statin dose, consider PCSK9 inhibition in very high-risk patients who remain above LDL-C goals, and add fenofibrate or high-dose EPA for persistent triglyceride elevation or low HDL-C after statin optimization, while avoiding gemfibrozil with statins and monitoring for adverse effects [^116NJinJ] [^116DRwdN] [^116oACdb] [^114QPd75] [^1175Zws4].

> Finally, I should confirm the targets and how to operationalize them. For high risk, aim for LDL-C < 70 mg/dL and at least a 50% reduction from baseline; for very high risk, aim for LDL-C < 55 mg/dL, and use non–HDL-C goals about 30 mg/dL above the LDL-C target, with apoB < 90 mg/dL as an additional marker of atherogenic particle burden when available [^116NJinJ] [^111tgRQW]. Hold on, I should verify that these thresholds are consistent with contemporary guidance: yes, these align with EAS and related recommendations for risk-based LDL-C lowering and non–HDL-C as a secondary target in mixed dyslipidemia [^116NJinJ] [^111tgRQW].

---

Treat mixed hyperlipidemia when **LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL** [^11179jnJ], **triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL** [^114QPd75], or when **ASCVD risk is high/very high** and LDL-C is ≥ 70 mg/dL despite lifestyle therapy [^116NJinJ]. Start with **lifestyle changes** (diet, weight loss, exercise, alcohol limit) [^115DtLXC]; if goals are not met, add statins first-line [^116NJinJ], then ezetimibe [^116DRwdN], PCSK9 inhibitors [^116oACdb], or bempedoic acid [^114NJGhp] as needed. For persistent triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL on statins, add fenofibrate [^1175Zws4] or omega-3s (EPA 4 g/day) [^1175Zws4] if ASCVD risk is high. Monitor lipids every 3–6 months and adjust therapy to reach LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or < 55 mg/dL if very high risk) [^116NJinJ] and triglycerides < 150 mg/dL [^notfound].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment is indicated based on **LDL-C levels**, **triglyceride levels**, and **cardiovascular risk**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for treatment** |
|-|-|
| LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL | Immediate pharmacologic therapy [^11179jnJ] |
| Triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL | Immediate pharmacologic therapy to prevent pancreatitis [^114QPd75] |
| High or very high ASCVD risk (e.g. diabetes, established ASCVD) | Pharmacologic therapy if LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL despite lifestyle therapy [^116NJinJ] |
| Moderate ASCVD risk | Pharmacologic therapy if LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL despite lifestyle therapy [^notfound] |

---

## Initial lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes are **first-line** and should begin before or alongside pharmacotherapy:

- **Diet**: Reduce saturated fats, trans fats, refined carbs; increase soluble fiber and omega-3 intake [^116Qcsi5].
- **Weight loss**: Aim for 5–10% weight reduction if overweight/obese [^notfound].
- **Exercise**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity [^notfound].
- **Alcohol**: Limit to ≤ 1 drink/day (women) or ≤ 2 drinks/day (men) [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

### First-line therapy

Statins are **first-line** to lower LDL-C and non-HDL-C; choose intensity based on risk and tolerance [^116NJinJ].

---

### Second-line therapy

Add therapy if **LDL-C or non-HDL-C goals are not met** on maximally tolerated statins:

- **Ezetimibe**: Add to statins for additional LDL-C lowering [^113DbuBg].
- **PCSK9 inhibitors**: For very high risk or statin-intolerant patients [^116oACdb].
- **Bempedoic acid**: For additional LDL-C lowering, especially if statin-intolerant [^114NJGhp].

---

### Management of elevated triglycerides

For triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL despite statins, consider **fenofibrate** [^112hyagd] or **omega-3 fatty acids** (EPA 4 g/day) [^1175Zws4] if ASCVD risk is high.

---

## Monitoring and treatment goals

Monitor lipids every 3–6 months and adjust therapy to reach:

- **LDL-C**: < 70 mg/dL (or < 55 mg/dL if very high risk) [^116NJinJ].
- **Non-HDL-C**: < 100 mg/dL (or < 80 mg/dL if very high risk) [^111tgRQW].
- **Triglycerides**: < 150 mg/dL [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Diabetes/metabolic syndrome**: Prioritize statins; add fenofibrate or omega-3s for persistent hypertriglyceridemia [^116NJinJ] [^1175Zws4].
- **Statin intolerance**: Use ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or bempedoic acid [^116DRwdN] [^116oACdb] [^114NJGhp].
- **Severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL)**: Immediate fibrate or omega-3 therapy to prevent pancreatitis [^114QPd75].

---

Treat mixed hyperlipidemia when **LDL-C is ≥ 190 mg/dL**, **triglycerides are ≥ 500 mg/dL**, or **ASCVD risk is high/very high** and LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL despite lifestyle therapy. Start with lifestyle changes, then use statins first-line, adding ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or bempedoic acid as needed, and add fenofibrate or omega-3s for persistent triglyceride elevation. Monitor lipids every 3–6 months and titrate to LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or < 55 mg/dL if very high risk) and triglycerides < 150 mg/dL.

### Treating mixed hyperlipidemia and the atherogenic lipid phenotype for prevention of cardiovascular events [^114GqdEb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Statins reduce cardiovascular events and cardiovascular and total mortality in persons at risk for and with coronary disease, but there remains a significant residual event rate, particularly in those with the atherogenic lipid phenotype that is characterized by a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and increase in non-HDL cholesterol. Large outcome trials designed to assess the value of combining statins with other agents to target HDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol will not be completed for a few years, but there is ample evidence for the clinician to consider combination therapy. The choices for therapies to supplement statins include niacin, fibrates, and omega-3 fatty acids. We present the argument that after therapeutic lifestyle changes, the first priority should be the maximally tolerated effective dose of a potent statin. Evidence supports the addition of niacin as the second agent. In some situations, high-dose omega-3 fatty acid therapy could be the first agent added to statins. Although fibrate monotherapy alone or in combination with non-statin low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering agents can be effective in mixed hyperlipidemia when statins are not tolerated, the combination of statin+fibrate should be considered second-line therapy until the efficacy and safety are established.

### Treating mixed dyslipidemias: why and how [^113yVCci]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with only mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values but low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and/or high triglyceride levels are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (also known as statins) have been shown to slow coronary heart disease (CHD) progression, reduce CHD events in patients with low HDL-C levels, and raise HDL-C concentrations in patients with mixed dyslipidemias. Some, but not all trials of fibrates have shown benefit in patients with low HDL-C levels. Combination therapy with a statin plus either a fibrate or niacin is effective in improving the entire lipid profile, but may increase cost and side effects.

### Combination therapy in the management of mixed dyslipidaemia [^113hwVvS]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Whilst statin monotherapy is often sufficient to reach LDL-C goals, treatment may not reach all lipid goals in individuals with mixed dyslipidaemia typically associated with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes. Double or triple combination therapy, which provides the opportunity to address multiple lipid abnormalities simultaneously, may be required to achieve targets in some patients. Addition of fenofibrate or niacin (nicotinic acid) to statin therapy is likely to be the first option, as recommended by national treatment guidelines; omega-3 fatty acids may also be useful. Careful monitoring is required when adding additional agents given the increased potential for drug interactions and side effects.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^116Qcsi5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Mixed dyslipidemia — defined pattern and triglyceride threshold effects are described: The term denotes concurrent elevations in triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and familial combined hyperlipidemia is the most common type. When the TG concentration exceeds ~300–400 mg/dL, conversion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) to LDL in circulation is typically impaired; when TG is lowered in such patients, LDL-C commonly rises due to a shift from VLDL-C to LDL-C as VLDL to LDL conversion increases.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome typically exhibit atherogenic mixed dyslipidemia characterized by low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, and an increase in small, dense low-density lipoprotein particles. Treatment guidelines recognize lifestyle intervention as a first step in the management of dyslipidemia in these patients. The aim of this article is to review evidence to support this approach. To achieve all recommended lipid goals in clinical practice, lifestyle intervention is likely to be adjunctive to pharmacotherapy.

Background

National clinical treatment guidelines recommend pharmacologic treatment in addition to therapeutic lifestyle modifications in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD).

Objectives

To evaluate real-world pharmacologic treatment of mixed dyslipidemia patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.

Methods

Commercial health plan members in a large, United States managed-care database with complete lipid panel results (ie, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], total cholesterol [TC], triglycerides [TG]) between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006 were included. Mixed dyslipidemia was defined as any two nonoptimal lipid parameters (LDL-C, HDL-C, TG) according to National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Subjects were observed for 182 days pre-index to determine CVD risk factors (ie, male aged 45+ years, female 55+ years, CHD history, hypertension, diabetes mellitus). Lipid treatment status 6 months pre- and post-index dates was determined using pharmacy claims for any lipid monotherapy (statin, fibrate, niacin, "other"), or combination therapy (statin + fenofibrate; statin + niacin; statin + other).

Results

Lipid treatment increased post-index for all mixed dyslipidemia groups and by total number of risk factors. The increased LDL-C and low HDL-C group had the lowest treatment rates; the group with low HDL-C and elevated TG had the highest. In the latter group, when treated, primarily statin monotherapy (51%) was used post-index; only 26% received niacin or fibrate therapy targeting HDL-C or TG abnormalities. Across all mixed dyslipidemia patients, > 30% with three to four CVD risk factors were not treated ≥ 6 months post-index.

Conclusions

In real-world clinical practice, pharmacologic treatment rates increased upon assessment of multiple lipid abnormalities and by total risk factors for CHD. However, mixed dyslipidemia remained undertreated with low rates of niacin and fibrate usage.

### A review of the current status of the management of mixed dyslipidemia associated with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome [^1119bsBi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Current treatment guidelines recommend lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with a statin as the primary lipid-modifying intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. However, even with high-dose statin therapy or the combination of statin plus ezetimibe, many patients remain at substantial risk of a cardiovascular event. Increasingly, there is recognition of the importance of treating all components of the atherogenic dyslipidemic profile associated with both conditions, specifically low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated triglyceride levels, in addition to lowering LDL cholesterol. Both niacin (nicotinic acid) and fibrates are recommended as options for combination with a statin in this setting. Data from ongoing prospective outcomes studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these combinations.

### Interaction between primary hyperlipidemias and type 2 diabetes: therapeutic implications [^116NJinJ]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic Implications

Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia

Treatment of mixed hyperlipidemia should achieve a significant lowering of LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and apoB. As mentioned above, the coexistence of FCHL and T2D implies the categorization of cases at least as a high risk status (according to the European Atherosclerosis Society). Intermediate-risk patients with diabetes (i.e. young type 2 diabetes cases with a time since diagnosis lower than 10 years, free of chronic complications) should be considered as a high-risk status because of the coexistence of FCHL. Cases with ten or more years of exposure to hyperglycemia or with one or more chronic complications should be considered as a very high-risk status. As guidelines recommend, patients at high risk need to achieve a 50% LDL-C decrement compared to the baseline concentrations and a during therapy LDL-C level < 70 mg/dl. The same recommendation applies for the very high-risk cases, but the on-therapy LDL-C should be below 55 mg/dl. The main first-line therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk should be statins, and if goals are not attained, the addition of a combined therapy with ezetimibe, PCSK9i, bempedoic acid, or inclisiran should be considered. In cases with a non-HDL-C > 220 mg/dl, a statin/ezetimibe combination should be considered as initial therapy. If there is a persistence of TG > 200 mg/dl despite dietary therapy, a fibrate or eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester should be added, although its capability to reduce CVD is controversial.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^115rfmgz]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Dyslipidemia is an important and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. In particular, elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels, are strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events. According to the meta‐analysis, the lowering of LDL‐C by about 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) with statin regimens safely reduced the major coronary events about a 23%. Consequently, lipid‐lowering therapies are key components in the prevention and treatment of CVD.

Hydroxymethylglutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely prescribed for their effectiveness in reducing LDL‐C levels and improving cardiovascular outcomes. Importantly, aggressive LDL‐C lowering has been shown to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, reduce inflammation, and ultimately prevent clinical events. However, despite the proven efficacy of statins, some patients do not achieve their target LDL‐C levels or experience side effects associated with higher doses. The most common adverse effects of high‐intensity statins include myopathy, an increased risk of hepatotoxicity, and new‐onset diabetes.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Mixed dyslipidemia: 135 mg once daily (2.2).
Hypertriglyceridemia: 45 to 135 mg once daily (2.3).
Renally impaired patients: 45 mg once daily (2.5).
Maximum dose: 135 mg once daily (2.1).
May be taken without regard to food (2.1).
May be taken at the same time as a statin (2.2).
Co-administration with the maximum dose of a statin has not been evaluated in clinical studies and should be avoided unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks (2.2).

2.1 General Considerations

Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving Trilipix as monotherapy or co-administered with a statin [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2, 2.3 and 2.4)], and should continue this diet during treatment. Trilipix delayed release capsules can be taken without regard to meals. Serum lipids should be monitored periodically. The maximum dose is 135 mg once daily.

2.2 Co-administration Therapy with Statins for the Treatment of Mixed Dyslipidemia

Trilipix 135 mg may be co-administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. For convenience, the daily dose of Trilipix may be taken at the same time as a statin, according to the dosing recommendations for each medication. Co-administration with the maximum dose of a statin has not been evaluated in clinical studies and should be avoided unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks.

2.3 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

The initial dose of Trilipix is 45 to 135 mg once daily. Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals. The maximum dose is 135 mg once daily.

2.4 Primary Hyperlipidemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

The dose of Trilipix is 135 mg once daily.

2.5 Impaired Renal Function

Treatment with Trilipix should be initiated at a dose of 45 mg once daily in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and should only be increased after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose. The use of Trilipix should be avoided in patients with severely impaired renal function.

2.6 Elderly Patients

Dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.5)].

### Fenofibric acid (trilipix) [^1157txDr]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

1.1 Co-administration Therapy with Statins for the Treatment of Mixed Dyslipidemia

Trilipix is indicated as an adjunct to diet in combination with a statin to reduce TG and increase HDL-C in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and CHD or a CHD risk equivalent who are on optimal statin therapy to achieve their LDL-C goal.

CHD risk equivalents comprise:

Other clinical forms of atherosclerotic disease (peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and symptomatic carotid artery disease);
Diabetes;
Multiple risk factors that confer a 10-year risk for CHD > 20%

1.2 Treatment of Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

Trilipix is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce TG in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacological intervention. Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. > 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of Trilipix therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

1.3 Treatment of Primary Hyperlipidemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

Trilipix is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, TG, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

1.4 Important Limitations of Use

No incremental benefit of Trilipix on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for statin monotherapy has been established. Fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 135 mg of Trilipix was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in 2 large, randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

1.5 General Considerations for Treatment

Laboratory studies should be performed to establish that lipid levels are abnormal before instituting Trilipix therapy.

Every reasonable attempt should be made to control serum lipids with non-drug methods including appropriate diet, exercise, weight loss in obese patients, and control of any medical problems such as diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism that may be contributing to the lipid abnormalities. Medications known to exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia (beta-blockers, thiazides, estrogens) should be discontinued or changed if possible, and excessive alcohol intake should be addressed before triglyceride-lowering drug therapy is considered. If the decision is made to use lipid-altering drugs, the patient should be instructed that this does not reduce the importance of adhering to diet.

Drug therapy is not indicated for patients who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of VLDL.

### Statins as the cornerstone of drug therapy for dyslipidemia: monotherapy and combination therapy options [^111G8mpH]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction with statin treatment remains the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy to reduce risk of coronary heart disease. Combination therapy with a statin poses advantages in certain settings and may allow use of lower doses of multiple drugs rather than maximum doses of a single drug. Bile-acid sequestrants or the cholesterol-absorption inhibitor ezetimibe can be added to a statin to achieve greater LDL cholesterol reductions. Niacin or fenofibrate can be added to a statin for treatment of mixed dyslipidemia. Differences in statin efficacy in reducing LDL cholesterol and meeting recommended LDL cholesterol targets as well as differences among these agents in beneficial effects on other lipid parameters can affect whether and how these agents are prescribed in monotherapy and combination therapy.

### Management of mixed dyslipidemia in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease: a role for combination fibrate therapy [^115iNd1y]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the primary focus of the management of dyslipidemia in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease. However, use of a statin alone may be insufficient for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia, which is characterized by low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated levels of triglycerides, with or without elevated levels of LDL-C.

Objective

This report reviews the evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of different combination treatments for the management of mixed dyslipidemia, as supported by clinical-trial data and recommended by national guidelines.

Methods

Using the terms lipid-modifying therapy, combination therapy, combination statin-fibrate therapy, and mixed dyslipidemia, a search of PubMed was conducted (completed in April 2007, updated to October 2007) to identify English-language publications and pertinent studies of fibrate combination therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia, including those with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome.

Results

National guidelines recommend the addition of either niacin (nicotinic acid) or a fibrate to statin therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia to achieve better overall lipid control. Fibrates do not have detrimental effects on uric acid levels or glycemic control in patients with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. Based on data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System indicating that gemfibrozil plus a statin was associated with a 15-fold higher risk of rhabdomyolysis than fenofibrate plus a statin, fenofibrate may be the fi-brate of choice for use in combination with a statin. As reported by the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes study, fenofibrate treatment has also been associated with microvascular benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes, which is consistent with preliminary evidence from the Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study.

Conclusion

The addition of fenofibrate to statin therapy may be a useful strategy for the management of mixed dyslipidemia in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease.

### Efficacy and safety of statin and fibrate combination therapy in lipid management [^1121QxYx]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Adequate control of hyperlipidemia is of paramount importance for prevention of vascular events. Statins and fibrates are well established treatments for hyperlipidemia. Combination therapy with a statin and fibrate offers significant therapeutic advantage for the treatment of severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. Although such a combination does increase the risk of myopathy, with an incidence of approximately 0.12%, this small risk of myopathy rarely outweighs the established morbidity and mortality benefits of achieving lipid goals. Nevertheless, a higher incidence of myopathy has been reported with statin monotherapy. Statin+fibrate therapy should be considered if monotherapy or adding other drugs (e.g. cholesterol absorption inhibitors, omega-3 fatty acids or nicotinic acid) did not achieve lipid targets or is impractical. The current article focuses on recent studies highlighting the beneficial effects of this combination.

### The ACC / AHA 2013 guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: the good the bad and the uncertain: a comparison with ESC / EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias 2011 [^11179jnJ]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the most important public health problem of our time in both Europe and the rest of the world, accounting for the greatest expenditure in most healthcare budgets. Achieving consistency of clinical care, incorporating new evidence and their synthesis into practical recommendations for clinicians is the task of various guideline committees throughout the world. Any change in a set of guidelines therefore can have far reaching consequences, particularly if they appear to be at variance with the existing guidelines. The present article discusses the recent American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines 2013 on the control of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults. When compared with the ESC/EAS guidelines on lipid modification in 2011, the ACC/AHA guidelines of 2013 differ markedly. Specifically, (i) the scope is limited to randomized trials only, which excludes a significant body of data and promotes essentially a statin centric approach only; (ii) the abolition of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in favour of specific statin regimens that produce a 30–50% reduction in LDL-C we believe will confuse many physicians and miss the opportunity for medication adherence and patient engagement in self-management; (iii) the absence of target LDL-C levels in very high-risk patients with high absolute risk or residual risk factors will discourage clinicians to consider the addition of lipid modification treatments and individualize patient care; (iv) a reduction in the threshold for treatment in primary prevention will result in a greater number of patients being prescribed statin therapy, which is potentially good in young patients with high life time risk, but will result in a very large number of older patients offered therapy; and (v) the mixed pool risk calculator used to asses CVD risk in the guidelines for primary prevention has not been fully evaluated. This article discusses the potential implications of adopting the ACC/AHA guidelines on patient care in Europe and beyond and concludes with the opinion that the ESC/EAS guidelines from 2011 seem to be the most wide ranging, pragmatic and appropriate choice for European countries.

### The rationale for combination therapy [^113U8NeW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The use of combination lipid-altering therapy for dyslipidemia is becoming increasingly important for effective management of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). In accordance with the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, the primary target of therapy is lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Studies have demonstrated the benefit of LDL cholesterol reduction in decreasing CHD event rates and all-cause mortality. However, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol remains a significant predictor of CHD events. In addition, lipid-lowering therapy targeting aberrant lipoprotein subclass and triglyceride levels afford additional benefit for patients with mixed dyslipidemias. Aggressive lipid-altering therapy often requires the use of combination therapy involving statins in conjunction with niacin, fibric-acid derivatives, or bile acid resins or intestinal inhibitors of active cholesterol transport. This article reviews the rationale for the use of combination therapy in the treatment of dyslipidemia, highlighting management strategies.

### Niacin and lovastatin (Advicor) [^1115rTwH]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk-factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate (see also Table 8 and the NCEP treatment guidelines1).

ADVICOR

ADVICOR (niacin extended-release and lovastatin) is indicated for use when treatment with both NIASPAN and lovastatin is appropriate. As described in the labeling for Niaspan and lovastatin below, the components of ADVICOR are both indicated for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Patients receiving treatment with ADVICOR should be on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet and should continue on this diet during treatment.

NIASPAN (niacin extended-release)

Hypercholesterolemia

NIASPAN is indicated as an adjunct to diet for reduction of elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Table 7), when the response to an appropriate diet has been inadequate.

Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events

In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hypercholesterolemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction.

Hypertriglyceridemia

Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with very high serum triglyceride levels (Table 7) who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Such patients typically have serum TG levels over 2000 mg/dL and have elevations of VLDL-C as well as fasting chylomicrons (Table 7). Patients who consistently have total serum or plasma TG below 1000 mg/dL are unlikely to develop pancreatitis. Therapy with niacin may be considered for those patients with TG elevations between 1000 and 2000 mg/dL who have a history of pancreatitis or of recurrent abdominal pain typical of pancreatitis. Some patients with TG under 1000 mg/dL may, through dietary or alcohol indiscretion, convert to a pattern with massive TG elevations accompanying fasting chylomicronemia, but the influence of niacin therapy on risk of pancreatitis in such situations has not been adequately studied. Drug therapy is not indicated for patients with hyperlipoproteinemia, who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma TG, but who have normal levels of VLDL-C.

### Assessment of the role of niacin in managing cardiovascular disease outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112P6BbD]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review found that most clinical trials conducted over the last 60 years to assess the effectiveness of niacin in cardiovascular prevention settings evaluated changes in surrogate measures, mainly HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels. Among trials qualifying for the meta-analysis, niacin was not associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for all patients, with similar results among the subgroup of statin-treated patients. These findings are consistent with quantitative syntheses from previous meta-analyses. By contrast, pooled estimates of the trials performed on the subgroup of patients without concurrent statin therapy indicated an association of niacin with 3 clinical outcomes, often reported as secondary end points: a reduced risk for acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and revascularization procedures.

Prescription extended-release niacin has FDA-approved indications as monotherapy for treating primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. While many trials have been conducted in patients with dyslipidemia, showing favorable changes in lipid profiles, few reported information on cardiovascular outcomes, and even fewer were designed to detect changes in these clinical outcomes. Therefore, evidence that using niacin alone to correct primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia to change the risk of cardiovascular mortality or morbidity is limited.

### Niacin (niaspan) [^114PMWr3]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hyperlipidemia. Niacin therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate.

NIASPAN is indicated to reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia.
NIASPAN in combination with simvastatin or lovastatin is indicated for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia when treatment with NIASPAN, simvastatin, or lovastatin monotherapy is considered inadequate.
In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction.
In patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyperlipidemia, niacin, in combination with a bile acid binding resin, is indicated to slow progression or promote regression of atherosclerotic disease.
NIASPAN in combination with a bile acid binding resin is indicated to reduce elevated TC and LDL-C levels in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia.
Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them.

### Hyperlipidemia: drugs for cardiovascular risk reduction in adults… [^1166TWF4]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

The consensus statement recommends that nonstatin therapy should be considered in at-risk individuals who do not achieve the expected statin response or who cannot tolerate the recommended statin dose. Nonstatin therapies should not, however, be considered as alternatives to evidence-based statin therapy unless intolerance has been systematically determined.

### Which is the best lipid-modifying strategy in metabolic syndrome and diabetes: fibrates, statins or both? [^115ZzXS6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2004). Low credibility.

Although less clinical intervention studies have been performed with fibrates than with statins, there are evidences indicating that fibrates may reduce risk of cardiovascular events. The potential clinical benefit of the fenofibrate will be specified by the ongoing Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, which rationale, methods and aims have been just published. Controlled clinical trials show similar or even greater cardiovascular benefits from statins-based therapy in patient subgroups with diabetes compared with overall study populations. Therefore, statins are the drug of first choice for aggressive lipid lowering actions and reducing risk of coronary artery disease in these patients. However, current therapeutic use of statins as monotherapy is still leaving many patients with mixed atherogenic dyslipidemia at high risk for coronary events. A combination statin/fibrate therapy may be often necessary to control all lipid abnormalities in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes adequately, since fibrates provide additional important benefits, particularly on triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels. Thus, this combined therapy concentrates on all the components of the mixed dyslipidemia that often occurs in persons with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and may be expected to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Safety concerns about some fibrates such as gemfibrozil may lead to exaggerate precautions regarding fibrate administration and therefore diminish the use of the seagents. However, other fibrates, such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate appear to be safer and better tolerated. We believe that a proper co-administration of statins and fibrates, selected on basis of their safety, could be more effective in achieving a comprehensive lipid control as compared with monotherapy.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^116ehrQt]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusion

The combination of low‐intensity atorvastatin (5 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) is significantly more effective in reducing LDL‐C levels than low‐intensity atorvastatin (5 mg), ezetimibe (10 mg), or moderate‐intensity atorvastatin (10 mg) monotherapy in patients with dyslipidemia. The combination therapy also shows good efficacy in improving other lipid levels, including non‐HDL‐C and Apo B levels, and the Apo B/Apo AI ratio, with a rapid onset of the effect observed within the first 4 weeks of treatment. This approach offers a viable alternative for patients who are intolerant to high‐intensity statins or who are unable to use or afford PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Alirocumab vs usual lipid-lowering care as add-on to statin therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia: the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA randomized trial [^11187jNq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The ODYSSEY DM‐DYSLIPIDEMIA trial was designed to address these clinical uncertainties and assessed the efficacy and safety of alirocumab vs usual lipid‐lowering care (UC), stratified by an investigator's predefined option for add‐on therapy (fenofibrate, omega‐3 fatty acids, ezetimibe, nicotinic acid or no additional LLT) to maximally tolerated statins among individuals with T2DM at high ASCVD risk who had mixed dyslipidaemia and in whom non‐HDL cholesterol was not adequately controlled (≥ 2.59 mmol/L [≥ 100 mg/dL]). The primary endpoint (not used in previous randomized studies) was the difference in the percentage change from baseline in non‐HDL cholesterol between alirocumab and UC (overall; ie, all options). A prespecified analysis was used to compare the superiority of alirocumab vs fenofibrate (recommended in guidelines for treating individuals with elevated TGs 4, 5).

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^116k6MUr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets, which contain a cholesterol absorption inhibitor and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to:

reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia. (1.1)
reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments. (1.2)

Limitations of Use (1.3)

No incremental benefit of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for simvastatin has been established.
Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets have not been studied in Fredrickson Type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.

1.1 Primary Hyperlipidemia

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets are indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.

1.2 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets are indicated for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g. LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable.

1.3 Limitations of Use

No incremental benefit of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for simvastatin has been established.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets have not been studied in Fredrickson type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.

### Effectiveness of high doses of simvastatin as monotherapy in mixed hyperlipidemia [^117NQgUR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Twenty subjects with mixed hyperlipidemia participated in a 3-arm crossover trial to evaluate the effectiveness of high-dose simvastatin as monotherapy. Significant reductions were observed in atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins. The highest dose of simvastatin also resulted in significant increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (21%) with a comparable increase in large, protective high-density lipoprotein particles.

### Efficacy and safety of fenofibric acid in combination with a statin in patients with mixed dyslipidemia: pooled analysis of three phase 3, 12-week randomized, controlled studies [^112hyagd]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with mixed dyslipidemia often require combination therapy to manage multiple lipid abnormalities.

Objective

To evaluate fenofibric acid in combination with a statin across three studies of patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods

As prospectively planned, data were pooled from three randomized, double-blind, phase 3 studies of patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 130mg/dL, triglycerides (TG) ≥ 150mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) < 40mg/dL (men) or < 50mg/dL (women). A total of 2715 patients were randomly assigned to 12-week treatment with fenofibric acid 135mg monotherapy; low-, moderate-, or high-dose statin (rosuvastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin, depending on study) monotherapy; or fenofibric acid + low- or moderate-dose statin. The primary efficacy comparisons were mean percent change in HDL-C and TG (combination therapy vs. statin) and LDL-C (combination therapy vs. fenofibric acid).

Results

Fenofibric acid + low-dose statin increased HDL-C (18.1% vs. 7.4%) and reduced TG (-43.9% vs. -16.8%) versus low-dose statin monotherapy and reduced LDL-C (-33.1% vs. -5.1%) versus fenofibric acid monotherapy (P < .001 for all). Fenofibric acid + moderate-dose statin increased HDL-C (17.5% vs. 8.7%) and reduced TG (-42.0% vs. -23.7%) versus moderate-dose statin monotherapy and reduced LDL-C (-34.6% vs. -5.1%) versus fenofibric acid monotherapy (P < .001 for all). Combination therapy was generally well tolerated, and safety profiles were similar to monotherapies. No rhabdomyolysis was reported.

Conclusion

In patients with mixed dyslipidemia, combination therapy simultaneously improved multiple lipid abnormalities more effectively than fenofibric acid or statin monotherapies.

### Efficacy and safety of the coadministration of ezetimibe / simvastatin with fenofibrate in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia [^115o9Bmt]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Mixed hyperlipidemia is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and TG-rich lipoprotein levels.

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm trial, eligible patients were 18 to 79 years of age, with mixed hyperlipidemia (LDL-C 130–220 mg/dL, TG 150–500 mg/dL). Patients with type 2 diabetes were limited to those with LDL-C of 100 to 180 mg/dL. Patients (N = 611) were randomized in a 3:3:3:1 ratio to one of 4 treatment arms for 12 weeks: ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg (EZE/SIMVA) + fenofibrate 160 mg (FENO), EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg, FENO 160 mg, or placebo. The primary objective was to evaluate the LDL-C-lowering efficacy of EZE/SIMVA + FENO versus FENO monotherapy.

Results

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was significantly (P < .05) reduced with EZE/SIMVA + FENO (-45.8%) compared with FENO (-15.7%) or placebo (-3.5%), but not when compared with EZE/SIMVA (-47.1%). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels were significantly increased with EZE/SIMVA + FENO (18.7% and 11.1%, respectively) treatment compared with EZE/SIMVA (9.3% and 6.6%) or placebo (1.1% and 1.6%), but not when compared with FENO (18.2% and 10.8%). Triglyceride, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels were significantly reduced with EZE/SIMVA + FENO (-50.0%, -50.5%, and -44.7%, respectively) versus all other treatments. Treatment with EZE/SIMVA + FENO was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to the EZE/SIMVA and FENO therapies.

Conclusions

Coadministration of EZE/SIMVA + FENO effectively improved the overall atherogenic lipid profile of patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. Clinical trial registry number: NCT 00093899 (http://www. ClinicalTrials.gov).

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^1159PRD8]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Triglyceride (TG) and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL–C) management after control of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C) is level based. Children with average fasting levels of TG ≥ 500 mg/dL or any single measurement ≥ 1,000 mg/ dL related to a primary hypertriglyceridemia should be treated in conjunction with a lipid specialist; the CHILD-2–TG diet should be started and use of fish oil, fibrate, or niacin to prevent pancreatitis should be considered (Grade D). Children with fasting levels of TG 200 to 499 mg/dL after a trial of lifestyle/diet management with CHILD 1 → CHILD 2–TG should have non–HDL recalculated and be managed to a goal of less than 145 mg/dL (Grade D). For those with TG 200 to 499 mg/dL and non–HDL ≥ 145 mg/dL after CHILD 1 → CHILD 2–TG, including increased fish intake, fish oil supplementation may be considered (Grade D). Children ages 10 years or older with non–HDL–C levels ≥ 145 mg/dL after the LDL–C goal is achieved may be considered for further intensification of statin therapy or additional therapy with a fibrate or niacin, with referral to a lipid specialist (Grade D). Children with severe or complex mixed dyslipidemias, particularly where multiple medications are being considered, should be referred for consultation with a lipid specialist (Grade D).

### Effect of evolocumab or ezetimibe added to moderate-or high-intensity statin therapy on LDL-C lowering in patients with hypercholesterolemia: the LAPLACE-2 randomized clinical trial [^116oACdb]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In phase 2 studies, evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, reduced LDL-C levels in patients receiving statin therapy.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of evolocumab when used in combination with a moderate- vs high-intensity statin.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Phase 3, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and ezetimibe-controlled study conducted between January and December of 2013 in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia at 198 sites in 17 countries.

Interventions

Patients (n = 2067) were randomized to 1 of 24 treatment groups in 2 steps. Patients were initially randomized to a daily, moderate-intensity (atorvastatin [10 mg], simvastatin [40 mg], or rosuvastatin [5 mg]) or high-intensity (atorvastatin [80 mg], rosuvastatin [40 mg]) statin. After a 4-week lipid-stabilization period, patients (n = 1899) were randomized to compare evolocumab (140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly) with placebo (every 2 weeks or monthly) or ezetimibe (10 mg or placebo daily; atorvastatin patients only) when added to statin therapies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 and at week 12.

Results

Evolocumab reduced LDL-C levels by 66% (95% CI, 58% to 73%) to 75% (95% CI, 65% to 84%) (every 2 weeks) and by 63% (95% CI, 54% to 71%) to 75% (95% CI, 67% to 83%) (monthly) vs placebo at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 in the moderate- and high-intensity statin-treated groups; the LDL-C reductions at week 12 were comparable. For moderate-intensity statin groups, evolocumab every 2 weeks reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 115 to 124 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 39 to 49 mg/dL; monthly evolocumab reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 123 to 126 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 43 to 48 mg/dL. For high-intensity statin groups, evolocumab every 2 weeks reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 89 to 94 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 35 to 38 mg/dL; monthly evolocumab reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 89 to 94 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 33 to 35 mg/dL. Adverse events were reported in 36%, 40%, and 39% of evolocumab-, ezetimibe-, and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common adverse events in evolocumab-treated patients were back pain, arthralgia, headache, muscle spasms, and pain in extremity (all < 2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this 12-week trial conducted among patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia, evolocumab added to moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy resulted in additional LDL-C lowering. Further studies are needed to evaluate the longer-term clinical outcomes and safety of this approach for LDL-C lowering.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2013 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD [^1175S4MW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Lipid guidelines comparison — LDL role, on‑treatment targets, and combination therapy are contrasted as follows: KDIGO states "does not consider LDL in treatment decision", while ACC/AHA specifies "If CVD history, do not consider LDL; if LDL ≥ 190, treat; if LDL 70–189, depends on risk", and 2014 ADA notes "LDL not used for treatment initiation, though there are target LDL levels on treatment", whereas AACE advises "As part of risk assessment, recommend that all adults at risk for CAD to reach optimum lipid values". For treatment targets, ACC/AHA indicates "Reasonable to target 50% reduction if LDL ≥ 190, otherwise no"; 2014 ADA specifies "Without CVD, LDL < 100; with CVD, LDL < 70 is an option; can use reduction by 30%–40% as alternative target if on maximum statin", and AACE lists "LDL < 100 with goal < 70 for very high risk, also targets HDL and triglycerides". For combination pharmacologic therapy, AACE allows "Yes if cholesterol markedly elevated and target not achieved with monotherapy, for mixed dyslipidemia, or to use lower doses of ≥ 2 drugs to decrease toxicity risk". LDL levels are reported in mg/dL.

### Statin-fibrate combination therapy [^112fNy9j]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Precautionary warnings for severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis from the coadministration of statins and fibrates have been well publicized. However, a recent cerivastatin labeling change made the combined use with fibric acid derivatives a contraindication. Practical recommendations for clinicians who care for patients with refractory mixed hyperlipidemia are needed.

Objective

To provide recommendations for clinicians in the treatment of refractory mixed hyperlipidemia.

Data Sources

A comprehensive MEDLINE (1966-July 2000) and bibliographic search was performed.

Data Synthesis

Thirty-six published clinical trials and 29 case reports involving combination therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and fibric acid derivatives regarding the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy were reviewed. The literature review demonstrated that combination therapy with a statin and fibrate increases the risk of muscle damage, with an incidence of 0.12%. Risk factors that predispose patients to myopathy caused by combination statin-fibrate therapy include increased age, female gender, renal or liver disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, debilitated status, surgery, trauma, excessive alcohol intake, and heavy exercise.

Conclusions

Combination therapy with a statin and fibrate offers significant therapeutic advantage for the treatment of severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. Although such a combination does increase the risk of myopathy, with an incidence of approximately 0.12%, this small risk of myopathy rarely outweighs the established morbidity and mortality benefits of achieving lipid goals. Nevertheless, a higher incidence of myopathy has been reported with statin monotherapy. When monotherapy with a statin fails to control mixed hyperlipidemia, combination therapy may be considered. Niacin may be added before a fibrate is considered, as it appears to have less risk of myopathy. Statin-fibrate combination therapy must be undertaken cautiously and only after careful risk-benefit analysis. Patient counseling on the risks and warning signs of myopathy is extremely important.

Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

In two multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-response trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 8.)

In three multicenter, double-blind trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either atorvastatin 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 9).

Table 9 does not contain data comparing the effects of atorvastatin 10 mg and higher doses of lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. The drugs compared in the trials summarized in the table are not necessarily interchangeable.

Hypertriglyceridemia in Adults

The response to atorvastatin in 64 patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia treated across several clinical trials is shown in the table below (Table 10). For the atorvastatin-treated patients, median (min, max) baseline TG level was 565 (267–1502).

### Comparison of the lipid-lowering effects of pitavastatin 4 mg versus pravastatin 40 mg in adults with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed (combined) dyslipidemia: a phase IV, prospective, US, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, superiority trial [^111LYbxb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Results from a Phase III, European, non-inferiority trial in elderly (age ≥ 65 years) patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed (combined) dyslipidemia demonstrated significantly greater reductions in LDL-C for pitavastatin versus pravastatin across 3 pair-wise dose comparisons (1 mg vs 10 mg, 2 mg vs 20 mg, and 4 mg vs 40 mg, respectively). The present study investigated whether pitavastatin 4 mg is superior to pravastatin 40 mg in LDL-C reduction in adults (18–80 years old) with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed (combined) dyslipidemia.

Methods

This was a Phase IV, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-control superiority study conducted in the United States. Patients with baseline LDL-C levels of 130 to 220 mg/dL (inclusive) and triglyceride levels ≤ 400 mg/dL after a 6-week washout/dietary stabilization period were randomized to 12 weeks of once-daily treatment with either pitavastatin 4 mg or pravastatin 40 mg.

Findings

A total of 328 subjects (164 per treatment arm) were randomized (mean age, 57.9 years [76% were aged < 65 years]; 49.4% women; mean body mass index, 30.2 kg/m(2)) to treatment. The median percent change in LDL-C from baseline to the week 12 endpoint was -38.1% for pitavastatin 4 mg and -26.4% for pravastatin 40 mg; the difference in median percent change between treatments was -12.5% (P < 0.001). Differences between treatments in median percent reductions from baseline for apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, and non-HDL-C were also significant in favor of pitavastatin (P < 0.001). Both treatments significantly (P < 0.001) increased HDL-C and decreased triglycerides, but the differences between treatments were not statistically significant. The overall rate of treatment-emergent adverse events was 47.6% (78 of 164) for pitavastatin and 44.5% (73 of 164) for pravastatin. Myalgia was reported by 3 patients (1.8%) in the pitavastatin group and by 4 patients (2.4%) in the pravastatin group. There were no reports of myositis or rhabdomyolysis.

Implications

Pitavastatin 4 mg demonstrated superior LDL-C reductions compared with pravastatin 40 mg after 12 weeks of therapy in adults with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed (combined) dyslipidemia. There were no new safety findings in the trial. Clinical Trials.gov identifier: NCT01256476.

### Alirocumab vs usual lipid-lowering care as add-on to statin therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia: the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA randomized trial [^1148UhDw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

2.3 Study procedures

After a screening period of up to 3 weeks, investigators selected before randomization the most appropriate choice from a range of 5 therapeutic options based on their usual clinical practice, namely, not to add any LLT, or to add 1 of the following: ezetimibe, fenofibrate, omega‐3 fatty acid formulation or nicotinic acid. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive, on top of maximally tolerated statin (or no statin if intolerant), either open‐label alirocumab or UC for 24 weeks. Randomization was stratified by the UC option selected by the investigator prior to randomization.

Alirocumab was initiated at a dose of 75 mg every 2 weeks, with blinded dose increase to 150 mg every 2 weeks at week 12 if week 8 non‐HDL cholesterol was ≥ 2.59 mmol/L (≥ 100 mg/dL), henceforth referred to as "alirocumab 75/150 mg every 2 weeks".

2.4 Endpoints and assessments

The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change in non‐HDL cholesterol from baseline to week 24, analysed using an intention‐to‐treat approach. Further details on secondary endpoints and laboratory and safety assessments are given in Appendix S1.

2.5 Statistical analysis

The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed using a mixed‐effect model with a repeated measures approach to account for missing data. Further information on analysis methods is presented in Appendix S1.

### Fenofibrate (fenoglide) [^11683jjB]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fenoglide is a peroxisome proliferator receptor alpha (PPARα) activator indicated:

as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, TG, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia when response to diet and non-pharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate. (1.1)
as an adjunct to diet to treat patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacologic intervention. (1.2)

Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in a large, randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. (1.3)

1.1 Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia

Fenoglide is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, Triglycerides, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Lipid-altering agents should be used in addition to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol when response to diet and nonpharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate.

1.2 Hypertriglyceridemia

Fenoglide is also indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of adult patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually reduce fasting triglycerides and eliminate chylomicronemia thereby obviating the need for pharmacologic intervention.

1.3 General Guidelines

Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in a large, randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) .]

Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. > 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of Fenoglide therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

Drug therapy is not indicated for patients who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Inspection of plasma refrigerated for 14 hours is helpful in distinguishing these patients from those with elevated VLDL.2

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^115ymTH5]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atorvastatin, a widely used statin, has demonstrated significant LDL‐C lowering effects and a reduction in cardiovascular events across various risk populations. Consequently, combination therapies that integrate supplementary lipid‐lowering agents, such as ezetimibe, are gaining interest. Ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, has shown promise in further reducing LDL‐C levels when added to statin therapy, providing a potential strategy for patients who do not reach their lipid targets with statin monotherapy. These findings support the complementary mechanisms of action and the potential of combining atorvastatin and ezetimibe to achieve effective LDL‐C lowering and improve clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Although guidelines recommend a moderate‐intensity statin that can lower LDL‐C level by 30%–49% for effective primary prevention in patients at low to moderate cardiovascular risk, there are limited studies comparing the effectiveness and safety of low‐intensity atorvastatin and ezetimibe combination therapy to moderate‐intensity statin. In the RACING trial, the combination of a moderate‐intensity statin and ezetimibe was non‐inferior to high‐intensity statin therapy on the risk of CVD in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, it is not known whether a low‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe is an alternative to a moderate‐intensity statin in the general population. Thus, in this study, we aimed to compare the lipid‐lowering effect and safety of a combination therapy of atorvastatin 5 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg (A5E10) with monotherapy regimens (atorvastatin 5 mg [A5], ezetimibe 10 mg [E10], or atorvastatin 10 mg [A10]) in patients with dyslipidemia.

4.1 The Benefits of Low‐Intensity Statin Combination Therapy Over Moderate‐Intensity Statin Therapy

Lowering LDL‐C improves clinical outcomes and statins are recommended as the mainstay of lipid‐lowering therapy. Therefore, recent lipid guidelines recommend LDL‐C reduction based on cardiovascular risk. Clinical guidelines recommend moderate‐intensity statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40–75 years without diabetes and at a moderate cardiovascular risk, or in patients with diabetes and aged 40–75 years. Although the initial lowering of LDL‐C levels with statins is effective, further reductions require disproportionately larger dose increases. This is because statin‐induced reductions in serum cholesterol can lead to increased cholesterol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, which diminishes the efficacy of higher statin doses. Typically, doubling the statin dose from the minimum effective dose yields only an additional 6% reduction in serum LDL‐C concentration. In addition, side effects associated with statins include myopathy, new‐onset diabetes, and an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. The SEARCH trial compared the effects of 80 mg versus 20 mg of simvastatin in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. The trial demonstrated a higher risk of myopathy in high‐dose simvastatin (0.9%) compared to the low‐dose group (0.03%). Similarly, the JUPITER trial, which compared rosuvastatin 20 mg to placebo, reported a higher incidence of new‐onset diabetes in the rosuvastatin (3.0% vs. 2.4%). In another meta‐analysis comparing high‐intensity and moderate‐intensity statins, new‐onset DM occurred 12% more often in the high‐intensity statin group compared with the moderate‐intensity statin group. These findings highlight the dose‐dependent manner in which statin‐associated side effects, which are important because they reduce patient adherence, are associated with clinical outcomes. Our study found that combining a low‐intensity statin atorvastatin 5 mg with ezetimibe resulted in a 47.6% reduction in LDL‐C from baseline, a significantly greater reduction than that achieved with atorvastatin 10 mg monotherapy, which is classified as a moderate‐intensity statin. Moreover, in the A5E10 group, 100% of participants with low‐to‐moderate risk achieved their LDL‐C targets. Consistent with the results of previous studies, these findings suggest that adding ezetimibe to a low‐intensity statin can achieve greater LDL‐C reduction than a moderate‐intensity statin alone, potentially offering a more effective and better‐tolerated treatment option by reducing the side effects commonly associated with high‐intensity statin therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of ongericimab in Chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia [^111B4uoQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A phase 3 trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ongericimab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, as an add‐on treatment to optimized lipid‐lowering therapy in Chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods and Results

A total of 806 patients who were receiving stable and optimized lipid‐lowering therapy but did not achieve their low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) targets were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 2:1:2:1 ratio to receive either ongericimab 150 mg or matching placebo every 2 weeks, or ongericimab 300 mg or matching placebo every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. Efficacy and safety were evaluated in 802 patients who received at least 1 dose of ongericimab or placebo. The primary end point was the percentage change in LDL‐C from baseline to week 24. Our findings demonstrated that the least‐squares mean difference of percentage change in LDL‐C from baseline to week 24 was −67.7% (95% CI, −72.5% to −63.0%; P < 0.0001) in the ongericimab 150 mg every 2 weeks group compared with the placebo every 2 weeks group, and −61.2% (95% CI, −67.1% to −55.2%; P < 0.0001) in the ongericimab 300 mg every 4 weeks group compared with the placebo every 4 weeks group. These reductions were sustained up to week 52. Furthermore, treatment with ongericimab favorably altered other lipid parameters. A similar incidence of adverse events was observed in the ongericimab and placebo groups.

Conclusions

Ongericimab, as an add‐on treatment to optimized lipid‐lowering therapy, significantly reduced LDL‐C and was well‐tolerated in Chinese patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia who did not achieve their LDL‐C targets.

### Attainment of goal / desirable lipid levels in patients with mixed dyslipidemia after 12 weeks of treatment with fenofibric acid and rosuvastatin combination therapy: a pooled analysis of controlled studies [^114REpUZ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Goal/desirable lipid levels are underachieved in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. These patients may have substantial residual risk of cardiovascular disease even while receiving optimal LDL-C-lowering therapy and may require additional therapy to improve multiple lipid/lipoprotein levels.

Objective

To evaluate attainment of goal/desirable levels of lipids/lipoproteins after 12-week treatment with combination rosuvastatin + fenofibric acid versus rosuvastatin monotherapy.

Methods

This was a post hoc analysis of patients with mixed dyslipidemia who enrolled in one of two randomized controlled trials, and were treated (N = 2066) with rosuvastatin (5, 10, or 20 mg), fenofibric acid 135 mg, or rosuvastatin + fenofibric acid for 12 weeks. Data were pooled across doses of rosuvastatin as monotherapy and combination therapy.

Results

Compared with rosuvastatin monotherapy, combination therapy had comparable effects in achieving risk-stratified LDL-C goals; however, measures of total atherogenic burden were improved because significantly greater percentages of patients attained non-HDL-C goal in high- (62.9% vs 50.4%, P = 0.006) and moderate-risk groups (87.6% vs 80.4%, P = 0.016) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) < 90 mg/dL in high-risk group (59.8% vs 43.8%, P < .001). In the overall population, more patients treated with the combination therapy achieved desirable levels of HDL-C > 40/50 mg/dL in men/women (P < .001), triglycerides < 150 mg/dL (P < .001), and ApoB < 90 mg/dL (P < .001), compared with rosuvastatin monotherapy. Furthermore, combination therapy resulted in significantly greater percentages of patients achieving simultaneous specified levels of LDL-C + non-HDL-C (P < .015); LDL-C + HDL-C + TG (P < .001); and LDL-C + HDL-C + triglycerides + non-HDL-C + ApoB (P < .001), compared with rosuvastatin monotherapy.

Conclusion

Rosuvastatin + fenofibric acid may be more efficacious than rosuvastatin alone in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

### Which is the best lipid-modifying strategy in metabolic syndrome and diabetes: fibrates, statins or both? [^1131yrk4]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2004). Low credibility.

Evidence also suggests that there is a 'fibrate effect' that mediates the reduction in CHD risk beyond the favorable impact of these agents on HDL-cholesterol levels. This last notion is consistent with the pleiotropic effects of fibrates which are known to be related to their mechanisms of action. Being PPAR alpha ligands, fibrates have a significant impact on the synthesis of several apolipoproteins (apo) and enzymes of lipoprotein metabolism as well as on the expression of several genes involved in fibrinolysis and inflammation. Such changes contribute to improve the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, leading to a substantial increase in HDL-cholesterol levels accompanied by a shift in the size and density of LDL particles (from small, dense LDL particles to larger, more buoyant cholesteryl ester-rich LDL).

Controlled clinical trials show similar or even greater cardiovascular benefits from statins-based therapy in patient subgroups with diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, and metabolic syndrome, compared with overall study populations. Therefore, statins are the drug of first choice for aggressive lipid lowering actions and reducing risk of coronary artery disease in these patients. However, current therapeutic use of statins as monotherapy is still leaving many patients with mixed atherogenic dyslipidemia at high risk for coronary events.

A combination statin/fibrate therapy may be often necessary to control all lipid abnormalities in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes adequately, since fibrates provide additional important benefits, particularly on triglyceride and HDL-C levels. Thus, this combined therapy concentrates on all the components of the mixed dyslipidemia that often occurs in persons with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and may be expected to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Safety concerns about some fibrates such as gemfibrozil may lead to exaggerate precautions regarding fibrate administration and therefore diminish the use of the seagents. However, other fibrates such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate appear to be safer and better tolerated. We believe that a proper co-administration of statins and fibrates, selected on basis of their safety, could be more effective in achieving a comprehensive lipid control as compared with monotherapy.

### Design and rationale of the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA trial: lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of alirocumab in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia at high cardiovascular risk [^111tgRQW]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Most guidelines/consensus statements suggest a non-HDL-C target of 30 mg/dl above target LDL-C levels. Therefore, for individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) at very-high or high cardiovascular risk who have LDL-C goals of < 70 or < 100 mg/dl, respectively, the recommended non-HDL-C levels are < 100 or < 130 mg/dl.

Maximally tolerated statin therapy is commonly used to manage mixed dyslipidaemia, particularly with the goal of reducing LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels. Significant reductions in cardiovascular events have been observed in individuals with DM treated with statins. However, real-world studies often report under-utilisation of statins and sub-optimal dosing in high-risk patients. Additional lipid-lowering therapies are used in conjunction with statins to address mixed dyslipidaemia, including ezetimibe, fibrates, nicotinic acid and omega-3 fatty acids. Although these additional therapies have not definitively demonstrated cardiovascular outcome benefits in several large randomised trials, in a post hoc subgroup analysis, fibrates have been associated with an apparent reduction in cardiovascular events in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia. Fibrate therapy was most beneficial when TG levels were lowered, particularly in individuals with high baseline TG levels. Despite these treatment options, many individuals with DM continue to have persistent lipid abnormalities, and are therefore exposed to residual cardiovascular risk.

Alirocumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a key regulator of plasma LDL-C metabolism. Alirocumab is approved in many countries, including the USA and across Europe, for the management of patients with hypercholesterolaemia on maximally tolerated statin therapy. As demonstrated in the ODYSSEY Phase 3 clinical studies, alirocumab reduces LDL-C levels by up to 60%, both alone and in combination with statin and other lipid-lowering therapies, in patients with dyslipidaemia. In contrast to bococizumab (a murine-derived, humanised monoclonal antibody to PCSK9 that was recently discontinued from clinical development due to the attenuation of LDL-C lowering over time and higher rates of immunogenicity), LDL-C reductions on alirocumab did not decrease over time and very low rates of immunogenicity were observed. Such evidence suggests differences in immunogenicity potential for murine-derived antibodies humanised by in vitro artificial engineering, versus fully human antibodies that were produced with mice with genetically humanised immune systems.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1 The reasons are probably multifactorial, but a relevant contributory factor may be the greater prevalence of mixed dyslipidaemia, which is characterized by elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and thus elevated TG‐rich lipoprotein (TRL) and TRL cholesterol levels, as well as low levels of HDL cholesterol. 2 Mixed dyslipidaemia in T2DM might not be detected with measurement of LDL cholesterol levels, as these may remain within a normal range. 3 Non‐HDL cholesterol (calculated by subtracting HDL cholesterol from total cholesterol), accounts for the sum of all atherogenic lipoproteins (LDL cholesterol, intermediate‐density lipoprotein, very‐low‐density lipoprotein [VLDL], VLDL remnants, chylomicron remnants, and lipoprotein a [Lp(a)]) and has been suggested to be a better indicator of cardiovascular (CV) risk than LDL cholesterol among individuals with elevated TG levels, including individuals with dyslipidaemia. 3, 4, 5 Populations with mixed dyslipidaemia also have qualitative changes in LDL particles, with a higher number of smaller, more dense LDL particles; these are believed to be more atherogenic than larger, more buoyant particles. 2

Lipid‐lowering therapy (LLT) with statins increases the clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins and thus reduces plasma cholesterol levels, principally through reductions in LDL cholesterol. 6 This results in a significantly lower risk of ASCVD with the proportional benefit related to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol. 7 Other therapeutic approaches that further increase clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins include ezetimibe 8 and the inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin‐kexin type 9 (PCSK9), alirocumab 9 and evolocumab. 10 Adding ezetimibe or evolocumab to statin significantly reduces CV events (the CV outcomes study with alirocumab [NCT01663402] is ongoing) 11, 12; however, no previous study has prospectively evaluated PCSK9 inhibition in individuals with diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia or compared different therapeutic options among individuals with elevated TG levels despite maximally tolerated statin therapy, an important consideration given the "real‐world" clinical uncertainty around potential therapeutic agents which principally reduce either the synthesis of TRL particles (fibrates), lipolysis of TGs (omega‐3 fatty acids), clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins (ezetimibe), or a combination of these mechanisms (nicotinic acid).

### Efficacy of fenofibric acid plus statins on multiple lipid parameters and its safety in women with mixed dyslipidemia [^117JpDG8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The combination of fibrate and statin therapies may be a treatment option for women with multiple lipid abnormalities. We, therefore, initiated the present safety and efficacy analysis to address the paucity of such data in women with mixed dyslipidemia. A total of 1,393 women with mixed dyslipidemia (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dl, triglycerides [TG] ≥ 150 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol < 50 mg/dl), who had enrolled in any 1 of 3 randomized clinical trials, were evaluated. The eligible women were randomized to receive fenofibric acid plus a low- or moderate-dose statin (combination treatment); or low-, moderate-, or high-dose statin monotherapy; or fenofibric acid monotherapy. With low-dose combination treatment, the baseline HDL cholesterol level increased 20% and TG decreased 46% compared to an 8% HDL cholesterol increase and 20% TG decrease with low-dose statins alone. With the moderate-dose combination, the baseline HDL cholesterol increased 21% and TG decreased 44% compared to an 8% HDL cholesterol increase and 26% TG decrease with moderate-dose statins alone. The reduction in baseline LDL cholesterol with low-dose and moderate-dose combinations (37% and 39%, respectively) was comparable to the reduction with corresponding-dose statins (36% and 43%, respectively). High-dose statins decreased the baseline LDL cholesterol 47%; however, the increase in HDL cholesterol (9%) and decrease in TG (25%) were similar to the changes observed with lower doses of statins. The safety profiles of the combinations were comparable to those of the component therapies. In conclusion, these data suggest that a combination of fenofibric acid and a statin could be considered safe and efficacious for treating women with mixed dyslipidemia.

14.1 Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia

CRESTOR reduces Total‑C, LDL‑C, ApoB, nonHDL‑C, and TG, and increases HDL‑C, in adult patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia.

Dose-Ranging Study: In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in patients with hyperlipidemia CRESTOR given as a single daily dose for 6 weeks significantly reduced Total‑C, LDL‑C, nonHDL‑C, and ApoB, across the dose range (Table 6).

Active-Controlled Study: CRESTOR was compared with the HMG‑CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin in a multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging study of 2240 patients with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. After randomization, patients were treated for 6 weeks with a single daily dose of either CRESTOR, atorvastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin (Figure 1 and Table 7).

### Model-based simulation to explore the cost-effectiveness of following practice guidelines for triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control among patients with diabetes mellitus and mixed dyslipidemia [^113TL5mt]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines recommend maintaining lipid levels within particular targets to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events.

Objective

The objective of this simulation study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of following guideline-recommended care compared with current practice or usual care for patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and mixed dyslipidemia (ie, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] and triglyceride [TG] levels).

Methods

A simulation model using a US health care payer perspective was designed to predict changes in lipid levels (LDL-C, TG, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol) and long-term CHD risk. Data about patients with DM and uncontrolled TG and/or LDL-C were taken from an electronic medical records database to develop the description of current care (eg, statin, fibrate, or no medication) and cholesterol levels. Patients with uncontrolled lipid levels who were not following guideline recommendations were assumed to be receiving combination treatment (ie, coadministration of statin and fibrate) or monotherapy for the uncontrolled lipids under guideline care. Results from a previous study were used to project incremental benefits of combination treatment compared with monotherapy. CHD events were predicted based on risk equations. A 20-year model of direct costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was created.

Results

Among patients switched to guideline therapy, the model predicted 72% achieved 2 lipid targets and 44% achieved 3 lipid targets in 1 year. Over 20 years, in a modeled sample of 1000 patients, 176 myocardial infarction and angina events would be avoided by following guideline care. Total present value of costs for drug treatment and medical care for CHD events would be $33,626 per patient for guideline treatment versus $25,264 per patient for current care. The discounted QALY gain would be 0.18 per patient for an incremental cost per QALY of $50,315.

Conclusions

The results of this model simulation suggest that for patients with DM and mixed dyslipidemia, following treatment guidelines rather than current practice (including combination therapy rather than monotherapy) would result in more patients achieving lipid targets, fewer CHD events, and more QALYs gained at a reasonable cost (less than $109,000) per QALY.

### Efficacy and tolerability of pitavastatin versus pitavastatin / fenofibrate in high-risk Korean patients with mixed dyslipidemia: a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, parallel, therapeutic confirmatory clinical trial [^114vdX3p]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins are known to effectively reduce not only low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level but also death and nonfatal myocardial infarction due to coronary heart disease. The risk for CVD from atherogenic dyslipidemia persists when elevated triglyceride (TG) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are not controlled with statin therapy. Therefore, statin/fenofibrate combination therapy is more effective in reducing CVD risk. Here, we assessed the efficacy and tolerability of pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and a high risk for CVD.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, therapeutic-confirmatory clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of fixed-dose combination therapy with pitavastatin/fenofibrate 2/160 mg in Korean patients with a high risk for CVD and a controlled LDL-C level (< 100 mg/dL) and a TG level of 150–500 mg/dL after a run-in period with pitavastatin 2 mg alone. In the 8-week main study, 347 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive pitavastatin 2 mg with or without fenofibrate 160 mg after a run-in period. In the extension study, patients with controlled LDL-C and non-HDL-C (< 130 mg/dL) levels were included after the completion of the main study. All participants in the extension study received the pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy for 16 weeks for the assessment of the tolerability of long-term treatment.

Findings

The difference in the mean percentage change in non-HDL-C from baseline to week 8 between the combination therapy and monotherapy groups was -12.45% (95% CI, -17.18 to -7.72), and the combination therapy was associated with a greater reduction in non-HDL-C. The changes in lipid profile, including apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 were statistically significant with combination therapy compared to monotherapy at all time points. Furthermore, the rates of achievement of non-HDL-C and apolipoprotein B targets at week 8 in the combination therapy and monotherapy groups were 88.30% versus 77.98% (P = 0.0110) and 78.94% versus 68.45% (P = 0.0021), respectively. The combination therapy was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of statin monotherapy.

Implications

In these Korean patients with mixed dyslipidemia and a high risk for CVD, combination therapy with pitavastatin/fenofibrate was associated with a greater reduction in non-HDL-C compared with that with pitavastatin monotherapy, and a significantly improvement in other lipid levels. Moreover, the combination therapy was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of statin monotherapy. Therefore, pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy could be effective and well tolerated in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03618797.

### Prevalence, incidence, and treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with high or very high cardiovascular risk in Germany [^116NbbZt]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

2019 ESC/EAS guidelines on management of dyslipidemia outline treatment goals of LDL-C reduction in patients with high and very high cardiovascular (CV) risk.

Objective

To describe the proportion, clinical characteristics, and treatment practices of adult patients with dyslipidemia and high or very high CV risk in Germany.

Methods

Based on German claims data from 2010 to 2019, a retrospective cross-sectional study on prevalence, incidence, and treatment pathways in patients with dyslipidemia and high and very high CV risk is performed.

Results

Between 2010 and 2019, there were 213 to 233 adult patients per 1,000 with prevalent dyslipidemia based on ICD 10 codes. Annual incidence ranged from 31.7 to 40.2 per 1,000. In 2019, 1.2% and 22.8% of the prevalent patients are classified to high or very high CV risk. Out of these patients, 61.7% and 78.5% received lipid lowering treatments (LLT). Among incidence patients, prescription rates are further apart between high-risk and very-high-risk patients, at 56.6% and 79.2%. Cross-sectional analysis showed that in 2019 statin monotherapy is the most common LLT (87.2%) administered mainly at moderate dose (59.9%). In that year, 2.7% and 8.4% of the patients received ezetimibe as monotherapy or in combination with statins. The proportion of treatment pause, or discontinuation was 56.6% over time, with subsequent re-initiation for 42.0% of patients.

Conclusions

Analysis indicates that despite recommendations, intensive treatment therapies are underutilized in clinical practice even in high and very high CV risk patients with primary hypercholesterolemia/mixed dyslipidemia, who may have benefited from LLT optimization.

### Fenofibrate (Tricor) [^114DpRRV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Overview of Clinical Trials

The effectiveness of TRICOR has been established in adults with hypertriglyceridemia or primary hyperlipidemia based on adequate and well-controlled trials of other formulations of fenofibrate, referenced below as "fenofibrate". Dosages of fenofibrate used in these trials were comparable to TRICOR 145 mg per day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

14.2 Clinical Trials in Adults with Hypertriglyceridemia

The effects of fenofibrate on serum TG were studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 147 patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Patients were treated for 8 weeks under protocols that differed only in that one entered patients with baseline TG levels of 500 to 1,500 mg/dL, and the other TG levels of 350 to 499 mg/dL. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia and normal cholesterolemia with or without hyperchylomicronemia, treatment with fenofibrate decreased primarily very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) TG and VLDL cholesterol (VLDL-C). Treatment of patients with elevated TG often results in an increase of LDL-C (see Table 5).

1.400000000000000e+01 3 Clinical Trials in Adults with Primary Hyperlipidemia

The effects of fenofibrate were assessed in four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trials in patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. TRICOR therapy reduced LDL-C, Total-C, and TG, and increased HDL-C (see Table 6).

### Targeting the angiopoietin-like protein 3 / 8 complex with a monoclonal antibody in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia: a phase 1 trial [^1133ApPY]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The angiopoietin-like protein 3/8 complex (ANGPTL3/8) inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, primarily in oxidative tissues, and does so more potently than ANGPTL3, making ANPTL3/8 an attractive target for treating dyslipidemia. This study enrolled 48 adults (36 men, 12 women) with mixed hyperlipidemia to assess the primary outcome of safety and the secondary outcomes of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ascending doses of LY3475766, a human monoclonal antibody that specifically blocks ANGPTL3/8-mediated inhibition of LPL activity. Participants received a single dose of LY3475766 or placebo. LY3475766 was well tolerated with no severe adverse events or adverse event-related discontinuations. Compared with placebo, LY3475766 dose-dependently reduced the concentration of triglycerides (−70%), remnant cholesterol (−86%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (−32%), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) (−35%) and apolipoprotein B (−29%) while increasing HDL-C (+27%). LY3475766 thus significantly reduced atherogenic lipoprotein levels while increasing HDL-C levels; however, the effects on cardiovascular risk remain to be established.

### Atorvastatin film coated (atorvastatin calcium) [^115TFjF7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.2 Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia

Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, VLDL-C, apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb). Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

Atorvastatin is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly.

In two multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-response studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 9.)

In patients with Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb hyperlipoproteinemia pooled from 24 controlled trials, the median (25thand 75thpercentile) percent changes from baseline in HDL-C for atorvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg were 6.4 (-1.4, 14), 8.7 (0, 17), 7.8 (0, 16), and 5.1 (-2.7, 15), respectively. Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in total-C, LDL-C, TG, total-C/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C.

In three multicenter, double-blind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either atorvastatin 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 10).

The impact on clinical outcomes of the differences in lipid-altering effects between treatments shown in Table 10 is not known. Table 10 does not contain data comparing the effects of atorvastatin 10 mg and higher doses of lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. The drugs compared in the studies summarized in the table are not necessarily interchangeable.

14.3 Hypertriglyceridemia

The response to atorvastatin in 64 patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson Type IV) treated across several clinical trials is shown in the table below (Table 11). For the atorvastatin-treated patients, median (min, max) baseline TG level was 565 (267 to 1,502).

Study with Simvastatin in Patients with ≥ 2 Risk Factors for Coronary Heart Disease (Study 304)

Pitavastatin was compared with simvastatin tablets (referred to as simvastatin) in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, non-inferiority study of 351 adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia with ≥ 2 risk factors for coronary heart disease. After a 6- to 8-week wash-out/dietary lead-in period, patients were randomized to a 12-week treatment with either pitavastatin or simvastatin (Table 8). Non-inferiority of pitavastatin to simvastatin was considered to be demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the mean treatment difference was greater than -6% for the mean percent change in LDL-C.

Lipid results are shown in Table 8. Pitavastatin 4 mg was non-inferior to simvastatin 40 mg for percent change from baseline to endpoint in LDL-C. The mean treatment difference (95% CI) was 0% (-2%, 3%).

### Efficacy and safety of ongericimab in Chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia [^115U5Ho3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A phase 3 trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ongericimab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, as an add-on treatment to optimized lipid-lowering therapy in Chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods and Results

A total of 806 patients who were receiving stable and optimized lipid-lowering therapy but did not achieve their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 2:1:2:1 ratio to receive either ongericimab 150mg or matching placebo every 2weeks, or ongericimab 300mg or matching placebo every 4weeks for 52weeks. Efficacy and safety were evaluated in 802 patients who received at least 1 dose of ongericimab or placebo. The primary end point was the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to week 24. Our findings demonstrated that the least-squares mean difference of percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to week 24 was -67.7% (95% CI, -72.5% to -63.0%; P < 0.0001) in the ongericimab 150mg every 2weeks group compared with the placebo every 2weeks group, and -61.2% (95% CI, -67.1% to -55.2%; P < 0.0001) in the ongericimab 300mg every 4weeks group compared with the placebo every 4weeks group. These reductions were sustained up to week 52. Furthermore, treatment with ongericimab favorably altered other lipid parameters. A similar incidence of adverse events was observed in the ongericimab and placebo groups.

Conclusions

Ongericimab, as an add-on treatment to optimized lipid-lowering therapy, significantly reduced LDL-C and was well-tolerated in Chinese patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia who did not achieve their LDL-C targets.

### Atherogenic dyslipidemia in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes: therapeutic options beyond statins [^11276D3D]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Controlled clinical trials show similar or even greater cardiovascular benefits from statins-based therapy in patient subgroups with diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, and metabolic syndrome, compared with overall study populations. Therefore, statins are the drug of first choice for aggressive lipid lowering actions and reducing risk of coronary artery disease in these patients with combined atherogenic dyslipidemia. However, current therapeutic use of statins as monotherapy is still leaving many patients with mixed atherogenic dyslipidemia at high risk for coronary events and commonly insufficient to achieve all lipid targets recommended by current guidelines. For this reason, other approaches to treatment of combined hyperlipidemia should be considered. Because fibrates, niacin, ezetimibe and statins each regulate serum lipids by different mechanisms, combination therapy may offer particularly desirable benefits in patients with combined hyperlipidemia.

A combination statin/fibrate or statin/niacin therapy may be often necessary to control all lipid abnormalities in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes adequately, since fibrates and niacin provide additional important benefits, particularly on triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels. Thus, this combined therapy concentrates on all the components of the mixed dyslipidemia that often occurs in persons with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and may be expected to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Safety concerns about some fibrates such as gemfibrozil may lead to exaggerate precautions regarding fibrate administration and therefore diminish the use of these agents. However, other fibrates (such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate) appear to be safer and better tolerated. In addition, bezafibrate as pan-PPAR-activator has clearly demonstrated beneficial pleiotropic effects related to glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Therefore a proper co-administration of statins with other agents: fibrates, niacin or ezetimibe – selected on basis of their safety and effectiveness, could be more valuable in achieving a comprehensive lipid control as compared with statins monotherapy.

### Fluvastatin [^113AE1EV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Dosing Information

Dose range: 20 mg to 80 mg/day.

Fluvastatin capsules can be administered orally as a single dose, with or without food.

Do not open fluvastatin capsules prior to administration.

Do not take two fluvastatin capsules, 40 mg at one time.

Since the maximal effect of a given dose is seen within 4 weeks, periodic lipid determinations should be performed at this time and dosage adjusted according to the patient's response to therapy and established treatment guidelines.

For patients requiring LDL-C reduction to a goal of ≥ 25%, the recommended starting dose is 40 mg as one capsule in the evening, or 80 mg in divided doses of the 40 mg capsule given twice daily. For patients requiring LDL-C reduction to a goal of < 25% a starting dose of 20 mg may be used.

2.2 Adult Patients With Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia

Adult patients can be started on fluvastatin capsules. The recommended starting dose for fluvastatin capsules is one 40 mg capsule in the evening, or one fluvastatin capsule, 40 mg twice daily. Do not take two fluvastatin capsules, 40 mg at one time.

2.3 Pediatric Patients (10 to 16 Years of Age) With Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia

The recommended starting dose is one fluvastatin capsule, 20 mg. Dose adjustments, up to a maximum daily dose administered as fluvastatin capsules, 40 mg twice daily should be made at 6 week intervals. Doses should be individualized according to the goal of therapy [see NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines and CLINICAL STUDIES (14)]1.

### Design and rationale of the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA trial: lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of alirocumab in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia at high cardiovascular risk [^116PNSN5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA trial has been designed to investigate the superiority of alirocumab versus usual care in improving non-HDL-C and other lipid parameters in individuals with T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia at high cardiovascular risk. This is the first trial in the ODYSSEY programme to evaluate non-HDL-C as a primary efficacy endpoint. Findings will supplement available data from the Phase 3 ODYSSEY clinical development programme, which studied non-HDL-C as a secondary efficacy endpoint. Results will also expand on the subgroup analysis in five Phase 3 ODYSSEY placebo-controlled trials of individuals with DM and mixed dyslipidaemia which showed substantial improvements in LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels with alirocumab that were similar to those in individuals with DM without mixed dyslipidaemia.

As discussed previously, non-HDL-C levels are believed to provide a better risk estimation of cardiovascular disease than LDL-C, especially in individuals with DM and mixed dyslipidaemia, and statins are commonly used to modulate non-HDL-C levels. However, despite statin treatment, many individuals with DM and dyslipidaemia remain sub-optimally treated, and many go on to experience cardiovascular events. A second lipid-lowering therapy is frequently used to bring non-HDL-C to within the target range. Currently, there is no single preferred second-line treatment, and guidelines typically suggest an individualised approach. The ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA study, comparing alirocumab with usual care (which includes other lipid-lowering therapies currently used to manage mixed dyslipidaemia, namely ezetimibe, fibrates, nicotinic acid and omega-3 fatty acids), allows physicians participating in the study to make an individualised therapeutic choice for each study participant whose non-HDL-C remains elevated despite maximally tolerated statin therapy.

### Is there a role for fibrates in the management of dyslipidemia in the metabolic syndrome? [^1172q6BG]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2008). Low credibility.

The outcomes of fibrate trials have varied: positive with gemfibrozil in the primary prevention Helsinki Heart Study and the secondary prevention VA-HIT trial; positive with reservations in the primary prevention WHO trial (clofibrate); and mixed with bezafibrate in the secondary prevention BIP study and with fenofibrate in the combined primary and secondary prevention FIELD study. Overall, the mixed results, combined with potential for adverse effects when given in combination with statins, have limited the use of these fibrates as cardioprotective agents. However, post hoc analyses of several of the fibrate studies have shown that people with features of the metabolic syndrome, particularly overweight people with high plasma triglyceride levels and low levels of HDL cholesterol, derive a disproportionately large reduction in cardiovascular events when treated with these agents. Thus, there is a strong case for the use of a fibrate to reduce the cardiovascular risk in overweight people with high triglyceride and low HDL-C. However, it should be noted that such people also have their cardiovascular risk reduced by statin therapy. It remains to be determined whether the combination of a fibrate plus statin reduces the risk beyond that achieved with a statin alone.

### The effects of fenofibric acid alone and with statins on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its diagnostic components in patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^115xZpSq]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Three similarly designed, phase III, randomized, double-blind, 12-week studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of FA in combination with either rosuvastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin. After a 6-week lipid-altering drug washout period, all studies enrolled patients with mixed dyslipidemia (HDL cholesterol < 40 mg/dl [< 1.04 mmol/l] for men, < 50 mg/dl [< 1.30 mmol/l] for women; triglycerides [TGs] ≥ 150 mg/dl [≥ 1.70 mmol/l]; and LDL cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dl [≥ 3.37 mmol/l]). Patients were assigned in a 2:2:2:2:2:1 ratio to 1 of 6 treatment arms: FA 135 mg monotherapy; low-dose statin monotherapy; FA 135 mg + low-dose statin; moderate-dose statin monotherapy; FA 135 mg + moderate-dose statin; or high-dose statin monotherapy. Each study used a different statin, and the respective doses of low-, moderate-, or high-dose statin were rosuvastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg, or simvastatin or atorvastatin 20, 40, or 80 mg. Data were pooled across the 3 studies. For further details regarding patients and study design, see the article by Jones et al.

Assessments included the number and percent of patients with metabolic syndrome at the final visit for each treatment group, as well as the number and percent of patients having individual metabolic syndrome diagnostic criteria at the baseline visit and at the final visit. In order to be included in these analyses, patients were required to have a final visit value for each metabolic syndrome diagnostic criteria. Waist circumference was not measured at final visit; baseline values were carried forward.

Mean changes from baseline to final value in weight, blood pressure, and fasting glucose were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA, comparing combination therapy with corresponding-dose monotherapies. Percent changes in efficacy parameters were compared between combination therapy and corresponding-dose monotherapies as previously described.

### Evolocumab treatment in patients with HIV and hypercholesterolemia / mixed dyslipidemia: BEIJERINCK study design and baseline characteristics [^117GcsJQ]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

People living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) are at higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) due to traditional and HIV- or antiretroviral treatment (ART)-related risk factors. The use of high-intensity statin therapy is often limited by comorbidities and drug-drug interactions with ART. Herein, we present the design and baseline characteristics of the BEIJERINCK study, which will assess the safety and efficacy of evolocumab in PLHIV and hypercholesterolemia/mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial that investigates monthly subcutaneous evolocumab 420 mg versus placebo in PLHIV with hypercholesterolemia/mixed dyslipidemia who are treated with maximally-tolerated statin therapy. The primary outcome is the baseline to week 24 percent change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Secondary outcomes include achievement of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL and percent change in other plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels. Safety will also be examined.

Results

This study enrolled and dosed 464 patients who had a mean age of 56.4 years and were mostly male (82.5%). Mean duration with HIV was 17.4 years, and, by design, HIV viral load at screening was ≤ 50 copies/mL. ASCVD was documented in 35.6% of patients. Mean LDL-C of enrolled patients at baseline was 133.3 mg/dL. Statin use was prevalent (79.3% overall) with 74.6% receiving moderate or high-intensity statins. In total, 20.7% of patients did not receive statins due to intolerance/contraindications.

Conclusions

The BEIJERINCK study is the first clinical trial to examine the lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of a fully human PCSK9 monoclonal antibody inhibitor in a moderate/high cardiovascular risk population of PLHIV.

### (ezetimibe and atorvastatin) (Lypqozet) [^111Caxmk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate.

LYPQOZET, which contains a cholesterol absorption inhibitor and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to:

reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia. (1.1)
reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments. (1.2)

Limitations of Use

No incremental benefit of LYPQOZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for atorvastatin has been established. LYPQOZET has not been studied in Fredrickson Type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias. (1.3)

1.1 Primary Hyperlipidemia

LYPQOZET is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.

1.2 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)

LYPQOZET is indicated for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g. LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable.

1.3 Limitations of Use

No incremental benefit of LYPQOZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for atorvastatin has been established. LYPQOZET has not been studied in Fredrickson type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.

Statin and ezetimibe combination therapy may be insufficient to improve lipid and nonlipid parameters beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods

In this phase 3, multicenter, double-blind study, a total of 543 patients with triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL and < 400 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) < 40 mg/dL (< 50 mg/dL for women), and LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with fenofibric acid 135 mg (FA) or placebo, each coadministered with atorvastatin 40 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg (Atorva/Eze).

Results

Both treatment regimens lowered LDL-C by > 50%; however, FA + Atorva/Eze resulted in significantly (P < .001) greater improvements in HDL-C (13.0% vs 4.2%), triglycerides (-57.3% vs -39.7%), non-HDL-C (-55.6% vs -51.0%), and apoprotein B (-49.1% vs -44.7%) compared with Atorva/Eze. Overall, adverse events were similar in the 2 treatment groups. No unexpected muscle, hepatic, or renal safety signals were identified with either treatment combination.

Conclusions

In patients with mixed dyslipidemia, the combination of FA + Atorva/Eze significantly improved lipid and nonlipid parameters compared with Atorva/Eze and was generally well tolerated.

### Autosomal dominant familial dysbetalipoproteinemia: a pathophysiological framework and practical approach to diagnosis and therapy [^113fQxFH]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (FD) is a genetic disorder of lipoprotein metabolism associated with an increased risk for premature cardiovascular disease. In about 10% of the cases, FD is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). This review article provides a pathophysiological framework for autosomal dominant FD (ADFD) and discusses diagnostic challenges and therapeutic options. The clinical presentation and diagnostic work-up of ADFD are illustrated by two cases: a male with premature coronary artery disease and a p.K164Q mutation in APOE and a female with mixed hyperlipidemia and a p.R154H mutation in APOE. ADFD is characterized by a fasting and postprandial mixed hyperlipidemia due to increased remnants. Remnants are hepatically cleared by the low-density lipoprotein receptor and the heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptor (HSPG-R). Development of FD is associated with secondary factors like insulin resistance that lead to HSPG-R degradation through sulfatase 2 activation. Diagnostic challenges in ADFD are related to the clinical presentation; lipid phenotype; dominant inheritance pattern; genotyping; and possible misdiagnosis as familial hypercholesterolemia. FD patients respond well to lifestyle changes and to combination therapy with statins and fibrates. To conclude, diagnosing ADFD is important to adequately treat patients and their family members. In patients presenting with mixed hyperlipidemia, (autosomal dominant) FD should be considered as part of the diagnostic work up.

### Managing dyslipidemia in chronic kidney disease [^116a5GxD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the U.S. continues to increase, and now over 10% of the U.S. population has some form of CKD. Although some patients with CKD will ultimately develop renal failure, most patients with CKD will die of cardiovascular disease before dialysis becomes necessary. Patients with CKD have major proatherogenic lipid abnormalities that are treatable with readily available therapies. The severe derangements seen in lipoprotein metabolism in patients with CKD typically results in high triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Because of the prevalence of triglyceride disorders in patients with CKD, after treating patients to a low-density lipoprotein goal, non-HDL should be calculated and used as the secondary goal of treatment. A review of the evidence from subgroup analysis of several landmark lipid-lowering trials supports treating dyslipidemia in mild to moderate CKD patients with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The evidence to support treating dyslipidemia in hemodialysis patients, however, has been mixed, with several outcome trials pending. Patients with CKD frequently have mixed dyslipidemia and often require treatment with multiple lipid-lowering drugs. Although statins are the cornerstone of therapy for most patients with CKD, differences in their pharmacokinetic properties give some statins a safety advantage in patients with advanced CKD. Although most other lipid-lowering agents can be used safely with statins in combination therapy in patients with CKD, the fibrates are renally metabolized and require both adjustments in dose and very careful monitoring due to the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis. After reviewing the safety and dose alterations required in managing dyslipidemia in patients with CKD, a practical treatment algorithm is proposed.

### Efficacy and safety of ongericimab in Chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia [^111UgXso]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Emerging findings from epidemiological, genetic, and clinical intervention studies have strengthened the causal relationship between LDL‐C and arteriosclerosis. These advancements have led to the development of new lipid‐lowering drugs such as PCSK9 inhibitors that have shown significant efficacy in reducing LDL‐C and cardiovascular risks. As a result, many countries have updated their lipid management guidelines, with stricter LDL‐C control targets, particularly for patients at extremely high risk of ASCVD. In this study, we followed the latest international guidelinesas well as the Chinese expert consensus, and enrolled clearly defined extremely high‐risk patients, accounting for up to 64.3% (516/802 patients). The findings indicated that treatment with ongericimab, at doses of 150 mg every 2 weeks or 300 mg every 4 weeks, both resulted in significant reductions in LDL‐C levels ranging from 60.3% to 76.5% compared with placebo. The observed reduction was sustained for 52 weeks, similar to or numerically higher than the reduction achieved with the approved PCSK9 antibodies (45%–75%). Moreover, ongericimab 150 mg every 2 weeks enabled 87.5% to 91.4% of patients at extremely high risk to achieve the LDL‐C target of < 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL), and 88.1% to 91.8% of patients at very high risk to achieve the LDL‐C target of < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). These results were comparable with or slightly higher than the targets achieved with the approved PCSK9 antibodies. While the percentage of patients achieving LDL‐C targets with ongericimab at 300 mg every 4 weeks were slightly lower than those at 150 mg every 2 weeks, this dosing regimen allowed 71.2% to 71.4% of patients at extremely high risk and 78.2% to 84.1% of patients at very high risk to achieve their LDL‐C targets. The advantage of the 300 mg every 4 weeks dosing regimen lies in its ability to improve patients' long‐term compliance without additional cost, thus providing clinicians with more options to develop personalized treatment strategies on the basis of patients' blood lipid and cardiovascular risk levels.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of fenofibric acid in combination with statin therapy for the treatment of patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^117VBChk]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Co-administration of a fibrate and statin is an effective treatment option for patients with multiple lipid abnormalities, yet adequate long-term safety and efficacy data are lacking.

Objective

To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of fenofibric acid combined with statins in adults with mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods

Three large, 12-week, phase three, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials evaluated fenofibric acid 135 mg combined with a low- or moderate-dose statin compared to fenofibric acid or statin monotherapy, and a subsequent 52-week open-label extension study evaluated fenofibric acid 135 mg combined with moderate-dose statin (rosuvastatin 20 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, or atorvastatin 40 mg). This prespecified analysis integrated results from these studies to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of combination therapy.

Results

Across the controlled studies and the extension study, 2201 patients received at least one dose of fenofibric acid + statin for a median duration of 364 days. The most common adverse events were headache, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and back pain, with the incidence of all adverse events being similar across all combination therapy treatment groups. Rhabdomyolysis or treatment-related death was not reported in any group. Combination therapy resulted in sustained improvements in multiple lipid parameters, including triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

Conclusion

Long-term fenofibric acid + statin combination therapy was generally well tolerated and resulted in comprehensive and sustained improvements in multiple lipid parameters in adults with mixed dyslipidemia.

### Efficacy and safety of adding fenofibrate 160 mg in high-risk patients with mixed hyperlipidemia not controlled by pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy [^111ZP1VP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with mixed hyperlipidemia and at high risk of coronary heart disease may not achieve recommended low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol goals on statin monotherapy. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fenofibrate 160 mg/pravastatin 40 mg fixed-dose combination therapy in high-risk patients not at their LDL cholesterol goal on pravastatin 40 mg. In this 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study, after a run-in on pravastatin 40 mg, 248 patients were randomly assigned to fenofibrate/pravastatin combination therapy or to pravastatin monotherapy. Combination therapy produced significantly greater complementary decreases in non-HDL cholesterol (primary end point) than pravastatin monotherapy (-14.1% vs -6.1%, p = 0.002). Significantly greater improvements were also observed in LDL cholesterol (-11.7% vs -5.9%, p = 0.019), HDL cholesterol (+6.5% vs +2.3%, p = 0.009), triglycerides (-22.6% vs -2.0%, p = 0.006), and apolipoprotein B (-12.6% vs -3.8%, p < 0.0001). Significantly more patients receiving the fenofibrate/pravastatin combination therapy than pravastatin alone achieved the LDL cholesterol (< 100 mg/dl) and non-HDL cholesterol (< 130 mg/dl) goals (p < 0.01). Combination therapy was generally well tolerated with incidences of clinical and laboratory adverse experiences similar between the 2 groups. In conclusion, the fenofibrate 160 mg/pravastatin 40 mg fixed-dose combination therapy significantly improved the global atherogenic lipid profile in high-risk patients with mixed hyperlipidemia not controlled by pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy.

### Design and rationale of the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA trial: lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of alirocumab in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia at high cardiovascular risk [^115GxggK]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is often associated with mixed dyslipidaemia, where non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels may more closely align with cardiovascular risk than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We describe the design and rationale of the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA study that assesses the efficacy and safety of alirocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor, versus lipid-lowering usual care in individuals with T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia at high cardiovascular risk with non-HDL-C inadequately controlled despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. For the first time, atherogenic cholesterol-lowering with a PCSK9 inhibitor will be assessed with non-HDL-C as the primary endpoint with usual care as the comparator.

Methods

DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA is a Phase 3b/4, randomised, open-label, parallel group, multinational study that planned to enrol 420 individuals. Main inclusion criteria were T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia (non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dl [≥ 2.59 mmol/l], and triglycerides ≥ 150 and < 500 mg/dl [≥ 1.70 and < 5.65 mmol/l]) with documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or ≥ 1 additional cardiovascular risk factor. Participants were randomised (2:1) to alirocumab 75 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or lipid-lowering usual care on top of maximally tolerated statin (or no statin if intolerant). If randomised to usual care, investigators were able to add their pre-specified choice of one of the following to the patient's current statin regimen: ezetimibe, fenofibrate, omega-3 fatty acids or nicotinic acid, in accordance with local standard-of-care. Alirocumab-treated individuals with non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dl at week 8 will undergo a blinded dose increase to 150 mg Q2W at week 12. The primary efficacy endpoint is non-HDL-C change from baseline to week 24 with alirocumab versus usual care; other lipid levels (including LDL-C), glycaemia-related measures, safety and tolerability will also be assessed. Alirocumab will be compared to fenofibrate in a secondary analysis.

Results

Recruitment completed with 413 individuals randomised in 14 countries worldwide. Results of this trial are expected in the second quarter of 2017.

Conclusions

ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA will provide information on the efficacy and safety of alirocumab versus lipid-lowering usual care in individuals with T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia at high cardiovascular risk using non-HDL-C as the primary efficacy endpoint.

### Ezetimibe (Zetia) [^113DbuBg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ZETIA, added to on-going statin therapy, significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C compared with a statin administered alone (see Table 7). LDL-C reductions induced by ZETIA were generally consistent across all statins.

Combination with Statins: ZETIA Initiated Concurrently with a Statin

In four multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials, in 2,382 patients (age range 18 to 87 years, 57% female; 88% White, 5% Black or African American, 2% Asian, 5% other races mostly identified as Hispanic or Latino) with hyperlipidemia, ZETIA or placebo was administered alone or with various doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, or lovastatin.

When all patients receiving ZETIA with a statin were compared to all those receiving the corresponding statin alone, ZETIA significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C compared to the statin administered alone. LDL-C reductions induced by ZETIA were generally consistent across all statins. (See footnote, Tables 8 to 11 .)

Combination with Fenofibrate

In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, 625 patients (age range 20 to 76 years, 44% female; 79% White, 1% Black or African American, 20% other races; and 11% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) were treated for up to 12 weeks and 576 for up to an additional 48 weeks. Patients were randomized to receive placebo, ZETIA alone, 160 mg fenofibrate alone, or ZETIA and 160 mg fenofibrate in the 12-week trial. After completing the 12-week trial, eligible patients were assigned to ZETIA coadministered with fenofibrate or fenofibrate monotherapy for an additional 48 weeks.

### The effects of fenofibric acid alone and with statins on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its diagnostic components in patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^115HwsZu]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare fenofibric acid (FA) + statin to respective monotherapies on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its diagnostic components in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

Research Design and Methods

Post hoc analysis of over 2,000 metabolic syndrome patients administered either FA + low- or moderate-dose statin; FA alone; or low-, moderate-, or high-dose statin alone.

Results

FA + low- or moderate-dose statin combination therapy reduced the presence of metabolic syndrome (35.7 or 35.9%, respectively) more than low-, moderate-, or high-dose statin monotherapy (15.5, 16.6, or 13.8%, respectively), mostly due to improvements in triglycerides and HDL cholesterol levels. Mean glucose levels slightly decreased with FA monotherapy, slightly increased with statin monotherapy, and were essentially unchanged with FA + statin. FA with or without statin also reduced non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

Conclusions

FA + statin in patients with mixed dyslipidemia reduces the prevalence of metabolic syndrome.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Participating individuals

Eligible individuals were allocated to UC options by the investigator prior to randomization, and were subsequently randomized within each stratum to either alirocumab or UC option in a 2:1 ratio (Figure 1). A total of 413 individuals were randomized to alirocumab (n = 276) or UC (n = 137). The median daily doses of UC treatments are given in Table S1.

Figure 1
Disposition of individuals for the DM‐DYSLIPIDEMIA study. Abbreviations: ALI, alirocumab; FA, fatty acids; ITT, intention‐to‐treat; LLT, lipid‐lowering therapy; Q2W, every 2 weeks. a Thirty‐nine individuals were intended for "no LLT" prior to randomization; however, 37 actually received "no LLT". One individual intended for "no LLT" received fenofibrate and another received ezetimibe. In total, 4 individuals were not included in the ITT analysis (no non‐HDL cholesterol value available within 1 of the analysis windows up to week 24) and 1 individual was not included in the safety analysis (individual did not wish to continue prior to treatment)

Baseline characteristics and lipid variables were generally similar regardless of treatment allocation (Tables 1 and S2). At baseline, 84.0% of individuals in the alirocumab group and 76.6% in the UC group were receiving statin therapy (of these, 46.3% [alirocumab] and 36.2% [UC] were receiving high‐intensity statin). Treatment groups included 34.4% and 34.3% of individuals with a history of ASCVD and 65.6% and 65.7% without ASCVD but with additional CV risk factors in the alirocumab and UC groups, respectively (Table 1).

### Efficacy and safety of ongericimab in Chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia [^1142f8NV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The data, methods employed in the analysis, and materials used in the research are available to any researcher upon reasonable request from the corresponding author. This enables them to replicate the procedure or reproduce the results.

Study Design

This was a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group clinical trial conducted over a period of 52 weeks.

This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each study site involved in this study before patients' recruitment. In addition, an independent data monitoring committee periodically reviewed the safety data provided by an independent and external biostatistical group.

Study Patients

Briefly, this study enrolled patients aged 18 to 80 years who had been receiving stable and optimized lipid‐lowering therapy for at least 4 weeks before randomization. Optimized lipid‐lowering therapy was defined as moderate‐ or high‐intensity statins in accordance with Chinese guidelines, such as atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg/day and rosuvastatin 5 to 20 mg/day, either alone or in combination with ezetimibe. Eligible patients should have a fasting triglyceride level of ≤ 4.5 mmol/L (400 mg/dL), and a fasting LDL‐C level of at least 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL), 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL), 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), and 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for those at extremely high, very high, high, and low‐to‐moderate cardiovascular risk, respectively. Key exclusion criteria included heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, recent or planned revascularization procedures, uncontrolled hypertension, moderate‐to‐severe renal dysfunction, and active liver disease or hepatic dysfunction. All patients provided written informed consent before participating in the study.

### Alirocumab vs usual lipid-lowering care as add-on to statin therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia: the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA randomized trial [^11441FwZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Based on post hoc data from the ACCORD trial or from meta‐analyses of fibrate trials, 16, 17 many clinicians add fibrates to statins in individuals with high TGs or high TGs/low HDL cholesterol. However, in the present prespecified analyses we demonstrate that the addition of fenofibrate to statins results in little or no reduction in atherogenic lipoproteins and hence a trivial reduction in their cholesterol cargo, despite favourable but clinically modest changes in TG and HDL cholesterol. These data underscore the importance of therapeutic approaches that increase the clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins rather than other currently available therapies (apart from statins) that target either synthesis or lipolysis of TG, but which have little impact on atherogenic cholesterol levels, as demonstrated by modest improvements in non‐HDL cholesterol goal attainment.

Whilst the present data cannot be used to assess whether favourable changes in atherogenic particle clearance will translate into better clinical outcomes in patients with T2DM and atherogenic dyslipidaemia, it should be noted that UC failed to achieve non‐HDL cholesterol levels < 2.59 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL; recommended as a treatment target for individuals with T2DM in guidelines 4, 5) for the majority (82.3%). In contrast, at week 24, only 33.1% of the alirocumab group failed to achieve non‐HDL cholesterol levels < 2.59 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL). The findings were consistent with previous subgroup or post hoc analyses which have reported the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors according to mixed dyslipidaemia or diabetes status. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24

### Comparison of the effects of fibrates versus statins on plasma lipoprotein (a) concentrations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head randomized controlled trials [^117RQEgK]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Mixed dyslipidemia is characterized by high serum concentrations of total and LDL-C as well as of triglycerides. Statins and fibrates are among the first-line pharmacotherapies for mixed dyslipidemia. Findings of clinical trials have shown that the combination of statins and fibrates results in a significantly greater reduction in LDL-C and triglyceride levels and greater increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared with monotherapy with either drug. In addition, both statins and fibrates have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Moreover, these classes of drug affect different aspects of lipoprotein metabolism. Fibrates decrease serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and increase HDL-C levels in hyperlipidemic patients, thereby reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis. The main mechanisms of action of fibrates are induction of lipoprotein lipolysis, induction of hepatic fatty acid uptake and reduction of hepatic triglyceride production, enhancement of hepatic removal of LDL particles, reduction of plasma triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and elevation of HDL production.

Statins mainly act through enhancement of plasma clearance of LDL and reduction of hepatic very low-density lipoprotein production. Statins reduce hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis through inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, causing depletion of intracellular cholesterol content and resulting in an increase in the expression and density of hepatic LDL receptors.

Owing to the importance of Lp(a) as an emerging coronary risk factor, and the wide use of statins and fibrates in the management dyslipidemias, the present study aimed to compare the effects of these two classes of drugs on plasma Lp(a) concentrations through a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head clinical trials. A secondary aim was to assess if combination therapy with statins and fibrates is associated with a greater effect on plasma Lp(a) levels compared with monotherapy with either of the agents.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^114QPd75]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Fibrate drugs — gemfibrozil has been shown to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events as monotherapy in primary prevention high risk males with elevated non-HDL-C and for secondary prevention in males with below average HDL-C; the class can reduce TG and non-HDL-C in mixed dyslipidemia and is considered a first-line choice for severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL). In the ACCORD Lipid trial of fenofibrate added to a statin, no benefit was demonstrated in the full study sample compared to statin monotherapy in type 2 diabetes, but a predefined subgroup with TG in the top tertile (≥ 204 mg/dL) and HDL-C in the bottom tertile (≤ 34 mg/dL) had a significantly lower ASCVD event rate with fenofibrate compared to placebo (−29%). Gemfibrozil should not be used with statins because of a drug–drug interaction that increases the risk for myositis; fenofibrate and fenofibric acid have not been found to have this adverse event when combined with statins. Fenofibrate has been shown to reduce the progression of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy and has not been associated with incident diabetes. Fibrates should not be used in patients with stage 3B CKD or worse, and based on limited outcomes data, consideration of fenofibrate or fenofibric acid as statin combination therapy is in type 2 diabetes patients with a non-HDL-C at goal who also have retinopathy and/or microalbuminuria and who do not have stage 3B or worse CKD.

### Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol XL) [^1164ADc7]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be used in addition to
a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol (see National Cholesterol
Education Program [NCEP] Treatment Guidelines, below).

Lescol®(fluvastatin sodium) and
Lescol®XL (fluvastatin sodium) are indicated to reduce
elevated total cholesterol (Total-C), LDL-C, TG and Apo B levels, and to
increase HDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed
dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Type IIa and IIb) whose response to dietary
restriction of saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacological
measures has not been adequate.

Lescol and Lescol XL are indicated as an adjunct to diet to
reduce Total-C, LDL-C, and Apo B levels in adolescent boys and girls who are at
least one year post-menarche, 10–16 years of age, with heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia whose response to dietary restriction has not been adequate
and the following findings are present:

LDL-C remains > 190 mg/dL or
LDL-C remains > 160 mg/dL and:
there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease
or
two or more other cardiovascular disease risk factors are
present.

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be considered only after
secondary causes for hyperlipidemia such as poorly controlled diabetes mellitus,
hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease,
other medication, or alcoholism, have been excluded. Prior to initiation of
fluvastatin sodium, a lipid profile should be performed to measure Total-C,
HDL-C and TG. For patients with TG < 400 mg/dL (< 4.5 mmol/L), LDL-C can be
estimated using the following equation:

At week 24, an LDL‐C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline was achieved in 81.3% and 63.2% of patients in the ongericimab 150 mg every 2 weeks and 300 mg every 4 weeks groups, respectively, compared with 4.5% and 0.8% in the placebo groups, respectively (Table S2). The percentages of patients at low‐to‐moderate, high, very high, and extremely high cardiovascular risk who achieved LDL‐C targets in the ongericimab 150 mg every 2 weeks group were 100%, 96.4%, 91.8%, and 87.5%, respectively, which were 100%, 80%, 78.2%, and 71.2%, respectively, in the 300 mg every 4 weeks group. Even in patients at extremely high cardiovascular risk, > 70% achieved the LDL‐C target after 24 weeks of treatment with ongericimab.

### Dyslipidemia treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus in a US managed care plan: a retrospective database analysis [^111A1Qaw]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

To evaluate real-world pharmacologic treatment of mixed dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).

Methods

All commercial health plan members in a large US managed care database with complete lipid panel results (HDL-C, LDL-C, TG) between 1/1/2006 and 12/31/2006 were identified (N = 529,236). DM patients (N = 53,679) with mixed dyslipidemia were defined as having any 2 suboptimal lipid parameters (N = 28,728). Lipid treatment status 6 months pre- and post-index date was determined using pharmacy claims for any lipid therapy.

Results

Post-index, 41.1% of DM patients with 2 abnormal lipid parameters and 45.1% with 3 abnormal lipid parameters did not receive lipid-modifying treatment. Post-index treatment rates were 57.4%, 63.6%, and 66.4% for patients with LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG in the most severe quartiles, respectively. Statin monotherapy was the primary lipid-modifying regimen prescribed (54.8% and 47.8% of patients with any 2 and all 3 lipids not at goal, respectively). Less than 30% of treated patients received combination therapy.

Conclusion

Over 40% of DM patients with mixed dyslipidemia received no lipid-modifying therapy during the follow-up period. Those who were treated were primarily prescribed statin monotherapy. This study suggests that DM patients are not being treated to ADA-suggested targets.

### Omega 3 fatty acids induce a marked reduction of apolipoprotein B48 when added to fluvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia: a preliminary report [^112Yh7b3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Mixed hyperlipidemia is common in patients with diabetes. Statins, the choice drugs, are effective at reducing lipoproteins that contain apolipoprotein B100, but they fail to exert good control over intestinal lipoproteins, which have an atherogenic potential. We describe the effect of prescription omega 3 fatty acids on the intestinal lipoproteins in patients with type 2 diabetes who were already receiving fluvastatin 80 mg per day.

Methods

Patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia were recruited. Fasting lipid profile was taken when patients were treated with diet, diet plus 80 mg of fluvastatin and diet plus fluvastatin 80 mg and 4 g of prescription omega 3 fatty acids. The intestinal lipoproteins were quantified by the fasting concentration of apolipoprotein B48 using a commercial ELISA.

Results

The addition of 4 g of prescription omega 3 was followed by significant reductions in the levels of triglycerides, VLDL triglycerides and the triglyceride/HDL cholesterol ratio, and an increase in HDL cholesterol (P < 0.05). Fluvastatin induced a reduction of 26% in B100 (P < 0.05) and 14% in B48 (NS). However, the addition of omega 3 fatty acids enhanced this reduction to 32% in B100 (NS) and up to 36% in B48 (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Our preliminary findings therefore suggest an additional benefit on postprandial atherogenic particles when omega 3 fatty acids are added to standard treatment with fluvastatin.

### Alirocumab vs usual lipid-lowering care as add-on to statin therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia: the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA randomized trial [^113HWK5t]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design

ODYSSEY DM‐DYSLIPIDEMIA (NCT02642159) was a phase IIIb/IV, randomized, open‐label, parallel group, multicentre trial. The trial was conducted at 110 sites in 14 countries; screening started in March 2016 and recruitment was completed in September 2016. The study design and methods have been published previously. 13 Brief methods are summarized below and further details are provided in Appendix S1.

The trial was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles laid down by the 18th World Medical Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and all applicable amendments laid down by the World Medical Assemblies, and the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines. The trial protocol was approved by the relevant institutional review boards or independent ethics committees, and all participating individuals provided written informed consent.

2.2 Trial participants

The trial included individuals (aged ≥ 18 years) with T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia whose non‐HDL cholesterol was not adequately controlled despite stable maximally tolerated statin dose for ≥ 4 weeks prior to screening visit, without other LLTs, and who had either a documented history of ASCVD or at least 1 additional CV risk factor. Study participants had to have a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of < 9% (74.9 mmol/mol); changes to antihyperglycaemic medications were to be limited and made only in circumstances of clinical need for the duration of the study.

Mixed dyslipidaemia was defined as non‐HDL cholesterol ≥ 2.59 mmol/L (≥ 100 mg/dL) and TGs ≥ 1.70 mmol/L (150 mg/dL; but < 5.65 mmol/L [500 mg/dL]) at the screening visit. The maximally tolerated dose of statin was based on the judgment of the investigator. Individuals with documented statin intolerance (as judged by the investigator) and therefore not receiving statin therapy could also be enrolled. ASCVD was defined as coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease or ischaemic stroke. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reported previously. 13

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^113ntDGD]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This study assessed the lipid‐lowering effect and safety of combination therapy with atorvastatin (5 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) compared with monotherapy regimens in patients with dyslipidemia. The key findings of this study are as follows. (1) The A5E10 combination therapy reduced LDL‐C level by 47.6% from baseline LDL‐C after 8 weeks of treatment, which was significantly greater than the reductions achieved with atorvastatin 5 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg, or atorvastatin 10 mg monotherapy. (2) A5E10 combination therapy demonstrated a rapid onset of action, with a 46.7% reduction in LDL‐C levels observed as early as 4 weeks. By week 4, combination therapy also led to a 23.7% reduction in TG levels, a 44.3% reduction in non‐HDL‐C levels, and a 38.0% reduction in Apo B levels. (3) All lipid parameter ratios, including LDL‐C/HDL‐C, TC/HDL‐C, non‐HDL‐C/HDL‐C, and Apo B/Apo AI, showed significant changes after 4 weeks of treatment, with the most pronounced reductions observed in the A5E10 group at 8 weeks. Notably, no SAEs were observed in the combination therapy group.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^1114eTfN]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Objective

This study aimed to compare the lipid‐lowering effect and safety of low‐intensity atorvastatin (5 mg) plus ezetimibe (10 mg) combination therapy (A5E10) with monotherapy regimens–atorvastatin 5 mg [A5], ezetimibe 10 mg [E10], and atorvastatin 10 mg [A10])–in dyslipidemia patients.

Methods

A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial involving 252 dyslipidemia patients was conducted at 25 centers in South Korea (NCT05970679). Participants aged ≥ 19 years were randomized into four groups: A5E10, A5, E10, and A10. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints included changes in other lipid parameters, lipid ratios, LDL‐C goal achievement rates and safety assessments.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 63 years, and 51.2% were male. The A5E10 group showed significantly greater LDL‐C reduction (47.6%) compared with A5 (33.4%), E10 (19.4%), and A10 (40.1%) at 8 weeks (p < 0.0001). A5E10 also significantly reduced triglyceride, non‐high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels. In addition, a significant reduction in LDL‐C levels was observed over the 4 weeks, with a 46.7% reduction in LDL‐C levels after 4 weeks of A5E10 administration. No severe adverse events were observed in the A5E10 group.

Conclusion

The combination of low‐intensity atorvastatin and ezetimibe was more effective than moderate‐intensity atorvastatin monotherapy in lowering LDL‐C levels and improving other lipid parameters. It was well‐tolerated and demonstrated rapid benefits within a month, offering a promising alternative for patients with low to moderate cardiovascular risk who do not achieve adequate control with statin monotherapy.

Eicosapentaenoic acid in statin-treated adults with elevated triglycerides — In adults who are on statin and still have moderately elevated TG levels > 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), and who have either ASCVD or diabetes plus 2 additional risk factors, we suggest adding eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl ester to reduce the risk of CVD; risk factors include traditional risk factors and risk-enhancing factors, the dose of EPA ethyl ester is 4 g/day, and if EPA ethyl ester is not available or accessible, then it is reasonable to consider a fibrate. Evidence cited indicates multiple trials have failed to show any CVD benefit of 1 g/d of mixed EPA + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), whereas in a double blind RCT (REDUCE-IT) a high-risk statin treated population with LDL-C below 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) and elevated fasting TG up to 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) had reduced CVD events with EPA ethyl ester 4 g daily (relative risk reduction [RRR] 25%); the study population consisted of patients with either ASCVD, or T2D and 2 additional risk factors, and in fibrate studies subgroup analyses of patients with increased TG levels (200–499 mg/dL) and low HDL (< 40 mg/dL [1.0 mmol/L]) show benefit.

### Fixed-dose combination fenofibrate / pravastatin 160 / 40 mg versus simvastatin 20 mg monotherapy in adults with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia uncontrolled with simvastatin 20 mg: a double-blind, randomized comparative study [^115e9hjh]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mixed hyperlipidemia have an increased cardiovascular risk and may not achieve recommended LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals on statin monotherapy. This study was designed to obtain regulatory approval of a fenofibrate/pravastatin 160/40 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) capsule.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of this FDC and simvastatin 20 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm study was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia, without cardiovascular disease, and who were not at lipid goals with simvastatin 20 mg monotherapy. After a 6-week run-in period during which patients received simvastatin 20 mg, those with non-HDL-C concentrations ≥ 130 mg/dL or LDL-C concentrations ≥ 100 mg/dL and triglyceride concentrations 150 to 600 mg/dL were enrolled. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive 12-week treatment with fenofibrate/pravastatin 160/40 mg FDC or simvastatin 20 mg once daily, followed by a 12-week open-label tolerability-assessment period during which all patients received the FDC. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean percentage change in non-HDL-C after 12 weeks. Secondary efficacy outcomes included changes in other lipid and lipoprotein parameters, fibrinogen, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Tolerability was assessed based on the prevalence of adverse events and abnormal laboratory data in each treatment group.

Results

A total of 291 patients were randomized to receive fenofibrate/pravastatin (n = 145) or simvastatin (n = 146). The mean (SD) age of the participants was 56.6 (8.9) years, 48.1% were men, and the body mass index was 31.3 (4.6) kg/m(2). The FDC was associated with a significantly greater reduction in non-HDL-C (primary end point) compared with simvastatin monotherapy (-12.9% [1.8] vs -6.8% [1.8]; P = 0.008). Triglyceride (-28.6% [3.7] vs +5.0% [3.6]; P < 0.001), fibrinogen (-11.5% [1.6] vs +0.3% [1.6]; P < 0.001), and HDL-C (+6.3% [1.3] vs +1.8% [1.3]; P = 0.008) concentrations also were significantly improved with the FDC compared with simvastatin monotherapy. The proportions of patients who achieved the LDL-C target (< 100 mg/dL) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The proportion of patients who achieved the combined end point of non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL was significantly greater with fenofibrate/pravastatin compared with simvastatin monotherapy (41 [28.5%] vs 26 [17.9%]; P < 0.05). The prevalences of patients who experienced ≥ 1 adverse event were not statistically different between the fenofibrate/pravastatin and simvastatin groups (17.2% vs 15.1%). However, compared with simvastatin monotherapy, the combination treatment was associated with significantly greater increases in alanine aminotransferase (+9.6% vs +1.5%; P = 0.03 between groups), creatinine (+13.7% vs +6.8%; P = 0.002 between groups), and homocysteine (+36.5% vs +1.6%; P < 0.001 between groups) concentrations.

Conclusions

In this selected population of adults with type 2 diabetes, the fenofibrate/pravastatin 160/40 mg FDC was associated with significantly greater changes from baseline in non-HDL-C, triglyceride, and HDL-C concentrations compared with simvastatin 20 mg. Both treatments were well tolerated.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid for prevention of cardiovascular events and diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114NJGhp]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular diseases are among the principal causes of mortality, accounting for about 1 in 3 deaths in the United States. Therefore, preventive interventions from the established risk factors for such diseases are a high priority. Statins are the standard of care for lower cholesterol levels and prevention of cardiovascular events. However, statin intolerance is reported to prevalent from 7 to 29%, with the predominant symptoms being muscle-related side effects. Inability to tolerate statins leads to uncontrolled cholesterol levels and insufficient cardiovascular risk reduction. To reduce cardiovascular risk in these patients, the 2018 multisociety guidelines advocate the addition of non-statin agents.

Bempedoic acid (Esperion Therapeutics Inc, Ann Arbor, MI), as a small molecule inhibitor of ATP-citrate lyase, is an oral, once-daily, first-in-class drug being developed for the treatment of hyperlipidemia by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis. Randomized clinical trials have shown the efficacy of bempedoic acid treatment on lowering low-density lipoprotein–cholesterol. Thus, the drug has been listed in the future perspectives of 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for new approaches to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved bempedoic acid for the treatment of adults who require additional low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol lowering, and European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended approval bempedoic acid to treat adults with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. However, the benefites of bempedoic acid are limited, because current trials have not proved the potential benefits of bempedoic acid use for prevention of cardiovascular events. The primary criticisms of those trials have been small numbers of events, raising the probability of a type II error. We performed the systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the potential benefit and safety of bempedoic acid use for the prevention of cardiovascular events.

### Meta-analysis of safety of the coadministration of statin with fenofibrate in patients with combined hyperlipidemia [^117K93fA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Addition of fenofibrate to statin therapy might represent a viable treatment option for patients whose high risk for coronary heart disease is not controlled by a statin alone. However, safety of coadministration of statin with fenofibrate has been a great concern. The present study tested the safety of coadministration of statin with fenofibrate. We systematically searched the literature to identify randomized controlled trials examining safety of coadministration of statin with fenofibrate. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate safety of coadministration of statin with fenofibrate using fixed-effects models. There were 1,628 subjects in the identified 6 studies. Discontinuation attributed to any adverse events (4.5% vs 3.1%, p = 0.20), any adverse events (42% vs 41%, p = 0.82), adverse events related to study drug (10.9% vs 11.0%, p = 0.95), and serious adverse events (2.0% vs 1.5%, p = 0.71) were not significantly different in the 2 arms. Incidence of alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 3 times upper limit of normal in the combination therapy arm was significantly higher than in the statin monotherapy arm (3.1% vs 0.2%, p = 0.0009). In the 6 trials with 1,628 subjects no case of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis was reported. In conclusion, statin-fenofibrate combination therapy was tolerated as well as statin monotherapy. Physicians should consider statin-fenofibrate combination therapy to treat patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

### Omega 3 fatty acids induce a marked reduction of apolipoprotein B48 when added to fluvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia: a preliminary report [^115wLsu4]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Backgorund

Mixed hyperlipidemia is common in patients with diabetes. Statins, the choice drugs, are effective at reducing lipoproteins that contain apolipoprotein B100, but they fail to exert good control over intestinal lipoproteins, which have an atherogenic potential. We describe the effect of prescription omega 3 fatty acids on the intestinal lipoproteins in patients with type 2 diabetes who were already receiving fluvastatin 80 mg per day.

Methods

Patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia were recruited. Fasting lipid profile was taken when patients were treated with diet, diet plus 80 mg of fluvastatin and diet plus fluvastatin 80 mg and 4 g of prescription omega 3 fatty acids. The intestinal lipoproteins were quantified by the fasting concentration of apolipoprotein B48 using a commercial ELISA.

Results

The addition of 4 g of prescription omega 3 was followed by significant reductions in the levels of triglycerides, VLDL triglycerides and the triglyceride/HDL cholesterol ratio, and an increase in HDL cholesterol (P < 0.05). Fluvastatin induced a reduction of 26% in B100 (P < 0.05) and 14% in B48 (NS). However, the addition of omega 3 fatty acids enhanced this reduction to 32% in B100 (NS) and up to 36% in B48 (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Our preliminary findings therefore suggest an additional benefit on postprandial atherogenic particles when omega 3 fatty acids are added to standard treatment with fluvastatin.
