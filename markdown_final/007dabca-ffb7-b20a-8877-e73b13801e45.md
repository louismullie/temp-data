## Question

Mitral valve disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about mitral valve disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and classify mitral valve disease. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and natural history, especially the differences between primary and secondary mitral regurgitation. Next, I will review diagnostic strategies and severity assessment, including pitfalls and when to use TEE or CMR. After that, I need to examine management principles, including medical therapy, surgical timing, and transcatheter options. Finally, I should consider special populations, controversies, and a practical decision framework, and I will double-check key thresholds and guideline nuances as I go.

> Let me first confirm the classification and epidemiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Mitral valve disease spans mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, and mixed disease, with MR being the most common valvular lesion in adults, particularly in older populations, and prevalence rising with age; in the U.S., moderate or severe MR is present in about 6.4% of adults aged 65–75 and 9.3% of those ≥ 75 years, which underscores the aging burden and the need for proactive detection and referral [^b49f21d7] [^4d8475ca]. I should also distinguish primary MR, due to leaflet/chordal pathology such as degenerative prolapse, from secondary MR, due to LV remodeling and annular dilation in cardiomyopathy or ischemia, because mechanism drives both prognosis and therapy [^993f5e13] [^782290fe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms without anchoring them to outcomes. In chronic primary MR, a pure volume overload state produces eccentric hypertrophy and supranormal ejection fraction early, but over time leads to LV dilation, fibrosis, and systolic dysfunction; importantly, once symptoms or LV dysfunction emerge, prognosis worsens even if EF appears "normal", which is why timing of intervention matters [^632bbcad] [^8adc1b03]. In secondary MR, the valve is structurally normal and MR severity is dynamic, fluctuating with loading, ischemia, and rhythm; importantly, correcting MR alone may not improve survival if the underlying LV disease is advanced, so I need to ensure GDMT and CRT optimization precede any valve intervention [^632bbcad] [^61ca9a30].

> I will now examine diagnostic strategy and severity grading, and I should double-check the role of integrated echocardiography. Transthoracic echocardiography is first-line to define etiology, mechanism, and severity; however, severity can be overestimated by color Doppler on a single frame, so I should integrate multiple parameters and, when uncertain, use TEE or CMR to quantify regurgitant volume and fraction, with CMR offering high reproducibility for RVol/RF and LV volumes when TTE is suboptimal [^be050e8d] [^b5ab6683]. Wait, let me verify the thresholds for severe MR: for primary MR, specific anatomic markers like flail leaflet or torn chordae indicate severe disease, whereas for secondary MR, an effective regurgitant orifice ≥ 0.40 cm², regurgitant volume ≥ 60 mL, and regurgitant fraction ≥ 50% define severe, though low-flow states can confound these metrics and warrant caution [^9ee14c98] [^a0f2a9c3].

> Next, I should review management principles, starting with primary MR, and I need to ensure I align with guideline triggers. For severe symptomatic primary MR, surgery is indicated regardless of LV function; for asymptomatic patients, intervention is indicated when LVEF is ≤ 60% or LVESD is ≥ 40 mm, or when pulmonary hypertension (PASP > 50 mmHg), new AF, or progressive LV remodeling are present; when none of these are present, early repair is reasonable if the likelihood of durable repair exceeds 95% and expected mortality is < 1% at a valve center [^2a3bcb28] [^d4e8ff2e]. Let me reconsider the timing nuance: the ideal window is before irreversible LV dysfunction, so if EF is drifting toward 60% or LVESD toward 40 mm, that is the time to act rather than wait for overt symptoms, which often lag behind structural decline [^8adc1b03] [^635a821e].

> I should confirm the preferred operative approach and expected outcomes. Mitral valve repair is the procedure of choice for degenerative primary MR when feasible, with posterior leaflet disease showing excellent durability and anterior or bileaflet disease increasingly repairable in experienced hands; at high-volume centers, operative mortality for isolated posterior leaflet repair is < 1% with > 95% freedom from reoperation and > 80% freedom from recurrent moderate or severe MR at 15–20 years, which supports early referral to repair-capable centers [^48ea3393] [^635a821e]. But wait, what if anatomy is unfavorable or repair is unlikely? In that scenario, replacement may be necessary, yet even then, outcomes are better when performed at comprehensive valve centers with robust surgical expertise and multidisciplinary support [^d973a0b5].

> Now, for secondary MR, I need to ensure I don't conflate it with primary disease. The cornerstone is guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure, including ACEi/ARB/ARNI, beta-blockers, MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors, with CRT for eligible patients; rhythm control for AF and revascularization when indicated can reduce MR severity in a meaningful fraction, so device therapy is reserved for persistent symptoms despite optimized care [^94bb6934] [^b928684b]. Hold on, I should verify the role of surgery: isolated mitral surgery for secondary MR has not consistently improved survival, though it may improve symptoms and quality of life in selected patients; thus, decisions should be individualized by a heart team, and chordal-sparing replacement may outperform downsized annuloplasty repair in ischemic SMR due to lower recurrence rates [^61ca9a30] [^f2c91b0d].

> Let me consider transcatheter options, and I should confirm indications and anatomy. Edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is reasonable for high or prohibitive surgical risk patients with severe primary MR and favorable anatomy, and for select secondary MR patients who remain symptomatic despite optimized GDMT and CRT; favorable features include grasping zone ≥ 10 mm without calcification, flail width < 15 mm, flail gap < 10 mm, and coaptation depth < 11 mm with overlap > 2 mm for secondary MR, and durability to about 5 years has been reported in degenerative disease [^362ccdb3] [^e1f65020] [^c6e4bf00]. I should double-check outcomes: in COAPT, TEER reduced heart failure hospitalizations and mortality in secondary MR, whereas MITRA-FR was neutral, likely reflecting differences in patient selection and LV volumes, reinforcing the need for careful screening and heart team consensus [^b928684b].

> I need to check special populations and controversies so I don't overgeneralize. In asymptomatic severe primary MR with preserved LV function, watchful waiting is acceptable, but emerging data suggest that early surgery in flail-leaflet disease improves long-term survival and reduces heart failure, supporting a lower threshold when repair is highly likely; still, randomized data are limited, so shared decision-making is essential [^7fa90bd3] [^8b1857fb]. In women, there are concerning disparities with underdiagnosis, delayed referral, and worse unadjusted outcomes, which argues for proactive screening and equitable access to valve centers [^ec21cc6f]. In pregnancy, most patients with severe MR tolerate gestation, but high-risk features like LV dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension warrant referral to a comprehensive valve center for individualized planning [^86664fe5].

> Next, I should review follow-up cadence and surveillance so I don't miss progression. For asymptomatic severe primary MR, TTE every 6–12 months is recommended to monitor LV size and function and pulmonary pressures, with closer intervals if parameters are changing; biomarkers and global longitudinal strain can be considered adjuncts, though evidence is evolving [^25acff61]. For moderate MR, reassessment every 1–2 years is reasonable, and for mild disease, every 3–5 years suffices in stable patients, with earlier checks if symptoms or new AF arise [^f0492da5].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will sanity-check each branch. First, confirm etiology and mechanism with high-quality echocardiography and, if needed, TEE or CMR; second, quantify severity using integrated parameters and correct for loading conditions; third, stage disease by symptoms, LV size/function, and pulmonary pressures; fourth, refer early to a multidisciplinary heart team at a valve center; fifth, for primary MR, favor repair when feasible and intervene before LV dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension; for secondary MR, optimize GDMT and CRT first, then consider TEER or surgery in persistent symptomatic patients with suitable anatomy; finally, embed shared decision-making and longitudinal surveillance into the plan [^64f0e363] [^271149b0] [^c6413ce6].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the key takeaways so nothing critical is lost. Mitral valve disease is common and heterogeneous, with primary MR often curable by durable repair when timed correctly, whereas secondary MR requires a heart failure–first approach with selective device therapy; accurate imaging, mechanism-specific management, and early referral to experienced valve centers are the pillars of improving outcomes and closing the substantial care gaps that still exist [^541271eb] [^7a240551] [^c6e4bf00].

---

Mitral valve disease is best understood as a **mechanism-based spectrum** with primary degenerative MR (prolapse/flail) and secondary functional MR (LV remodeling) as the principal entities, each requiring distinct diagnostic and therapeutic approaches [^782290fe] [^632bbcad]. Accurate **echocardiographic quantification** of severity, mechanism, and ventricular impact is essential, with TTE as first-line and TEE or CMR when TTE is inadequate or discordant [^be050e8d] [^b5ab6683]. For severe primary MR, early **mitral valve repair** at experienced centers is preferred when feasible, as it restores life expectancy and reduces heart failure; transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is reserved for high surgical risk or select secondary MR cases [^2a3bcb28] [^362ccdb3]. Secondary MR management centers on **GDMT, CRT, and rhythm control**, with transcatheter therapy considered only for persistent symptoms despite optimization; surgery is rarely indicated and does not improve survival [^950a8b61] [^61ca9a30]. Follow-up should be tailored to severity and ventricular status, with periodic TTE and prompt referral to a Heart Valve Center for complex anatomy or intervention decisions [^25acff61] [^c6413ce6].

---

## Classification and etiology

Mitral valve disease is broadly classified into **primary (organic)** and **secondary (functional)** categories:

| **Category** | **Etiology** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary MR | - Degenerative mitral valve disease (MVP, flail leaflet) <br/> - Infective endocarditis <br/> - Rheumatic heart disease <br/> - Trauma | Structural abnormalities of the mitral valve apparatus (leaflets, chordae, annulus, papillary muscles) causing regurgitation [^782290fe] |
| Secondary MR | - Ischemic cardiomyopathy <br/> - Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy <br/> - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy | LV remodeling and dysfunction causing leaflet tethering and annular dilation, leading to regurgitation [^632bbcad] |

---

## Pathophysiology

Primary MR causes **volume overload** with eccentric LV hypertrophy and progressive LV dysfunction, while secondary MR reflects LV disease with MR both a consequence and driver of adverse remodeling [^632bbcad]. Both mechanisms can lead to heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary hypertension if untreated [^f0492da5].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients may be asymptomatic or present with:

- Dyspnea
- Fatigue
- Palpitations
- Edema
- Orthopnea
- Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea

Physical examination often reveals a **holosystolic murmur** at the apex radiating to the axilla, with a soft S1 and prominent S2 [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Echocardiography

Echocardiography is the **cornerstone of diagnosis and severity assessment**:

- **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)**: First-line for initial diagnosis, severity grading, and serial follow-up [^be050e8d].
- **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)**: Superior for detailed valve anatomy, especially when TTE is suboptimal or for surgical planning [^be050e8d].
- **Three-dimensional echocardiography**: Enhances anatomical assessment and procedural planning [^be050e8d].

---

### Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)

CMR is valuable when echocardiography is inconclusive or discordant, providing **accurate quantification** of regurgitant volume, regurgitant fraction, and ventricular volumes [^b5ab6683].

---

### Exercise testing

Exercise echocardiography or cardiopulmonary testing can unmask symptoms, reveal dynamic MR, and assess **functional capacity** in seemingly asymptomatic patients [^84abfffb].

---

## Management strategies

### Medical management

Medical therapy is primarily for symptom control and optimizing **LV function**, particularly in secondary MR:

- **Diuretics**: For congestion and symptom relief.
- **ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: Reduce afterload and LV remodeling.
- **Beta-blockers**: Improve symptoms and reduce remodeling.
- **Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)**: Essential in secondary MR to reduce MR severity and improve outcomes [^94bb6934].

---

### Surgical management

#### Primary MR

- **Mitral valve repair**: Preferred over replacement due to superior long-term outcomes, lower operative mortality, and improved survival [^2a3bcb28] [^48ea3393].
- **Indications**: Symptomatic severe MR, asymptomatic severe MR with LV dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 60% or LVESD ≥ 40 mm), or progressive LV enlargement [^2a3bcb28] [^271149b0].
- **Early surgery**: Considered in asymptomatic patients with severe MR and high likelihood of durable repair (> 95%) at experienced centers [^d4e8ff2e].

---

#### Secondary MR

Surgery is generally reserved for patients undergoing concomitant **CABG** or with persistent symptoms despite optimized medical therapy, as isolated mitral surgery does not improve survival [^61ca9a30] [^f2c91b0d].

---

### Transcatheter interventions

Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (**MitraClip**) is indicated for:

- **Primary MR**: High or prohibitive surgical risk patients with severe symptoms [^362ccdb3].
- **Secondary MR**: Persistent symptoms despite optimized GDMT and CRT, with favorable anatomy [^362ccdb3] [^94bb6934].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to detect disease progression and guide timely intervention. Asymptomatic severe primary MR warrants **TTE every 6–12 months**, whereas moderate MR is reassessed every 1–2 years; secondary MR follow-up is dictated by the underlying cardiomyopathy and symptom status [^25acff61] [^f0492da5].

---

## Prognosis

Untreated severe MR is associated with **significant morbidity and mortality**, including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, and reduced life expectancy [^f0492da5]. Early, durable repair in primary MR restores life expectancy to that of the general population, whereas secondary MR prognosis remains guarded and is primarily driven by the underlying LV disease [^3f86a4be] [^61ca9a30].

---

## Emerging trends and future directions

- **Improved imaging**: Advanced echocardiography, CMR, and CT enhance diagnosis and procedural planning [^b5ab6683].
- **Transcatheter technologies**: Expanding indications and development of new devices for both primary and secondary MR [^541271eb].
- **Personalized medicine**: Genetic and biomarker research may refine risk stratification and guide therapy [^028f666d].

---

Mitral valve disease spans primary and secondary MR, each requiring **mechanism-specific management**. Early, accurate diagnosis and **timely intervention** — especially repair for primary MR — are critical to improving outcomes, while secondary MR care prioritizes GDMT and selective transcatheter therapy.

### A pathoanatomic approach to the management of mitral regurgitation [^da094728]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Mitral regurgitation remains the most common global valvular heart disease. From otherwise unsuspecting healthy patients without overt symptoms to those with recalcitrant heart failure, mitral valve (MV) disease touches millions of patients per year. While MV prolapse without regurgitation remains benign, once regurgitation begins, quantification of severity is related to prognosis. Understanding the mechanism of regurgitation guides appropriate treatment. Current management guidelines emphasize early therapy after careful assessment of both anatomy and severity of mitral regurgitation. The objective of this review is to provide an update on the treatment of MV disease and to offer additional granularity on pathoanatomic decision making that may aid a more precise application of optimal guideline-directed therapy of primary and secondary mitral regurgitation.

### Mitral valve prolapse [^f8e264e9]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Mitral valve prolapse is a common valvular abnormality that is the most common cause of severe non-ischaemic mitral regurgitation in the USA. The overall prognosis of patients with mitral valve prolapse is excellent, but a small subset will develop serious complications, including infective endocarditis, sudden cardiac death, and severe mitral regurgitation. We present a comprehensive review of mitral valve prolapse, examining normal mitral anatomy, the clinical and echocardiographic features of mitral valve prolapse, and the pathophysiology and genetics of the disorder. We discuss the contemporary management of both asymptomatic and symptomatic prolapse, with particular attention to the timing and technique of surgical repair. We conclude that echocardiography is the method of choice for diagnosing mitral valve prolapse, that clinical and echocardiographic features can predict which patients with prolapse are at highest risk for complications, and that mitral valve repair is the treatment of choice for symptomatic prolapse.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a complex valve lesion that can pose significant management challenges for the cardiovascular clinician. This Expert Consensus Document emphasizes that recognition of MR should prompt an assessment of its etiology, mechanism, and severity, as well as indications for treatment. A structured approach to evaluation based on clinical findings, precise echocardiographic imaging, and when necessary, adjunctive testing, can help clarify decision making. Treatment goals include timely intervention by an experienced heart team to prevent left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, reduced quality of life, and premature death.

### Degenerative mitral valve regurgitation: best practice revolution [^0a5e6933]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Degenerative mitral valve disease often leads to leaflet prolapse due to chordal elongation or rupture, and resulting in mitral valve regurgitation. Guideline referral for surgical intervention centres primarily on symptoms and ventricular dysfunction. The recommended treatment for degenerative mitral valve disease is mitral valve reconstruction, as opposed to valve replacement with a bioprosthetic or mechanical valve, because valve repair is associated with improved event free survival. Recent studies have documented a significant number of patients are not referred in a timely fashion according to established guidelines, and when they are subjected to surgery, an alarming number of patients continue to undergo mitral valve replacement. The debate around appropriate timing of intervention for asymptomatic severe mitral valve regurgitation has put additional emphasis on targeted surgeon referral and the need to ensure a very high rate of mitral valve repair, particularly in the non-elderly population. Current clinical practice remains suboptimal for many patients, and this review explores the need for a 'best practice revolution' in the field of degenerative mitral valve regurgitation.

### Mitral valve regurgitation in the contemporary era: insights into diagnosis, management, and future directions [^25a697db]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Mitral valve regurgitation (MR) is the most common valvular heart disease. Primary MR is a disease of the mitral valve apparatus, whereas secondary MR is a disease of the left ventricle. Diagnosing and managing MR is often challenging and requires a structured approach, integrating findings on history, physical examination, and imaging. Decisions regarding treatment depend on knowledge of the etiology, natural history, and outcome of interventions for these patients with mitral valve disease. The optimal timing of intervention requires a comprehensive 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiogram in each patient to determine the cause of the mitral valve disease, the severity of the regurgitation, and the effect of the volume overload on the left ventricle, as well as determining if a durable valve repair can be performed. Advances in both surgical and catheter-based therapies have resulted in recommendations for lower thresholds for operation and extension of interventional treatments to the older, sicker population of patients with MR. The current review discusses the pathophysiological rationale for current diagnostic and management strategies in MR.

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^de71a340]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

When mitral regurgitation becomes heart failure is also heterogeneously defined in the literature. For the purposes of discussion here, and based on our interpretation of the guidelines, the development of heart failure in a patient with mitral regurgitation would hinge on the development of the clinical symptoms of heart failure (eg, dyspnea, exercise intolerance), which is denoted “Severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation” by the 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines on the management of patients with valvular heart disease executive summary.Indeed, many studies that describe the outcomes of patients with severe mitral regurgitation describe the severity of symptoms using the New York Heart Association functional criteria for heart failure.This of course makes it difficult to delineate the 2 disorders from one another.

Because heart failure is defined in many ways, and as a result of the inter‐relatedness of heart failure and mitral regurgitation, it is difficult to estimate the risk of developing heart failure in patients with MVP; nonetheless studies have tried to do so. In the Olmstead study of 833 patients with asymptomatic MVP, 5.7% developed heart failure that was determined to be a result of their disease. In the same study, however, 66 patients had mitral valve surgery, which may demonstrate additional patients who initially developed symptoms of heart failure, but who met criteria for surgery.In another cohort of patients with mitral regurgitation that that met criteria for valve surgery, a third of patients went on to develop heart failure within 10 years, but in the same cohort, 370 out of 576 patients, or nearly 2 in 3 patients, had a diagnosis of heart failure before their surgery,presumably because of the presence of symptoms of heart failure. In an editorial in 2018, Gillam et al further highlighted the problems with using presence of symptoms as a tool for diagnosis of symptomatic mitral regurgitation/heart failure. They argue that it can be difficult to differentiate the patient with severe regurgitation who is “at risk” for heart failure (meaning in New York Heart Association class 1, but without symptoms) from someone who meets criteria for a diagnosis of heart failure because patients with mild exercise intolerance will subconsciously curtail the amount of physical activity they engage in.In a nationwide hospital‐based registry study, Andell et al found that 39.3% of patients with a diagnosis of mitral regurgitation had a coexistent diagnosis of heart failure, yet they also point out that this is a 2‐way street; primary MR reduces effective stroke volume and causes heart failure, but mitral regurgitation can also result from annular dilation secondary to left ventricular dilation in heart failure or ischemic heart disease.For the purposes of this review, we focused primarily on the mechanisms through which primary regurgitation can cause worsening left and right heart function, and eventually cause heart failure.

### Valve disease: asymptomatic mitral regurgitation: does surgery save lives? [^8b1857fb]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Management of asymptomatic patients with severe mitral valve regurgitation is controversial-conservative surveillance and early mitral valve repair have both been advocated as reasonable approaches on the basis of divergent data. a new study by Kang et al. fuels this debate. However, careful assessment of the existing literature can provide insight into the optimal care of this population of patients.

### Watchful waiting for severe mitral regurgitation [^d785dfe2]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Watchful waiting is an established treatment strategy for asymptomatic patients with severe organic mitral regurgitation. It is based on indications for surgery that are based on current European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline recommendations, which are defined by symptom onset, impairment of left ventricular function, and left ventricular enlargement. Excellent outcome is achieved when patients are periodically followed with clinical and echocardiographic examinations and when surgery is performed in expert centers. The strategy is based on the recognition of mitral regurgitation at an early symptomatic stage, avoiding a delayed referral of these patients. There is an ongoing debate about whether surgery should be performed in asymptomatic patients with preserved ventricular function. Ultimately, decision-making needs to be individualized and to take individual patient-related factors and local resources (including the natural history of the disease, the risk of surgery, and the likelihood of successful mitral valve repair) into consideration to obtain an optimal outcome with medical and surgical management.

### Misconceptions and facts about mitral regurgitation [^90b74add]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Mitral regurgitation is a common heart valve disease. It is defined to be primary when it results from the pathology of the mitral valve apparatus itself and secondary when it is caused by distortion of the architecture or function of the left ventricle. Although the diagnosis and management of mitral regurgitation rely heavily on echocardiography, one should bear in mind the caveats and shortcomings of such an approach. Clinical decision making commonly focuses on the indications for surgery, but it is complex and mandates precise assessment of the mitral pathology, symptom status of the patient, and ventricular performance (right and left) among other descriptors. It is important for healthcare providers at all levels to be familiar with the clinical picture, diagnosis, disease course, and management of mitral regurgitation.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) definitions and diagnostic foundation—evaluation and management algorithms in this document flow from an echocardiographically validated diagnosis of MR, and primary, secondary, and mixed MR are delineated by mechanism. Primary MR is defined by principal involvement of the leaflets and/or chordae tendineae in the pathological process, secondary MR is characterized by incompetence due to adverse changes in LV size, shape, or function with or without annular dilatation, and mixed MR is due to both primary and secondary causes. It is now recognized that primary and secondary MR are different diseases with different outcomes and indications for treatment, and the writing committee emphasized the need for additional testing when severity could not be established with certainty.

### Degenerative mitral valve regurgitation: best practice revolution [^48f5980b]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Degenerative mitral valve disease is a common disorder affecting around 2% of the population.The most common finding in patients with degenerative valve disease is leaflet prolapse due to elongation or rupture of the chordal apparatus, resulting in varying degrees of mitral valve regurgitation due to leaflet malcoaptation during ventricular contraction. The emphasis of clinical decision-making in patients with degenerative disease centres around the severity of regurgitation and its impact on symptom status, ventricular function and dimension, the sequelae of systolic flow reversal such as atrial dilatation/fibrillation and secondary pulmonary hypertension, and the risk of sudden death. –

Controversy exists as to whether early surgical intervention in asymptomatic patients, before the onset of ventricular changes, improves the outcome of patients with chronic severe degenerative mitral valve disease. – This debate has put emphasis on the lack of predictability of mitral valve repair, despite broad consensus that this is the procedure of choice for patients undergoing surgical intervention. The confidence gap in predicting successful mitral valve repair is one of the factors responsible for the lack of adherence to guidelines directed toward timely referral of patients with indications for surgery. An emerging accord is building that current medical and surgical practice often results in suboptimal care for the individual patient with degenerative mitral valve disease, and indeed a paradigm shift or ‘revolution’ through education is not only predictable but essential to advance the field. All practicing cardiovascular specialists should have familiarity with the ‘state of art’ in terms of degenerative disease differentiation, timing of intervention, and surgical techniques and results in order to improve patient care.

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^6ce71ec2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Second, MVP can also cause left ventricular dysfunction, and systolic heart failure.Although patients with severe regurgitation, may have a completely “normal” ejection fraction, this doesn't reflect the true underlying hemodynamic alterations that are occurring. To do a quick calculation, in severe regurgitation (defined in the Framingham Heart Study as regurgitant jet area >40% of the volume of the LA), assuming a normal left atrial volume index of ≈41 mL/m 2 for a male patient, ≈16 mL of blood would be regurgitated with each beat of the ventricle. Assuming a normal ventricular stroke volume index of 65 mL/m 2, ≈25% of the blood ejected from the heart each beat is flowing from LV to LA. This implies that only 75% of the blood ejected with each beat makes it to systemic circulation, and therefore, the cardiac output has to increase 33% to pump enough blood in the forward direction to meet the body's metabolic demands. The initial response by the LV is a compensatory increase in left ventricular end‐diastolic volume and force of contraction supported by the frank starling mechanism,but chronically, this volume overload causes increased LV wall stress, LV hypertrophy, fibrosis, increases in LV afterload, and a gradually worsening systolic function.The best evidence that ventricular systolic dysfunction exists in patients with severe mitral regurgitation is the acute decline in ejection fraction that occurs in patients just after mitral valve surgery.,Even further, patients with impaired preoperative ejection fraction had a much more drastic reduction in ejection fraction with their operation, and patients with a more significant reduction in ejection fraction carried a worse prognosis.In a prospective study of asymptomatic patients with severe mitral regurgitation, immediate surgical correction was compared with a conventional treatment strategy that waited to perform surgery until they developed symptoms (exertional dyspnea), or they experienced a declination in ejection fraction (<60), an increase in LV end systolic diameter (>45 mm), AF, or pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary arterial pressure >50 mm Hg). In follow‐up, conventional management resulted in an estimated actuarial 7‐year cardiac mortality rate of 5%, compared with 0% with immediate surgery.As such, the 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology focused update on the management of valvular heart disease guidelines state that surgical intervention in a patient with a normal ejection fractionF (>60%) who has increasing LV size or worsening ejection fractionF is reasonable, since an ejection fractionF <60% indicates these patients are already in LV dysfunction.

### Mitral valve prolapse: implications for the primary care (...) [^ab177551]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

A 72-year-old man presented with acute pulmonary edema after having had fever and constitutional symptoms for one week. He was found to have severe mitral regurgitation associated with a ruptured mitral chord and infective endocarditis. The patient required medical treatment and subsequent mitral valve surgery. A 32-year-old woman presented with palpitations and atypical chest pain. She had multiple systolic clicks on auscultation of the heart. Both of these patients had a diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse, but do they have the same disease. 1 in 1966, this disease entity has generated more than 4, 000 scientific articles describing its high prevalence and a number of associated complications. In the echocardiographic literature, mitral valve prolapse was diagnosed in almost one third of young women, which would suggest that it is a normal variant.

Yet mitral valve prolapse has been associated with complications such as cerebral embolic events, infective endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation requiring mitral valve surgery and even sudden death. 3, 5, 6 At the far end of the spectrum, patients may have the true disease of mitral valve prolapse, with thickened, redundant, floppy mitral valve leaflets and myxomatous proliferation. These patients are usually older men or persons with connective tissue disease who are at risk for severe mitral regurgitation, chordal rupture, infective endocarditis and sudden death. It has been subsequently established that the normal mitral annulus is shaped like a saddle, so the mitral valve leaflets in normal persons will appear to bulge into the left atrium on certain image views.

Thus, the criteria for mitral valve prolapse on echocardiography should be a systolic displacement of at least 2 mm of one or both leaflets into the left atrium, and this should be visible in views other than the apical four-chamber view. Alternatively, patients who present with a loud holosystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation and the diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse should have a comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation. Longstanding mitral regurgitation creates a volume overload on the left ventricle, which eventually can lead to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure. Prophylaxis for infective endocarditis is warranted only in those patients with the true disease of thickened redundant mitral leaflets, mitral regurgitation, or both.

### Controversies in valvular heart disease: insights from cardiac imaging [^5331dc1f]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Numerous controversies still exist in the diagnosis and management of valvular heart disease, for example, the benefit of treating moderate aortic stenosis (AS) or asymptomatic, severe AS and the appropriate selection criteria for transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair. While numerous imaging parameters have been linked to the risk of sudden cardiac death in mitral valve prolapse, their relative merits are unknown and this is a challenging population to risk-stratify. No large, randomized data exist to guide selection of patients for transcatheter repair of tricuspid regurgitation or valve intervention in severe pulmonary regurgitation. Multimodality cardiac imaging provides unique insights into these important questions.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) disease burden, staging, and focus—MR is the most common type of moderate or severe heart valve disease among U.S. adults older than 55 years. The guideline emphasizes disease staging wherein patients are classified as being at risk for developing MR (Stage A), having mild or moderate MR that may progress over time (Stage B), having asymptomatic severe MR (Stage C) with normal (C1) or reduced (C2) LV function, or having symptomatic severe MR (Stage D). This ECDP document focuses on the evaluation and management of patients with MR with specific emphasis on 1) clinical assessment; 2) proper identification of the etiology and mechanism of MR; 3) determination of MR severity; 4) assessment of the feasibility of surgical or transcatheter intervention in appropriate patients; and 5) indications for consideration of referral to a regional, comprehensive valve center, and within each section, clear and precise terminology is recommended for communicating the essential features of MR in the medical record. Because patients with acute MR typically present with hemodynamic compromise for which the need for urgent intervention is well-recognized, this document focuses on chronic MR.

### Treatment and management of mitral regurgitation [^2c5174a7]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most-common valvular heart disease in the western world. From an etiologic point of view, MR can be either organic (mainly degenerative in western countries) or functional (secondary to left ventricular remodeling in the context of ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy). Degenerative and functional MR are completely different disease entities that pose specific decision-making problems and require different management. The natural history of severe degenerative MR is clearly unfavorable. However, the appropriate and timely correction of degenerative MR is associated with a life expectancy similar to that of the normal population. By contrast, the prognostic impact of the correction of functional MR is still a matter of debate. In this Review, we discuss the optimal treatment of both degenerative and functional MR, taking into account all presently available therapeutic options, including novel percutaneous methods. Since a clear understanding of the etiology and mechanisms of valvular dysfunction is important to guide the timing and choice of treatment, the role of echocardiography in the management of MR is also addressed.

In light of the adverse prognosis related to severe mitral regurgitation, heart failure, or sudden cardiac death in a subset of patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP), identifying those at higher risk is key. For the first time in decades, researchers have the means to rapidly advance discovery in the field of MVP thanks to state-of-the-art imaging techniques, novel omics methodologies, and the potential for large-scale collaborations using web-based platforms. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recently initiated a webinar-based workshop to identify contemporary research opportunities in the treatment of MVP. This report summarizes 3 specific areas in the treatment of MVP that were the focus of the workshop: 1) improving management of degenerative mitral regurgitation and associated left ventricular systolic dysfunction; 2) preventing sudden cardiac death in MVP; and 3) understanding the mechanisms and progression of MVP through genetic studies and small and large animal models, with the potential of developing medical therapies.

### Research opportunities in the treatment of mitral valve prolapse: JACC expert panel [^b2ec97ef]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common heritable valvulopathy affecting over 170 million individuals worldwide. It is the direct cause of degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR), which represents the most frequent form of mitral regurgitation (MR) requiring surgery. MVP is characterized by fibromyxomatous changes, defined structurally by expansion of the middle spongiosa layer of leaflets caused by proteoglycan accumulation, structural alterations of collagen in all components of the leaflet, and by abnormal chordae. Macroscopically, MVP is characterized by redundant mitral valve (MV) tissue, which clinically translates by echocardiography in a displacement ≥2 mm of 1 or both leaflets beyond the annular high points at end-systole toward the left atrium (Central Illustration). - Leaflet displacement may yield malcoaptation and consequent DMR. Although most individuals with MVP in the general population have mild or no MR,severe DMR affects 10% of subjects in MVP cohortsand up to 25% in longitudinal samples in association with aging. MV repair is generally associated with low risk, superior late survival to valve replacement, and when performed before symptoms and before development of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction,to restoration of life expectancy. However, early surgery remains a Class II indication for low-risk patients based on current valvular guidelines.Hence, risk stratification and management of older, higher-risk patients remains challenging.

Recent studies have emphasized the risk of ventricular arrhythmias associated with MVP. Overall, 0.4% to 1.8% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD) every year (32,000-152,000/y in the United States alone). Far more patients (up to 30%) have frequent ventricular ectopy and/or syncope,hence the uncertainty regarding whether they are at risk for SCA. Severe DMR explains only 20% of SCD cases in MVP.SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a malignant bileaflet phenotype with mitral annular disjunction (MAD), abnormal valvular-myocardial interactions, and LV fibrosis, even in the absence of severe DMR (Central Illustration). - Complex ventricular ectopy is a common feature of malignant MVP (with or without severe DMR),and is associated with higher mortality.However, routine monitoring for ventricular arrhythmias is currently not recommended in valvular guidelines. Indications for implantation of a primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in MVP or valve interventions to reduce arrhythmias are lacking.

### Surgical and transcatheter mitral valve repair for severe chronic mitral regurgitation: a review of clinical indications and patient assessment [^b49f21d7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Significant mitral regurgitation (MR) is an increasingly common disorder affecting nearly 10% of the US population aged >75 years and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the setting of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure symptoms. Mitral valve repair or replacement improves morbidity and mortality in appropriate clinical contexts, but determination of optimal timing of these therapies can be clinically challenging. Consequently, nearly 50% of patients meeting an indication for mitral valve surgery are not referred. Premature exposure to operative risk and limitations in durability are factors that may delay surgery. Conversely, high predicted operative mortality and severe frailty limit other patients from referral to surgery altogether. The recent development of less invasive transcatheter repair provides an additional therapeutic option for some nonoperative patients. Detailed patient and valvular pathology assessments are essential for appropriate utilization of medical, surgical, and transcatheter therapies. Given this complexity, current guidelines recommend that patients being considered for surgical or transcatheter therapies undergo consultation with a multidisciplinary heart team within a heart valve center of excellence. In the current review, we summarize the pertinent aspects of patient and valvular assessments used to guide the optimal timing and type of intervention for severe chronic MR.

MR is the most prevalent heart valve disease in the United States. Moderate or severe MR is found in 0% to 1.0% of people aged 18 to 64 years, 6.4% of people aged 65 to 75 years, and a striking 9.3% of people aged ≥75 years. 1 The volume overload of chronic MR results in progressive cardiac remodeling and cyclical worsening of MR severity, which ultimately leads to heart failure and increased mortality. Beyond determining and tracking MR severity, management is dependent on differentiation between primary and secondary mechanisms of regurgitation. Primary (or degenerative) MR results from lesions of ≥1 element of the mitral valve apparatus, including the leaflets, chordae tendinae, annulus, and papillary muscles. Secondary (or functional) MR is characterized by a structurally normal valve apparatus and instead develops from abnormal LV function and geometry, such as in ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy. In primary MR, therapies are generally focused on mechanically correcting the valvular dysfunction. Alternatively, secondary MR management is initially focused on the root problem of LV dysfunction. If significant secondary MR persists after optimized medical therapy for heart failure, revascularization, and resynchronization therapy, then mitral valve repair or replacement of the valve is considered. 2

Dynamic nature of MR—Mitral regurgitation (MR) severity varies with loading conditions; sedation and reduced blood pressure during TEE may result in a significant reduction in MR severity compared with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in the awake state. Patients with hypertensive urgency/emergency can present with moderate or severe MR that improves substantially with control of blood pressure, and MR severity will increase with maneuvers that decrease left ventricular preload in mitral valve prolapse and in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

Chronic primary mitral regurgitation—definition and etiologic patterns: In assessing the patient with chronic MR, it is important to distinguish between chronic primary (degenerative) MR and chronic secondary (functional) MR; primary MR is a disease of the mitral valve apparatus, and secondary MR is a disease of the ventricle or atria. In chronic primary MR, the pathology of ≥1 valve components (leaflets, chordae tendineae, papillary muscles, annulus) causes valve incompetence with systolic regurgitation of blood from the LV to the LA. The most common cause of chronic primary MR in high-income countries is mitral valve prolapse. Younger populations present with severe myxomatous degeneration with excess redundancy of both anterior and posterior leaflets and the chordal apparatus (Barlow’s valve), and a subset will present with ventricular arrhythmias, mitral annular disjunction, and LV dilation; older populations present with fibroelastic deficiency disease in which lack of connective tissue leads to chordal rupture. The differentiation between these 2 etiologies may have implications for operative intervention.

Recommendation-specific supportive text for severe primary MR emphasizes mechanism and timing: Primary MR is a mechanical problem of the leaflet coaptation that has only a mechanical solution—that of mitral valve mechanical intervention, and the onset of symptoms that results from severe MR worsens prognosis even when LV function appears to be normal; thus, the onset of symptoms is an indication for prompt mitral valve surgery, and the ideal time for mitral valve surgery is when the patient’s LV approaches but has not yet reached the parameters that indicate systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤60% or LVESD ≥40 mm), with imaging surveillance used because symptoms do not always coincide with LV dysfunction.

### Degenerative mitral valve regurgitation: best practice revolution [^903aa0f2]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Best practice revolution

Prevailing data suggest many patients with degenerative mitral valve disease do not receive state-of-the-art care. Accumulating evidence documents a reluctance of many cardiologists and physicians following patients with mitral valve regurgitation to refer them for surgery in a timely fashion, when the maximal benefit from a successful mitral valve repair would be realized. The reasons behind this are certainly multi-factorial, and probably include unawareness of basic concepts in and recent changes to guidelines and a lack of confidence in or poor understanding of modern surgical therapy and results. Both suggest the need for broad continued education with regard to the indications for intervention for mitral valve regurgitation. The implementation of dedicated valve clinics should be encouraged when feasible; a significant outcome benefit can be achieved when experience is widened with larger patient volumes. A close cooperation between internists, imagers, cardiologists, and cardiac surgeons should be promoted, centred on guideline-driven practice.

Despite surgical progress seen in increasing repair rates, lower mortality rates, and less invasive approaches, far too many patients continue to be subjected to unnecessary valve replacement procedures. In this modern era of imaging and degenerative disease differentiation, it should be very uncommon for a patient with mitral valve prolapse to have an unexpected valve replacement based on operative findings; if the surgeon or imager thinks the chances are <90% for a successful repair, they should refer the patient (particularly any asymptomatic patient or a young patient with Barlow's valve disease) to a reference surgeon in a regional reference mitral valve centre; hopefully future evidence of better patient outcomes will support these recommendations and lead to their incorporation into daily practice. There are numerous ‘medical geo-political and financial barriers’ to such a transparency in surgical referral, but the patient with degenerative mitral valve disease deserves the best possible chance for a repair procedure, which is associated with lower long-term morbidity and mortality compared with valve replacement in a majority of patients.

### Mitral valve disease – current management and future challenges [^541271eb]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The field of mitral valve disease diagnosis and management is rapidly changing. New understanding of disease pathology and progression, with improvements in and increased use of sophisticated imaging modalities, have led to early diagnosis and complex treatment. In primary mitral regurgitation, surgical repair is the standard of care. Treatment of asymptomatic patients with severe mitral regurgitation in valve reference centres, in which successful repair is more than 95% and surgical mortality is less than 1%, should be the expectation for the next 5 years. Transcatheter mitral valve repair with a MitraClip device is also producing good outcomes in patients with primary mitral regurgitation who are at high surgical risk. Findings from clinical trials of MitraClip versus surgery in patients of intermediate surgical risk are expected to be initiated in the next few years. In patients with secondary mitral regurgitation, mainly a disease of the left ventricle, the vision for the next 5 years is not nearly as clear. Outcomes from ongoing clinical trials will greatly inform this field. Use of transcatheter techniques, both repair and replacement, is expected to substantially expand. Mitral annular calcification is an increasing problem in elderly people, causing both mitral stenosis and regurgitation which are difficult to treat. There is anecdotal experience with use of transcatheter valves by either a catheter-based approach or as a hybrid technique with open surgery, which is being studied in early feasibility trials.

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^aeb6333e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In a second study comprised of 833 asymptomatic patients with MVP defined by echocardiography at baseline, the presence of comorbidities was analyzed longitudinally. In this cohort, 7.6% were determined to have an MVP‐related event, defined as death, heart failure related to MVP, endocarditis, or mitral surgery in 10 years of follow‐up. Further, severity of mitral regurgitation at baseline was the strongest risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity.In the Strong Heart Study, patients with MVP had a significantly higher prevalence of both mild mitral regurgitation (28.1% versus 18.9%) and moderate‐to‐severe mitral regurgitation (8.8% versus 2.1%) compared with patients without MVP. Whilst the above studies make it clear that MVP is not as benign of a disease as was originally thought, more work needs to be done to understand why some patients have a more severe disease course, while others do not.

MVP is the most common cause of severe mitral regurgitation requiring surgery.By one estimate, ≈0.2% to 3.5% of patients with prolapse will require surgery for their condition at some point in their lifetime, depending on their demographics.Mitral valve surgery, carries significant risks,but is highly effective at preventing mortality in patients with severe regurgitation.Moreover, less invasive percutaneous catheter‐based procedures have been developed, are available for patients who are not ideal candidates for surgery, and have been shown to improve quality of life, reduce rehospitalizations, and promote favorable ventricular remodeling, although they were not shown to improve survival at 1 year.

Chronic primary mitral regurgitation (MR), imaging thresholds and modality roles—A “normal” left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in MR is approximately 70%, and the onset of LV dysfunction is inferred when LVEF declines toward 60% or when the LV is unable to contract to a diameter <40 mm at end systole. Assessment of MR severity is made by integrating available data, and careful attention is needed because conventional color Doppler parameter may overestimate its severity on a single image frame; volumetric measurements provide a better assessment in this situation. TEE provides excellent imaging of the mitral valve and should be performed when TTE images are inadequate; TEE may allow more precise quantitation of regurgitant severity and three-dimensional TEE may be helpful in further visualizing abnormal mitral valve anatomy. In most cases, TTE provides the data needed for adequate cardiac evaluation of the patient with MR, but when TTE image quality is poor, CMR may be of value, producing highly accurate LV and RV volumes and LVEF and an assessment of regurgitant fraction, although CMR is less helpful in establishing mitral pathology. In mitral valve prolapse, MR may be non-holosystolic (mid-late systole).

### Timing of intervention in asymptomatic patients with valvular heart disease [^8f4cc1ab]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Current management of valvular heart disease (VHD) seeks to optimize long-term outcome by timely intervention. Recommendations for treatment of patients with symptoms due to severe valvular disease are based on a foundation of solid evidence. However, when to intervene in asymptomatic patients remains controversial and decision requires careful individual weighing of the potential benefits against the risk of intervention and its long-term consequences. The primary rationale for earlier intervention is prevention of irreversible left ventricular (LV) myocardial changes that might result in later clinical symptoms and adverse cardiac events. A number of outcome predictors have been identified that facilitate decision-making. This review summarizes current recommendations and discusses recently published data that challenge them suggesting even earlier intervention. In adults with asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), emerging risk markers include very severe valve obstruction, elevated serum natriuretic peptide levels, and imaging evidence of myocardial fibrosis or increased extracellular myocardial volume. Currently, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is not recommended for treatment of asymptomatic severe AS although this may change in the future. In patients with aortic regurgitation (AR), the potential benefit of early intervention in preventing LV dilation and dysfunction must be balanced against the long-term risk of a prosthetic valve, a particular concern because severe AR often occurs in younger patients with a congenital bicuspid valve. In patients with mitral stenosis, the option of transcatheter mitral balloon valvotomy tilts the balance towards earlier intervention to prevent atrial fibrillation, embolic events, and pulmonary hypertension. When chronic severe mitral regurgitation is due to mitral valve prolapse, anatomic features consistent with a high likelihood of a successful and durable valve repair favour early intervention. The optimal timing of intervention in adults with VHD is a constantly changing threshold that depends not only on the severity of valve disease but also on the safety, efficacy, and long-term durability of our treatment options.

### Degenerative mitral regurgitation [^c6e4bf00]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Degenerative mitral regurgitation is a major threat to public health and affects at least 24 million people worldwide, with an estimated 0.88 million disability-adjusted life years and 34,000 deaths in 2019. Improving access to diagnostic testing and to timely curative therapies such as surgical mitral valve repair will improve the outcomes of many individuals. Imaging such as echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance allow accurate diagnosis and have provided new insights for a better definition of the most appropriate timing for intervention. Advances in surgical techniques allow minimally invasive treatment with durable results that last for ≥20 years. Transcatheter therapies can provide good results in select patients who are considered high risk for surgery and have a suitable anatomy; the durability of such repairs is up to 5 years. Translational science has provided new knowledge on the pathophysiology of degenerative mitral regurgitation and may pave the road to the development of medical therapies that could be used to halt the progression of the disease.

Hemodynamic effects of mitral regurgitation—primary versus secondary pathophysiology and prognostic implications: MR is considered primary when due to disease of the mitral valve leaflets or chordae tendineae, and chronic severe primary MR imposes a pure LV volume overload resulting in eccentric hypertrophy and LV dilation; increased preload with low‑to‑normal afterload augments LV ejection fraction, which is typically supranormal. In secondary MR, LV dilatation and decreased function are usually the cause rather than the consequence of MR; severity can be dynamic and change abruptly with afterload, preload, ischemia, and heart rate or rhythm. Any degree of secondary MR is associated with worsened prognosis in ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and although a framework linking severity by effective regurgitant orifice areas to LV end‑diastolic volume has been proposed, further prospective validation is required before widespread clinical adoption.

Algorithm for determining eligibility for transcatheter mitral valve (MV) intervention—transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), clinical assessment, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) steps are specified, including anatomic thresholds. TTE directs to “Quantitation of MR using integrated methods†; confirm moderately severe or severe MR” and to “Distinguish mechanism of MR: primary versus secondary (versus mixed).” Clinical assessment should “Confirm NYHA status,” “Assess adequacy of GDMT, as well as CRT and revascularization when indicated,” and “Confirm MDT consensus recommendation for transcatheter treatment.” TEE should “Confirm mechanism of MR and location of MR jet(s); exclude perforations and clefts” and “Assess for presence and location of calcification†,” and then confirm favorable pathoanatomy. For primary MR, favorable features are “grasping zone ≥10 mm and without calcification,” “flail width <15 mm,” “flail gap <10 mm,” and “single middle segment prolapse.” For secondary MR, favorable features are “grasping zone ≥10 mm and without calcification,” “coaptation depth <11 mm,” and “coaptation length (overlap length) >2 mm.” When calcification is uncertain, the page advises to “Consider cardiac CT if degree and location of calcification are unclear.”

Primary degenerative mitral regurgitation—posterior leaflet–limited disease and repair outcomes: Mitral valve repair is the procedure of choice for isolated severe primary MR limited to less than one-half of the posterior leaflet, and mitral valve replacement is inappropriate unless mitral valve repair has been attempted and was unsuccessful. Repair is associated with an operative mortality rate of <1%, long-term survival rate equivalent to that of age-matched general population, approximately 95% freedom from reoperation, and >80% freedom from recurrent moderate or severe (≥3) MR at 15 to 20 years after surgery. As much as one-half of the posterior leaflet may be excised, plicated, or resuspended, and posterior leaflet repair has become sufficiently standardized in this situation so that repair, rather than mitral valve replacement, is the standard of care. Execution of this procedure with a success rate ≥95% should be the expectation of every cardiac surgeon who performs mitral valve procedures.

1 Rheumatic heart diseasemost commonly affects the mitral valve or the aortic valve, but any valve can be affected, and more than one can be involved. Bicuspid aortic valve happens in about 1% to 2% of the population and is more common among men. What causes valvular heart disease. There are several causes of valvular heart disease, including congenital conditions, infections, degenerative conditions, and conditions linked to other types of heart disease. Rheumatic diseasecan happen after an infection from the bacteria that causes strep throat is not treated with antibiotics. The infection can cause scarring of the heart valve. This is the most common cause of valve disease worldwide, but it is much less common in the United States, where most strep infections are treated early with antibiotics.
- High blood pressure.
- A heart attack, which can damage the muscles that control the opening and closing of the valve.
- Other:
- Autoimmune disease, such as lupus.
- Marfan syndrome, a disease of connective tissue that can affect heart valves.
- Exposure to high-dose radiation, which may lead to calcium deposits on the valve.
- The aging process, which can cause calcium deposits to develop on the heart valves, making them stiff or thickened and less efficient with age. What are the symptoms of valvular heart disease. Heart valve disease can develop quickly or over a long period. When valve disease develops more slowly, there may be no symptoms until the condition is quite advanced. When it develops more suddenly, people may experience the following symptoms:
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain
- Fatigue
- Dizziness or fainting
- Fever
- Rapid weight gain
- Irregular heartbeat. How is valvular heart disease treated.

If the condition isn’t too severe, it might be managed with medicines to treat the symptoms. If the valve is more seriously diseased and causing more severe symptoms, surgery may be recommended. The type of surgery will depend on the valve involved and the cause of the disease. For some conditions, the valve will need to be replaced by either opening the heart during surgery or replacing the valve without having to open the heart during surgery.

### Mitral regurgitation in 2020: the 2020 focused update of the 2017 American college of cardiology expert consensus decision pathway on the management of mitral regurgitation [^3e15a5f4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

The recently published "2020 Focused Update of the 2017 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Management of Mitral Regurgitation" provides a framework for the clinical and echocardiographic assessment of mitral regurgitation and describes considerations for the medical, surgical, and transcatheter treatment of mitral regurgitation. The Update provides guidance for clinicians in light of the significant interim developments since the 2017 recommendations, particularly in the areas of secondary mitral regurgitation and transcatheter mitral valve repair. The present review focuses on the aspects of the Update that are most relevant to the cardiac anesthesiologist, with emphasis on the integrated assessment of mitral regurgitation with echocardiography and the indications and considerations for the surgical and transcatheter management of mitral regurgitation.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) severity clarification—Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be sufficient to define leaflet pathology and quantitate MR severity, although it may underestimate MR severity during anesthesia due to favorable loading conditions; cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is generally more accurate and reproducible for quantitating regurgitant volume (RVol) and regurgitant fraction (RF) as well as left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF). Right and left heart catheterization may be indicated to assess hemodynamics, and a high-quality LV angiogram can also be helpful in resolving uncertainty in some cases; invasive measurement of pressures, cardiac output, and pulmonary vascular resistance allows a comprehensive assessment that can be correlated with symptoms and response to medical therapy. Stress echocardiography can also be a valuable tool to assess any discrepancies between noninvasive and clinical findings and to help define symptoms, exercise capacity, MR severity, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and LV/right ventricular (RV) responses to exercise. High-quality CMR can be very helpful in many patients in whom MR severity is unclear, although the technology is not widely available, and consideration should be given to referring such patients to a comprehensive valve center for multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment; an evidence-based algorithm for referral of patients with MR is outlined in Figure 8 and is based on the 2014 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease and its 2017 focused update.

Secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) staging—this table defines hemodynamic thresholds for at-risk, progressive, and severe disease in secondary MR. At-risk includes small central jet area <20% LA on Doppler and small vena contracta <0.3 cm. Progressive MR is characterized by ERO <0.40 cm^2, regurgitant volume <60 mL, and regurgitant fraction <50%. Severe MR uses ERO ≥0.40 cm^2, regurgitant volume ≥60 mL, and regurgitant fraction ≥50%. Thresholds may be lower in low-flow states, and not all criteria for each category will be present in each patient.

Chronic primary mitral regurgitation—exercise testing for diagnostic evaluation: In patients with primary MR (Stages B and C) and symptoms that might be attributable to MR, hemodynamic exercise testing using Doppler echocardiography or cardiac catheterization or cardiopulmonary exercise testing is reasonable. In a subset of apparently asymptomatic patients with severe primary MR, exercise testing with hemodynamics can provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information.

Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) surgical thresholds and outcomes—because of altered loading, a higher cutoff for “normal” LVEF is used in MR, and although it is inadvisable to allow LV function to deteriorate beyond an LVEF ≤60% or LVESD ≥40 mm, some recovery can still occur after crossing these thresholds. Repair success increases with surgical volume and expertise, and mitral valve replacement is preferable to a poor repair. When only annuloplasty and posterior leaflet repair are required, expected results include an operative mortality rate of <1%, approximately 95% freedom from reoperation, and >80% freedom from recurrent moderate or severe MR at 15 to 20 years after operation. The onset of symptoms, LV dysfunction, or pulmonary hypertension worsens prognosis, and an attractive alternative strategy is early mitral repair before these triggers are reached, provided a durable repair is achieved.

Secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) surgery—guideline recommendations for mitral valve (MV) surgery for the treatment of moderate or severe secondary MR, with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting, are more conservative because surgical intervention in this patient group may improve symptoms and quality of life, but has not been shown to improve survival. MV repair (usually with a downsized annuloplasty ring) may be considered at the time of coronary artery bypass grafting for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease and moderate secondary MR, although its benefit in this context is uncertain. In patients with severe secondary MR, MV surgery (either replacement or repair) is reasonable at the time of other cardiac surgery and can be considered as an isolated procedure for selected patients with advanced New York Heart Association functional class despite guideline-directed management inclusive of CRT when indicated. For severely symptomatic patients with severe ischemic, secondary MR, it is reasonable to choose chordal-sparing MV replacement over downsized annuloplasty repair, reflecting RCT findings that repair patients experienced a significantly higher rate of recurrent moderate or severe MR with more HF events and cardiovascular readmissions during follow-up. In patients deemed appropriate surgical candidates for atrial functional MR with annular dilatation and persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), a catheter-based AF ablation procedure would generally not be recommended, and individual patient considerations require careful assessment and MDT consensus decision-making.

### Surgical and transcatheter mitral valve repair for severe chronic mitral regurgitation: a review of clinical indications and patient assessment [^f0492da5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The Continuum of Chronic Primary MR

The natural history of chronic primary MR is a cyclical progression driven by chronic left atrial and LV volume overload, whereby the addition of regurgitant volume to pulmonary venous filling results in increased left atrial volume and pressure. Increased left atrial diastolic pressure produces increased LV diastolic filling, which in turn feeds more MR volume in the subsequent LV systolic event. Primary MR may progress suddenly due to chordal rupture with flail leaflet with resultant increase in the regurgitant volume and orifice area, often to the severe range; however, less immediate and significant MR volume, as typically seen with myxomatous degeneration and MV prolapse, produces more modest volume and pressure alterations. These changes are accommodated by atrial dilation, minimizing increased chamber pressure. With these adaptive physiological responses, there is considerable individual variation of progression from mild to moderate primary MR, but overall risk of developing LV dilation or systolic dysfunction is low. 17 In the absence of symptoms, serial echocardiographic evaluation in patients with mild primary MR should be completed every 3 to 5 years. 2 A transition to moderate or severe MR indicates disease progression but may or may not be associated with onset of noticeable symptoms, even if this results in LV dilation and dysfunction. Asymptomatic patients with moderate MR should have repeated echocardiographic evaluations every 1 to 2 years, and severe MR should be reassessed every 6 to 12 months. 2

Once symptoms of severe MR develop, the lack of repair or replacement is associated with high annual mortality from heart failure and sudden cardiac death, with only one‐third of patients surviving to 8 years. 18 Furthermore, valvular repair or replacement completed after development of heart failure symptoms or LV dysfunction improves but does not normalize prognosis relative to the age‐matched population. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 Serial assessment is essential because, ideally, surgery for primary MR is completed before development of heart failure symptoms or LV dysfunction. Additional clinical sequelae of chronic MR that may develop prior to heart failure symptoms and LV dysfunction include atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension. These comorbidities herald a transition from a compensated stage of chronic primary MR to a decompensated stage characterized by the development of symptoms and LV dysfunction. 3 Because pulmonary hypertension and atrial fibrillation may reverse following valvular intervention, these findings pinpoint an opportunity to proceed with surgery prior to permanent damage and increased mortality.

### Gender and sex differences in the management, intervention, and outcomes of patients with severe primary mitral regurgitation [^68a40492]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Gender and sex differences in the patient presentation, treatment timeliness, and outcomes are prevalent in cardiovascular disease.Gender‐ and sex‐based disparities are particularly important in degenerative mitral valve (MV) disease, as timely mechanical correction of severe primary mitral regurgitation (MR) has the potential to restore quality of life and life expectancy.Untreated MR could lead to pulmonary hypertension, ventricular dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, tricuspid regurgitation, and heart failure.Because women have been shown to have underdiagnosis, undertreatment, and delay in care,it is critical to characterize these disparities and their potential impact on outcomes in women with MV disease to prevent adverse sequelae and restore normal life expectancy.,

The factors associated with these differences remain unknown. Additionally, our understanding is limited on the differences that may occur at earlier triaging stages, including referral to multidisciplinary evaluation after diagnosis and selection of intervention among the broader cohort of those with degenerative disease. Identifying and understanding the treatment phases where this disparity occurs is essential in devising strategies to mitigate these differences.

Using a health care network–wide echocardiogram database, we aimed to compare the patient characteristics and early and midterm outcomes of patients with newly detected severe primary MR between men and women across treatment phases from diagnosis to intervention. We also sought to identify patient factors associated with the likelihood of undergoing multidisciplinary evaluation for MV disease.

### Surgical and transcatheter mitral valve repair for severe chronic mitral regurgitation: a review of clinical indications and patient assessment [^03fe7fad]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Valvular repair or replacement is a common final management option in both primary and secondary MR, resulting in ≈50 000 annual mitral valve operations in the United States; however, defining the optimal timing of these interventions can be challenging. Anticipated disease progression must be considered regarding the benefits and risks of surgical and transcatheter‐based approaches. With mild MR, the rate of progressive remodeling such as ventricular dilation is low; however, remodeling with systolic dysfunction and the risk of sudden cardiac death increase in older patients and when MR is moderate or worse. Persons aged ≥50 years with medically managed primary MR face a 3% annual risk of mortality if the MR is moderate and 6% if severe. 3 Furthermore, within 10 years of diagnosis of severe primary MR, nearly 90% of patients experience clinical events resulting in death or surgical therapy. 4 Similarly, ≈50% of patients with secondary MR following a myocardial infarction develop heart failure or death within 5 years, a 3‐fold higher risk than post–myocardial infarction patients without MR. 5 Despite these findings, surgical repair or replacement is often delayed to avoid exposure to procedural risk or postoperative risk of anticoagulation, or concerns about durability of repair or bioprosthetic replacement over following decades.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^8fba03c3]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

2020 ACC/AHA valvular heart disease—stage B medical therapy emphasizes that in early valvular heart disease (VHD) there are currently no therapies to prevent disease progression in the valve leaflets, so recommendations are directed toward patient monitoring with the intent to intervene once severe disease is present with symptoms or abnormal cardiovascular function. The document highlights inclusion gaps, noting that women and minorities often are underrepresented in clinical trials and calls for directed efforts to include all patient groups with numbers adequate to perform separate data analysis. It notes that, given the relatively low risk of intervention and improved options, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of intervention for severe asymptomatic VHD are important and in progress for some conditions, such as severe aortic stenosis (AS), and that clinical equipoise exists for asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation (AR) with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, severe primary mitral regurgitation (MR) with normal LV function and a high likelihood of valve repair, and the role of intervention for tricuspid regurgitation (TR); long-term follow-up is needed to ensure the lifetime risks of a prosthetic valve or valve repair are balanced against any benefits attributable to earlier intervention.

### Surgical and transcatheter mitral valve repair for severe chronic mitral regurgitation: a review of clinical indications and patient assessment [^45197549]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Parallel to the current and numerous developing therapeutic options, the variety of patient characteristics and MR mechanisms result in a complex decision tree directing patient evaluation as well as timing and appropriateness of therapy. As such, current guidelines recommend that patients being considered for surgical or transcatheter therapies undergo consultation with a multidisciplinary heart team within a heart valve center of excellence. 2 This includes focused evaluations by physicians and advanced practitioners with expertise in heart failure, echocardiography, interventional cardiology, and cardiac surgery. Care by heart failure specialists promotes achievement of optimized guideline‐directed medical therapy in secondary MR patients, such that MR severity improves in many cases. Likewise, use of beta blockers, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists can be maximized in primary MR patients who have developed LV dysfunction. Similarly, simultaneous patient assessment by cardiac surgeons and cardiologists with expertise in echocardiography and interventional therapies facilitates evaluation for candidacy of surgical or transcatheter therapies. Evaluation by multiple clinicians in the same setting enables real‐time discussion and planning with the patient and enhances communication with referring providers.

### The current therapy for mitral regurgitation [^009b4901]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

In addressing the current therapy for mitral regurgitation (MR), it is useful to distinguish primary MR from secondary (functional) MR. In primary MR, abnormalities of one or more of the components of the mitral valve cause it to leak, imparting a volume overload on the left ventricle (LV). Severe prolonged primary MR leads to LV remodeling, myocardial dysfunction, heart failure, and death. Correction of MR, preferably by valve repair rather than replacement, is curative. Severe MR by itself is considered an indication for repair in many centers, and mitral surgery (repair or replacement) should take place when even mild symptoms appear or when ejection fraction approaches 0.60 or end systolic dimension approaches 40 mm. In secondary MR, myocardial damage from infarction or cardiomyopathy produces papillary muscle displacement and annular dilatation, causing a normal valve to leak. Because the MR in this case is not the primary problem, the indications for mitral valve intervention are less certain and considerably more data are needed to aid us in selecting the most appropriate patients for surgical therapy. Percutaneous therapies for both primary and secondary MR have generated much interest, and many different percutaneous technologies are being developed. Future data from randomized trials will help clarify when and in whom these therapies are applicable.

Valvular heart disease—top take-home messages (items 6–10) highlight that “indications for transcatheter aortic valve implantation are expanding,” and for severe aortic stenosis “the choice of type of intervention … should be a shared decision-making process that considers the lifetime risks and benefits” including valve type and approach. For valvular regurgitation, “indications for intervention … are relief of symptoms and prevention of the irreversible long-term consequences of left ventricular volume overload,” and “thresholds for intervention now are lower than they previously were because of more durable treatment options and lower procedural risks.” “A mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is of benefit to patients with severely symptomatic primary mitral regurgitation who are at high or prohibitive risk for surgery,” and to a select subset with secondary mitral regurgitation despite guideline-directed therapy. Patients with severe symptomatic isolated tricuspid regurgitation “may benefit from surgical intervention” if performed before severe right ventricular dysfunction or end-organ damage. For prosthetic valves, “bioprosthetic valve dysfunction may occur” from leaflet degeneration or thrombosis, and “catheter-based treatment … is reasonable in selected patients” with leaflet degeneration or paravalvular leak without active infection.

### Association between early surgical intervention vs watchful waiting and outcomes for mitral regurgitation due to flail mitral valve leaflets [^7fa90bd3]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The optimal management of severe mitral valve regurgitation in patients without class I triggers (heart failure symptoms or left ventricular dysfunction) remains controversial in part due to the poorly defined long-term consequences of current management strategies. In the absence of clinical trial data, analysis of large multicenter registries is critical.

Objective

To ascertain the comparative effectiveness of initial medical management (nonsurgical observation) vs early mitral valve surgery following the diagnosis of mitral regurgitation due to flail leaflets.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Mitral Regurgitation International Database (MIDA) registry includes 2097 consecutive patients with flail mitral valve regurgitation (1980-2004) receiving routine cardiac care from 6 tertiary centers (France, Italy, Belgium, and the United States). Mean follow-up was 10.3 years and was 98% complete. Of 1021 patients with mitral regurgitation without the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) guideline class I triggers, 575 patients were initially medically managed and 446 underwent mitral valve surgery within 3 months following detection.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Association between treatment strategy and survival, heart failure, and new-onset atrial fibrillation.

Results

There was no significant difference in early mortality (1.1% for early surgery vs 0.5% for medical management, P=.28) and new-onset heart failure rates (0.9% for early surgery vs 0.9% for medical management, P=.96) between treatment strategies at 3 months. In contrast, long-term survival rates were higher for patients with early surgery (86% vs 69% at 10 years, P<.001), which was confirmed in adjusted models (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55 [95% CI, 0.41-0.72], P<.001), a propensity-matched cohort (32 variables; HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.35-0.79], P=.002), and an inverse probability-weighted analysis (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.52-0.83], P<.001), associated with a 5-year reduction in mortality of 52.6% (P<.001). Similar results were observed in relative reduction in mortality following early surgery in the subset with class II triggers (59.3 after 5 years, P=.002). Long-term heart failure risk was also lower with early surgery (7% vs 23% at 10 years, P<.001), which was confirmed in risk-adjusted models (HR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.19-0.43], P<.001), a propensity-matched cohort (HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.26-0.76], P=.003), and in the inverse probability-weighted analysis (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.36-0.72], P<.001). Reduction in late-onset atrial fibrillation was not observed (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.64-1.13], P=.26).

Conclusion and Relevance

Among registry patients with mitral valve regurgitation due to flail mitral leaflets, performance of early mitral surgery compared with initial medical management was associated with greater long-term survival and a lower risk of heart failure, with no difference in new-onset atrial fibrillation.

Multidisciplinary team (MDT) processes and patient selection—supporting guidance emphasizes communication, referral, evolving device use, and follow-up in mitral regurgitation (MR). “Standardized echocardiographic reporting and timely access to accurate information are critical for effective patient management.” “The prognostic, evaluative, and management differences between primary and secondary MR should be recognized.” “An MDT consensus treatment recommendation should be discussed with the patient and family to enable shared decision making.” “Ongoing communication between members of the MDT and the referring clinician is strongly endorsed, especially at critical junctures in the course of treatment and at times of transition of care.” For surgery, “Referral for repair to an experienced MV surgeon at a heart valve center should be considered for patients with severe MR in whom other cardiac diseases require concomitant operative management (e.g., coronary artery disease),” and also “for those in whom complex repair of primary MR is contemplated, or for those with primary MR who wish to pursue a minimally invasive or robotic approach.” Device therapy notes that “Use of TMVr with an edge-to-edge clip device in the United States has expanded from the treatment of severely symptomatic patients with primary, severe MR who are poor operative candidates to carefully selected secondary MR patients with persistent HF symptoms despite rigorous GDMT (and CRT when indicated).” “The roles of the MDT and its individual members are critical to decision making and consensus treatment recommendations.” “Other TMVr and TMVR systems are under active investigation and are anticipated to become clinically available in the near to intermediate term,” and “Introduction of these systems into clinical practice will require iterative updates to this ECDP.” “Long-term follow-up of patients after surgical or transcatheter MV intervention is essential for assessment of durability of MR reduction, functional outcome, quality of life, and survival.”

### Echocardiography (...) [^8b300563]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Mitral valve prolapse occurs in an estimated 15 million Americans. 1 Because its clinical manifestations are extremely variable, MVP may be difficult to recognize. The disorder is usually asymptomatic but, in certain patients, it may be an important cause of incapacitating chest pain and refractory arrhythmias. 2 The abnormal components of the mitral valve apparatus are possible sites for endocarditis, and severe mitral regurgitation can result from endocarditis, ruptured chordae, or both. 2, 3. 1–6 Although MVP is often an isolated finding, it is also the most frequent cause of significant mitral regurgitation and the most common substrate for mitral valve endocarditis in the United States. In certain conditions that affect one or more components of the mitral apparatus, the prolapse is secondary.

More often, however, a primary disorder of the mitral valve leaflets exists, with specific pathologic changes causing redundancy of the valve leaflets and their prolapse into the left atrium during systole 2, 5, 7.
5. The mitral valve apparatus is a complex structure
8. The characteristic microscopic feature of primary MVP is marked proliferation of the spongiosa, the delicate myxomatous connective tissue between the atrialis and the fibrosa or ventricularis that supports the leaflet 9. In secondary MVP, no myxomatous proliferation of the spongiosa portion of the mitral valve leaflet occurs. Patients with primary and secondary MVP must be distinguished from those who have no heart disease but who have findings on cardiac auscultation or echocardiography that have been misinterpreted. 1, 3–6. Natural History, Prognosis and Complications In most studies, MVP has a complication rate of less than 2 percent per year 2,
15.

The age-adjusted survival rate in men and women with MVP is similar to that in patients without this common clinical disorder. The gradual progression of mitral regurgitation in patients with MVP, however, may result in progressive dilation of the left atrium and left ventricle. LA dilation often results in atrial fibrillation and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with eventual LV dysfunction and the development of congestive heart failure. 3.

Differences in assessing MR severity in primary versus secondary MR—Primary MR is “generally easier to evaluate because of the morphological abnormalities of the mitral leaflets or chordae,” and abnormalities such as “a flail leaflet with torn chords, leaflet destruction, and perforation due to endocarditis or severe leaflet retraction without visible coaptation, are specific markers of severe MR.” In chronic primary MR, “LV or LA dilation … is most often a consequence of the MR and a strong clue that the MR is severe,” whereas “when MR is primary and LV and LA size are normal, severe MR is very unlikely.” In contrast, “secondary MR is more difficult to grade because morphological abnormalities of the leaflets and chords are absent,” and clinical or adjunctive findings “may be due to the underlying cardiomyopathy and, therefore, are less helpful in grading MR severity.” Additionally, “in secondary MR, the shape of the regurgitant orifice is often markedly crescentic, leading to underestimation of EROA by the PISA method.”

Spectrum and management considerations in secondary mitral regurgitation—secondary MR occurs as a consequence of adverse LV remodeling with papillary muscle displacement, leaflet tethering, and annular dilation, and mitral valve closing forces may also be reduced. At one extreme is a severely dilated, spherical LV with markedly depressed LV systolic function and secondary MR along the leaflet coaptation line; at the other, an isolated inferolateral myocardial infarction may produce severe secondary MR due to asymmetric posteromedial annular dilation and posterior leaflet tethering despite normal LV size and global ejection fraction. Secondary MR may also emerge or worsen in the context of atrial fibrillation (AF) due to left atrial stretch and annular dilation despite preserved LV systolic function. Management considerations need to take into account the mechanism(s) of MR and potential indications for other interventions, such as coronary revascularization and rhythm control. In patients with heart failure, advanced LV remodeling/chamber dilatation, and significant LV systolic dysfunction who remain symptomatic despite optimized guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT) (including cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT] when indicated), mitral valve intervention may not improve HF symptoms or quality of life if the dominant problem is severe LV dysfunction, and heart transplantation or destination LV assist device therapy may be a more effective treatment strategy than MV intervention in this context.

### The right ventricular pulmonary circulation continuum in mitral valve disease study (RIPCOM1) [^74dff147]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic severe primary MR can be initially monitored without impairing long term survival. However, significant symptoms or impairment of left ventricular function is associated with worse prognosis due to long term heart failure. Some physicians wait for early symptoms before referring for surgery and this is reflected by a great variation in referral patterns, but symptomatic status is subjective and difficult to assess. Nearly all of the surgical indications are based on expert opinion rather than significant evidence base. The current indications for surgery for MR include symptomatic status; asymptomatic status with echocardiographic features such as impaired left ventricular function or increased left ventricular dimensions; new onset atrial fibrillation or pulmonary hypertension; asymptomatic status with a high likelihood of durable repair and low co-morbidity.

The limitation in strength of the current evidence base is reflected by the class of evidence being expert opinion for all of the above indications with the sole exception of symptomatic patients, which is level B. The fulcrum point between asymptomatic status and symptomatic status at which patients would derive prognostic benefit and thus should be referred for surgery on prognostic grounds still remains unclear and controversial. Although elective mitral valve repair carries a low risk of mortality, it has been demonstrated that asymptomatic patients with severe degenerative MR can be safely followed up before becoming symptomatic or reaching cutoff values for left ventricular dimensions, size or pulmonary hypertension; with no significant difference with expected survival. As a result, it is debatable whether prophylactic surgery for all patients with asymptomatic severe degenerative MR derives prognostic benefit.

At the other end of the clinical spectrum, the increased operative mortality and worse long term prognosis of symptomatic patients is well proven. Patients with New York Heart Association Class III or IV status have excessive operative mortality and significantly increased mortality at 10 years. Both this study and another have demonstrated that preoperative ejection fraction is an independent predictor of long term survival. In summary, severe mitral regurgitation is a common valvular pathology that causes a significant burden of disease. Current guidelines for timing of operative intervention are mostly based on expert opinion rather than randomised trials or studies. The ideal tipping point investigation will be an objective marker of functional capacity which correlates with known surrogates of survival such as left ventricular function; and detects early decline, but returns to normal after successful surgery.

The improved evidence base will create an epidemiological shift in patterns of referring for mitral valve surgery and reduce the burden of disease of heart failure.

### Mitral valve regurgitation: a disease with a wide spectrum of therapeutic options [^7a240551]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Over the past two decades interest in mitral valve regurgitation has increased as a result of the development of new technologies that have expanded the number of patients who can potentially benefit from mitral regurgitation treatments. To develop new devices for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, the focus has been placed on the functional anatomy and pathophysiology of the mitral valve, with the use of the most advanced methods of cardiac imaging that allow the best visualization of the mitral valve and a perfect understanding of the complexity of a specific disease. Mitral regurgitation is still underdiagnosed and undertreated in a substantial number of patients who have poor survival. Therefore, the priority should be to identify and treat these patients to increase their survival and quality of life. To achieve this goal, general physicians and cardiologists must be aware of all the treatment options that are currently available in dedicated centres of excellence. Patients referred to these centres can benefit from a tailored heart team-based approach. The aim of this Review is to analyse the basic principles of mitral regurgitation, discussing new concepts on the pathophysiology of the mitral valve that have been developed to facilitate the selection of patients for transcatheter procedures. We also describe the indications and timing of treatment, contemporary surgical and transcatheter techniques and the heart team approach, and highlight the need for centres of excellence.

### Management of secondary mitral regurgitation: from drugs to devices [^94bb6934]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Severe secondary mitral regurgitation carries a poor prognosis with one in five patients dying within 12 months of diagnosis. Fortunately, there are now a number of safe and effective therapies available to improve outcomes. Here, we summarise the most up-to-date treatments. Optimal guideline-directed medical therapy is the mainstay therapy and has been shown to reduce the severity of mitral regurgitation in 40–45% of patients. Rapid medication titration protocols reduce heart failure hospitalisation and facilitate earlier referral for device therapy. The pursuit of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation has been shown to significantly reduce mitral regurgitation severity, as has the use of cardiac resynchronisation devices in patients who meet guideline-directed criteria. Finally, we highlight the key role of mitral valve intervention, particularly transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) for management of moderate-severe mitral regurgitation in carefully selected patients with poor left ventricular systolic function, with a number needed to treat of 3.1 to reduce heart failure hospitalisation and 5.9 to reduce all-cause death. To slow the rapid accumulation of morbidity and mortality, we advocate a proactive approach with accelerated medical optimisation, followed by management of atrial fibrillation and cardiac resynchronisation therapy if indicated, then, rapid referral to the Heart Team for consideration of mitral valve intervention in patients with ongoing symptoms and at least moderate-severe mitral regurgitation. Mitral TEER has been shown to be ‘reasonably cost-effective’ (but not cost-saving) in the UK in selected patients, although TEER remains underused with only 6.5 procedures per million population (pmp) compared with Germany (77 pmp), Switzerland (44 pmp) and the USA (32 pmp).

Mitral regurgitation—cardiac catheterization utility is described as follows: Left ventriculography and hemodynamic measurements are useful when clinical assessment and noninvasive tests are inconclusive or discordant with regard to severity of MR, LV function, or the need for surgery; noninvasive imaging is adequate for evaluation of MR in most cases, but invasive hemodynamic evaluation may be necessary when there is a clinical discrepancy between symptom status and noninvasive testing; elevated filling pressures support a cardiac cause of dyspnea and may indicate severely abnormal pathophysiology even when the patient claims to be asymptomatic.

Asymptomatic severe valve disease and pregnancy—additional considerations: Some women with severe asymptomatic AS, normal LV systolic function, and normal biomarkers may choose to undergo pregnancy without valve intervention, and in experienced centers these women can often be treated with activity restriction, volume management, and optimization of loading conditions. The threshold for valve operation for valve regurgitation is higher in the asymptomatic patient who might get pregnant than in patients who will not become pregnant because there always is the possibility that valve repair will not be successful and a prosthetic valve will be needed. Most patients with asymptomatic severe MR tolerate the hemodynamic changes of pregnancy, and there is no evidence for acceleration of LV dysfunction during pregnancy. High-risk features for development of HF during pregnancy in women with MR include depressed LV systolic function and pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure >50 mmHg). In high-risk asymptomatic women with severe MR, referral to a Comprehensive Valve Center allows consideration of mitral valve morphology, the likelihood of a successful valve repair, and estimated surgical risk in the decision-making process.

### Practice gaps in the care of mitral valve regurgitation: insights from the American college of cardiology mitral regurgitation gap analysis and advisory panel [^15dc4915]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The revised 2014 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association valvular heart disease guidelines provide evidenced-based recommendations for the management of mitral regurgitation (MR). However, knowledge gaps related to our evolving understanding of critical MR concepts may impede their implementation.

Methods

The ACC conducted a multifaceted needs assessment to characterize gaps, practice patterns, and perceptions related to the diagnosis and treatment of MR. A key project element was a set of surveys distributed to primary care and cardiovascular physicians (cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons). Survey and other gap analysis findings were presented to a panel of 10 expert advisors from specialties of general cardiology, cardiac imaging, interventional cardiology, and cardiac surgeons with expertise in valvular heart disease, especially MR, and cardiovascular education. The panel was charged with assessing the relative importance and potential means of remedying identified gaps to improve care for patients with MR.

Results

The survey results identified several knowledge and practice gaps that may limit implementation of evidence-based recommendations for MR care. Specifically, half of primary care physicians reported uncertainty regarding timing of intervention for patients with severe primary or functional MR. Physicians in all groups reported that quantitative indices of MR severity were frequently not reported in clinical echocardiographic interpretations, and that these measurements were not consistently reviewed when provided in reports. In the treatment of MR, nearly 30% of primary care physician and general cardiologists did not know the volume of mitral valve repair surgeries by their reference cardiac surgeons and did not have a standard source to obtain this information. After review of the survey results, the expert panel summarized practice gaps into 4 thematic areas and offered proposals to address deficiencies and promote better alignment with the 2014 ACC/American Heart Association valvular disease guidelines.

Conclusion

Important knowledge and skill gaps exist that may impede optimal care of the patient with MR. Focused educational and practice interventions should be developed to reduce these gaps.

Surgical management

In operable patients, surgical valve repair remains the gold standard intervention and treatment for severe PMR, with repair consistently demonstrating superior long-term clinical outcomes to valve replacement when feasible.Surgical mitral valve replacement for primary regurgitation may be considered in the clinical context of multimorbid elderly patients with acutely complex anatomy.

Numerous surgical techniques are available for mitral valve repair to address anterior, posterior, bileaflet, or commissural prolapse. The most appropriate techniques should be selected on a case-by-case basis, considering the complex mitral anatomy and disease mechanisms. Repair considerations should include optimizing free-edge coaptation, annular stabilization via annuloplasty implantation, and preserving/restoring natural leaflet motion while reducing the risk of SAM and functional stenosis.Please see a non-exhaustive summary of common repair techniques in table 3.

Table 3 
Summary of surgical mitral valve repair techniques

The presence of severe MAC, primarily involving the posterior annulus, has been demonstrated to increase mortality in patients undergoing MV repair due to the increased risk of prosthesis dehiscence, circumflex artery injury, or cardiac rupture. There are multiple surgical techniques to address MAC; resection and debridement of the annular calcium and pericardial patch or atrial muscle reconstruction may be performed to allow for satisfactory repair and annuloplasty prosthesis implantation.Ultrasonic emulsification is a developing technology to aid decalcification when treating patients with MAC; the published results of emulsification techniques are positive but currently limited.Alternative techniques may opt not to decalcify the annulus and avoid associated risks, where oversized or atypical annuloplasty prostheses may provide adequate repair in comorbid and high-risk patients. Mitral valve replacement may be selected in patients with anatomy unfavorable for repair.Patients with circumferential MAC (>270°) may be referred for transcatheter interventions.

Comprehensive and primary valve center surgical capabilities—A Comprehensive (Level I) Center should also house the surgical skill and resources to treat patients with complicated infective endocarditis, and successful repair of mitral valve disease, including durable repair not only for primary MR involving the posterior leaflet, but also for anterior leaflet prolapse, bileaflet prolapse, and Barlow’s disease, should be offered at the Comprehensive (Level I) Valve Center; repair of posterior leaflet prolapse might also be offered at a Primary (Level II) Valve Center depending on the level of surgical and imaging expertise and experience. Surgical mitral valve replacement should be available at both Level I and II centers, annuloplasty repair of tricuspid regurgitation is often a straightforward addition to mitral repair in appropriate patients, the evaluation and surgical management (repair or replacement) of severe, secondary MR with regional or global LV systolic dysfunction can be challenging and, for some patients, may be more appropriate at a Level I Center, and multivalve operations, reoperative valve surgery, operations for prosthetic valve endocarditis, and hybrid transcatheter/surgical procedures are likely better suited for a Comprehensive (Level I) Valve Center.

Over the past 20 years, our understanding of MVP has evolved considerably. Precise definition of the disorder has allowed for large, population level studies to occur which have shown that even though MVP is a common and often benign entity, the lifetime cardiovascular risk of patients with MVP is both substantial and diverse. Through the hard work of many clinical and basic science researchers, genetic causes of MVP have been identified, and animal models of MVP have been developed which allow in‐depth investigation of the molecular drivers of mitral valve enlargement, myxomatous tissue formation, and prolapse.,,,With these tools, future investigations can focus on how MVP progresses beyond the valve, to the ventricle, and whether new studies may inform revised clinical guidelines or application of rationale remedial therapies to blunt disease progression or severity.

### Comparison of need for operative therapy in patients with mitral valve prolapse involving both leaflets versus posterior leaflet only [^231cefb5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Mitral valve prolapse may involve 1 leaflet or 2 leaflets, yet management guidelines do not differentiate posterior leaflet (PML) from bileaflet (BML) prolapse. We hypothesized that patients with BML have a prolonged natural history with more severe atrial and ventricular enlargement but less severe mitral regurgitation (MR) compared to patients with PML. Patients with mitral valve prolapse undergoing mitral repair were identified and preoperative characteristics were recorded. Patients with predominant PML prolapse (n = 304) versus BML prolapse (n = 131) were identified based on preoperative echocardiographic and intraoperative findings. Timing of operation was based on standard guidelines. Despite being equally symptomatic, patients with BML differed significantly from those with PML in being younger (54 vs 60 years, p <0.0001), more likely to be women (51% vs 24%, p <0.0001), and having a larger valve (37 vs 32 mm, p <0.0001). Despite similar cardiac function and dimensions, patients with BML had less severe MR (24% vs 13% with <4+ MR, p = 0.01) and less severe pulmonary hypertension (14% vs 31%, p <0.0001) at time of operation. In conclusion, patients with BML often meet indications for mitral valve repair with similar cardiac enlargement but less MR than patients with PML prolapse. Patients with BML prolapse may benefit from timing mitral repair based more on symptomatic 3+ MR or cardiac enlargement and less on presence of severe MR.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) expert consensus decision pathway scope and emphasis—The ECDP emphasizes: Clinical and echocardiographic assessment; Establishment of MR etiology (primary, secondary, mixed) and mechanism; Consideration of associated hemodynamic consequences; Recognition of the indications for surgical or transcatheter intervention; Appreciation of the increasing complexity of surgical mitral valve (MV) repair as a function of pathoanatomy; Understanding of the current role for transcatheter MV edge-to-edge repair using a clip device. Recent emphasis has been placed on multidisciplinary team (MDT) consensus decision making to optimize outcomes for patients with valvular heart disease, including those with aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation (MR). A highly functioning and expanded MDT is critical for the care of patients with significant MR. This document contains clinical expert consensus recommendations to guide the approach to patients with MR, and recommendations are based on the 2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease (2), its 2017 focused update (3), and the results of landmark randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (4,5) published in 2018.

### Practice variation among cardiovascular physicians in management of patients with mitral regurgitation [^e2c45910]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Severe mitral regurgitation (MR), whether isolated or with coronary disease, was associated with adverse clinical outcomes. However, clinician practice is characterized by different thresholds for treatment. No data exist that described current practice patterns, factors that affected these patterns, or whether physicians followed American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines in clinical practice for patients with MR. Cardiovascular specialists were surveyed using e-mail, and 1,076 physicians completed the survey (71% response rate), including adult cardiologists (94%) and cardiac surgeons (5%) who practiced in the United States (78%), Canada (5%), and other nations (17%). Wide variations were noted regarding rates of referral of asymptomatic patients with severe MR for mitral valve repair. There was geographic and specialty-dependent heterogeneity in practice. Most physicians (65%) used medications to delay the progression of MR in the absence of guideline recommendations. A minority (28%) of respondents routinely quantitated MR by calculating the effective regurgitant orifice area. In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, MR severity was not assessed before the procedure by 1 in 4 providers, and the presence of MR frequently did not affect clinical care decisions. In conclusion, considerable variability existed in the clinical management of MR, particularly regarding referral of asymptomatic patients for mitral valve reparative surgery. Medications were frequently used to treat asymptomatic patients with MR in the absence of evidence of pharmacologic efficacy. MR was frequently not considered a relevant factor before treatment of patients with coexistent coronary artery disease.

Figure 9A—intervention for primary mitral regurgitation (MR)—directs management for moderate to severe or severe primary MR. In asymptomatic patients, if “LV EF ≤0.60 or LV ESD ≥4.0cm?” the pathway proceeds to mitral valve repair or replacement (MVRR); if not, surgery is prompted when “1 or more of the following [are] present” including “Resting PASP >50 mm Hg,” “Progressive increase in LVESD towards 4.0 cm on serial TTE,” or “Progressive decrease in LV EF towards ≤0.60.” If none are present, MVRR is considered only when “Likelihood of successful repair >95% AND Peri-operative risk <1%,” otherwise “GDMT Clinical and TTE F/U” is advised. In symptomatic patients, “MDT assessment: candidate for surgery?” leads to MVRR when yes; if not, “MDT assessment: candidate for transcatheter therapy?” leads to transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr) when yes or to GDMT when no; the figure notes that “Surgical repair is preferred over replacement for primary MR.”

### Mitral valve prolapse and its motley crew-syndromic prevalence, pathophysiology, and progression of a common heart condition [^b12bbc11]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Mitral valve prolapse is a common heart condition that is estimated to affect 2% to 3% of individuals.The defining finding in mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leaflets,which eventually leads to structural incompetence and superior displacement of one or both mitral leaflets into the left atrium (LA) during systole.Though it is recognized as a highly prevalent heart condition, the question of whether it is benign has been hotly disputed over the years.,After initially being described as a risk factor for several diseases including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, mitral regurgitation, and others,,an analysis of the Framingham Heart Study offspring cohort in 1999 disputed these findings, arguing that many of these associations were made in hospital‐based cohorts, and therefore patients were sicker and more likely to have comorbid disease.Subsequently, a community study of asymptomatic patients with mitral valve prolapse disputed these findings, and reported that the clinical course was much more heterogeneous than described in the Framingham study.

Despite the controversy, it is now well recognized that mitral valve prolapse poses a significant disease burden and is a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Based on the prevalence estimates at 2% to 3%, it is hypothesized that >7.8 million people in the United States, and >176 million people worldwide, are living with MVP.Another study published in 2020 estimates that prevalence worldwide of degenerative mitral valve disease, defined as myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leading to hemodynamically moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, is 18.1 million people (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 17.6 million to 18.6 million) and that the mortality rate from degenerative mitral valve disease in 2017 was 35 700 people (95% UI, 30 500–42 500).The discrepancy in prevalent cases between these 2 studies is likely attributable to a more stringent definition of degenerative mitral valve disease, which excludes patients with myxomatous degeneration who have mild or absent regurgitation. Further, it is unclear from the published data whether the mortality associated with degenerative mitral valve disease is a direct result of the valvular dysfunction itself, or as a result of recognized nonvalvular complications of mitral valve disease. Greater than 90 000 mitral valve surgeries occur each year making it the fastest growing cardiovascular intervention in the United States.Further, no Food and Drug Administration approved medical treatments exist for MVP, meaning surgical or percutaneous correction is the only treatment available to patients.

### The management of secondary mitral regurgitation in patients with heart failure: a joint position statement from the heart failure association (HFA), European association of cardiovascular imaging (EACVI), European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), and European association of percutaneous cardiovascular interventions (EAPCI) of the ESC [^b928684b]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and scope

Moderate or severe secondary (also known as functional) mitral regurgitation (SMR) accompanies heart failure (HF) in about one-third of patientsand contributes to clinical deterioration, progression of the syndrome, and adverse outcomes.Secondary mitral regurgitation results from left ventricular (LV) remodelling as a consequence of ischaemic or non-ischaemic myocardial disease that leads to reduced coaptation of normal mitral valve leaflets via several mechanisms.Since SMR is principally a disease of the left ventricle and not of the valve itself, current treatment strategies target the underlying LV disorder. However, SMR exaggerates LV remodelling by increasing volume load and mechanical correction has been proposed alongside guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) to improve symptoms and prognosis.

The interventional management of patients with HF and SMR is challenging. In contrast to primary (including degenerative) mitral regurgitation (MR), the outcomes of surgical mitral valve repair, either alone or combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), are of questionable benefit.Transcatheter techniques for the correction of SMR have broadened the spectrum of patients who may benefit from mitral valve intervention, although current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of both HF and valvular heart disease (VHD) indicate the need for further clinical research in this area. The recently published COAPTand MitraClip Device for Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral Regurgitation (MITRA-FR)randomized controlled trials have addressed this deficit but their conflicting results have generated considerable discussion and require careful interpretation.

This position statement, developed in collaboration by the ESC Heart Failure Association (HFA), European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI), European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), and European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI), proposes an updated practical approach to the management of patients with HF and SMR based on a multidisciplinary Heart Team approach. We outline the current evidence (and its limitations), discuss open issues that need to be addressed by future research, and stress the importance of appropriate referral and selection of patients for transcatheter mitral valve intervention alongside guideline-recommended medical and device therapies.

### Transcatheter therapy for mitral regurgitation clinical challenges and potential solutions [^fe08df55]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Severe mitral regurgitation is a common and complex disease that is associated with an adverse prognosis. For decades, surgical treatment has been the standard of care. Recently, multiple technologies for transcatheter mitral therapy have emerged, with the potential for both repair and replacement in patients with native mitral regurgitation. Transcatheter mitral technologies have potential as solutions for unmet clinical needs. Further rigorous clinical studies are needed to determine their efficacy and safety, as well as the appropriate patient candidates. These evaluations will help to define the role of transcatheter mitral therapy as a potentially exciting new strategy to improve the lives of patients with mitral regurgitation.

### Elevated trans-mitral pressure gradient predicts surgery in young people with moderate-severe rheumatic mitral regurgitation [^e6189c73]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient Management

Management pathways for children with severe MR are largely based on adult guidelines. Medical management of adults with moderate to severe chronic MR includes the use of diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and occasionally B-blockers. Sampaio et al. demonstrated a reduction in LA and LV size along with improvements in MR severity (including rheumatic MR and leaflet prolapse) with the use of Enalapril. Surgical intervention is recommended for symptomatic patients with chronic, severe MR and LV dilatation, and/or LV systolic dysfunction (Class I) and in asymptomatic patients with preserved LV systolic function but progressive increase in LV dimension (Class IIa).

Mitral valve surgery carries a risk of late mortality in children with RHD with survival of 83% reported at 15 years. Mitral valve repair is preferred in children, offering improved survival and freedom from reoperation compared with valve replacement ; however, avoidance of surgery or at least delay until adulthood would likely be the preferred option provided symptomatic relief can be achieved. The rate of reoperation at 10 years following mitral valve repair in children ranges from 18 to 47%. Surgical intervention may be an option for children in resource-rich countries; however, conservative management may be the only option for many living in other limited resource and high-risk regions, and detection of an elevated TMPG in those with significant MR may be a signal to provide more aggressive heart failure therapy if intervention or early mortality is to be avoided.

Timing of mitral valve surgery relies on echocardiographic features of severe disease, along with clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure. While an increase in TMPG is expected in cases of significant MR, the gradient is not traditionally used to evaluate MR severity or as a predictor of outcomes, such as the need for surgical intervention. Based on the 2D planimetry of MVA, no patient in our cohort had significant MS at the time of echocardiography nor was MS recorded on the operation report for those undergoing mitral valve surgery, confirming that significant MR was the cause of elevated TMPG rather than stenosis.

Chronic primary MR—Class 2 and Class 3 recommendations state that in asymptomatic patients with severe primary MR and normal LV systolic function (LVEF ≥60% and LVESD ≤40 mm) (Stage C1), mitral valve repair is reasonable when the likelihood of a successful and durable repair without residual MR is >95% with an expected mortality rate of <1%, when it can be performed at a Primary or Comprehensive Valve Center; in asymptomatic patients with severe primary MR and normal LV systolic function (LVEF >60% and LVESD <40 mm) (Stage C1) but with a progressive increase in LV size or decrease in EF on 3 serial imaging studies, mitral valve surgery may be considered irrespective of the probability of a successful and durable repair; in severely symptomatic patients (NYHA class III or IV) with primary severe MR and high or prohibitive surgical risk, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is reasonable if mitral valve anatomy is favorable for the repair procedure and patient life expectancy is at least 1 year; in symptomatic patients with severe primary MR attributable to rheumatic valve disease, mitral valve repair may be considered at a Comprehensive Valve Center by an experienced team when surgical treatment is indicated, if a durable and successful repair is likely; and in patients with severe primary MR when the leaflet pathology is limited to less than one half of the posterior leaflet, mitral valve replacement should not be performed unless mitral valve repair has been attempted at a Primary or Comprehensive Valve Center and was unsuccessful.

Third, as regurgitation through the mitral valve worsens, increasing amounts of blood are expelled into the LA instead of through the aorta, causing left atrial pressure and volume overload.This results in left atrial enlargement, and may cause AF, as has been discussed in our section on AF.At the same time, worsening regurgitation has been associated with increases in pulmonary arterial pressures,,likely as a result of pulmonary congestion because of the regurgitant blood and left atrial volume overload.Even in asymptomatic patients with severe regurgitation, 34% had elevated pulmonary systolic pressures during exercise, suggesting that these patients may have subclinical pulmonary congestion that has not yet progressed to symptomatic pulmonary hypertension.In another study of patients with left ventricular dysfunction (defined by an EF <50%), severity of mitral regurgitation was found to independently predict pulmonary arterial pressure.These findings suggest that regurgitation drives the onset of pulmonary hypertension independent of left ventricular dysfunction. Worsening pulmonary hypertension, in turn, increases right ventricular afterload, and causes right ventricular remodeling and hypertrophy, but this is ultimately insufficient to overcome the increase in pulmonary afterload, and right‐sided heart failure develops.Severity of pulmonary hypertension in patients with mitral regurgitation is associated with worse outcomes. In a study of 1318 patients with severe mitral regurgitation attributable to myxomatous degeneration, an elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (>35 mm Hg) was seen in 77% of patients who died, and there was a positive trend that showed the higher your baseline right ventricular systolic pressure, the higher your mortality risk.Despite the risks of pulmonary hypertension on adverse outcomes in MR patients, current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend avoiding surgical intervention on patients with regurgitation until the development of pulmonary hypertension, when their right ventricular systolic pressures reach 50 mm Hg.As such, current guidelines may wait too long to intervene in patients with mildly elevated right ventricular systolic pressures, and delay care that may be associated with a more favorable outcome.

DMR, CARDIAC REMODELING, AND HEART FAILURE

HEART FAILURE AND INDICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION.

MVP is the most frequent cause of clinically significant DMR.The burden of moderate to severe DMR is large, affecting 1.4 to 1.6 million persons in the United States. Early cohorts of DMR emphasized excess-mortality, frequent heart failure and atrial fibrillation during follow-up,, mostly in proportion to DMR severity.Despite the high burden and serious outcomes of DMR, whether MVP and DMR represent a public health problem may not appear obvious, as an effective treatment is available in the form of MV repair, which is superior to valve replacementat all ages and long after surgery.MV repair restores life expectancy and markedly reduces heart failure risk when indicated early in the course of the disease.However, despite this therapeutic progress, there remains an unmet need for treatment, as attested by the profound undertreatment of affected patients in the community, which is in turn associated with persistent excess mortality.

Current consensus (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology) guidelines for treatment of MVP are predicated on confirmation of severe MR. Current triggers for intervention are based upon symptoms, LV dysfunction, left atrial remodeling, progressive LV remodeling, and high likelihood of surgical repair. These guidelines do not fully take into account clinical modifiers, and largely rely on linear chamber indexes rather than volumetric cutoffs, which are quantifiable by 3-dimensional (3D) echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) technologies.
