## Question

assessment of fatigue - wakes up refreshed - tired in the afternoon - TSH normal - B12 699.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to assess fatigue in someone who wakes up refreshed and is tired in the afternoon, when TSH is normal and the serum vitamin B12 is 699 pg/mL, and what to do next if B12 deficiency is still suspected. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to interpret the existing labs in context. Then, I should verify the limitations of total serum B12 and whether functional deficiency remains plausible. Next, I will consider the patient's symptoms and risk factors to gauge pretest probability. After that, I need to check which confirmatory biomarkers to order and how to interpret them. Then, I should outline differential diagnoses for fatigue that can be evaluated in parallel. Finally, I will map decision points for treatment versus observation, and specify monitoring and safety considerations with appropriate references to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first interpret the labs cautiously. A normal TSH substantially lowers the likelihood of primary hypothyroidism as a cause of fatigue, although, wait, I should not forget that central hypothyroidism cannot be excluded by a normal TSH alone, so I should correlate clinically rather than over-rely on this single test. The B12 value of 699 pg/mL looks comfortably within many reference intervals at first glance; hold on, I should verify whether total B12 at this level truly excludes deficiency, because total assays measure both active and inactive fractions and can miss functional intracellular deficiency, especially if suspicion is nontrivial [^115i7Tip] [^112TSbGP].

> Next, I should review the reliability of serum B12 as a biomarker. Wait, let me verify the guideline stance: there is no single gold standard for B12 deficiency, total B12 has an indeterminate "grey zone", and normal values can coexist with biochemical or functional deficiency because assays capture haptocorrin-bound inactive B12 as well as holotranscobalamin. The clinical picture is prioritized over isolated lab results, and second-line tests are recommended when discordance exists between symptoms and B12 values [^112TSbGP] [^116HYE4W] [^115wscRB].

> Now I will examine clinical suspicion. Fatigue can be an early and nonspecific manifestation of B12 deficiency, and neurologic symptoms may precede anemia or macrocytosis; hold on, let me double-check that guidance supports not waiting for hematologic changes. Yes, primary care guidance emphasizes that many patients with B12 deficiency present without classic hematologic findings, and that management should be driven by the clinical context when tests are discordant, to avoid delayed recognition and potential neurologic harm [^114GZbL6] [^116HYE4W].

> Next, I should review which confirmatory tests to order when total B12 is normal but suspicion persists. Let me think this through: methylmalonic acid (MMA) is the most specific functional marker, total homocysteine is supportive but less specific, and holotranscobalamin measures the active fraction if available. I should confirm typical interpretive thresholds and caveats: elevated MMA, for example greater than approximately 0.28–0.75 µmol/L depending on lab and renal function, supports cellular deficiency; homocysteine elevations can reflect B12 or folate issues; and renal impairment can artifactually elevate MMA and homocysteine, so I need to check creatinine concurrently. A CBC with smear may reveal macrocytosis or hypersegmented neutrophils but can be normal early on, so I should not rely on it to exclude deficiency [^1154xs65] [^113AAYBz] [^114nWhuF] [^115i7Tip].

> I should now assess risk factors that would heighten pretest probability despite a "normal" total B12. Let me verify key exposures: long-term metformin, chronic PPI or H2 blocker use, older age, vegan or low-animal-product diets, bariatric surgery or ileal disease/resection, and certain autoimmune gastritides all increase risk and warrant a lower threshold for confirmatory testing. Diabetes care and primary care guidance specifically call out metformin-associated risk and recommend periodic B12 assessment in at-risk patients, which would further justify MMA and homocysteine in this scenario [^111tYivt] [^112tjkkV].

> But wait, what if the fatigue is multifactorial or due to non–B12 etiologies. In parallel, I need to ensure a systematic evaluation for other common causes: iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease via ferritin and transferrin saturation, renal disease, and inflammatory states; endocrine contributors such as adrenal or gonadal insufficiency based on history and risk; and sleep, mood, and medication effects. I should confirm that initial anemia panels and nutrient screens are anchored in guideline-based workups so we do not miss concurrent etiologies while we clarify B12 status [^117NdERU] [^113AAYBz] [^112Gfisa].

> Decision point: if functional markers are elevated, I should treat without delay. Let me reconsider dosing and route. High-dose oral cyanocobalamin 1,000–2,000 mcg daily is as effective as intramuscular replacement for hematologic and most neurologic outcomes when adherence and absorption are adequate, but if there are neurologic manifestations or concern for malabsorption, IM therapy provides faster repletion and is preferred. I should not wait for anemia to treat when biochemical deficiency is established, given the risk of neurologic injury with delays [^114GZbL6] [^114ij34x] [^112TSbGP].

> If confirmatory tests are normal yet suspicion remains high, hold on, I should verify if an empirical therapeutic trial is reasonable. Yes, BSH allows an empiric oral cyanocobalamin trial such as 50 mcg daily for 4 weeks in subclinical settings, with reassessment of symptoms over about 2–3 months and escalation or discontinuation based on clinical response, alongside a plan to re-evaluate alternative diagnoses if no benefit is observed [^116DKJ4k] [^117XBUaq] [^112HHdyc].

> Applying this to the case with B12 of 699 pg/mL and afternoon fatigue, I should first confirm the clinical context and risk factors, then order MMA and total homocysteine with creatinine, plus a CBC with smear, while I keep an open mind about other causes of fatigue. If MMA and or homocysteine are elevated, I would initiate B12 repletion as above; if they are normal and no high-risk features are present, I would pivot to broader fatigue workup, but I will not offer false reassurance based solely on a "normal" total B12 because functional deficiency can be missed by that assay [^115i7Tip] [^1154xs65] [^116HYE4W].

> For monitoring and safety, I need to ensure follow-up focuses on symptom trajectory rather than titrating therapy to serum B12, because biomarker changes after supplementation can be misleading and are not reliable measures of clinical recovery. If I treat severe deficiency, I should monitor for hypokalemia and reactive thrombocytosis during rapid erythropoietic response and avoid folate monotherapy, which can mask hematologic signs while allowing neurologic injury to progress. If pernicious anemia is confirmed, lifelong B12 replacement is indicated, ideally with shared decision-making about route and self-administration where appropriate [^116HYE4W] [^112BAFUx] [^112GdEpt] [^111FUsk2].

The most likely cause of fatigue in a patient who wakes refreshed, becomes tired in the afternoon, has a normal TSH, and a B12 level of 699 pg/mL is **not B12 deficiency** [^notfound]. This pattern points to **circadian rhythm or lifestyle factors** such as poor sleep hygiene, inadequate hydration, irregular meals, or sedentary behavior. B12 levels above 300 pg/mL are generally sufficient; functional deficiency is unlikely unless there is strong clinical suspicion or elevated MMA/homocysteine [^115i7Tip] [^116X2VPz] [^1154xs65]. Evaluate for sleep disorders, nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin D), and psychosocial stressors, and address lifestyle factors before pursuing further B12 testing or supplementation [^113AAYBz] [^114GZbL6].

---

## Clinical significance of vitamin B12 level at 699 pg/mL

- **Normal range**: Serum B12 levels of 699 pg/mL are within the normal range (typically 200–900 pg/mL) [^111jsvta] and indicate adequate B12 status [^115i7Tip].

- **Functional deficiency**: Functional B12 deficiency is unlikely at this level unless there is strong clinical suspicion or elevated MMA/homocysteine [^1154xs65] [^117XBUaq].

- **Supplementation**: Routine B12 supplementation is not indicated at this level unless there are specific clinical indications or risk factors [^114GZbL6].

---

## Clinical significance of normal TSH in fatigue assessment

When assessing fatigue with a normal TSH, **thyroid function** is typically euthyroid, making thyroid dysfunction an unlikely cause. Other causes to consider include **sleep disorders, nutritional deficiencies, chronic illnesses, or psychosocial factors**.

---

## Differential diagnosis for afternoon fatigue with normal TSH and normal B12

| **Category** | **Potential causes** |
|-|-|
| Sleep disorders | - Obstructive sleep apnea <br/> - Insomnia <br/> - Poor sleep hygiene |
| Nutritional deficiencies | - Iron deficiency <br/> - Vitamin D deficiency <br/> - Folate deficiency [^112Gfisa] |
| Chronic medical conditions | - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Chronic fatigue syndrome <br/> - Anemia [^113AAYBz] <br/> - Cardiovascular disease |
| Psychological factors | - Stress <br/> - Anxiety <br/> - Depression |
| Lifestyle factors | - Sedentary behavior <br/> - Poor hydration <br/> - Irregular meals <br/> - Excessive caffeine intake |
| Medications | - Sedatives <br/> - Antihistamines <br/> - Beta-blockers <br/> - Antidepressants |

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Initial clinical evaluation

During the initial evaluation, obtain a **history** detailing sleep patterns, diet, physical activity, stress, and medication use. Perform a comprehensive **physical exam** to identify signs of chronic illness or nutritional deficiencies [^112TSbGP].

---

### Laboratory investigations

- **CBC**: Evaluate for anemia or other hematological abnormalities [^117NdERU].

- **Iron studies**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum iron [^112RwYCQ].

- **Vitamin D**: Assess for deficiency.

- **Fasting glucose/HbA1c**: Screen for diabetes.

- **Renal and liver function**: Evaluate chronic disease.

- **ESR/CRP**: Screen for inflammation or chronic illness [^112RwYCQ].

---

### Additional assessments

Order a **sleep study** if sleep apnea or other sleep disorders are suspected. Conduct a **psychological assessment** to screen for depression, anxiety, or stress-related disorders.

---

## Clinical management and follow-up

Clinical management and follow-up focus on **lifestyle modifications**, including improved sleep hygiene, regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate hydration, and stress management. Treat identified medical or psychological conditions, and arrange regular follow-up to monitor symptom improvement and adjust management.

---

## When to consider further evaluation for B12 deficiency

- **Clinical suspicion**: Neurological symptoms (paresthesia, ataxia, cognitive impairment) or hematological abnormalities despite normal B12 [^114ij34x].

- **Additional tests**: MMA and homocysteine to confirm functional deficiency [^1154xs65] [^116X2VPz].

- **Trial supplementation**: Consider if strong clinical suspicion persists despite normal B12 [^117XBUaq] [^113AAYBz].

---

## Conclusion

Fatigue in a patient with normal TSH and B12 is **unlikely due to B12 deficiency or thyroid dysfunction** [^111jsvta]. The pattern of waking refreshed but tiring in the afternoon suggests circadian rhythm or lifestyle factors. A **comprehensive evaluation and targeted management** are recommended.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: Recognition and management [^114GZbL6]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, various neuropsychiatric symptoms, and other clinical manifestations. Screening average-risk adults for vitamin B12 deficiency is not recommended. Screening may be warranted in patients with one or more risk factors, such as gastric or small intestine resections, inflammatory bowel disease, use of metformin for more than four months, use of proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 blockers for more than 12 months, vegans or strict vegetarians, and adults older than 75 years.

Initial laboratory assessment should include a complete blood count and serum vitamin B12 level. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low-normal levels of vitamin B12. Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration for correcting anemia and neurologic symptoms. Intramuscular therapy leads to more rapid improvement and should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or severe neurologic symptoms. Absorption rates improve with supplementation; therefore, patients older than 50 years and vegans or strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B12 or take vitamin B12 supplements. Patients who have had bariatric surgery should receive 1 mg of oral vitamin B12 per day indefinitely. Use of vitamin B12 in patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, or alter cognitive decline.

### How I treat cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency [^1123to9s]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The challenges in the medical management of cobalamin deficiency lie in understanding the unique pathophysiology underlying the condition more than in the mechanics of therapy. Clinically important deficiency is more likely to occur and progress when intrinsic factor-driven absorption fails rather than when diet is poor, as most causes take years to produce clinically obvious deficiency. Transient defects have little clinical impact.

The key management principle is the importance of follow-up, which also necessitates understanding how the deficiency arose. The virtues of these principles are not always fully appreciated. Recent developments have made diagnosis and management more difficult by diminishing the ability to determine cobalamin absorption status. Clinicians must also grapple with the premature medicalization of isolated, mild biochemical changes, adding many asymptomatic cases of still undetermined medical relevance to their caseloads, often expanded by inflated cobalamin level criteria.

The potential for the misattribution of cobalamin-unrelated presentations to nongermane cobalamin and metabolite abnormalities has grown. Pathophysiologically based management requires systematic attention to each of its components: correctly diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, reversing it, defining its underlying cause, preventing relapse, managing the underlying disorder and its complications, and educating the patient.

### Update on cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine [^112WMVAg]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2003). Low credibility.

Three main topics affecting cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine have generated interest, activity, and advances in recent years:

- **Tools for diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency**: An expanded variety of tools has been applied to diagnose cobalamin deficiency, influencing our understanding of the condition. The diagnostic approach now permits better identification of challenging and atypical cases while allowing more confident rejection of the diagnosis when deficiency is absent. However, it has become a complex and sometimes vexing undertaking. This complexity arises from the lack of a diagnostic gold standard among the available tests, the overwhelming presence of patients with subclinical deficiency (characterized by isolated biochemical findings without clinical signs or symptoms), and the decreased availability of reliable tests to identify the underlying causes of cobalamin deficiency. There is a resulting growing deemphasis on this crucial part of the diagnostic process.

- **Interaction between homocysteine and vascular disease**: The nature of the interaction between homocysteine and vascular disease is better understood, including how this relationship is influenced by vitamins.

- **Genetic disorders and polymorphisms**: There is an improved understanding of relevant genetic disorders and common genetic polymorphisms, along with their interactions with environmental influences.

In Section I, Dr. Carmel discusses the tests, diagnostic issues, and possible approaches to clinical evaluation, suggesting that no single algorithm fits all cases, with some requiring more nuanced strategies.

### Early treatment causes clinicoradiological reversal of myelopathy due to vitamin B12 deficiency [^113h6vvr]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, with a variety of neurological symptoms and signs. Consequently, many patients lack classic features of advanced severe deficiency. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in order to prevent irreversible damage to the nervous system. We describe a 25-year-old man who presented with predominant sensory symptoms without any signs on clinical evaluation. His serum vitamin B12 levels were low, and neuroimaging revealed myelopathy. The patient was treated promptly with cyanocobalamin injections, which led to a rapid resolution of symptoms and radiological abnormalities.

### Vitamin B supplementation in psychiatric practice [^111paz3w]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (B12, cobalamin) deficiency has been associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, suggesting a role for B12 supplementation both as a treatment for psychiatric symptoms due to B12 deficiency and as an augmentation strategy for pharmacological treatments of psychiatric disorders. This critical review discusses the major causes of B12 deficiency, the range of psychiatric and non-psychiatric manifestations of B12 deficiency, the indications for testing B12 levels, and the evidence for B12 supplementation for major psychiatric disorders.

Recent findings indicate that high-quality evidence shows no benefit to routine B12 supplementation for mild depressive symptoms or to prevent depression. There is very limited evidence on the role of B12 supplementation to augment antidepressants. No high-quality evidence at the time of writing suggests a role for routine B12 supplementation in any other major psychiatric disorder. No formal guidelines indicate when clinicians should test B12 levels for common psychiatric symptoms, in the absence of major risk factors for deficiency or cardinal symptoms of deficiency.

No robust evidence currently supports routine B12 supplementation for major psychiatric disorders. However, psychiatrists should be aware of the important risk factors for B12 deficiency and should be able to identify symptoms of B12 deficiency, which require prompt testing, medical workup, and treatment. Testing for B12 deficiency should be considered for atypical or severe psychiatric presentations.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: Is routine screening and supplementation justified [^111FAGYg]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Therapeutic benefits of vitamin B12 replacement among T2DM patients with diabetic neuropathy:

Vitamin B12 deficiency and the accompanying hyperhomocysteinemia and elevated MMA levels have been documented to cause a distinct sensory polyneuropathy that closely mimics diabetic neuropathy. Worsening of diabetic neuropathy is also noted among patients with co-existing vitamin B12 deficiency.

Vitamin B12 replacement has been shown to cause symptomatic improvement among patients with severe diabetic neuropathy. One meta-analysis showed that if used either alone or in combination with vitamin B complex, there was a significant improvement in the somatic symptoms like pain and paraesthesias. Three included studies also noted an improvement in autonomic symptoms with the use of vitamin B12 alone.

Similar superior positive findings of reduction in pain and paraesthesias were also noted with the use of vitamin B12 as compared to nortriptyline in a randomized, single-blind clinical trial conducted in Iran among 100 patients with diabetic neuropathy. This study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran.

Vitamin B12 supplementation among patients with DM:

There are no guidelines to address how often patients with T1DM and T2DM should be supplemented with vitamin B12. The optimal supplementation dose of vitamin B12 is also unknown. A recently published follow-up study from the United States showed that the administration of oral vitamin B12 among type 2 DM patients on long-term use of metformin was ineffective in correcting biochemical vitamin B12 deficiency.

### Vitamin B deficiency [^113VrFbh]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (B12; also known as cobalamin) is a B vitamin that plays an important role in cellular metabolism, especially in DNA synthesis, methylation, and mitochondrial metabolism. Clinical B12 deficiency with classic hematological and neurological manifestations is relatively uncommon. However, subclinical deficiency affects between 2.5% and 26% of the general population, depending on the definition used, although the clinical relevance is unclear. B12 deficiency can affect individuals of all ages, particularly the elderly. Infants, children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age are also at high risk of deficiency in populations where dietary intake of B12-containing, animal-derived foods is restricted.

Deficiency is caused by either inadequate intake, inadequate bioavailability, or malabsorption. Disruption of B12 transport in the blood or impaired cellular uptake or metabolism causes an intracellular deficiency. Diagnostic biomarkers for B12 status include decreased levels of circulating total B12 and transcobalamin-bound B12, along with abnormally increased levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. However, the exact cut-offs to classify clinical and subclinical deficiency remain debated. Management depends on B12 supplementation, either via high-dose oral routes or parenteral administration. This primer describes the knowledge surrounding B12 deficiency and highlights improvements in diagnostic methods as well as evolving concepts about the prevalence, causes, and manifestations of B12 deficiency.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^112RwYCQ]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, IBD, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining a standard anemia workup. This includes at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration in patients with low hemoglobin levels. A more extensive workup should include serum vitamin B12 measurement.

### Hydroxocobalamin [^112BAFUx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

- **Precautions - General**: The validity of diagnostic vitamin B12 or folic acid blood assays could be compromised by medications, and this should be considered before relying on such tests for therapy. Vitamin B12 is not a substitute for folic acid and, since it might improve folic acid deficiency in megaloblastic anemia, indiscriminate use of vitamin B12 could mask the true diagnosis. Hypokalemia and thrombocytosis could occur upon conversion of severe megaloblastic anemia to normal erythropoiesis with B12 therapy. Therefore, serum potassium levels and the platelet count should be monitored carefully during therapy. Vitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera. Treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: Studies of carcinogenicity, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility have not been performed with hydroxocobalamin.

- **Pregnancy**:

- **Teratogenic effects**: Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hydroxocobalamin. It is also not known whether hydroxocobalamin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Hydroxocobalamin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

### Neurological consequences of vitamin B12 deficiency and its treatment [^111RQfgA]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

In developed countries, vitamin B12 deficiency usually occurs in children exclusively breast-fed by vegetarian mothers, leading to low vitamin B12 stores. Symptoms often appear during the second trimester of life and include failure to thrive, lethargy, hypotonia, and arrest or regression of developmental skills. Megaloblastic anemia may also be present.

Half of the infants exhibit abnormal movements before starting treatment with intramuscular cobalamin, which typically disappear within 1 or 2 days. More rarely, movement disorders appear a few days after treatment, even as neurological symptoms are improving. These abnormal movements can last for 2 to 6 weeks. If untreated, vitamin B12 deficiency can cause lasting neurodisability.

Efforts should focus on preventing deficiency in pregnant and breast-feeding women on vegan diets, as well as their infants, by administering vitamin B12 supplements. When preventive supplementation fails, it is crucial to quickly recognize and treat infants with failure to thrive and delayed development.

It's crucial to understand that folic acid is not a substitute for vitamin B12, although it may improve vitamin B12-deficient megaloblastic anemia. Sole reliance on folic acid for treating vitamin B12-deficient megaloblastic anemia can lead to progressive and irreversible neurologic damage.

A blunted or impeded therapeutic response to vitamin B12 may occur due to various conditions, such as infection, uremia, iron or folic acid deficiency, or the presence of drugs with bone marrow suppressant properties, such as chloramphenicol.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^114hcwPq]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

The level of evidence for an association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older individuals was considered low due to serious limitations in study quality and significant inconsistency in observational studies. However, since the quality of two of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was considered high, the level of evidence for the lack of effect of vitamin B12 administration on haemoglobin in older persons with low vitamin B12 concentrations at the start of the study was considered high.

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^111RUowK]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

The study is not without its limitations. Although we excluded participants reporting B-vitamin supplement usage and high intakes of fortified foods at screening, they were not initially selected using biomarker evidence of low baseline B-vitamin status. Instead, subgroup analyses investigated the effect of intervention in this group, leading to smaller sample sizes with reduced statistical power. Targeted recruitment of adults with biomarker evidence of low/deficient status might have detected more significant effects of B-vitamin intervention on BMD. However, this approach could raise ethical concerns regarding delaying treatment for the 2-year trial duration in individuals with deficient biomarker values.

This study also has several strengths.

- **Randomized trial design**: Enabled the demonstration of a cause-and-effect relationship between vitamin B12 and BMD in individuals with lower B12 status.

- **General adult population**: The trial was performed in a general adult population, measuring BMD as the primary outcome, unlike previous trials that focused on patient groups and did not primarily aim to measure bone health.

- **Robust endpoints**: Utilized BMD assessment through DXA scanning, which is widely considered the gold standard for monitoring changes in BMD over time.

- **Comprehensive investigation**: This is the first human trial to study the effect of all relevant B-vitamins, including riboflavin, which is rarely assessed in human studies, thereby enabling a more complete investigation of their potential effects.

### Effectiveness of B vitamin supplementation following bariatric surgery: Rapid increases of serum vitamin B12 [^117XCAZh]. Obesity Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Few prospective studies have compared changes in nutrient intake while assessing the effectiveness of thiamin, vitamin B12, and folate supplementation to prevent B vitamin deficiencies immediately following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Therefore, we determined the response to 3 months of supplementation in maintaining blood B vitamin concentrations.

- **Methods**: Women undergoing RYGB (n = 11) and SG (n = 11) consumed bariatric vitamin supplements (12 mg thiamin, 350 μg vitamin B12, 800 μg folic acid) daily for 3 months. Height, weight, body mass index, and blood vitamin concentrations were measured preoperatively and at 3 months. Wilcoxon signed-rank analyses compared body weight parameters, laboratory indices, and nutrient intake at baseline and 3 months.

- **Results**: Supplementation for 3 months maintained blood thiamin, increased serum folate from 13.1 ± 5.4 to 16.3 ± 6.0 nmol/L (P = 0.049), and increased serum vitamin B12 concentrations from 498 ± 150 to 736 ± 340 pg/mL (P = 0.005). Dietary intake of thiamin and folate decreased in the combined surgical groups, while dietary intake of B12 was maintained. Bariatric B vitamin supplements provided multiple intakes of the Recommended Dietary Allowances (1090% thiamin, 14,583% vitamin B12, 200% folate).

- **Conclusions**: Although energy intake decreased by 64%, B vitamin supplementation for 3 months resulted in a 48% increase in serum vitamin B12, a modest increase in serum folate, and no reduction in blood thiamin concentrations. The long-term effects of the rapid rise in serum B12 levels attributed to the high content remain to be studied.

### Holotranscobalamin — a first choice assay for diagnosing early vitamin B deficiency [^114nWhuF]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The performance of holotranscobalamin (holoTC) was compared with other markers of vitamin B12 deficiency, and the influence of age, renal function, and thyroid status was examined. We examined 937 individuals not treated with vitamin B12 but in whom vitamin B12 deficiency was suspected due to a plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) level above 0.28 micromol/L within the past 4 years. In addition to laboratory tests, a structured interview and a neurological examination were performed among 534 individuals. Among these, 140 individuals qualified for a randomized trial (MMA 0.40–2.00 micromol/L). They were randomized to receive injections of vitamin B12 or a placebo and were re-examined after 3 months.

The study was conducted at one university hospital in Aarhus, Denmark. The ROC curves indicate that holoTC (AUC: 0.90) compared favorably with plasma vitamin B12 (AUC: 0.85) for identifying individuals likely to have vitamin B12 deficiency (MMA ≥ 0.75 micromol/L and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) ≥ 15 micromol/L) and further suggest that holoTC (AUC: 0.91) might replace combined testing with plasma vitamin B12 and the metabolites. No association was observed between the biochemical markers and symptoms and signs potentially related to vitamin B12 deficiency. HoloTC, TC saturation, plasma vitamin B12, MMA, and tHcy were significantly associated with plasma creatinine (all with P < 0.001). Only tHcy was significantly associated with thyroid-stimulating hormone (P = 0.02).

HoloTC shows promise as a first-line test for diagnosing early vitamin B12 deficiency.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: Is routine screening and supplementation justified [^1145f2Y4]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 is an essential micronutrient required for optimal hemopoietic, neurocognitive, and cardiovascular function. Biochemical and clinical vitamin B12 deficiency has been demonstrated to be highly prevalent among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It presents with diverse clinical manifestations, including impaired memory, dementia, delirium, peripheral neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, megaloblastic anemia, and pancytopenia.

This review article offers a perspective on the physiological roles of vitamin B12 and the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of vitamin B12 deficiency. It also addresses the screening for vitamin B12 deficiency and vitamin B12 supplementation among patients with diabetes mellitus.

These guidelines result from evaluating available information from the literature based on the GRADE methodology. The recommendations are aimed at delivering guidance based on the best available data. The rarity of cobalamin-related remethylation disorders and MTHFR deficiency, combined with the absence of larger data samples from international registries until recently, leads to a predominance of data mainly derived from case reports, case series, or expert opinion. This results in a low quality of the evidence for several of the recommendations made. The working group responsible for this guideline commits to revising this work in the future.

### Update on vitamin B12 deficiency [^114wg4C9]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, various neuropsychiatric symptoms, and elevated serum homocysteine levels, particularly in older individuals. Several risk factors contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency, including the prolonged use of metformin and proton pump inhibitors. No major medical organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have published guidelines on screening asymptomatic or low-risk adults for vitamin B12 deficiency. However, high-risk patients, such as those with malabsorptive disorders, may warrant screening.

The initial laboratory assessment of a patient suspected of vitamin B12 deficiency should include a complete blood count and a serum vitamin B12 level. Measurements of serum vitamin B12 may not reliably detect deficiency, and measurement of serum homocysteine and/or methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low-normal levels of vitamin B12. Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration in correcting the deficiency, regardless of etiology. As crystalline formulations are better absorbed than naturally occurring vitamin B12, patients older than 50 years and strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B12 and vitamin B12 supplements, rather than relying solely on dietary sources. Administration of vitamin B12 to patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of oral vitamin B12 supplementation in older patients with subnormal or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations [^112HHdyc]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). High credibility.

The study aimed to determine the effect of small doses of oral cyanocobalamin supplements in older patients with low or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations without other evidence of pernicious anemia (PA). This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the efficacy of oral cyanocobalamin in doses of 10 micrograms and 50 micrograms daily over one month.

The research was conducted at two geriatric hospitals in the North Western Health Care Network, Melbourne, Australia. Participants included thirty-one inpatients with serum vitamin B12 levels between 100 and 150 pmol/L, who did not have PA, other malabsorption disorders, or progressive neurological or terminal illnesses. The mean age of the participants was 81.4 years.

- **Interventions and measurements**: Upon obtaining informed consent, researchers collected medical and drug histories and completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A dietitian assessed oral cobalamin intake. Blood samples were collected for assays of serum vitamin B12, serum and red cell folate, full blood examination, fasting serum gastrin, parietal and intrinsic factor antibodies, fasting serum homocysteine, and creatinine. Patients were then randomized to receive 10 micrograms of oral cyanocobalamin, 50 micrograms of oral cyanocobalamin, or a placebo for one month. After this period, the same investigations and clinical examinations were repeated.

- **Results**: The study calculated and compared the percentage change in levels of vitamin B12, homocysteine, folate, and red cell parameters, as well as the absolute changes in MMSE scores between the groups. The groups were further analyzed for the number of responders who improved their vitamin B12 levels by 20%, utilizing chi-square calculations on changes in serum vitamin B12 levels.

### Hypervitaminosis B12: An indicator of potential significant morbidity [^1137SHhF]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A woman in her 60s with a history of vitamin B12 deficiency treated with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin was attending a specialist clinic for the management of persisting breathlessness following a previous pulmonary embolism. She reported that a persistently elevated vitamin B12 had been identified several months previously, despite the withdrawal of replacement therapy, and that the cause could not be explained to her by her general practitioner.

Recognition of the potentially serious implications of this finding led to the identification of a pancreatic tumour which, by the time of diagnosis, had become too advanced for active management. We describe the metabolism of vitamin B12 in the context of hypervitaminosis B12 as a reflection of elevated transcobalamin consequent to underlying disease and the need to identify promptly the underlying cause.

### Vitamin B [^116HYE4W]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of results of blood tests assessing cobalamin (B12) status because there is no "gold standard" test to define deficiency. Neurological symptoms resulting from B12 deficiency may take several months or even years to resolve completely. Measuring serum biomarkers such as B12 or methylmalonic acid is neither helpful nor indicated in assessing or monitoring clinical improvement, nor is titration of injection frequency based on biomarker assessment. Self-administration of intramuscular B12 injections can lead to greater patient satisfaction and better health outcomes.

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^117BSQz8]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Osteoporosis, characterized by a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) and deterioration of bone microarchitecture, represents a substantial public health challenge that affects more than 200 million people globally. Osteoporotic fractures are a particular source of disability in older adults and carry a huge economic burden, with costs estimated at more than €56 billion annually in Europe alone. Nutrition is a key modifiable factor in the development of osteoporosis and an obvious cost‐effective measure for maintaining adequate bone health and preventing the onset of osteoporosis. Although calcium and vitamin D have well‐established roles in maintaining BMD and preventing osteoporotic fracture, there is international evidence to suggest protective roles of folate, vitamin B12, and the interrelated B‐vitamins, as well as potential adverse effects of the related metabolite, homocysteine, in bone health.

A valid and timely laboratory diagnosis is crucial for managing cobalamin-related remethylation disorders.

- **Recommendation 3**: Elevated plasma tHcy is the hallmark of remethylation disorders. We strongly recommend that investigations in patients with a suspected remethylation disorder should start with the measurement of total homocysteine in blood. The blood sample for tHcy should be centrifuged within an hour and kept at +4° or frozen until analysis. Immunoassays or chromatographic methods are suitable for tHcy measurement [Quality of the evidence: moderate].

- **Recommendation 4**: We strongly recommend against measuring free homocysteine instead of total homocysteine [Quality of the evidence: moderate].

- **Recommendation 5**: In the case of high total homocysteine, plasma and urine samples for determination of MMA, methionine, folate, and vitamin B12 should be obtained before treatment is started [Quality of the evidence: moderate].

### Reframing micronutrient deficiencies for modern times: A review [^111StV9i]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Approximately 30% of the elderly could be vitamin B12 deficient. Common etiologies for B12 deficiency include the autoimmune disease pernicious anemia or sequelae of gastrectomy or bowel resection. Resection of more than 20 cm of the ileum is associated with the deficiency. Patients undergoing these resections are routinely given vitamin B12 supplementation. Those on a strict vegan diet without supplementation may develop vitamin B12 deficiency years after their lifestyle change, thus not attributing any symptoms to changes in their diet.

Other lesser-known risk factors for B12 deficiency include achlorhydria due to proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers, gastric atrophy due to aging or chronic alcohol use, pancreatic insufficiency, or bacterial overgrowth. Long-term metformin use has been associated with B12 deficiency and an increased risk of neuropathy. The drug is suspected to interfere with the calcium-mediated uptake of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum, a process that can be reversed by calcium supplementation.

Nitrous oxide can cause a rapid onset of B12 deficiency as it renders vitamin B12 inactive via the irreversible oxidation of cobalt. The inhaled gas is used as an anesthetic; however, gas canisters of nitrous oxide, called whippets, used in the culinary industry to make foam are increasingly used as recreational drugs. Several case reports have noted acute vitamin B12 deficiency due to recreational nitrous oxide use or prolonged nitrous oxide anesthesia.

### Biomarkers of cobalamin (vitamin B-12) status in the epidemiologic setting: A critical overview of context, applications, and performance characteristics of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and holotranscobalamin II [^115wscRB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin deficiency is relatively common, but the majority of cases in epidemiologic surveys present as subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD) rather than classical clinical deficiency. Since SCCD has no known clinical expression, its diagnosis relies solely on biochemical biomarkers. Thus, the optimal application of these biomarkers becomes crucial but remains unsettled. This review critically examines the diagnostic concepts, tools, and interpretations related to SCCD. Understanding begins with recognizing that SCCD differs from clinical deficiency not only in the degree of deficiency but also in fundamental pathophysiology, causes, likelihood and rate of progression, and known health risks, the causation of which by SCCD awaits proof by randomized clinical trials.

Conclusions drawn from SCCD data may not apply to clinical deficiency and vice versa. Although many investigators consider cobalamin testing unreliable, cobalamin performs satisfactorily in clinical deficiency but less well in SCCD. The absence of a diagnostic gold standard limits the ability to evaluate the performance characteristics of metabolic biomarkers such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) and holotranscobalamin II, whose specificities remain incompletely defined outside their relations to each other. Variable cutoff selections heavily affect diagnostic conclusions and require better rationalization. The maximization of diagnostic reliability and specificity is currently more critical than the identification of earlier stages of SCCD. The limitations of all biomarkers suggest that a combination of approaches may enhance diagnostic accuracy.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^111kySvh]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Pernicious anaemia is a form of anaemia undeniably associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. The search for a cure for pernicious anaemia led to the discovery of vitamin B12. Nowadays, vitamin B12 deficiency is not only associated with (pernicious) anaemia, but it is also linked to other conditions such as dementia, neuropathy, and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Therefore, individuals with low serum concentrations of vitamin B12 are frequently given vitamin B12 supplements. Since low serum vitamin B12 concentrations are very common in older individuals, screening older people for vitamin B12 deficiency has often been recommended.

Although the biological role of vitamin B12 in haematopoiesis is well-defined, the outcomes of some studies cast doubt on the relationship between low vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older individuals. The association between low vitamin B12 and anaemia has become even more difficult to study because various cut-off values for serum vitamin B12 are used, and serum concentrations of vitamin B12 appear not to be an accurate reflection of vitamin B12 status at the tissue level.

Therefore, to evaluate the association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older subjects, we performed a systematic review of relevant observational (cross-sectional and longitudinal) studies and randomized placebo-controlled trials that had been published in the medical literature at the time of writing.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency — an update [^111b7Xx4]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

This article presents an update on diagnosing and treating vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in individuals at risk, such as the elderly and patients with intestinal diseases. The measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis, followed by the measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unresolved cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and the measurement of holoTC is currently being introduced in the clinical setting. There is no consensus regarding the evaluation of the cause of vitamin B12 deficiency; pros and cons of the different tests primarily aimed at evaluating the function of the gastric mucosa are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed, efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 months or by a daily dose of 1 mg vitamin B12.

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^115PHGg7]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Despite no overall effect of B-vitamin intervention on BMD in the present study, our subgroup analysis found beneficial effects on BMD in those with lower baseline vitamin B12 status. In participants with serum B12 below the median value of 246 pmol/L or with MMA above the median value of 0.22 μmol/L at baseline, B-vitamin intervention decreased the 2-year BMD decline at the total hip and at the femoral neck. No similar effect of intervention on BMD was shown among participants with lower baseline status of folate, vitamin B6, or riboflavin or in those with higher tHcy concentrations, suggesting an independent role for vitamin B12 in bone health.

In broad agreement with a B12-specific effect on bone health, lower serum B12 concentrations (< 207 pmol/L; lowest quintile) were associated with accelerated bone loss at the hip in women ≥ 65 years in a large prospective study in the United States. Likewise, B12 concentrations defined as deficiency (< 148 pmol/L) were associated with lower BMD at the hip in males in the Framingham Osteoporosis Study (n = 2576). Furthermore, in nationally representative samples from the United States, increasing concentrations of MMA (a functional biomarker of B12) were associated with lower BMD and higher osteoporosis risk at the hip in older adults and at the lumbar spine in women ≥ 50 years.

Given that MMA is considered a specific and sensitive indicator of tissue vitamin B12 status, previous findings support a specific effect of vitamin B12 on bone health. In contrast, low plasma folate (but not B12) was associated with increased fracture risk.

Clinical differential diagnosis can be challenging because all clinical presentations of genetic disorders of remethylation can be mimicked by common conditions that reduce the availability of folate or cobalamin, such as nutritional deficiency, acquired malabsorption, or drug-associated effects. Maternal vitamin B12 deficiency, due to a strict vegan diet or undiagnosed pernicious anemia, should be excluded in neonates and young infants presenting with signs of a remethylation disorder or identified by newborn screening (NBS) with subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations.

- **Conditions that mimic intracellular disorders of remethylation**: A number of other rare genetic diseases can mimic defects in intracellular cobalamin metabolism and should be considered in children with clinical signs and biochemical hallmarks of a remethylation disorder but with normal serum concentrations of vitamin B12 and folates. For example, transcobalamin (TC) deficiency is biochemically and clinically indistinguishable from combined cobalamin disorders.

The recently discovered MTHFD1 deficiency affects folate metabolism and can cause mild hyperhomocysteinaemia. The five patients described so far displayed severe megaloblastic anemia and pancytopenia, immunological problems, and renal microangiopathy.

The HCFC1 X-linked defect (cblX) is sometimes associated with disturbed function of the CblC protein, but its diagnosis can be challenging because not all affected boys have elevated homocysteine concentrations. Clinical hallmarks are also noted, though the text appears to be incomplete.

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^117YPczq]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

- **B-vitamin biomarker status at baseline**: At baseline, mean values for B-vitamin biomarkers generally compared favorably with normal ranges, with the exception of MMA, whose mean value indicated deficient B12 status (pre-intervention values). Although mean values for B-vitamin biomarkers (apart from MMA) were within normal ranges, 17% of participants had low or deficient vitamin B12 status (as determined by cB12 ≤ −0.5), and 16% were deficient in serum folate; data not shown. There were no significant associations at baseline between individual B-vitamin biomarkers (or serum tHcy) and BMD at any site, in the total cohort or in males or females separately; data not shown.

- **Verification of target doses and compliance with the study protocol**: On analysis of the treatment capsules at baseline, the vitamin doses were found to vary marginally from the target doses: folic acid 200 μg (184 μg); vitamin B12 10 μg (9.6 μg); vitamin B6 10 mg (10.2 mg); riboflavin 5 mg (4.3 mg); and vitamin D 10 μg (11.2 μg). Analysis of the "active" placebo capsule showed values similar to the targeted vitamin dose: vitamin D 10 μg (10.8 μg) and negligible amounts of B-vitamins. Overall, participant compliance with the intervention protocol was generally excellent, estimated by pill counting to be 88%.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^116DKJ4k]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for vitamin B12 deficiency, and more specifically with respect to vitamin B12 supplementation without neurological involvement, BSH 2014 guidelines recommend considering an empiric trial of oral cyanocobalamin (50 mcg/day for 4 weeks) for the treatment of patients with serum levels of subclinical deficiency on two occasions. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of neuropathy develop. Reassess cobalamin levels after 3 months, and obtain second-line tests if there is no improvement.

### Nascobal [^116PAaeS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Prior to treatment, obtain hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate, and iron levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Consider the potential for concomitant drugs to interfere with vitamin B12 and folate diagnostic blood assays [see Drug Interactions (7)].

In patients with suspected cobalamin hypersensitivity, consider administering an intradermal test dose of parenteral vitamin B12 prior to use of Nascobal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Recommended dosage**: The recommended initial dose of Nascobal is one spray (500 mcg) administered in one nostril once weekly. Administer Nascobal at least one hour before or one hour after ingestion of hot foods or liquids since hot foods may cause nasal secretions and a resulting loss of medication. Defer use of Nascobal in patients with nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, or upper respiratory infections until after symptoms have subsided.

- **Monitoring, dosage modifications, and treatment duration**:

	- **Monitoring for response and safety**: Monitor serum B12 levels periodically during therapy to establish the adequacy of therapy. Obtain a serum B12 level and peripheral blood count one month after treatment initiation, then subsequently at intervals of 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

	- **Dosage modifications**: If serum levels of B12 decline after one month of treatment with Nascobal, consider increasing the dose. Assess serum B12 level one month after each dose adjustment. If serum B12 levels are persistently low, consider alternative therapy.

### Macro-bmasking bdeficiency [^113pwXwc]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin, abbreviated B12) deficiency is common. Symptoms develop insidiously, sometimes over the course of several years, and overlap with many other common disorders. The measurement of serum B12 concentration as a diagnostic test for cellular B12 deficiency is unreliable, as many people with clinical signs of B12 deficiency have serum concentrations above the lower population reference limit (140 pmol/L, depending on the assay). In such situations, the measurement of the biomarkers methylmalonic acid and homocysteine has been used, but their sensitivity and specificity for demonstrating B12 deficiency is also limited, which may cause individuals with relevant and readily reversible deficiency to be missed.

Elevated serum B12 concentrations most commonly reflect recent supplementation with high-dose oral vitamin-B12-containing preparations or injections. Serum B12 may also be elevated as a consequence of an underlying disorder such as liver diseases or a hematologic malignancy. It has also been demonstrated that immune complexes between serum immunoglobulins and B12-vitamin binding protein (macro-B12) may develop in some individuals, leading to highly elevated serum B12 concentrations.

We describe a young woman aged 18 who developed macro-B12, leading to difficulties and delay in making a correct diagnosis of B12 deficiency.

### Improving bariatric patient aftercare outcome by improved detection of a functional vitamin B12 deficiency [^114nGRdp]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is common after bariatric surgery. Vitamin B12 is a poor predictor of functional vitamin B12 status, as deficiencies might occur even within the reference limits. Therefore, vitamin B12 deficiencies with serum vitamin B12 levels between 140 and 200 pmol/L often remain undetected. Methylmalonic acid (MMA), however, can detect these deficiencies as it accumulates due to functional intracellular vitamin B12 deficiencies. MMA is a relatively expensive analysis and is therefore not generally available. To lower costs, MMA is only requested when vitamin B12 levels are within these ranges. As a result, more biochemical deficiencies are found. However, it was not initially known whether bariatric patients with vitamin B12 levels between 140 and 200 pmol/L would benefit from supplementation.

- **Method**: Bariatric patients with vitamin B12 levels between 140 and 200 pmol/L with (n = 45) and without (n = 45) intramuscular hydroxocobalamin injections were compared.

- **Results**: Treated patients showed a significant increase in vitamin B12 levels (P < 0.001) and a significant decrease in MMA levels (P < 0.001). Biochemical improvement was observed in both patients with and without clinical symptoms. The control group showed a significant increase in MMA levels (P < 0.001). To examine whether the biochemical benefits of vitamin B12 supplementation correlated with clinical improvement, patient records were checked for complaints. Complaints disappeared after treatment, while no improvement was seen in untreated patients.

This study shows that all bariatric patients with functional vitamin B12 deficiencies, even those without clinical symptoms, benefit from supplementation.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113AAYBz]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

Patients may present with deficiencies in B12, folate, and other nutrients such as copper, which can cause anemia, macrocytosis, dysplastic features on peripheral smear, and neurologic symptoms. In countries with folate supplementation, deficiencies are rare but should be suspected in those with severe malnourishment, including severe alcohol overuse. Adults aged over 60 years are at the highest risk for developing pernicious anemia, which involves autoantibodies against intrinsic factor and parietal cells. A B12 level of less than 300 pg/mL suggests B12 deficiency but does not necessarily indicate B12-deficient anemia. Elevated levels of serum methylmalonic acid suggest B12 deficiency and warrant a diagnostic trial of B12.

Methylmalonic acid assays are not readily available in all laboratories, and correcting borderline B12 deficiency does not always lead to hemoglobin improvement. For cases of borderline B12 deficiency (levels 200–300 pg/mL), we recommend a therapeutic trial of B12, considering the low cost and potential benefit of supplementation. Symptoms of B12 deficiency can be reversed with appropriate supplementation. Severe pernicious anemia should be corrected slowly to reduce the risk of sudden death related to shifts in potassium from extracellular fluid into maturing RBCs. Older adults with mild B12 deficiency and normal absorption usually respond to an oral B12 dose of 1000 μg daily. Patients with impaired absorption often require parenteral B12 indefinitely.

The following main questions and outcomes of interest in males and females with any type of onset (early or late) of one of the diseases of interest were addressed (outcomes in parentheses):

- **Which clinical signs are characteristic and allow timely diagnosis**: Outcome is timely clinical diagnosis, considered important.
- **Which biochemical parameters allow timely and valid diagnosis**: Outcome is valid, timely laboratory diagnosis, considered important.
- **How can we prevent death and avoid/treat severe organ damage**: Outcome is survival and severe organ complications, considered critical.
- **How can we prevent or treat eye disease and neurocognitive impairment**: Outcome is visual and neurocognitive function, considered critical.

In the first step, all reports made available to the panelists were graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria by the authors who had assigned themselves according to their expertise to five major working groups focusing on the topics of "clinical signs and symptoms", "differential diagnosis", "laboratory/biochemical parameters", "disease course and outcome", and "treatment". Due to the rarity of the diseases, studies and reports of all types of designs (from case reports and case series to meta-analyses) were included; randomized controlled trials were not available.

The working groups prepared drafts on their topics, which were carefully evaluated in moderated discussion groups. Elaboration and grading of recommendations were accomplished by moderated, consensus-oriented discussion.

### Laboratory assessment of vitamin B12 status [^115i7Tip]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

The detection and correction of vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency prevents megaloblastic anemia and potentially irreversible neuropathy and neuropsychiatric changes. B12 status is commonly estimated using the abundance of the vitamin in serum, with ∼148 pmol/L (200 ng/L) typically set as the threshold for diagnosing deficiency. Serum B12 assays measure the sum of haptocorrin-bound and transcobalamin-bound (known as holotranscobalamin) B12. It is only holotranscobalamin that is taken up by cells to meet metabolic demand. Although receiver operating characteristic curves show holotranscobalamin measurement to be a moderately more reliable marker of B12 status than serum B12, both assays have an indeterminate range. Biochemical evidence of metabolic abnormalities consistent with B12 insufficiency is frequently detected despite an apparently sufficient abundance of the vitamin.

Laboratory B12 status markers that reflect cellular utilization rather than abundance are available. Two forms of B12 act as coenzymes for two different reactions. Methionine synthase requires methylcobalamin for the remethylation of methionine from homocysteine. A homocysteine concentration > 20 µmol/L may suggest B12 deficiency in folate-replete patients. In the second B12-dependent reaction, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase uses adenosylcobalamin to convert methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. In B12 deficiency, excess methylmalonyl-CoA is hydrolyzed to methylmalonic acid. A serum concentration > 280 nmol/L may suggest suboptimal status in young patients with normal renal function.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^112TSbGP]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of test results for cobalamin status because there is no 'gold standard' test to define deficiency. Serum cobalamin currently remains the first-line test, with additional second-line plasma methylmalonic acid to help clarify uncertainties of underlying biochemical/functional deficiencies. Serum holotranscobalamin has potential as a first-line test, but an indeterminate 'grey area' may still exist. Plasma homocysteine may be helpful as a second-line test but is less specific than methylmalonic acid. The availability of these second-line tests is currently limited. Definitive cut-off points to define clinical and subclinical deficiency states are not possible, given the variety of methodologies used and technical issues; therefore, local reference ranges should be established. In the presence of discordance between the test result and strong clinical features of deficiency, treatment should not be delayed to avoid neurological impairment. Treatment of cobalamin deficiency is recommended in line with the British National Formulary. Oral therapy may be suitable and acceptable provided appropriate doses are taken and compliance is not an issue. Serum folate offers equivalent diagnostic capability to red cell folate and is the first-line test of choice to assess folate status.

### Nascobal [^1117PB5K]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Nascobal is indicated for:

- **Vitamin B12 maintenance therapy**: This is applicable for adult patients with pernicious anemia who are in remission following intramuscular vitamin B12 therapy and who have no nervous system involvement.

- **Treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency**: It is intended for adult patients with dietary, drug-induced, or malabsorption-related vitamin B12 deficiency not due to pernicious anemia.

- **Prevention of vitamin B12 deficiency**: Applies to adult patients with vitamin B12 requirements in excess of normal.

- **Limitations of use**:

Nascobal should not be used for the vitamin B12 absorption test, known as the Schilling test. In patients with correctible or temporary causes of vitamin B12 deficiency, the benefit of continued long-term use of Nascobal following adequate correction of vitamin B12 deficiency and underlying disease has not been established. The effectiveness of Nascobal in patients with active symptoms of nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, or upper respiratory infection has not been determined; treatment with Nascobal should be deferred until symptoms have subsided.

### Reframing micronutrient deficiencies for modern times: A review [^116PyM1i]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The risk for micronutrient deficiency persists even in the developed world, yet it is often not considered. Small studies and multiple case reports have described its clinical presentation, which may have been initially overlooked in favor of more modern clinical diagnoses. There is a need for increased awareness of micronutrient deficiencies, especially in special populations. Despite the longstanding description of these conditions, there is also a need for updated testing and treatment guidelines, as protocols are varied and largely based on consensus. The increased interest in the study of nutrition and food insecurity should include the risk for micronutrient deficiency in overall evaluations.

### Vitamin B [^114QQraS]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

- **Tips for safer prescribing**: Continued or new B12 therapy for women with deficiency during pregnancy and lactation is mandatory and safe. B12 deficiency increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including early pregnancy loss, neural tube defects, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight, as well as insulin resistance and adiposity. It may also lead to neurological complications in newborns, such as hypotonia, failure to thrive, central apnoeas, and seizures.

- **Children**: Evidence-based treatment advice for children is lacking; each case is judged individually. Solid evidence on the safety of parenteral, lifelong, high-dose hydroxocobalamin is available from decades of treating patients with inborn errors of B12 metabolism (e.g. cobalamin C deficiency).

- **Symptom monitoring**: Monitor symptoms regularly (e.g. every two to three months) as they may reappear, even after several months, if injection frequency is reduced. Measuring serum biomarkers such as B12 or MMA is neither helpful nor indicated in assessing or monitoring clinical improvement. Base the injection frequency on symptoms, not on biomarker assessment.

- **Shared decision making**: Use shared decision making to establish a long-term frequency of B12 injections for each patient and teach them how to self-inject.
