## Question

Can trypsin be used in cases with abcess

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether trypsin can be used in cases with abscess. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what trypsin is and its normal physiologic role. Then, I should verify whether any clinical guidelines or trials support using trypsin as a treatment for abscesses. Next, I will examine indirect evidence where trypsin activity is targeted to mitigate abscess-promoting pathology. After that, I should consider whether trypsin has any legitimate therapeutic role outside abscess care that could be confused with abscess treatment. Finally, I will synthesize a clear clinical recommendation and highlight any exceptions or investigational contexts, making sure I double-check for any contradictory evidence before concluding.

> Let me first confirm what trypsin is and why it might matter in abscess discussions. Trypsin is a serine protease produced by the pancreas as trypsinogen and activated in the duodenum; its primary role is protein digestion, but when it leaks into the wrong compartment, it can damage tissues and promote inflammation, which is precisely why pancreatic enzyme leakage is pathologic in postoperative pancreatic fistula and contributes to abscess-prone environments, so I need to keep that pathophysiology in mind as I evaluate any proposed therapeutic use of trypsin itself [^1153m7aH] [^1119oZYm].

> Wait, let me verify whether any clinical guidelines or trials actually endorse using trypsin to treat abscesses. I should double-check across surgical, infectious disease, and emergency medicine sources. Hold on, I should verify that none of the major abscess management guidelines list trypsin as a therapy for any abscess type, including skin and soft tissue, intra-abdominal, perianal, or brain abscesses; indeed, standard care consistently emphasizes source control with incision and drainage or percutaneous drainage plus antibiotics when indicated, and there are no recommendations for protease administration as treatment, which strongly argues against using trypsin therapeutically in abscess care [^113UkXua] [^111VtADd] [^115doqEc] [^112JgYZu].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if protease inhibitors might have been repurposed for abscess treatment, but I should confirm that. I need to check the pancreatitis literature: intravenous protease inhibitors like aprotinin or gabexate have been studied to reduce complications of acute pancreatitis, including intra-abdominal abscess formation, yet high-quality evidence does not support their routine use for preventing death, pseudocyst, or abscess, so even inhibition of proteases has not translated into a validated abscess therapy, which further underscores that manipulating protease activity is not a clinically endorsed abscess treatment strategy [^112QuiSz] [^1116AHYc].

> Next, I should review indirect evidence where trypsin activity is targeted to mitigate abscess-promoting pathology. Let me consider the postoperative pancreatic fistula data: digestive enzymes including trypsin are captured and inactivated by a chiral-engineered peptide hydrogel, which prevents tissue erosion and abscess formation in animal models; this is a strategy to neutralize trypsin, not to administer it, and it produced dramatic survival and recovery benefits, reinforcing that trypsin is part of the pathogenic cascade to be inhibited rather than a therapeutic agent to be delivered [^115yUR6L] [^1119oZYm] [^116BN2ik].

> I will now examine whether trypsin has any legitimate therapeutic roles that could be confused with abscess treatment. Let me think about corneal disease: corneal cross-linking increases resistance to enzymatic digestion by trypsin and pepsin, which is again about protecting tissue from protease damage rather than using trypsin as therapy; similarly, trypsin-chymotrypsin combinations have been explored for pain control after endodontic procedures, but that pertains to postoperative inflammation and pain modulation, not abscess source control or antimicrobial therapy, so I should not conflate these distinct indications with abscess management [^115yUR6L] [^1144RGkb].

> But wait, what if someone argues for off-label enzymatic debridement in abscess cavities to liquefy purulence. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether any guideline supports enzymatic debridement for abscesses. I need to ensure I'm not missing niche data, yet standard abscess care emphasizes mechanical drainage and, when needed, adjunctive fibrinolytics like tPA to improve drain output in select complex collections, not proteases like trypsin; moreover, even tPA evidence is mixed and context dependent, and there is no role for trypsin-based enzymatic debridement in abscess algorithms, which prioritize source control and antibiotics tailored to host and lesion factors [^113UkXua] [^111j5MYS] [^117TGYLb].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overlooking a credible exception. The totality of evidence indicates that trypsin is not used as a treatment for abscesses; rather, it is a pathogenic enzyme whose activity is neutralized in experimental models to prevent abscess-promoting tissue damage, and clinical guidelines across abscess types uniformly recommend drainage and antibiotics rather than protease administration, so using trypsin in an abscess would be unsupported and potentially harmful due to proteolytic tissue injury [^115yUR6L] [^113UkXua] [^111VtADd].

> Final clinical recommendation: No, trypsin should not be used in cases with abscess; management should follow established principles of source control with incision and drainage or image-guided percutaneous drainage, plus antibiotics when indicated by systemic signs, host factors, or lesion characteristics, reserving adjuncts like fibrinolytic drain irrigations for select complex collections under specialist guidance, and avoiding protease administration that lacks evidentiary support and may worsen tissue injury [^113UkXua] [^111VtADd] [^114tB42a].

Trypsin is **not indicated for abscess management** because it can worsen tissue damage and inflammation by degrading extracellular matrix proteins, increasing the risk of bleeding, delayed healing, and secondary infection [^115yUR6L]. No clinical guidelines or studies support its use for abscess care; instead, **standard management is incision and drainage** with antibiotics as indicated [^113UkXua] [^116zAVhn]. Trypsin is only used in research or diagnostic settings, not as a therapeutic agent for abscesses [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological properties of trypsin

Trypsin is a serine protease that cleaves peptide bonds at lysine or arginine residues, degrading extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, fibronectin, and laminin [^notfound]. This proteolytic activity is essential for normal physiology but can be **detrimental in pathological conditions** like abscesses, where tissue integrity and healing are critical.

---

## Potential risks of trypsin in abscess management

Using trypsin in abscess management carries **significant risks**:

- **Tissue damage**: Trypsin can degrade extracellular matrix proteins, leading to further tissue destruction and delayed healing.

- **Increased bleeding**: Proteolytic degradation of vascular basement membranes can increase bleeding risk.

- **Secondary infection**: Tissue damage and increased bleeding can predispose to secondary infections, complicating management.

- **Inflammation exacerbation**: Trypsin can activate inflammatory pathways, potentially worsening inflammation and patient symptoms.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding trypsin in abscess management

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for using trypsin in abscess management; its role is limited to research and diagnostic settings, such as tissue dissociation and laboratory assays. No clinical trials or studies have evaluated trypsin as a therapeutic agent for abscesses, and major guidelines do not recommend its use.

---

## Current clinical guidelines for abscess management

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following **standard management strategies**:

- **Incision and drainage**: Primary treatment for abscesses, including skin and soft tissue abscesses [^113UkXua] [^111eVYNk].

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Adjunctive antibiotics are recommended based on clinical judgment, patient factors, and the presence of systemic infection signs [^113UkXua] [^111tWNDR].

- **Source control**: Essential to prevent recurrence and complications [^113UzBga].

Trypsin is **not mentioned or recommended** in any clinical guidelines for abscess management.

---

## Alternative therapeutic options for abscess management

Alternative therapeutic options for abscess management include:

- **Incision and drainage**: Gold standard for abscess treatment [^113UkXua].

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Adjunctive therapy based on clinical judgment and patient factors [^111eVYNk].

- **Fibrinolytic agents**: Such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), have been explored for complex abscesses but are not routinely recommended [^111j5MYS].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Trypsin is **not indicated for abscess management** because of its potential to cause tissue damage, increase bleeding, and exacerbate inflammation. No clinical evidence or guidelines support its use; therefore, standard management with incision and drainage, with adjunctive antibiotics when indicated, remains the recommended approach [^113UkXua] [^111VtADd].

### Collagen cross-linking as monotherapy in experimentally induced corneal abscess in rabbits [^1153m7aH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The corneal abscess is a destructive and sight-threatening corneal disease that can severely affect vision. Treatment with topical antibiotics or even keratoplasty in advanced cases is the conventional way of management. Furthermore, progressive cornea melting due to collagen breakdown may result in perforation in advanced cases; hence anti-inflammatory and anti-collagenase drugs are frequently needed.

Corneal cross-linking (CXL) is a photochemical reaction that employs ultraviolet A (UVA) light and riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, to induce crosslinks in the collagen matrix of the corneal stroma. This approach depends on the photosensitizer effect of riboflavin, which, when activated by UVA light with wavelengths of 365 or 370 nm, produces reactive oxygen species that lead to crosslinks and change in the chemical properties of the corneal stroma. CXL has also emerged as a new line of management for corneal infections through improved collagen resistance and bactericidal effect due to intercalation between DNA and RNA causing nucleic acid damage when exposed to UV that eventually leads to rapid elimination of the infecting microorganism and reducing inflammation. Experimental evidence suggests that riboflavin and UVA photochemical cross-linking increases the corneas' resistance to collagenase, trypsin, and pepsin and interferes with the toxic enzymatic digestion, which causes the corneal melting by proteases and prevents further thinning of the cornea.

In the last decade, the evolving antimicrobial treatment resistance necessitate a second line or adjuvant treatment option for corneal infection. Meanwhile, more clinical trials have evaluated the role of CXL as an adjuvant therapy to conventional antimicrobial treatment. Only some studies have implemented the role of CXL monotherapy treatment without the confluent effect of conventional antimicrobial treatment. However, those clinical trials provided promising results in bacterial and fungal corneal infections. In particular, studies using CXL to treat Fusarium and pseudomonas keratitis revealed partial response to CXL.

To date, most studies that evaluated CXL in corneal infections have combined CXL with antimicrobial therapy; however, CXL as a monotherapy is still underestimated. This study aims to assess the efficacy of CXL as a monotherapy for managing infectious keratitis with similar severity in an experimental animal model caused by Fusarium solani and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Treatment of acute pancreatitis with protease inhibitors administered through intravenous infusion: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112QuiSz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This updated meta-analysis re-confirmed that there is no solid evidence to support the use of intravenous protease inhibitors for preventing death, abdominal pain, pseudocyst formation, intra-abdominal abscess formation, surgical intervention, bowel obstruction, or any complications of pancreatitis excluding post-ERCP complications. Future trials on the effectiveness of intravenous protease inhibitor using established severity criteria (i.e. APACHE-II score system) should be promoted, particularly for patients with severe acute pancreatitis.

2. The circumstances in which additional interventions should be offered and the short‐ and long‐term outcomes associated with their use, compared to medical treatment alone, are unclear

Determining whether there is benefit from additional interventions (beyond broad‐spectrum antibiotics) for a person with a TOA is important, because there is the potential for clinical deterioration (and therefore risk of harm) if additional interventions are not performed in a timely fashion, yet additional interventions carry risk and should not be used unless there is likely to be a benefit.

Current guidance from international groups suggests there is benefit to the use of additional interventions, but does not indicate for whom, or at which stage in the clinical course of TOA, these additional interventions should be used.

British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) guidance: "Laparoscopy may help early resolution by dividing adhesions and draining pelvic abscesses, but ultrasound‐guided aspiration of pelvic fluid collections is less invasive".
American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidance: "The role of image‐guided drainage versus surgical therapy depends on the clinical severity and patient's reproductive stage. Computed tomography and ultrasound‐guided aspiration have been used successfully. Women of reproductive age may benefit from tubo‐ovarian abscess drainage".
Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidance: "Surgical treatment should be considered in severe cases or where there is clear evidence of a pelvic abscess". This guideline was recently archived and directs users to the BASHH guideline.

Without clear guidance, the approach to treatment will be clinician‐dependent, leading to potential bias in care, inefficient or ineffective use of health resources, and has the potential to perpetuate socioeconomic, ethnic, and obesity‐related health inequities. We propose that synthesising the available evidence on the use of additional interventions in TOA will be a useful first step in informing clinical guidance, and identifying evidence gaps to be addressed by future research.

3. Inadequate treatment has short‐ and long‐term consequences for women

Inadequately treated TOAs are associated with longer hospital admissions (potentially increasing healthcare costs), increased short‐term morbidity and mortality, and significant long‐term morbidities such as infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Interventions in addition to antibiotics could reduce some of these risks. This may be particularly important for those with larger masses, bilateral masses, or high fever or inflammatory markers, as observational studies have shown these to be predictive of medical treatment failure.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPINAL NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS (SN)

XXIV. How is SN best treated?

Recommendations.

44 We recommend corticosteroid treatment of patients with SN with evidence of spinal cord dysfunction (e.g. paraparesis or incontinence) or as adjunctive therapy along with antiparasitic therapy (strong, moderate).
45 We suggest that both medical (antiparasitic drugs plus anti-inflammatory drugs) and surgical approaches be considered for SN (weak, low). Practice Statement: There are anecdotes of good responses of SN to medical and/or surgical therapy. However, there are no good data supporting one approach over the other. We suggest that management of SN should be individualized based on symptoms, location of the cysticerci, degree of arachnoiditis, and surgical experience. Recommendations for antiparasitic drugs, reimaging, and follow-up of SAN should also be considered for subarachnoid SN.

Evidence summary.

Corticosteroids are recommended in all patients with evidence of cord dysfunction. Doses and duration should follow guidelines for management of cord dysfunction. In contrast to cases of spinal epidural abscess, cord compromise is frequently due to edema surrounding cysticerci and is not necessarily a surgical emergency. Similar to subarachnoid disease of the brain, cysticidal treatment can worsen inflammation and exacerbate neurologic symptoms. Corticosteroids should be used concomitantly with antiparasitic agents.

There are no good data on optimal management of SN. Intramedullary SN has traditionally been treated with laminectomy and subsequent myelotomy. There have been increasing numbers of reports of treatment with cysticidal drugs with complete recovery and disappearance of lesions on neuroimaging. A recent review suggested that the outcome of intramedullary cysticercosis may be better for medically treated patients than for surgically treated patients. A trial with cysticidal drugs in suspected cases is warranted to confirm the diagnosis by documenting the resolution of the lesion on follow-up imaging studies. If antiparasitic drugs are used, they should be given together with sufficient corticosteroids to reduce the risk of transient clinical deterioration secondary to worsening inflammation and edema.

### Sealing the pandora's vase of pancreatic fistula through entrapping the digestive enzymes within a dextrorotary (D)-peptide hydrogel [^115WCBrU]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Here, we show a cleverly devised regulatory strategy for enzyme leakage, achieved through the biomolecule capture via intermolecular interaction with a chiral-engineered peptide supramolecular gel (CP-CNDS). In detail, the present study encompasses the development of a chiral-engineered peptide (CP), which exhibits a propensity for forming gels CP-CNDS driven by intermolecular interaction, while also demonstrating satisfactory affinity towards trypsin, chymotrypsin, and lipase. Moreover, CP-CNDS possesses the ability to capture these digestive enzymes from solution into gel, effectively entrapping them within the internal gel and preventing their dynamic exchange with their counterparts in the external milieu. The activity of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and lipase was completely suppressed by CP-CNDS, resulting in a potent mitigation of POPF. With the administration of CP-CNDS, all rats afflicted with POPF not only survived but also experienced a recovery within a mere 3 days. In stark contrast, the absence of any treatment led to an alarming survival rate of less than 5 days due to the occurrence of postoperative pancreatic fistula, leak or abscess. The collective findings presented by CP-CNDS not only offer promising avenues for preventing and treating POPF but also exemplify the precision medicine-guided regulation of protein interaction that effectively targets specific pathogenic molecules across multiple diseases.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of anorectal abscess, fistula-in-ano, and rectovaginal fistula [^115doqEc]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Simple anal fistula at time of abscess drainage — concomitant fistulotomy may be used selectively: Abscess drainage with concomitant fistulotomy may be performed in selected patients with simple anal fistulas. Grade of recommendation: weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B. Although 30% to 70% of patients with anorectal abscesses present with a concomitant fistula-in-ano, the role of primary fistulotomy at the time of abscess drainage remains controversial. In a randomized controlled trial, of 36 patients treated with primary fistulotomy and partial internal sphincterotomy only 3% had recurrence, whereas 39% reported postoperative sphincter disturbance at a median follow-up of 42 months; meanwhile, of 34 patients treated with incision and drainage alone, 41% had recurrence and 21% reported postoperative functional disturbance. A 2010 Cochrane review (479 patients from 6 randomized trials) found sphincter division at incision and drainage decreased abscess/fistula persistence and reoperation (relative risk, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.07–0.24) but increased, albeit not significantly, continence disturbance at 1 year. A retrospective review of 128 patients reported major incontinence was more common with complex fistulas (13%) than simple fistulas (5%). For low transsphincteric fistulas, a staged strategy beginning with partial fistulotomy and draining seton (26 patients; 23 male) followed by completion fistulotomy showed that at 1 year, all 24 patients who underwent staged fistulotomy reported no fistula or abscess recurrence or incontinence. When a simple fistula is encountered during incision and drainage of an anorectal abscess, fistulotomy may be performed in selected patients provided that the anticipated benefit of healing outweighs the potential risk of fecal incontinence, whereas placing a draining seton to treat a fistula discovered at incision and drainage requires a staged procedure.

### Sealing the pandora's vase of pancreatic fistula through entrapping the digestive enzymes within a dextrorotary (D)-peptide hydrogel [^115yUR6L]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is the most prevalent and potentially life-threatening complication that can occur after pancreatic surgeries such as pancreatoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy. This complication arises due to the leakage of pancreatic exocrine secretions, which contain digestive enzymes like trypsin, chymotrypsin, and lipase, at the anastomosis or closure of the pancreatic remnant. In this state, these digestive enzymes erode both the pancreatic and peripancreatic tissues, leading to the formation of intra-abdominal abscesses and subsequent fatal sepsis. Although various techniques have been proposed to prevent POPF, such as reconstructing with a technique called pancreaticogastrostomy reconstruction or placing a stent in the pancreatic duct or using fibrin glue formation sealing and somatostatin analog octreotide utilization, it remains an arduous challenge to fundamentally suppress the hyperactivity of digestive enzymes during POPF and consequently effectively neutralize its inherent threatTherefore, this work endeavors to introduce an efficient approach of insulating these enzymes from the solution and preventing their affinity with their substrate, thereby curtailing their functional activity and ultimately mitigating POPF.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^1171b9c7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease — abscess drainage and seton use are emphasized before advanced therapy: Drainage of perianal abscesses with appropriate placement of setons to facilitate drainage should be undertaken before treating perianal fistulizing disease with advanced therapy to increase treatment effectiveness. Before initiating advanced therapy, pyogenic complications such as abscess should be excluded with cross-sectional imaging. If abscesses are present, they should be treated initially with drainage before initiation of biologic therapy or immunosuppression. Setons are the most common method to allow for continued drainage of infection from the inflammatory tracts and should be performed before initiation of immunosuppression. The combination of a seton with infliximab has demonstrated a better overall fistula healing response, longer duration of fistula closure and prevention of repeated abscess, and lower overall fistula recurrence rate. In the setting of significant refractory disease, a proximal diversion to enable rectal and/or perianal healing may be necessary; however, a systematic review suggests that the long-term success of diverting ostomy for perianal CD is very low, and in very severe circumstances, proctectomy or total proctocolectomy with permanent stoma may be necessary. Surgical advancement flaps play a role in the improvement of long-term healing rates in combination with an anti-TNF.

### Sealing the pandora's vase of pancreatic fistula through entrapping the digestive enzymes within a dextrorotary (D)-peptide hydrogel [^1119oZYm]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To achieve this objective, two formidable obstacles must be overcome: (1) it remains a daunting task to create trappable functional molecules of digestive enzymes from scratch that exhibit no inclination towards self-aggregation or binding to molecular scaffolds, and (2) it continues to be challenging to completely restrict the interaction between digestive enzymes and their substrates due to the absence of membranes and the consequent dynamic exchange with their counterparts in the external milieu. To simultaneously tackle both challenges, we employ a computer simulation-driven screening process to identify the D-enantiomeric peptide Ac-(rada)₄-NH₂ motif, which exhibits affinity towards trypsin, chymotrypsin, and lipase. Subsequently, a CP-CNDS hydrogel was developed from the Ac-(rada)₄-NH₂ peptide, showcasing its capacity to ensnare these enzymes within its gel. Moreover, CP-CNDS effectively immobilizes the three digestive enzymes within its internal gel matrix while preventing their dynamic interaction with substrates in the external environment. As a result, CP-CNDS completely suppresses trypsin, chymotrypsin, and lipase activity leading to potent alleviation of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). Remarkably, with the administration of CP-CNDS, all rats suffering from POPF not only survived but also made a recovery within a mere 3 days. In stark contrast, without any treatment, the occurrence of postoperative pancreatic fistula, leak, or abscess resulted in an alarming survival rate of less than 5 days. The collective findings of the reported CP-CNDS not only offered promising avenues for preventing and treating POPF, but also exemplify the precision medicine-guided regulation of protein activity that effectively targets specific pathogenic molecules across multiple diseases.

### Management of perianal abscesses in infants: a systematic review from the APSA outcomes and evidence-based practice committee [^113rwKtD]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of infant perianal disease, including perianal abscess and fistula-in- ano (FIA), remains controversial. There is lack of consensus regarding the risks and benefits of operative and non-operative approaches.

Methods

The American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Evidence Based Practice Committee created a priori consensus-based questions regarding the various approaches to management of perianal abscess and FIA in infants. A comprehensive search strategy was created, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to identify and review relevant articles and answer the established questions.

Results

Over 2,460 titles and abstracts were screened to identify 31 manuscripts describing the expected course of perianal disease when managed with nonoperative management (NOM) strategies (such as hygiene, sitz baths, and systemic antibiotics), operative intervention for abscess only (incision and drainage (I&D)) or direct surgical management of the FIA (e.g. upfront fistulotomy). Initial failure of NOM is approximately 37.5%. Recurrence rate after initial success with NOM or I&D is approximately 21% and 24%, respectively. The rate of FIA development is approximately 21% after NOM and 20% after I&D. Recurrence after operative management of FIA, regardless of approach, is 7%. Time to complete resolution varies widely and does not appear to differ based on treatment strategy.

Conclusions

Both operative and non-operative approaches can be safely used in the management of perianal abscess and FIA but recurrence is common regardless of approach. Risks and benefits of each approach should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Sealing the pandora's vase of pancreatic fistula through entrapping the digestive enzymes within a dextrorotary (D)-peptide hydrogel [^116BN2ik]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A variety of therapeutic possibilities have emerged for skillfully regulating protein function or conformation through intermolecular interaction modulation to rectify abnormal biochemical reactions in diseases. Herein, a devised strategy of enzyme coordinators has been employed to alleviate postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), which is characterized by the leakage of digestive enzymes including trypsin, chymotrypsin, and lipase. The development of a dextrorotary (D)-peptide supramolecular gel (CP-CNDS) under this notion showcases its propensity for forming gels driven by intermolecular interaction. Upon POPF, CP-CNDS not only captures enzymes from solution into hydrogel, but also effectively entraps them within the internal gel, preventing their exchange with counterparts in the external milieu. As a result, CP-CNDS completely suppresses the activity of digestive enzymes, effectively alleviating POPF. Remarkably, rats with POPF treated with CP-CNDS not only survived but also made a recovery within a mere 3-day period, while mock-treated POPF rats had a survival rate of less than 5 days when experiencing postoperative pancreatic fistula, leak or abscess. Collectively, the reported CP-CNDS provides promising avenues for preventing and treating POPF, while exemplifying precision medicine-guided regulation of protein activity that effectively targets specific pathogenic molecules across multiple diseases.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the surgical management of Crohn's disease [^116aGUP5]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). High credibility.

Penetrating Crohn's disease with abscess — antibiotics, percutaneous drainage (PD), and surgery: Patients with penetrating Crohn's disease with abscess formation may be managed with antibiotics with or without drainage followed by interval elective resection or medical therapy depending on the clinical situation and patient preferences (Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B). Smaller abscesses (< 3 cm) can generally be treated with antibiotics alone, whereas larger abscesses are typically treated with antibiotics and PD. Successful PD, defined as abscess resolution and avoidance of subsequent surgery, occurs in 23% to 78% of patients; abscess recurrence is significantly higher after PD alone versus surgical intervention (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.03–4.54; p = 0.04), and factors associated with PD failure include concomitant steroid use, colonic disease, and large, multiloculated, or multifocal abscesses. Preoperative PD combined with antibiotics typically improves postoperative outcomes and shortens length of stay; in a meta-analysis of 513 patients with spontaneous abscesses, postoperative complications were significantly lower with PD followed by surgery versus surgery at presentation (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23–0.83; p = 0.03).

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of anorectal abscess, fistula-in-ano, and rectovaginal fistula [^112a4E6N]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Anorectal abscess/fistula — diagnostic imaging use: Routine use of diagnostic imaging is not typically necessary for patients with anorectal abscess or fistula; however, imaging may be considered in selected patients with an occult anorectal abscess, recurrent or complex anal fistula, immunosuppression, or anorectal Crohn's disease, with grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. CT for suspected abscess showed an overall sensitivity of 77% and 70% in immunosuppressed patients; MRI correctly identified all abscesses and 82% of fistulas in anorectal Crohn's disease, and in a 2014 prospective study of 50 patients with suspected anorectal fistula MRI had a 95% sensitivity, 80% specificity, and 97% positive predictive value; a retrospective study of 136 patients reported that MRI identified "significant" findings defined as secondary (blind) tracts, horseshoe abscesses, or abscesses undiagnosed by physical examination.

### Abscess management: an evidence-based review for emergency medicine clinicians [^1148ZAjq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Abscesses are commonly evaluated and managed in the emergency department. Recent research has evaluated the use of ultrasonography, packing, incision and drainage (I&D), and antibiotics. There are evidence-based nuances to the management of specific types of abscesses, such as Bartholin, breast, dental, hidradenitis suppurativa, peritonsillar, and pilonidal abscesses.

Objective

This review provides emergency medicine clinicians with a summary of the current literature regarding abscess management in the emergency department.

Discussion

Ultrasound is valuable in diagnosing abscesses that are not clinically evident and in guiding I&D procedures. Although I&D is traditionally followed by packing, this practice may be unnecessary for small abscesses. Antibiotics, needle aspiration, and loop drainage are suitable alternatives to I&D of abscesses with certain characteristics. Oral antibiotics can improve outcomes after I&D, although this improvement must be weighed against potential risks. Many strategies are useful in managing Bartholin abscesses, with the Word catheter proving consistently effective. Needle aspiration is the recommended first-line therapy for small breast abscesses. Dental abscesses are often diagnosed with clinical examination alone, but ultrasound may be a useful adjunct. Acute abscess formation caused by hidradenitis suppurativa should be managed surgically by excision when possible, because I&D has a high rate of abscess recurrence. Peritonsillar abscesses can be diagnosed with either intraoral or transcervical ultrasound if clinical examination is inconclusive. Needle aspiration and I&D are both suitable for the management of peritonsillar abscesses. Pilonidal abscesses have traditionally been managed with I&D, but needle aspiration with antibiotics may be a suitable alternative.

Conclusions

This review evaluates the recent literature surrounding abscess management for emergency medicine clinicians.

### Treatment of acute pancreatitis with protease inhibitors administered through intravenous infusion: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1116AHYc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The present meta-analysis of the retrieved competent studies included 15 RCTs from the handsearch, one from a previous meta-analysis, and one from guidelines, with the total sample size of 1,697 patients. Of the 15 articles manually searched, 10 were used in our previous meta-analysis.

All articles evaluated death due to acute pancreatitis, in addition to other outcomes such as pain relief (n = 2), pseudocyst formation (n = 5), intra-abdominal abscess formation (n = 4), surgical intervention (n = 3), paralytic small bowel obstruction (n = 3), and other complications (n = 5). Of the 17 articles, 11 were conducted in a multicenter setting, and six in a single-center setting. Sixteen articles were published as a full paper, and one as an abstract only. Fourteen articles were written in English, two in German, and one in French. Eleven trials used aprotinin, and six trials used gabexate mesilate, all against the placebo control. Four articles described tangible outcomes in the method section, whereas 13 provided no description. The sample size was pre-calculated only in one article. Acute pancreatitis was defined as clinical manifestation with elevated serum pancreatic enzyme levels in 11 articles, or as clinical manifestation with elevated urine pancreatic enzyme levels in two; no description regarding the definition was found in the remaining four articles. Nine articles described sources of funding or medicine support from industries. The severity of acute pancreatitis was reported using the Ranson's score in two articles, or Acute Pathophysiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE-II) score in one article. In addition to these, we evaluated the severity of acute pancreatitis according to CMR in the present analysis, and found that 10 articles had CMR > 0.10. No articles mentioned the presence or absence of adverse events. Seven articles observed death due to acute pancreatitis as the primary outcome. Six articles reported no secondary outcome, while one article observed surgical intervention and bowel obstruction as the secondary outcomes. Ten articles reported undistinguishable outcomes. We performed quality of evidence assessment and found death, pseudocyst, intra-abdominal abscess, and any major complications to be low quality, and abdominal pain, surgical intervention, and bowel obstruction to be very low quality. Table 1 shows heterogeneity of each outcome with I² values.

Coccidioidal vertebral infection — surgical approaches delineate approach-specific indications and risks: An anterior approach is appropriate when infection is confined to the disc space or vertebral body, is familiar to most spine surgeons with less morbidity, and most patients tolerate anterior cervical and retroperitoneal lumbar procedures extremely well; the entire disc and surrounding bones should be removed even if complete corpectomy is required. Lateral approaches provide access from T3 to L3, with thoracotomy or VATS exposing T3 through L2 and a lateral retroperitoneal approach accessing L1 through L4; if complete vertebral destruction is present, a corpectomy should be performed and the ventral epidural space and thecal sac should be exposed. Posterior approaches can be used for any segment and would usually be employed to decompress an epidural abscess, but a posterior-only decompression of a ventral epidural abscess should be performed with great caution; a laminectomy alone is unlikely to be effective and may contribute to spinal destabilization; posterior approaches are typically more painful, have a higher risk of poor wound healing and wound infection, require longer recovery, and dorsal incisions are prone to infection and poor healing in recumbent patients due to direct pressure and less effective wound care. The posterolateral approach has utility limited to the midthoracic region (T3–T8); in general it allows access to the vertebral body, lateral vertebral elements, and ventral, lateral, and posterior epidural space, but muscle dissection and longer incision length contribute to postoperative morbidity.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^112ZVe5x]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease intra-abdominal abscess — management and outcomes are summarized as follows: Patients with CD who develop an abdominal abscess should undergo a surgical resection, although some may respond to medical therapy after radiologically guided drainage. In a meta-analysis of 9 studies including 513 patients with spontaneous intra-abdominal abscesses, the overall complication rate was higher in patients who underwent initial surgery compared with those who first underwent percutaneous drainage of the abscess (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.35–0.96; P = 0.03), and the risk for recurrent abscess was higher in patients who underwent percutaneous drainage alone than those who underwent surgery (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.03–4.54; P = 0.04). After drainage, most patients benefit from a delayed surgical resection, though some may benefit from drainage followed by CD medical treatment, especially those with a new diagnosis and absence of stricturing disease; to date, there are no studies comparing percutaneous drainage followed by delayed intestinal resection vs medical therapy.

Regarding medical management for brain abscess, more specifically with respect to antimicrobial therapy, choice of regimen, ESCMID 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole combined with TMP/SMX and voriconazole for empirical treatment of brain abscess in adult and pediatric patients with severe immunocompromise equivalent to organ transplant recipients, active chemotherapy, biological treatment, or hematological malignancies.
Consider administering meropenem combined with TMP/SMX and voriconazole as an alternative regimen.

### Impact of CT-guided drainage in the treatment of diverticular abscesses: size matters [^117SSCv3]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to determine whether abscess size can be used as a discriminating factor to guide management of patients with diverticular abscesses.

Materials and Methods

We performed a word search of our CT database between July 2001 and July 2002 for the CT diagnosis of diverticulitis. CTs were retrospectively reviewed as consensus opinion of two reviewers. CTs were evaluated for presence of an abscess, its location, maximum diameter, and feasibility of percutaneous abscess drainage. Abscesses were categorized into smaller than 3 cm and larger than or equal to 3 cm, and the management of these groups was compared.

Results

Thirty-one abscesses were noted in 30 (17%) of 181 patients with a CT diagnosis of diverticulitis. Twenty-two (73%) of 30 patients had 23 abscesses, all of which were smaller than 3 cm and were treated and resolved with antibiotics alone (p < 0.001). Eight (36%) of 22 required surgical treatment. Eight (26%) of 31 abscesses had a maximum diameter larger than or equal to 3 cm. Four (50%) of eight patients with abscesses 3.4–4.1 cm were treated with antibiotics alone. Four (50%) of eight abscesses, all larger than 4.1 cm, were treated with CT-guided drainage and one abscess required repeat drainage. After resolution of symptoms, surgery was performed in five (62.5%) of eight of the larger abscesses.

Conclusion

Patients with abscesses smaller than 3 cm in size can be treated with antibiotics alone and, in some cases, as outpatients, and may not uniformly require surgery. This is also likely true for patients with abscesses 3–4 cm in size, although our results in this group were limited by a small sample size. Patients with abscesses larger than or equal to 4 cm can be managed with CT-guided abscess drainage followed by referral for surgical treatment.

### A comprehensive review of abdominal infections [^116sSGu9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Traditionally, patients who present with an abscess or phlegmon then undergo elective surgery to avoid the high risk of recurrence and further complications. Recently though, some have begun to question the need for operative therapy when initial management with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics is successful. Two authors have found that perforation, which is the most common cause of mortality in complicated diverticulitis, is more likely to be the initial presentation of disease, rather than a manifestation of recurrence. They concluded that abscesses in complicated diverticulitis might then be adequately managed with antibiotics and drainage alone.

While conservative management may be appropriate in uniloculated abscesses, timely initial operative management is required for cases in which abscesses are large, multiloculated, or inaccessible, as well as in cases of free perforation, or diffuse peritonitis. Acute diverticulitis is complicated by free perforation in approximately 1.5% of episodes. The standard procedure in cases of peritonitis is a Hartmann's procedure. However, the Hartmann's procedure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and while it can be reversed in 3–6 months, 30–70% of patients never undergo reversal. Recently, it has been suggested that primary resection and anastomosis should be preferred. Finally, laparoscopic resections for complicated diverticulitis have also been shown to be safe; and, in spite of longer operative times, they are associated with fewer major complications, less pain, and shorter hospital stays.

### Serum amylase and lipase and urinary trypsinogen and amylase for diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^117Bi8y8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of people with acute abdominal pain differs if they have acute pancreatitis. It is important to know the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, so that an informed decision can be made as to whether the person with abdominal pain has acute pancreatitis. There is currently no Cochrane review of the diagnostic test accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

Objectives

To compare the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase, either alone or in combination, in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in people with acute onset of a persistent, severe epigastric pain or diffuse abdominal pain.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR HTA and DARE), and other databases until March 2017. We searched the references of the included studies to identify additional studies. We did not restrict studies based on language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. We also performed a 'related search' and 'citing reference' search in MEDLINE and Embase.

Selection Criteria

We included all studies that evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. We excluded case-control studies because these studies are prone to bias. We accepted any of the following reference standards: biopsy, consensus conference definition, radiological features of acute pancreatitis, diagnosis of acute pancreatitis during laparotomy or autopsy, and organ failure. At least two review authors independently searched and screened the references located by the search to identify relevant studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. The thresholds used for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis varied in the trials, resulting in sparse data for each index test. Because of sparse data, we used -2 log likelihood values to determine which model to use for meta-analysis. We calculated and reported the sensitivity, specificity, post-test probability of a positive and negative index test along with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each cutoff, but have reported only the results of the recommended cutoff of three times normal for serum amylase and serum lipase, and the manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 50 mg/mL for urinary trypsinogen-2 in the abstract.

Main Results

Ten studies including 5056 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests in people presenting to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain. The risk of bias was unclear or high for all of the included studies. The study that contributed approximately two-thirds of the participants included in this review was excluded from the results of the analysis presented below due to major concerns about the participants included in the study. We have presented only the results where at least two studies were included in the analysis. Serum amylase, serum lipase, and urinary trypsinogen-2 at the standard threshold levels of more than three times normal for serum amylase and serum lipase, and a threshold of 50 ng/mL for urinary trypsinogen-2 appear to have similar sensitivities (0.72 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.82); 0.79 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.92); and 0.72 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.84), respectively) and specificities (0.93 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.99); 0.89 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.99); and 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.93), respectively). At the median prevalence of 22.6% of acute pancreatitis in the studies, out of 100 people with positive test, serum amylase (more than three times normal), serum lipase (more than three times normal), and urinary trypsinogen (more than 50 ng/mL), 74 (95% CI 33 to 94); 68 (95% CI 21 to 94); and 67 (95% CI 57 to 76) people have acute pancreatitis, respectively; out of 100 people with negative test, serum amylase (more than three times normal), serum lipase (more than three times normal), and urinary trypsinogen (more than 50 ng/mL), 8 (95% CI 5 to 12); 7 (95% CI 3 to 15); and 8 (95% CI 5 to 13) people have acute pancreatitis, respectively. We were not able to compare these tests formally because of sparse data.

Authors' Conclusions

As about a quarter of people with acute pancreatitis fail to be diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis with the evaluated tests, one should have a low threshold to admit the patient and treat them for acute pancreatitis if the symptoms are suggestive of acute pancreatitis, even if these tests are normal. About 1 in 10 patients without acute pancreatitis may be wrongly diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis with these tests, therefore it is important to consider other conditions that require urgent surgical intervention, such as perforated viscus, even if these tests are abnormal. The diagnostic performance of these tests decreases even further with the progression of time, and one should have an even lower threshold to perform additional investigations if the symptoms are suggestive of acute pancreatitis.

### Treatment of Mycobacterium abscessus infection [^114JLSi5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Mycobacterium abscessus infections are challenging to treat because multidrug resistance necessitates prolonged intravenous (IV) therapy and side effects are perceived to be common. For the best chance of pulmonary disease cure, guidelines from the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) recommend multidrug macrolide-based therapy based on susceptibility testing results and surgical resection. However, these guidelines also state that there are no drug combinations with proven efficacy. Similarly for extrapulmonary disease, macrolide-based treatment regimens based on susceptibility testing results are recommended. Inducible macrolide resistance in many strains of M. abscessus further complicates treatment. Given the lack of evidence-based therapies, we hypothesized that treatment regimens have no clear pattern and that medication changes and toxicities occur frequently.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^117W37Zp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Spinal involvement in coccidioidomycosis — indications, timing, and procedural considerations — are outlined as follows: There are 4 typical reasons to seek a surgical opinion, including bony destruction without instability where debridement may optimize medical therapy, bony destruction with instability where risk to the spinal cord or nerve roots may necessitate stabilization, spinal cord or nerve root compression which should be considered a surgical emergency, and significant sequestered paraspinal abscess where surgical or interventional radiologic intervention may be needed; back pain is intense and precedes neurological symptoms by several days or weeks, and urgent intervention is indicated for signs of nerve root or spinal cord dysfunction, especially if symptoms are progressing rapidly; selection of procedures includes immobilization for painful discitis and paravertebral spasm with imaging surveillance and close clinical observation at frequent intervals (perhaps weekly MRI), minimally invasive aspiration given that coccidioidial abscesses are often amenable to image-guided needle aspiration and aspiration can be therapeutic if adequate, and surgical debridement for which aggressive surgical debridement is essential.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^113AzVzP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

On the basis of clinical conditions, patients with diverticular smaller abscesses may be treated by antibiotics alone (Recommendation 1C).

Patients with abscesses having a large diameter should be treated by percutaneous drainage and intravenous antibiotics (Recommendation 1C).

Whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, based on the clinical conditions patients with large abscesses can be initially treated by antibiotic therapy alone. However careful clinical monitoring is mandatory (Recommendation 1C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with ALCD have an abscess, and the treatment should be either antibiotics with or without percutaneous and/or surgical drainage. The use of antibiotics and percutaneous drainage in the management of diverticular abscesses facilitates single-stage operation to perform subsequently an elective sigmoidectomy. The size of 3–6 cm has been generally accepted, despite the low level of evidence, to be a reasonable limit between antimicrobial versus percutaneous drainage in the management of diverticular abscesses.

A retrospective study assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics as sole initial therapy in patients with large diverticular abscess was published in 2015 by Elagili et al. Thirty-two patients were managed by antibiotics alone while 114 underwent percutaneous drainage.

Failure of initial treatment required urgent surgery in eight patients with persistent symptoms during treatment with antibiotics alone (25%) and in 21 patients (18%) after initial percutaneous drainage (p = 0.21). Patients treated with antibiotics had a significantly smaller abscess diameter (5.9 versus 7.1 cm, p = 0.001). Postoperative complications in patients treated with antibiotics alone were significantly less severe than after percutaneous drainage based on the Clavien-Dindo classification (p = 0.04).

Hartmann's procedure remains useful in the management of diffuse peritonitis in critically ill patients. However, in clinically stable patients, primary resection with anastomosis, with or without a diverting stoma, may be performed (Recommendation 1B).

### Medical and surgical management of perianal Crohn's disease [^113eZBG7]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Surgical management

The fistula anatomy, disease activity and presence of complicating features (proctitis, abscess) influence surgical options. The AGA empirically distinguishes fistulas as simple or complex, with the former having higher rates of healing. Simple fistulas are classified as superficial or low intersphincteric/transsphincteric with a single external opening, no pain or fluctuation to suggest perianal abscess, no evidence of a rectovaginal fistula, and no evidence of anorectal stricture. Complex fistulas (Fig. 2A, B), in contrast, are high fistulas (intersphincteric / transsphincteric / extrasphincteric / suprasphincteric) and may be associated with multiple external openings, presence of pain or fluctuation to suggest a perianal abscess, presence of a rectovaginal fistula, presence of an anorectal stricture, or presence of active rectal disease at endoscopy.

Management of fistulizing PCD has evolved from a focus on definitive surgical repair to multidisciplinary management, with surgical drainage in preparation for medical treatment. In many circumstances surgery can be a good adjunct to symptom palliation. Diversion or ablation are offered in the case of failure.

Examination under anesthesia (EUA) with drainage of collections / seton insertion

EUA and drainage is the first-line treatment for acute abscess so as to control local sepsis prior to initiating medical treatment. Loose setons maintain patency of fistula tracts, limiting recurrent abscess formation. When the goal of medical treatment is fistula closure, the seton must be removed, often towards the end of anti-TNF treatment induction, although the optimal timing of removal is unknown. Loose setons may be left in situ permanently to control local sepsis and reduce symptoms, although on occasion they may need to be replaced. Loose setons also serve as a bridge between optimization of medical therapy and definitive surgical treatment. Cutting setons, by contrast, are a method of fistulotomy and risk sphincter injury and the authors do not advocate this in perianal Crohn's fistula.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113UkXua]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — cutaneous abscess and inflamed epidermoid cyst management emphasizes that aspiration was successful in only 25% of cases overall and < 10% with MRSA infections, and accordingly, this form of treatment is not recommended. Simply covering the surgical site with a dry dressing is usually the easiest and most effective treatment of the wound, and one small study found that packing caused more pain and did not improve healing when compared to just covering the incision site with sterile gauze. The addition of systemic antibiotics to incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses does not improve cure rates, even in those due to MRSA, but systemic antibiotics should be given to patients with severely impaired host defenses or signs or symptoms of systemic infection; multiple abscesses, extremes of age, and lack of response to incision and drainage alone are additional settings in which systemic antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric AHO — surgical source control principles and supporting evidence: Every established source of infection should be controlled as soon as possible, and adult sepsis data provide indirect evidence supporting source control in pediatric AHO; in a Spanish national multicenter prospective observational trial in adults, crude ICU mortality was lower (21.2% vs 25.1%; p = 0.010) with source control, adjusted hospital mortality was lower (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.99), and delay in source control beyond 12 hours was not associated with increased mortality. When surgery is undertaken, the goal is to debride all dead and devitalized tissue, with bone opening sized to avoid destabilization (generally 1 × 3 cm in dimension), and drain placement after debridement allows continued evacuation. Regarding abscess size thresholds, drainage of abscesses 2 cm or more in diameter has been suggested, while resolution with medical management alone has been described in small numbers for abscesses < 1 cm diameter. Bacterial arthritis can be associated with AHO, and the involved joint(s) is usually drained at presentation when clinically apparent.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^1169Q2jt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Spinal coccidioidomycosis — imaging assessment — CT of the spine provides the best information regarding bone involvement, and visualization of the extent of bone destruction is needed to plan the surgical approach and to optimize placement of hardware fixation; CT also provides the best assessment of postoperative fusion progress and integrity. MRI is the best modality to evaluate the associated soft tissues of the vertebral structures, and the disc spaces and abscess collections are best seen with MRI. Plain radiographic images are useful to assess the stability of the spine both before and after surgery, are helpful to evaluate the hardware construct and spinal alignment during the healing process, and plain films alone are often insufficient to determine the integrity of a bony fusion, particularly adjacent to hardware components.

### Multicentre study of non-surgical management of diverticulitis with abscess formation [^1145FhjW]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The rates of adverse and unwanted outcomes in patients with diverticular abscess remain high and present a major burden to the patient, as well the healthcare system. Therefore, an aim of the present study was to identify potential risk factors related to these adverse outcomes in order to help improve individual patient management. Abscess size was shown to be an independent predictor of adverse outcome; an abscess diameter of at least 3 cm increased the risk of short‐term treatment failure, whereas an abscess of 5 cm or larger increased the risk of emergency surgery. These results indicate that, for abscesses larger than 3 cm, and particularly those larger than 5 cm, it can still be debated which treatment strategy is most appropriate, as the results show no definite advantage of one strategy over the other in short‐term outcomes. Treatment should not be based solely on abscess size, but other patient and disease characteristics should also be considered. However, no other significant predictors were found in the multivariable analyses for treatment failure or emergency surgery, making it difficult to select a subpopulation of patients who would benefit from PCD. The findings do seem to acknowledge that a cut‐off value of 3 cm is appropriate for differentiating between small and large abscesses 11, 13, 17, 29, 30.

### Clinical application of the intersphincteric approach with internal incision combined with counter-drainage for deep perianal abscess [^114KMHFh]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Perianal abscesses typically arise from infections of the anal glands. The infection spreads through three potential spaces within the sphincter complex: the intersphincteric space between the internal anal sphincter (IAS) and the conjoint longitudinal muscle (CLM), and the intermediate and lateral spaces between the CLM and external anal sphincter (EAS). These infections can extend in various directions: downward to form perianal abscesses, laterally through the external sphincter to form ischiorectal abscesses, or upward above the levator ani to form supralevator or high intersphincteric abscesses. Clinically, anorectal abscesses are often divided into superficial abscesses and DPAs based on the location of the lesions. The most effective treatment for perianal abscesses currently is surgical treatment. According to the "Chinese Expert Consensus on Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Perianal Abscess" and the "Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Perianal Abscess, Anal Fistula, and Rectovaginal Fistula (2022 Edition)", incision — drainage are commonly used surgical methods for treating perianal abscesses. This procedure is simple to perform, quick to recovery, and can achieve significant therapeutic effects. However, for DPA, due to their deeper location, larger abscess cavities, and thinner drainage strips, the drainage opening can close prematurely before the abscess cavity is completely healed. This can result in the persistence of gaps between the drainage opening and the sphincter, leading to insufficient drainage of the abscess cavity and a postoperative fistula rate of up to 50%. The high rate of fistula formation or recurrence after perianal abscess drainage not only subjects patients to the pain of a second surgery but also increases the medical burden. To address this issue, clinicians have introduced the "Seton technique", which involves simultaneous incision — drainage along with internal seton placement. The gradual cutting action of the rubber band not only effectively eradicates the primary fistula and internal opening but also helps to partially preserve the function of the anal sphincter, thereby reducing the postoperative incidence of anal fistulas in perianal abscesses. According to the 2024 European Society of Coloproctology Guidelines, the immediate incision — drainage of fistulas are not recommended in the management of acute perianal abscesses. Although internal opening incision with seton drainage has a higher cure rate compared to simple incision — drainage, there is still some degree of postoperative anal function impairment. The selection of surgical methods for DPA has been a subject of controversy in clinical studies. Despite the differing approaches, the common goal remains to minimize patient pain, protect anal sphincter function, and reduce the high recurrence rate. Based on this, our study utilized an intersphincteric approach combined with counterpart drainage (IAICD) to treat deep abscesses.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^111do7rZ]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

4.8.2 Medical therapy

In the first instance, patient optimisation is required when localised perforation in Crohn's disease has led to abscess formation. Surgical intervention is mandatory within the context of free peritonitis and highly likely to be required at some stage in the setting of localised abscess formation. Ideally, surgery takes place following treatment of sepsis and treatment of nutritional deficiencies. Exclusive enteral nutrition can be an effective means of controlling intestinal inflammation without use of corticosteroids.

Good Practice Recommendation 10. Following treatment of an abdominal abscess in the setting of non-perianal fistulising Crohn's disease, joint medical and surgical discussion is required, but interval surgical resection is not always necessary (Agreement: 100%).

Some observers suggest that surgery may be avoided by percutaneous radiological drainage of abscesses and then resumption of medical therapy. The largest case series to date of 51 patients identified retrospectively from review of medical charts from a single centre over a 10-year period has shown that patients undergoing surgical resection were significantly less likely to develop abscess recurrence than those treated with antibiotics alone or percutaneous drainage over a mean follow-up of 3.75 years (12% vs 56%). Nevertheless, non-surgical approaches were successful in preventing subsequent surgery in almost half of the patients treated medically. An almost identical proportion of patients avoided surgery over long-term follow-up in a different series of 32 patients managed with percutaneous drainage for perforating Crohn's disease. This strategy, if successful in treating sepsis, is likely to lead to lower morbidity and potentially lower stoma rates.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: an evidence-based review [^11689GoD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and abscess are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatient.

Conclusions

It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### Needle aspiration versus incision and drainage for the treatment of peritonsillar abscess [^113xyjrB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Peritonsillar abscess is a common infection presenting as a collection of pus in the peritonsillar area. The condition is characterised by a severe sore throat, difficulty in swallowing and pain on swallowing, fever and malaise, and trismus. Needle aspiration and incision and drainage are the two main treatment modalities currently used in the treatment of this condition. The effectiveness of one versus the other has not been clearly demonstrated and remains an area of debate.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and risks of needle aspiration versus incision and drainage for the treatment of peritonsillar abscess in older children (eight years of age or older), adolescents and adults.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 7); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 25 August 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing needle aspiration with incision and drainage.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were recurrence rate (proportion of patients needing repeat intervention) and adverse effects associated with the intervention. Secondary outcomes were time to resumption of normal diet, complications of the disease process and symptom scores. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included 11 studies (674 participants). The risk of bias was high or unclear in all of the included studies. All studies compared needle aspiration to incision and drainage. All but one of the 11 studies reported on the primary outcome of recurrence. When we pooled data from the 10 studies the recurrence rate was higher in the needle aspiration group compared with incision and drainage: risk ratio (RR) 3.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63 to 8.59; 612 participants). We detected moderate heterogeneity in this analysis (I² = 48%). In interpreting the pooled result it is important to note that the evidence for this outcome was of very low quality. None of the other outcomes (adverse effects of the intervention, time to resumption of normal diet, complications of the disease process and symptom scores) were consistently measured across all studies. Only three studies reported on adverse effects/events associated with the intervention and only one such event in a single patient was reported (post-procedure bleeding following incision and drainage: 1/28, 3.6%) (very low-quality evidence). Time to resumption of normal diet was compared in two studies; neither found an obvious difference between needle aspiration and incision and drainage (very low-quality evidence). Only three studies stated that they would report complications of the disease process. In these three studies, the only complication reported was admission to hospital for dehydration in two patients who underwent incision and drainage (2/13, 6.7%). Symptom scores were measured in four studies; three evaluated pain using different scales and one other symptoms. The data could not be pooled in a meta-analysis. Two studies evaluating procedural pain reported this to be lower in the needle aspiration groups. One study found comparable rates of pain resolution at five days post-intervention between groups. The quality of the evidence for symptom scores was very low.

Authors' Conclusions

Although a number of studies have sought to evaluate whether or not needle aspiration or incision and drainage is more effective in patients with peritonsillar abscess, there is no high-quality evidence to allow a firm conclusion to be drawn and the answer remains uncertain. Very low-quality evidence suggests that incision and drainage may be associated with a lower chance of recurrence than needle aspiration. There is some very low-quality evidence to suggest that needle aspiration is less painful.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) — indications for invasive procedures at diagnosis: In children with AHO who present with sepsis or have a rapidly progressive infection, we recommend debridement of the infected bone and any associated abscesses as soon as possible after diagnosis, rather than treating with medical therapy alone (strong recommendation and moderate certainty of evidence). In a child with AHO who is clinically stable but documented to have a substantial abscess (greater than 2 cm), we suggest surgical drainage rather than treating with medical therapy alone (conditional recommendation and very low certainty of evidence).

Operative management — acute pilonidal abscess: Patients with an abscess should be treated with incision and drainage (I&D) regardless of whether it is primary or recurrent, with a Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate‑quality evidence, 1B. For first‑episode abscesses, overall successful healing reaches 60%, but simple I&D carries an estimated 15% to 40% recurrence rate; I&D also appears to have a protective effect on recurrence after surgical excision at 20‑year follow‑up. An unroofing (lay open) and curettage procedure is a 1‑step option that potentially avoids the need for a second procedure, and in a randomized trial curettage achieved greater complete healing at 10 weeks (96% versus 79%).

Anorectal abscess — drainage approach by location should follow on-page guidance: Abscess location generally determines whether a patient should have internal versus external drainage, and intersphincteric abscesses should typically be drained through the intersphincteric groove or into the anal canal via an internal sphincterotomy; it is usually preferable to drain supralevator abscesses originating from an intersphincteric abscess internally by incising the rectal wall, whereas supralevator abscesses because of cephalad extension of an ischiorectal abscess should typically be drained externally through the perianal skin, approaches that may help prevent complex fistula formation; for horseshoe abscesses, primary lay-open fistulotomy should typically be avoided, the Hanley procedure is effective but may negatively impact anal sphincter function, and a modified Hanley technique with posterior midline partial sphincterotomy plus seton placement has a high rate of abscess resolution and has been reported to better preserve anorectal function.

Fistulotomy wound-healing adjuncts and fistulectomy versus fistulotomy — randomized and comparative evidence indicates benefits of marsupialization and certain topical agents, while findings on fistulectomy are mixed. Four randomized controlled trials comparing fistulotomy with and without marsupialization found that marsupialization resulted in less postoperative bleeding and improved wound healing. Additionally, topical ointments such as 10% sucralfate and 2% phenylephrine have been associated with decreased postoperative pain and improved healing compared to placebo. In comparative surgery, a randomized controlled trial published in 1985 (n = 47) reported longer healing times, larger defects, and a higher risk of fecal incontinence after fistulectomy with comparable recurrence, whereas a meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials did not offer conclusive evidence that fistulectomy was associated with worse outcomes compared to fistulotomy in patients with low-lying fistulas.

### Recent developments in the surgical management of perianal fistula for Crohn's disease [^113TVfHS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Combination therapy

A combined medical and surgical approach to treatment is integral to the care of CD perianal fistulas. Medical treatment includes antibiotics, immunomodulators, and biologic medications. After being approved for use in CD in 1998, and with further reinforcement of their efficacy in perianal CD fistulas in 1999, biologic therapies are being widely used by gastroenterologists in all practice settings. The most commonly used biologic therapy is infliximab (IFX), an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α drug. Adalimumab is another anti-TNF-α medication indicated in cases refractory or intolerant to IFX.

According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, biologics should be reserved for CD that has failed conventional therapy or in the presence of severe, active fistulizing disease. This is echoed by the European evidence–based consensus on CD. IFX treatment of perianal CD after local surgical drainage resulted in an overall 55% closure. Duration of fistula closure is limited, however, with a median of three months of continued fistula closure. Recurrence rates were 17% at one year and 40% at five years. There seems to be some benefit to continuation with IFX maintenance therapy, which resulted in a 36% response rate at 54 weeks, compared to 19% in the placebo group.

In the adolescent population, response to IFX may be slightly improved, as there was a 70% complete response, with a 23% recurrence rate after seton drainage and IFX. These patients, however, had their setons left in much longer than their adult counterparts. In addition, many of this cohort were switched to adalimumab treatment.

Despite major advances in medical treatment, biologic medications and immunomodulators do not seem to significantly change the biology or long-term prognosis of patients with perianal CD, and surgical treatment remains a necessity. There is a significant nonresponse rate, 20–35% in most series. Even with closure of perianal fistula after IFX, many patients require further surgical intervention for recurrence, development of anal stenosis, or abscess formation. Anal stenosis is postulated to be due to scarring from rapid healing while on IFX. In a series of nine patients with perianal fistulizing CD, Poritz et al demonstrated an initial 44% complete response rate to perianal fistulas; however, another 44% went on to require surgical intervention.

### Percutaneous hepatic abscess drainage: do multiple abscesses or multiloculated abscesses preclude drainage or affect outcome? [^112XUfZw]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the effectiveness of percutaneous abscess drainage in patients with pyogenic liver abscesses of the following types: single, single multiloculated, multiple, and multiple multiloculated.

Materials and Methods

One hundred nine patients with 149 liver abscesses who underwent percutaneous drainage during an 11-year period were divided into a single abscess group and a multiple abscess group. Of the 109 patients, 54 had multiloculated abscesses and were divided into single and multiple multiloculated abscess groups. Technical success was defined as the ability to place the catheter within the abscess cavity and clinical success was defined as improvement in the patient's symptoms. Clinical findings, management strategy, complication rate, and success rate were analyzed.

Results

Technical success rates were 96% (82 of 85) for a single abscess and 96% (23 of 24) for multiple abscesses (P = 1.0). Clinical success was achieved in 74 of 85 patients (87%) with a single abscess and 22 of 24 patients (92%) with multiple abscesses (P = 0.729). Technical success rates were 94% (32 of 34) for a single multiloculated abscess and 95% (19 of 20) for multiple multiloculated abscesses (P = 1.0). Clinical success was achieved in 30 of 34 patients (88%) with a single multiloculated abscess and 18 of 20 patients (90%) with multiple multiloculated abscesses (P = 1). No significant difference in hospital stay was seen between single and multiple abscess groups (P = 0.373) or between single multiloculated and multiple multiloculated abscess groups (P = 0.180). There were no major complications or mortality related to the procedure.

Conclusions

Percutaneous drainage is a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of pyogenic liver abscess, regardless of abscess complexity and/or multiplicity.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^113UzBga]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

As a general principle, the most established source of infection should be totally controlled as soon as possible. However, source control requires general anaesthesia that may not be readily available in some areas of the world. In many rural areas, patients must be centralized to urban centers with the loss of much time, largely due to transport delays. Furthermore, the urgency of intervention is also affected by the rapidity of the evolution of clinical symptoms.

Source control encompasses all measures undertaken to eliminate the source of infection, reduce the bacterial inoculum, and correct or control anatomic derangements to restore normal physiologic function. The primary objectives of intervention include (a) determining the cause of peritonitis, (b) draining fluid collections, and (c) controlling the origin of the abdominal sepsis. This endeavor generally involves drainage of abscesses or infected fluid collections, debridement of necrotic or infected tissues, and definitive control of the source of contamination. Control of the septic source can be achieved either by surgical or non-surgical means. Non-surgical interventional procedures imply percutaneous drainages of abscesses, when it is available. Ultrasound and CT-guided percutaneous drainage of abdominal and extraperitoneal abscesses in selected patients are safe and effective. Surgical source control includes resection or suture of a diseased or perforated viscus (e.g. diverticular perforation, gastroduodenal perforation), removal of the infected organ (e.g. appendix, gallbladder), debridement of necrotic tissue, resection of ischemic bowel, and repair/resection of traumatic perforations with primary anastomosis or exteriorization of the bowel.

Nocardia — cutaneous infection management in immunocompromised hosts: Cutaneous Nocardia infections usually represent metastatic foci from a primary pulmonary source, and the dermatologic manifestations are usually limited to subcutaneous nodules or abscesses and panniculitis. Sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim (SMX‑TMP) remains the treatment of choice, with alternatives including other sulfa antibiotics (sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole), amikacin, imipenem, meropenem, third‑generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefotaxime), minocycline, extended‑spectrum fluoroquinolones (e.g., moxifloxacin), linezolid, and dapsone. Combination therapy with other agents should be considered in patients with severe infections or profound and lasting immunodeficiency. Prolonged therapy is important, and the duration of treatment (6–24 months) should take into account disseminated disease and the extent of underlying immunosuppression. Surgical debridement is recommended for necrotic nodules or large subcutaneous abscesses.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons' clinical practice guidelines for the management of pilonidal disease [^112AQ994]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). High credibility.

Management of recurrent pilonidal disease — operative strategies for recurrent pilonidal disease should distinguish between the presence of an acute abscess and chronic disease, considering the experience and expertise of the surgeon. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Proper hygiene, to include a trial of shaving, may remain a cornerstone in the outpatient management of recurrent disease, and recurrent abscesses should be surgically drained as if they were sentinel presentations; in the face of nonacute recurrence or chronically recurring pilonidal sinus disease, the goal should be a treatment strategy that allows the patient to resume a normal lifestyle as quickly as possible. Definitive flap-based procedures may be indicated if previous local excisions or multiple drainage procedures have been performed previously or if a minimally invasive approach may be entertained, with no strong evidence for either strategy; randomized data in recurrent patients comparing a modified asymmetric flap with a classical rhomboid flap demonstrated a lower wound infection rate (3% vs 23%), lower recurrence rate, shorter hospital stay, and faster return to work using the asymmetric flap. Thus, we recommend that patients be managed based on both the underlying presentation (ie, acute abscess, cellulitis, sinus, or subcutaneous tracts) and the goals, experience, and expertise of the surgeon, and it is recommended that known modifiable risk factors for surgical site occurrence, such as nutritional status, smoking cessation, glycemic control, and obesity, be optimized before embarking on repeat procedures.

### WSES guidelines for the management of acute left sided colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^115fQEJe]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment of localized complicated diverticulitis

10) Patients with CT findings of pericolic air or small fluid collection should be managed by antimicrobial therapy. (Recommendation 1 C).

High mortality associated with sepsis, requires maintaining a high index of clinical suspicion for deterioration and more aggressive management. WSES expert panel routinely recommends antimicrobial therapy in patients with pericolic air or small fluid collection. CT findings of pericolic air in the form of air bubbles or little pericolic fluid without abscess and distant air indicates a complicated acute diverticulitis and antimicrobial therapy should always recommended.

Treatment of diverticular abscesses

11) Patients with small diverticular abscesses (< 4–5 cm) may be treated by antibiotics alone (Recommendation 1 C).
12) Patients with large abscesses (> 4–5 cm) can best be treated by percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment (Recommendation 1 C).
13) Whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, based on the clinical conditions patients with large abscesses can be initially treated by antibiotic therapy alone. However careful clinical monitoring is mandatory. (Recommendation 1 C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. The size of 3–6 cm has been generally accepted as (all of low level of evidence), to be a reasonable limit between antimicrobial versus percutaneous drainage in the management of diverticular abscesses. The size of 4–5 cm may be a reasonable limit between antibiotic treatment alone versus percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment in the management of diverticular abscesses. Based on the clinical conditions also patients with large abscesses can be initially treated by antibiotic therapy alone. However careful clinical monitoring is mandatory. A CT scan should be repeated if the patient fails to show clinical and laboratory improvement.

The decision to administer antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage should be based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria such as temperature ≥ 38°C or < 36°C, tachypnea > 24 breaths per minute, tachycardia > 90 beats per minute, or white blood cell count > 12 000 or < 4000 cells/µL (moderate; Figure 1) (strong, low), and an antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have markedly impaired host defenses and in patients with SIRS (Figure 1, Table 2) (strong, low).

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^114Ah4NM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Classification

Several systems of classification have been used to describe SSTIs. In 1998 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories - uncomplicated and complicated - for the purpose of clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for the treatment of SSTIs. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles that either require antibiotics alone or in conjunction with surgical incision for drainage of abscess. In contrast, complicated SSTIs involve the deep soft tissues and require significant surgical intervention.

The terms "complicated" and "uncomplicated" skin structure infections is still valid and can be useful in describing SSTIs.

Uncomplicated SSTIs are at low risk for life- or limb-threatening infection unless they are not properly treated. Patients who have uncomplicated SSTIs can be treated with either empiric antibiotic therapy according to likely pathogen and local resistance patterns or simple surgical drainage.

The practice guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections classifies SSTIs into five categories: 1) superficial uncomplicated infection (includes impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis), 2) necrotizing infections, 3) infections associated with bites and animal contact, 4) surgical site infections and 5) infections in the immunocompromised host.

Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions for patients presenting as out-patients to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions for patients with SSTIs. This system is organized into classes of infection:

Class 1: patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.

Crohn's disease–related anorectal disease — incidence and pathogenesis: Distinct from cryptoglandular processes, anorectal abscess and fistula-in-ano can be manifestations of Crohn's disease. Among patients with Crohn's disease, fistula-in-ano has an incidence rate of 10% to 20% in population-based studies and 50% in longitudinal studies; meanwhile, nearly 80% of patients with Crohn's disease who were cared for at tertiary referral centers may have a history of fistula-in-ano. In Crohn's disease, anorectal abscesses and fistulas seem to result from penetrating inflammation rather than from infection of an anorectal gland, and patients with fistulas related to Crohn's disease are typically managed with a multidisciplinary approach.

### The role of tissue plasminogen activator in the management of complex intra-abdominal abscesses in children [^111anpUZ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to assess the safety of fibrinolytic therapy using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in children with complex intra-abdominal abscesses.

Summary Background Data

Intra-abdominal abscesses are common in children. Antibiotics and percutaneous drainage are the mainstays of treatment, but drainage may be less effective when the fluid is thick or septated. Fibrinolytic therapy using tPA is effective in a rat model of intra-abdominal abscesses, has recently been reported for the treatment of intra-abdominal abscesses in adults, and is commonly used in the treatment of empyema in children.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of all patients over a 10-year period who had intra-abdominal collections managed with tPA abscess drainage.

Results

Sixty-four children had a total of 66 drains placed and 92 doses of tPA. Appendicitis was the cause of the abscesses in 52 of 64 children. Mean length of stay pre-tPA was 11.7 ± 7.63 days, mean time from drain insertion to tPA was 4.3 ± 3.78 days, and mean time from tPA to discharge was 8.6 ± 8.85 days. Thirty patients underwent an operation before tPA administration. No patients experienced bleeding complications, anastomotic or appendiceal stump leak, or wound dehiscence after the administration of tPA, and no patients had abnormalities in coagulation studies related to tPA administration. One child died of sepsis.

Conclusions

Tissue plasminogen activator is safe for the management of thick or septated intra-abdominal abscesses in children. A prospective controlled study will be needed to evaluate the efficacy of this technique.

Adult suction and lavage versus suction alone — evidence summary: In adults, data from four RCTs from the systematic review were used to inform the panel's decision. Desirable effects included hospital length of stay, death, postoperative abscess, and readmission, with LOS 1.28 fewer days (95% CI 3.32 fewer to 0.76 more) based on two RCTs with 546 patients; death 8 fewer per 1,000 patients (95% CI 11 fewer to 62 more) based on one RCT with 286 patients; postoperative abscess 7 fewer per 1,000 patients (95% CI 55 fewer to 98 more) based on four RCTs with 713 patients; and readmission 12 fewer per 1,000 patients (95% CI 77 fewer to 150 more) based on two RCTs with 367 patients. Undesirable effects were postoperative drain placement 6 more per 1,000 patients (95% CI 24 fewer to 65 more) based on three RCTs with 453 patients and reoperation 21 more per 1,000 patients (95% CI 13 fewer to 117 more) based on three RCTs with 453 patients. The magnitude of these desirable effects was determined to be small and the magnitude of effect was deemed to be small by the panel. The certainty of the above evidence was evaluated as very low for adults and was primarily limited by high risk of bias and imprecision.

### Clinicoradiological improvement of intracranial tubercular abscess with medical management alone [^1113rVuq]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Tubercular abscess is a rare presentation of central nervous system tuberculosis (TB), which commonly presents as tuberculoma or meningitis. Most of the published cases of tubercular brain abscess have been dealt with by surgical treatment along with medical management. We here report a case of intracranial tubercular abscess in a 17-year-old girl presenting with fever, headache and right hemiparesis who showed significant clinicoradiological improvement with medical management alone. Thus, in a country like India where TB is highly endemic, TB should be considered as a possible aetiology for any intracranial lesion with radiological appearance suggestive of an abscess and surgical treatment can be kept as an option in case of neurological deficits, hydrocephalus or treatment failure.

### Serum trypsin is a reliable biomarker of pancreas function [^1127mBXG]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pancreatic diseases pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges necessitating robust biomarkers for accurate diagnosis, management, and monitoring of pancreas function. Pancreas function can be measured with direct (invasive) and indirect tests. However, neither approach allows for continuous disease monitoring to identify disease progression or therapeutic response. We demonstrate literature evidence suggesting that trypsin, an important pancreatic digestive enzyme, holds promise as a continuous biomarker. On one hand, assessment of trypsin concentration in the serum sensitively and specifically detects pancreas inflammation; whereas on the other hand, declining trypsin levels in serum show good correlation with direct pancreatic function tests to identify exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. With this comprehensive review, we aimed to evaluate the existing evidence on the utility of trypsin as a continuous biomarker, spanning from acute to chronic pancreatitis and pancreas function, highlighting its potential in monitoring disease evolution on an individual patient level.

### Trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen: potent anti-tumor agents [^115AdZSx]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen have been used clinically in tissue repair due to their ability to resolve inflammatory symptoms. Recently, novel evidence has supported the anti-tumourigenic potential of a mixture of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. Areas covered: First, we analyze the structure of these proteases and the effects of pancreatic proteinases on tissue repair, inflammation and the immune system. Second, we summarize studies that provided evidence of the effects of pancreatic (pro)enzymes on tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo and some successful clinical applications of pancreatic (pro)enzymes. Finally, we study pancreatic (pro)enzymes potential molecular targets, such as the proteinase-activated receptors (PARs). Expert opinion: This novel therapy has been shown to have effective antitumor effects. Treatment with these (pro) enzymes sensitizes Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) which may allow chemotherapy and radiotherapy to be more effective, which could positively affect the recovery of cancer patients.

Statistics and reproducibility

No statistical method was used to predetermine the sample size. For the murine infection model, the sample size was in line with our ethical allowance (IMIT01/20 G), binding us to the use of 5 mice per group with two abscesses per mouse. The allocation of mice to groups was randomised, but for other experiments, the experimental design does not require randomisation. For statistical analysis at least three biological replicates were used. The statistical tests used as well as the number of replicates for each experiment are indicated in the respective figure legends. No data were excluded from the analyses. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Grade of recommendation: weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C. In most cases, the initial management of RVFs, especially those of obstetric cause, is nonoperative and may include baths, wound care, debridement as needed, antibiotics in cases of infection, and stool-bulking fiber supplements for a period usually of 3 to 6 months, and a nonoperative approach under these circumstances may result in healing rates ranging from 52% to 66%; benign, minimally symptomatic RVFs unrelated to obstetrical injury may also be successfully managed with nonoperative therapy, although follow-up is limited.

### The clinical characteristics of focal acute pancreatitis based on imaging diagnosis: comparison with non-localized acute pancreatitis-a preliminary result [^111QKBmF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Focal pancreatitis(FP) is a special type of pancreatitis, which presenting as a local inflammatory mass of pancreas in imaging. FP is caused by various factors including gallstone diseases, alcohol, trauma, iatrogenic injury, autoimmune factors, tumors. FP can be clinically asymptomatic or present as acute or chronic pancreatitis. There have been lots of research on distinguishing of focal chronic pancreatitis, for it may mimic malignant tumors of the pancreas including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is one of the most common gastrointestinal condition, characterized by acute inflammatory reactions and cellular damage of pancreas as a result of inappropriate release and activation of trypsinogen to trypsin within the acini. The incidence of AP is (4.9–73.4) / 10 0,000 worldwide and has increased year by year, the overall mortality rate of AP is about 5%, which is associated with disease severity, it's higher when SAP with infection. However, considering timely and accurate diagnosis is particularly important for AP, little is known on focal AP. For differences in etiology composition, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests between focal AP and non-localized AP, as far as we know, there are no relevant reports.

Therefore, the present study aim to find differences between focal AP and non-localized AP, to assist clinicians detect and treat the disease in time.

### Saline vs tissue plasminogen activator irrigations after drain placement for appendicitis-associated abscess: a prospective randomized trial [^111j5MYS]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Emerging data suggest instillation of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is safe and potentially efficacious in the treatment of intra-abdominal abscess. To date, prospective comparative data are lacking in children. Therefore, we conducted a randomized trial comparing abscess irrigation with tPA and irrigation with saline alone.

Study Design

After IRB approval, children with an abscess secondary to perforated appendicitis who had a percutaneous drain placed for treatment were randomized to twice-daily instillation of 13 mL 10% tPA or 13 mL normal saline. All patients were treated with once-daily dosing of ceftriaxone and metronidazole throughout their course. The primary end point variable was duration of hospitalization after drain placement. Using a power of 0.8 and an α of 0.05, a sample size of 62 patients was calculated.

Results

Sixty-two patients were enrolled between January 2009 and February 2013. There were no differences in demographics, abscess size, abscess number, admission WBC, or duration of symptoms. Duration of hospitalization after drainage was considerably longer with the use of tPA. There was no difference in total duration of hospitalization, days of drainage, or days of antibiotics. However, medication charges were higher with tPA.

Conclusions

There are no advantages to routine tPA flushes in the treatment of abdominal abscess secondary to perforated appendicitis in children.

### Irrigation with fibrinolytic agents versus saline for percutaneous drainage of abdominal abscesses: a meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of randomized trials [^117TGYLb]. World Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fibrinolytic agents (FA) activate the fibrinolytic system, converting plasminogen into plasmin to break down fibrin. Their use for irrigation of abdominal abscesses is debated, and this meta-analysis evaluates their efficacy.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing FA and saline in percutaneous drainage of abdominal abscesses. Outcomes included length of hospitalization, duration of drainage, and drainage volume. We pooled mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model. We also performed a trial sequential analysis (TSA).

Results

We included six RCTs encompassing 299 patients. In the overall analysis, FA increased drainage volume (MD 104.25 mL; 95% CI 35.72–172.77 mL; p = 0.003; I² = 0%). In children, saline reduced hospitalization duration (MD -1.26 days; 95% CI -1.98 to -0.55 days; p = 0.0006; I² = 0%), whereas FA increased drainage volume (MD 84.66 mL; 95% CI 5.77–153.54 mL; p = 0.04; I² = 0%). In adults, FA significantly reduced hospitalization duration (MD -11.12 days; 95% CI -15.16 to -7.08 days; p < 0.00001; I² = 0%) and duration of drainage (MD -6.53 days; 95% CI -9.25 to -3.81 days; p < 0.00001; I² = 0%) while increasing drainage volume (MD 164.47 mL; 95% CI 26.16–302.78 mL; p = 0.02; I² = 0%). On TSA, the required information size was achieved only for the adult subgroup's hospitalization and drainage duration.

Conclusion

In adults, FA reduce hospitalization and drainage duration and increase drainage volume. In children, saline seems more effective in reducing hospitalization duration, while FA increase drainage volume. These findings underscore the need for age-specific treatments and further research, especially in the pediatric population.

The authors reviewed the basic facts about infections that complicate chemotherapy, and found that a difference exists between those that are medically treated, for which several standard protocols have been adopted, and infections amenable to surgical treatment, such as spinal epidural abscess, which are managed according to the experience at individual institutions. The authors believe that patients with leukemia who manifest a spinal epidural abscess should always be surgically treated when the infection occurs between the induction and remission phases, whereas medical treatment options can be considered for spinal epidural abscesses occurring at the end of the chemotherapy course.

### A randomized clinical trial of peritonsillar abscess treatment comparing drainage and tonsillectomy [^114yNy6f]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerance of drainage under local anesthesia compared to immediate tonsillectomy to treat uncomplicated unilateral peritonsillar abscess (PTA) in adults.

Methods

A randomized clinical trial was conducted in a tertiary care university hospital. Adults with PTA radiologically confirmed as ≥ 1 cm and uncomplicated were randomly assigned to two groups using block randomization. They immediately underwent either tonsillectomy under general anesthesia or drainage under local anesthesia. The primary outcome was treatment success at 48 h, defined as a reduction in swelling and restoration of swallowing function, allowing hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included pain and anxiety levels, along with postoperative bleeding.

Results

A total of 41 patients were included (66% male; age range 18–77 years). Twenty-one patients underwent tonsillectomy, while 20 underwent drainage. The success rate was higher in the tonsillectomy group (100%) than in the drainage group (75%, p = 0.02). Pain and anxiety levels were significantly higher in the drainage group (p < 0.01). Postoperative bleeding occurred in 33% of the tonsillectomy group, while no bleeding was reported in the drainage group (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Immediate tonsillectomy for treating PTA offers definitive management with high efficacy, albeit with an increased risk of postoperative bleeding. Drainage under local anesthesia is associated with a higher failure rate and increased patient discomfort but demonstrates a better safety profile. Treatment decisions should be tailored based on patient preferences, clinical presentation, and available resources.

### Childhood pancreatitis | AAFP… [^115iPGAz]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The child was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous fluids. Nasogastric suction was required to manage persistent vomiting. An abdominal sonogram the next day suggested pancreatic calcifications, and biliary sludge was noted in the gallbladder. Recurrent episodes of vomiting after the abdominal tenderness had resolved were attributed to gastroparesis and responded to therapy with oral cisapride. Outpatient endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed about one month later and showed changes consistent with chronic pancreatitis. Small biliary stones were seen in the bile drainage. The patient underwent an uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy but had another episode of pancreatitis one month later. Genetic testing for the R117H mutation of the trypsinogen gene was reported as heterozygously positive.

In a study of 30 families with hereditary pancreatitis, 2 it was reported that most of the subjects had a mutant form of trypsinogen in which the activated trypsin was less capable of being autodigested. This mutation is estimated to account for 85 percent of trypsinogen mutations that cause hereditary pancreatitis. Other inherited anatomic or biochemical abnormalities, such as pancreas divisum, have also been associated with hereditary pancreatitis. The normal anatomy of the pancreas is illustrated in Figure 3. The serum amylase concentration is often, but not invariably, elevated. The value frequently becomes normal after two to five days. Urinary lipase levels may remain elevated for a few days longer than serum levels. The serum lipase level is also usually elevated, but the degree of elevation has little correlation with the extent of the pancreatitis. Levels of cationic trypsin are said to be a more sensitive early marker of pancreatic inflammation.

Pseudocysts, which most often occur in trauma patients, develop two to three weeks after the acute episode. In children, they generally resolve spontaneously. Pancreatic phlegmon or abscess is rare in children but may require late drainage procedures. Recurrent episodes of pancreatitis can lead to a chronic disease state. Chronic pancreatitis is a recognized risk factor for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In a recent cohort study of 246 patients. 15 the estimated cumulative risk of pancreatic cancer in patients up to age 70 with chronic pancreatitis was about 40 percent.

### Comparing trypsin-chymotrypsin and naproxen sodium… [^1144RGkb]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Overview i. Background Prevention or management of pain, especially after root canal treatment, is of utmost importance to Endodontists. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been the most commonly used pain reduction modality in cases of irreversible pulpitis, but they do come with certain demerits. A lot of other alternatives have been researched as better alternatives for NSAIDs. Trypsin- Chymotrypsin has been proven to be an effective pain reducer after endodontic therapy. ii. Objective The objective of this study is to compare the pain reduction efficacy of Trypsin- Chymotrypsin and Naproxen sodium after root canal treatment. iii. Methodology In this triple-blinded, parallel, randomized controlled trial, a total of 100 patients will be included who are coming to the Operative Dentistry department for root canal treatment for any tooth. The patient must have a history of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis.

The patients will be randomly allocated into two groups. One group will be the Naproxen sodium group. The root canal treatment will be performed as usual. The first group will receive Trypsin- Chymotrypsin 1: 100000 and the second group will receive Naproxen Sodium 550mg in sealed envelopes. The intensity of post-operative pain will be evaluated using a numerical rating scale at 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hour intervals. Participation Criteria For general information about clinical research, read Learn About Studies. Inclusion Criteria:

- Both male and female, healthy patients.
- Patients between the age group of 18–45 years.
- Patients who are appointed for endodontic treatment.
- Maxillary or mandibular teeth diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis based on delayed responses to vitality tests. Exclusion Criteria:

- Patients who will require emergency dental treatment.
- Teeth with any form of peri-apical lesion will be excluded.
- Patient who have taken analgesics within 24 hours prior to the treatment.
- Patients with known hypersensitivity or allergy to any of the study medications.
