## Question

16 y/o with pneumonia with hemolytic anemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing a 16-year-old with pneumonia and hemolytic anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and transfusion thresholds. Then, I should verify the hemolysis workup and how to interpret it. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis for hemolysis in the context of pneumonia, including immune-mediated, microangiopathic, and oxidative causes. After that, I need to check for infection-specific triggers and outline targeted therapy. Finally, I will integrate sickle cell disease considerations, monitoring, and follow-up plans, making sure each step is supported by guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first hour: airway, breathing, circulation, and oxygenation, because hypoxemia accelerates hemolysis and vaso-occlusion in susceptible patients, and I should not delay resuscitation while waiting for labs. I need to ensure a large-bore IV, continuous pulse oximetry, and early consideration of ICU transfer if there is respiratory failure, hemodynamic instability, or rapid clinical deterioration, as anemia and pneumonia together increase the risk of decompensation in adolescents [^67a14840] [^fe5e6e4f].

> Wait, let me verify transfusion thresholds before I jump ahead. In adolescents with acute hemolysis and pneumonia, I should transfuse if hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL, or if there are signs of cardiac decompensation, ongoing ischemia, or hypoxemia that cannot be corrected with oxygen. I should also remember that in cold agglutinin disease, transfusion must be done with warm, washed RBCs to avoid exacerbating agglutination, and I should keep the patient warm throughout care [^b8cc4206] [^3448dbd2].

> Next, I should review the hemolysis workup and make sure I order the right tests up front. I will request CBC with reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, and a direct antiglobulin test with monospecific typing for IgG and C3d. I also need to check for schistocytes to distinguish microangiopathic hemolysis from immune or oxidative causes, and I should consider G6PD testing if there is a suggestive history or medication exposure, keeping in mind that G6PD assays can be falsely normal during active hemolysis or after transfusion, so timing matters [^1d3c44d2] [^58b8fbba] [^9b6a25d3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology until I correlate the labs with the clinical picture. Immune hemolysis typically shows a positive DAT with reticulocytosis, elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia, whereas microangiopathic hemolysis features schistocytes with thrombocytopenia and often organ injury, and oxidative hemolysis may show bite cells or blister cells with a negative DAT and evidence of oxidative stress or drug exposure. I should double-check the smear myself and repeat the DAT if the clinical picture strongly suggests immune hemolysis but the initial DAT is negative, as DAT-negative AIHA exists and requires careful exclusion of nonimmune causes [^1d3c44d2] [^58b8fbba].

> I will now examine infection-specific triggers, starting with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which is a classic cause of cold agglutinin syndrome in adolescents and can precipitate severe hemolysis. I should send Mycoplasma IgM and IgG, and consider PCR if available, while remembering that serology may be negative early and that paired titers improve diagnostic yield. If Mycoplasma is confirmed or strongly suspected, I should add a macrolide or doxycycline to standard pneumonia coverage and maintain strict warming measures to mitigate cold agglutinin–mediated hemolysis [^7d12a194] [^3448dbd2] [^72447240].

> But wait, what if the hemolysis is warm rather than cold. COVID-19 and other viral pneumonias can trigger warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, so I should test for SARS-CoV-2 and consider other respiratory viruses, and if warm AIHA is confirmed, I should initiate corticosteroids and consider IVIG in severe cases, while avoiding transfusion unless absolutely necessary due to risks of exacerbating hemolysis. I need to ensure close monitoring for rebound hemolysis and taper steroids slowly if effective [^0fbbc03f] [^a25542c5] [^b8cc4206].

> I should also consider Streptococcus pneumoniae–associated hemolytic uremic syndrome, especially if there is thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury alongside MAHA. In that scenario, I need to check for T-antigen exposure using minor cross-matching or lectin testing and, if positive, use washed RBCs and platelets to avoid worsening TMA, while providing supportive care and avoiding plasma exchange unless the diagnosis is uncertain or atypical HUS is suspected. I should confirm pneumococcal infection with cultures or antigen testing when possible [^bb777c46] [^f45bd50b] [^437bab2e].

> Let me think about oxidative hemolysis and G6PD deficiency. I should ask about fava beans, sulfa drugs, dapsone, primaquine, rasburicase, and other oxidants, and if G6PD deficiency is suspected, I should avoid oxidative drugs and transfuse supportively. I need to remember that G6PD testing during hemolysis or after transfusion can be falsely normal, so a negative result does not exclude deficiency in the acute setting, and I should counsel on avoidance of triggers going forward [^cd148728] [^9b6a25d3].

> Next, I should review sickle cell disease considerations because this patient is 16 years old and could have undiagnosed SCD or sickle cell trait. I need to check a hemoglobin electrophoresis if not already done, assess for a history of pain crises, jaundice, or splenic dysfunction, and remember that pneumonia can precipitate acute chest syndrome with severe hemolysis and hypoxemia. Management includes oxygen to maintain SpO2 above 92%, aggressive hydration, analgesia, and early transfusion to a hemoglobin around 10 g/dL to reduce sickling, along with broad-spectrum antibiotics including a macrolide for atypicals and close monitoring for respiratory deterioration [^0ab5234e] [^18cbf9c0] [^1530a261].

> I should confirm that I am not missing TTP or DIC masquerading as infection plus hemolysis. If there is thrombocytopenia, neurologic symptoms, or renal injury with schistocytes, I need to check ADAMTS13 activity and initiate urgent plasma exchange for TTP, whereas DIC will show prolonged PT/PTT, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer and requires treatment of the underlying cause rather than plasma exchange. Differentiating these entities prevents harmful interventions like early platelet transfusion in TTP [^cd148728] [^67a14840].

> Let me reconsider the broader differential so I do not anchor prematurely. Other causes of hemolysis in adolescents include hereditary spherocytosis or other membranopathies, enzymopathies like G6PD or pyruvate kinase deficiency, unstable hemoglobinopathies, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, so if the DAT is negative and there is no evidence of TMA or oxidative injury, I should pivot to hemolysis-specific testing such as osmotic fragility, enzyme assays, or flow cytometry for CD55/CD59 as indicated by the smear and clinical context [^1d3c44d2] [^58b8fbba].

> I need to ensure supportive care is optimized while the definitive workup proceeds. That means strict fever control, adequate analgesia, bronchodilators for wheeze, incentive spirometry to prevent atelectasis, and DVT prophylaxis if hemolysis is severe or the patient is immobilized. I should monitor hemoglobin, LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin, and reticulocyte count daily initially, then space out as the patient stabilizes, and I should watch for transfusion reactions, especially in patients with alloimmunization risk or multiple transfusions [^67a14840].

> Hold on, I should verify discharge planning and follow-up. Before discharge, I will confirm hemolysis is resolving, anemia is stable, and the pneumonia is improving clinically and radiographically if films were obtained. I will arrange close hematology and infectious diseases follow-up, reinforce medication adherence including steroids if prescribed with a clear taper plan, and provide sickle cell education and penicillin prophylaxis if SCD is diagnosed. I will also counsel on warning signs of recurrence, including dark urine, jaundice, dyspnea, or fever, and ensure vaccination status is updated, particularly for pneumococcus and influenza, given the elevated infection risk in hemolytic patients [^0ab5234e] [^18cbf9c0].

In a 16-year-old with pneumonia and hemolytic anemia, the most likely cause is **Mycoplasma pneumoniae** [^7d12a194] triggering cold agglutinin hemolysis [^72447240], but you must also consider **autoimmune hemolysis** [^0fbbc03f] from other infections (e.g. COVID-19, EBV) [^9a6cfbf9], **oxidative hemolysis** from G6PD deficiency or drugs [^cd148728], and **microangiopathic hemolysis** from TTP/HUS or DIC [^cd148728]. Immediate priorities are to **stabilize the patient** with oxygen, fluids, and transfusion if indicated [^67a14840], then **confirm hemolysis** with CBC, reticulocytes, LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin, and DAT [^1d3c44d2], and **identify the cause** with Mycoplasma serology/PCR, COVID-19 testing, G6PD assay, and a peripheral smear for schistocytes [^58b8fbba]. Treat the pneumonia and hemolysis concurrently: macrolide or doxycycline for Mycoplasma [^7d12a194], corticosteroids for warm AIHA [^a25542c5], and supportive care; avoid cold exposure and use warmed blood if transfusing in cold agglutinin disease [^3448dbd2]. Monitor closely for renal failure, thrombosis, and respiratory compromise, and escalate care if TTP/HUS or DIC is suspected [^cd148728].

---

### Specific therapies

- **Mycoplasma pneumoniae**: Macrolide (azithromycin) or doxycycline [^7d12a194].
- **Warm AIHA**: Corticosteroids (prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day) [^a25542c5]; IVIG if severe or refractory [^a25542c5].
- **Cold agglutinin disease**: Avoid cold exposure; rituximab for refractory cases [^notfound].
- **TTP/HUS**: Urgent plasma exchange; eculizumab for atypical HUS [^32ed896f].
- **DIC**: Treat underlying cause; supportive transfusion [^notfound].

---

### Monitoring and complications

- **Renal function**: Monitor for AKI, especially in HUS/TTP [^437bab2e].
- **Thrombosis**: Watch for PE/DVT [^notfound].
- **Respiratory status**: Monitor for ARDS/acute chest syndrome [^1530a261].
- **Neurologic status**: Monitor for PRES, seizures, encephalopathy [^00234f54].

---

## Prognosis and follow-up

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause**, severity of hemolysis, and timeliness of intervention. Most patients recover with appropriate therapy, but some may develop chronic hemolysis or renal impairment. Follow-up should include hematology review, renal function monitoring, and vaccination updates [^0ab5234e].

---

In a 16-year-old with pneumonia and hemolytic anemia, prioritize **stabilization**, confirm hemolysis, and identify the cause to guide targeted therapy. Mycoplasma-associated cold agglutinin disease is common, but immune, oxidative, and microangiopathic etiologies must be considered. Early, coordinated management improves outcomes.

### Fatal 1918 pneumonia case complicated by erythrocyte sickling [^f177fa3f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Sickle cell trait has been occasionally associated with debilitating illness and death. Pulmonary complications associated with sickle cell trait include venous thromboembolic disease, sickle chest syndrome, and pulmonary infarction, which recently prompted US college officials to screen athletes for sickle cell trait. We speculate that the clinical severity and rapid development of acute bacterial pneumonia in the patient reported here led to profound terminal hypoxemia, which led in turn to erythrocyte sickling. The postmortem gross evidence of necrotic areas in the lung and spleen and hemorrhages in the kidneys is clearly consistent with sickled erythrocytes causing vascular congestion and infarction, thus contributing to the patient's death.

### Pitfalls in the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis [^bfe87b20]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis is a very rare but devastating disorder. Diagnosis is sometimes difficult and the clinical course exceedingly variable, as illustrated by this report of a girl, aged 2 years 4 months, with severe iron deficiency anaemia. There was no response to iron therapy and transfusions. Sustained and striking reticulocytosis associated with low haptoglobin mimicked haemolytic anaemia. Positive faecal blood test was documented after repeated testing. There were no pulmonary symptoms. A chest radiograph showed bilateral diffuse alveolar infiltrates. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed numerous siderophages. High resolution computed tomography of the thorax revealed early pulmonary fibrotic changes. Recurrent reticulocytosis appeared to be a very useful sign of recurrent bleeding episodes.

### Case report: COVID associated pancytopenia unmasking previously undiagnosed pernicious anemia [^c5a354ee]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated pancytopenia is a known but rare complication of COVID-19 syndrome that is not well described in literature. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has shown the potential to affect any organ including the bone marrow, which then results in a decrease in all three blood cell lines. These cases usually resolve with the passage of time and treatment of underlying risk factors. As COVID pneumonia rates continue to increase worldwide, it is crucial to be able to recognize this complication. Additionally, deeper investigation into patient's response to COVID infection can be complicated by unexpected underlying disease. We report a case of a symptomatic 24-year-old active duty male in Hawaii with post-COVID pancytopenia that was found to have previously undiagnosed pernicious anemia and his response to standard treatment.

### The definition of pneumonia, the assessment of severity, and clinical standardization in the pneumonia etiology research for child health study [^fe5e6e4f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

EVALUATING THE SEVERITY OF PNEUMONIA

In a multisite study of etiology, geography is a key variable of interest. After accounting for variation in major risk factors, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection or sickle cell anemia, are there region-specific differences in etiological agents that provide additional clues about the epidemiology of the disease? One of the strongest confounders for this analysis is disease severity on admission, which may vary as a function of either hospital practice or health-seeking behavior. If one study site recruits less severe cases of pneumonia and another recruits only those in extremis, then the etiologic differences are likely to be due to the admission policy rather than to geographic location. To control for this, we aimed to define an index of clinical severity. The WHO clinical case definition provides only 2 grades — severe pneumonia and very severe pneumonia — and although these are associated with clinical outcome, they provide a relatively coarse classification to control for a potential confounder. We considered several approaches to provide a finer grading.

The most efficient approach is to use an existing standard such as the British Thoracic Society guidelines, which classify children as having mild or severe pneumonia but also provide criteria for admission to hospital and for transfer to the intensive care unit. Most of the features used to differentiate the strata are shared with the WHO clinical case classification. A finer differentiation would require considerably more clinical and laboratory data, but the published literature does not provide guidance on the optimal utility of such data.

A second approach is to focus on a single relevant parameter of clinical physiology, the oxygen saturation of the blood. Pulse oximeters are readily available and widely used in developing countries. Hypoxemia has been extensively studied and is associated with a 2- to 5-fold increase in mortality. However, a pulse oximeter may underestimate arterial oxygen saturation if it is incorrectly placed or if the patient has poor peripheral perfusion. In addition, whereas mortality in many cases of pneumonia is driven by poor oxygen exchange, it is not the only mechanism that can lead to death. Oxygen saturation will not accurately capture the degree of mortality risk among pneumonia cases that are threatened by, for example, septic shock, renal failure, or severe anemia.

### Case report: COVID associated pancytopenia unmasking previously undiagnosed pernicious anemia [^9d54c431]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

COVID-19 syndrome is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Generally, those affected with COVID-19 manifest with respiratory pathology, especially the classic bilateral multifocal pneumonia; less commonly, however, the infection affects the bone marrow, hindering the hematopoietic system. This may lead to lymphopenia, neutropenia, and rarely pancytopenia. The first case of persistent pancytopenia associated with SARS-CoV-2 bone marrow infiltration in an immunocompromised patient was described in October 2020, and subsequently other reports emerged.

Our purpose is to present clinical findings of a rare case of an immunocompetent young individual with COVID-19-associated pancytopenia with masked pernicious anemia. Although our case shares some similarities with cases reported previously, there are also differences that merit consideration.

### Hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with Coxiella burnetii infection [^ed860c1f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Acute Q fever most commonly manifests as a self-limited febrile illness, pneumonia or hepatitis. We report the case of a 12-year-old child with documented exposure to sources of Coxiella burnetii who was admitted to our hospital because of hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Serologic tests established the diagnosis of acute Q fever.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy associated withinfection [^23b94d90]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) comprises a process of sequential endothelial damage, microvascular thrombosis, consumptive thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia that can affect several organs, including the kidney. A 36-year-old woman was presented with a petechial rash 3weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection. Laboratory results showed normocytic normochromic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and evidence of TMA with decreased haptoglobin, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and a peripheral blood smear with numerous schistocytes. Treatment included daily plasmapheresis and prednisolone, with favourable clinical evolution. Antibodies anti-ADAMTS13 were positive, establishing the diagnosis of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. There was also serological evidence of a recent infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and therefore the preceding respiratory tract infection by this agent was the most likely trigger for the disease. Due to the high mortality rate and poor outcomes, the prompt diagnostic and treatment are crucial in this rare disease. The identification of triggers related to this pathology can allow new therapeutic targets or preventive strategies.

### The prevalence of anemia and its association with 90-day mortality in hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia [^5d427f43]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Previous large inpatient CAP cohort studies defined anemia as a hemoglobin of < 10 g/dL or hematocrit < 30%, yielding a prevalence of anemia on presentation of 7–12%, proportions which are consistent with our own. Our study is unique, in that we were able to describe not only the prevalence of anemia on presentation, but its development over time and its persistence at the time of hospital discharge. Furthermore, rather than focusing on arbitrary cutoffs, we explored the full spectrum of anemia severity across important subgroups, and in doing so, can better understand the prevalence and significance of anemia in hospitalized CAP and the independent contribution of patient and illness characteristics to its development.

Why was anemia so common in hospitalized CAP, even among those without obvious risk factors? The day 1 prevalence speaks to the significant systemic derangement that likely has already occurred in CAP patients at the time of presentation, long before repeated blood draws or the dilutional effects of intravenous fluids could explain low hemoglobin levels. The precipitous decline in hemoglobin values that occurred over the first few days of hospitalization is consistent with that seen in the ICU, where hemoglobin values may decline by > 0.5 g/dL/day in non-bleeding patients. These changes are believed to be due not only to dilutional effects of fluids and frequent blood draws, but also to other sources of blood loss (gastric stress bleeding, surgical procedures), effects of inflammatory cytokines, inadequate red cell production, and excessive red cell destruction. Unfortunately, the nature of the data collected in our study precluded us from identifying which of these factors were at work in any given patient. Certain infections, such as Mycoplasma pneumonia, are associated with anemia. Very few subjects in our study had positive blood or sputum cultures and cultures were not universally drawn, which is typical for observational studies of CAP. Consequently, we could not reliably determine whether the prevalence or severity of anemia varied by presence of bacteremia or by type of infecting organism.

### Antibiotics for treating community acquired pneumonia in people with sickle cell disease [^596eebb6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

As a consequence of their condition, people with sickle cell disease are at high risk of developing an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma called community-acquired pneumonia. Many different bacteria can cause this infection and antibiotic treatment is generally needed to resolve it. There is no standardized approach to antibiotic therapy and treatment is likely to vary from country to country. Thus, there is a need to identify the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from community-acquired pneumonia.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of the antibiotic treatment approaches (monotherapy or combined) for people with sickle cell disease suffering from community-acquired pneumonia.

Search Methods

We searched The Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (25 May 2012), which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched LILACS (1982 to 27 April 2012), African Index Medicus (1982 to 27 April 2012) and WHO ICT Registry (27 April 2012).

Selection Criteria

We searched for published or unpublished randomized controlled trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We intended to summarise data by standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies, but no eligible randomized controlled trials were identified.

Main Results

We were unable to find any randomized controlled trials on antibiotic treatment approaches for community-acquired pneumonia in people with sickle cell disease.

Authors' Conclusions

The updated review was unable to identify randomized controlled trials on efficacy and safety of the antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from community-acquired pneumonia. Randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the optimum antibiotic treatment for this condition. The trials regarding this issue should be structured and reported according to the CONSORT statement for improving the quality of reporting of efficacy and improved reports of harms in clinical research. Triallists should consider including the following outcomes in new trials: number of days to become afebrile; mortality; onset of pain crisis or complications of SCD following CAP; diagnosis; hospitalisation (admission rate and length of hospital stay); respiratory failure rate; and number of participants receiving a blood transfusion. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to May 2012. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published.

### Contributions of polyclonal malaria, gametocytemia, and pneumonia to infant severe anemia incidence in malaria hyperendemic pemba, tanzania [^2e22a780]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

The causative factors for severe anemia incidence in sub-Saharan Africa are multifactorial. In an observational, longitudinal study of two cohorts of about 300 infants followed-up for six months in a malaria hyperendemic area, the risk factors for severe anemia incidence were clinical malaria and pneumonia, which outweighed nutritional and sociodemographic factors. Severe anemia incidence was 1–2/year at age 2 months, peaked around 6–7/year at age 7–12 months, and decreased back to 1–2/year at age 16–22 months. The age-dependent increase of severe anemia incidence was shown to be parallel to the age-dependent increase of clinical malaria. Previous clinical malaria episodes increased the severe anemia risk by 80%, and gametocyte carriage and pneumonia at prior visit was associated with a six-fold increase and a > 10-fold increase, respectively. The role of pneumonia and malaria as risk factors, and areas for interventions for severe anemia, should not be underestimated.

There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to September 2016. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published.

### Fatal 1918 pneumonia case complicated by erythrocyte sickling [^e39f01d5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

To the Editor: The year 2010 marks the 100th anniversary of Herrick's original case description of what is now known as sickle cell anemia. Additional case reports followed in 1911 and 1915; in 1922, Mason described a fourth case and coined the term sickle cell anemia. In 1949, Pauling et al. published an important study that identified differences in the electrophoretic mobilities of normal and sickled erythrocytes. The inheritance pattern of sickle cell anemia was determined in 1949; in 1957, Ingram identified the single amino acid change in hemoglobin S.

Patients with sickle cell anemia are at markedly increased risk for infections with several bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, and emerging viral infections such as pandemic influenza. We report a retrospectively identified case of fatal bacterial pneumonia complicated by abundant erythrocyte sickling in a patient bearing the sickle cell trait. The patient's illness occurred in July 1918, representing one of the first identified symptomatic cases of sickle cell trait.

The patient, a 21-year-old African American male, was a US Army private admitted to the post hospital in Fort Riley (Camp Funston), Kansas, USA, on July 11, 1918, > 1 month before the first recognized cases of the fall wave of the influenza pandemic in the United States. The patient had a 2-day history of fever, headache, chest pain, and a dry, hacking, nonproductive cough. Medical history consisted only of frequent headaches. Admission temperature was 105.4°F. Physical examination found indistinct breath sounds over the entire right lung. Lobar pneumonia was diagnosed in the patient. On July 15, his leukocyte count was 7,600 cells/mm 3, and physical examination found crepitant rales over the right lung and tubular breathing over the right upper lobe. On July 19, his condition was grave. Probably because most US military camps had experienced epidemics of measles with fatal streptococcal pneumonia during winter 1917–spring 1918, he was given 100 mL anti-streptococcus antiserum intravenously. He died July 20.

### When pneumococcal infection leads to maltreatment concerns [^bb777c46]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a rare but severe condition in children characterized by a classic triad of acute hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. While this condition is mainly associated with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), the association with Streptococcus pneumonia accounts for 5% of all childhood HUS. The majority of patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae- associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (Sp-HUS) present with pneumonia with or without pleural effusion (72% of patients), and meningitis accounts for most of the remaining cases (29%). Compared with the typical form, patients with Sp-HUS have a more severely acute course of renal, hematologic, and neurologic diseases and higher mortality (between 2% and 12%).

While the pathomechanisms of Shiga toxin-mediated microangiopathy in patients with STEC-related HUS are well described, those involving Sp-HUS remain to be clarified. In the absence of the more common initial clinical presentations of Sp-HUS, mainly pneumonia and meningitis, we hypothesized that traumatic injuries were contributory to the development of the disease in our patient. Recent cohort studies indicated that Sp-HUS tends to develop in patients with loculated infected fluid collections such as parapneumonic empyema and subdural hematoma. Our patient's hemothorax and pulmonary contusions could have led to a significant bacterial load, one of the main physiopathology hypotheses for Sp-HUS. Moreover, the visceral injuries could have been a contributing factor to the disease, as the blunt trauma to the abdomen might have caused direct endothelial cell lesions in the microvasculature of the kidney, a common feature of all forms of hemolytic uremic syndrome. - These arguments support our assumption that significant traumatic injuries might have created a favorable environment for S. pneumoniae to proliferate and that direct endothelial cell damage to the kidneys and liver may have facilitated the onset of HUS within the context of circulating S. pneumoniae.

### Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia following recurrent Mycoplasma pneumonia infections in a child with down syndrome [^dce4235f]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) is mainly associated with cold agglutinin syndrome, whereas both cold IgM and warm IgG autoantibodies have been identified in only two cases in the literature. The authors present an 8-year-old boy with Down syndrome, who suffered from recurrent episodes of MP infection, followed by episodes of hemolytic anemia with normal titer of cold agglutinins. The first 6 episodes were sequenced by nonimmune hemolytic anemia, whereas the latter 7 episodes were followed by episodes of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. This is believed to be the first described case of hemolytic anemia with warm IgG autoantibodies, following MP infection.

### Identification of a new CD46 gene mutation site in a family with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [^4863dcb8]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The patient is a 27-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital on March 24, 2022, owing to "diagnosed aHUS for 16 years, abdominal pain for 2 days, and brown urine for 2 hours". A timeline of the patient's medical history is shown in Fig. 1.

The patient first presented to Shanghai Children's Hospital affiliated with Fudan University on March 6, 2006, due to fever accompanied by cough, sputum production, jaundice, and gross hematuria. Laboratory tests indicated renal function abnormalities, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. He was diagnosed with "aHUS and bronchopneumonia". Treatment included antibiotics such as cefotaxime and penicillin, plasma transfusions and urine alkalinization. The patient's renal function, hemoglobin levels, and platelet counts returned to normal, and he was discharged. The patient returned to Fudan University Children's Hospital on four occasions (October 28, 2006; February 10, 2012; June 24, 2015; and June 6, 2018) due to fever, cough, sputum production, and gross hematuria, with all cases considered aHUS triggered by acute upper respiratory infections. For the episodes in February 2012 and June 2015, the patient underwent plasmapheresis, along with anti-infective and symptomatic supportive therapy. For the other two episodes, the patient received plasma transfusions, anti-infective treatment, and supportive therapy. All four episodes ultimately fully resolved, and renal function and complete blood count tests remained normal at follow-up visits between episodes. Two days prior to this latest admission, the patient experienced upper abdominal pain without any obvious trigger, accompanied by nausea and dry heaving, with no diarrhea or melena. The pain gradually worsened, and two hours before admission, the patient developed tea-colored urine along with lumbar pain, leading to a visit to our hospital's emergency department. The examination results were as follows: urinalysis (2022-03-24, Emergency): urine protein 2+, urine occult blood 3+; blood amylase, 866 U/L; urine amylase, 1831 U/L; blood creatinine, 281.4 µmol/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 2454.4 U/L; schistocytes, 10%; and complete blood count: white blood cell count, 11.79 × 10 9 /L; neutrophil percentage, 80.8%; hemoglobin, 142 g/L; and platelet count, 78 × 10 9 /L. On the basis of these findings, aHUS was suspected, and the patient was admitted to the nephrology ward. The patient's medical history included hypertension for 3 years and a history of plasma and red blood cell transfusions. The patient's family history was as follows: his parents were affected by blood (cousins), and the patient's grandmother, mother, and cousin had a history of anemia with specific causes unknown. No other obvious familial or hereditary diseases were noted. The physical examination results were as follows: temperature, 36.5 °C; pulse, 74 beats/min; respiration, 19 breaths/min; blood pressure, 124/80 mmHg; and weight, 90 kg. The patient was alert and in good spirits. Heart, lung, and abdominal examinations were normal, and there was no swelling in the lower limbs. Pathological signs were negative. Key laboratory abnormalities upon admission are summarized in Table 1. Additional investigations, including antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM), serum glucose, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium), coagulation profile, and serological markers for hepatitis and HIV, as well as an electrocardiogram and chest computed tomography, yielded unremarkable results.

Table 1.
Samples Analyzed, Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Results, Clinical Details, and Treatment Details

During the prolonged hospitalization, serial blood and urine cultures were negative. Serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Toxoplasma gondii IgM, Coxiella burnetii, Brucella abortus, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Tropheryma whipplei, Histoplasma capsulatum, Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Francisella tularensis were all negative. Serological tests for Chlamydophila psittaci (concentration, 1:128) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (concentration, 1:1500) were positive but remained unchanged on repeat sampling and were assumed to represent previous Chlamydophila infection. In particular, Bartonella henselae, Bartonella quintana, Bartonella genus-specific PCR, Mycoplasma pneumonia e serology, and mycoplasma agglutination tests were all negative.

Immune causes of the neutropenia in the years preceding presentation were considered. There were fluctuating titers of ANA levels (1:80–1:160), but the anti–ds DNA tests were consistently negative from 4 years prior to presentation and throughout the current febrile illness. Although the patient was neutropenic on initial presentation, during her hospital stay, her WBC count increased to within the reference range and, on occasions, above the reference range (as did the neutrophil count) until discharge. During and after treatment for hemoplasma infection, the WBC and neutrophil counts decreased to levels seen before infection.

### Infections in sickle cell disease [^18cbf9c0]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma spp.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a small bacterium, lacking a cell wall, which is a common respiratory pathogen in all populations, accounting for 10–40% of all cases of community-acquired pneumonia. In SCD, a serological diagnosis of mycoplasma infection is found in approximately 9% of all cases of ACS, and 12% of ACS cases occurring in children under 5 years old. Case reports suggest that mycoplasma may cause a particularly severe form of ACS, with prolonged fever lasting more than 7 days, pleuritic pain and pleural effusions. M. pneumoniae accounts for most mycoplasma infections in ACS, although M. hominis and M. tuberculosis also occur. Mycoplasma infections do not respond to penicillin-based antibiotics and treatment with a macrolide is necessary.

Treatment of respiratory bacterial infections in sickle cell disease

Respiratory bacterial infections are a serious threat to patients with SCD, both because of their reduced immunity and because of the potential of respiratory complications to cause hypoxia and exacerbate hemolysis and vaso-occlusion, with rapid clinical deterioration. Treatment and investigation require multidisciplinary management, including the involvement of microbiology, critical care and respiratory medicine colleagues. The management of ACS includes the routine use of parenteral antibiotics, typically including a broad-spectrum penicillin or cephalosporin, with a macrolide to cover atypical organisms.

Routine immunization remains one of the most effective defense strategies against respiratory bacterial infections in SCD, as part of the childhood immunization schedule (Table 1). Vaccine uptake however, has been reported to vary widely geographically (46–95%)and further work is needed to ascertain response to vaccines in SCD. Hydroxycarbamide therapy has been shown to reduce episodes of ACS and infective complications in SCD and to inhibit progression of pneumococcal disease in a murine model. Penicillin prophylaxis (or erythromycin in patients allergic to penicillin) protects against pneumococcal infection, although the duration of prophylaxis varies between countries. The impact of education and infection prevention and control measures are likely to be important, particularly in low-resource settings.

### Multiple anatomic sites of infarction in a pediatric patient with M. pneumoniae infection, a case report [^e752751b]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The authors admit there are limitations to the confirmation of diagnosis of M. pneumoniae in this case. Many studies have compared different kits available and assay methods used for the diagnosis of M. pneumonia. It is recommended that paired specific IgM and IgG serologic tests two to 4 weeks apart are needed to confirm M. pneumoniae. This facility utilized an EIA assay method by GenBio for the serologic evaluation of M. pneumoniae using IgM and IgG levels, and in the case presented here a single evaluation of IgM and IgG levels was performed. Both IgM and IgG were high in this case, however the PCR was negative for M. pneumoniae. In most studies comparing assay methods from the different kits available, the serology is more likely to be negative early in the disease process, and shows high levels of IgM and IgG 2–4 weeks into the infection course. Since this patient had been ill for 2 weeks prior to IgM and IgG levels being drawn, it is likely that these levels reflect current infection with M. pneumoniae. However, it is possible that the positive results in this case are reflective of previous infection, as immunity and positive testing may last as long as 1–4 years after infection. The patient presented here had no antiphospholipid antibodies, and had very weakly positive anti-nuclear antibodies. The significance of this is not clear. Complement testing showed no abnormalities, except for the decrease in C4 (see Table 1 below). Furthermore, while red cell agglutination was demonstrated and the presenting anemia may have been caused by a hemolytic process, the severe drop in hemoglobin on day 8 did not appear to be due to hemolysis, as LDH was normal and uric acid was low at that time. So, while there are theories about the process of the coagulopathy associated with M. pneumoniae infection, this case illustrates the complexity of determining the exact mechanisms involved.

### A novel hemotropic Mycoplasma (hemoplasma) in a patient with hemolytic anemia and pyrexia [^7647292f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Ultrasound-guided liver biopsy to investigate persistent pyrexia and hepatosplenomegaly resulted in a hepatic arterial bleed, which was refractory to radiological embolization and required laparotomy to achieve hemostasis. Liver histology revealed no specific etiological features. Continuing postoperative pyrexia was then attributed to infection of a hepatic subcapsular hematoma, but was refractory to co-amoxiclav and metronidazole, and subsequently to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, given to broaden coverage against possible infection with hospital-acquired pathogens.

During the postoperative period the patient developed renal failure. Renal biopsy revealed acute tubular interstitial nephritis with focal granuloma formation and was negative for acid-fast bacilli and fungi. Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (concentration, 1:1280) and proteinase 3 antibody (weak) were positive. Systemic lupus erythematosus was considered, but insufficient features were present to make a diagnosis; although the patient was positive for antinuclear antibody (ANA), cytopenias, and arthralgia, both double-stranded DNA and lupus anticoagulant tests were negative, and there was no serositis, oral ulcers, photosensitivity, pre-existing renal disorder, neurological disorder, malar, or discoid rash. Nonetheless, prednisolone (40 mg once daily) was started in view of possible sarcoidosis or other immune disorder. Piperacillin-tazobactam and doxycycline (100 mg once daily orally) for 5 days were also started at this time as empirical treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia, diagnosed due to fever, inspiratory crepitations, and shadowing in the right base on chest radiography. Blood and sputum cultures were negative. The pyrexia resolved within 24 hours and on resolution of the pneumonia, recovery of the platelet count, and no immediate need for further transfusion over 5 days, the patient was discharged and continued taking prednisolone.

### Hepatosplenomegaly and reticulocytopenia as prominent features of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [^f9914779]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

This is a case of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) due to invasive pneumococcal disease in which the prominent clinical features were reticulocytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly, leading to the incorrect initial diagnosis of acute leukemia. Delayed diagnosis of HUS, especially in atypical cases, can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Atypical HUS must be part of the differential diagnosis of children who present with clinical characteristics suggestive of a hematologic malignancy with associated renal injury.

### Mortality following rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia [^9b6a25d3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of mortality following rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia.

Case Summary

A 62-year-old African American male with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma was admitted for tumor lysis syndrome and renal failure. He was treated with 2 doses of rasburicase, subsequently developed methemoglobinemia, and required intubation, multiple packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions, and 2 doses of methylene blue. A screen for glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was negative. His course was complicated by hemolytic anemia, nosocomial pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, and septic shock. His methemoglobin concentrations normalized over several days; however, the patient eventually died on hospital day 16. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug reaction was probable.

Discussion

Our case was similar to previously published cases, except that our patient died and his G6PD screen was negative. Although it was negative, it is likely that this was a false negative result because this blood was drawn shortly after PRBC transfusions and during active hemolysis. Both these are likely to cause false-negative results.

Conclusions

Methemoglobinemia is a rare adverse effect associated with the use of rasburicase and occurs most often in patients with G6PD deficiency. G6PD testing should not be ordered during active hemolysis or after blood transfusion because this may lead to false-negative results. Methylene blue should not be used as an antidote because it may worsen hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency.

### Things must not fall apart: the ripple effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children in sub-saharan Africa [^4682d9a4]. Pediatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell disease

SCD is a genetic red blood cell disorder with high prevalence among people of African descent, in the Indian subcontinent, and in parts of the Middle East and the Mediterranean region.SSA accounts for an estimated 79% of ~300,000 infants born annually with SCD worldwide. The risk of mortality is estimated at 50–90% among infants, and weak health infrastructure often contributes to delays in receiving life-saving interventions, such as pneumococcal vaccination, penicillin prophylaxis, and parental education. Patients with SCD are considered high risk for COVID-19 and complications due to impaired immunity secondary to functional hyposplenism, increased vulnerability to severe bacterial infections, systemic vasculopathy, and predisposition to thrombosis. As SARS-CoV-2 affects the respiratory system, it may be difficult to differentiate between symptoms of acute chest syndrome (a manifestation of SCD pulmonary vaso-occlusive disease) and COVID-19 pneumonia. Data on SCD and COVID-19 are limited, and given the high prevalence of SCD in SSA, countries need to proactively optimize access to critical interventions (e.g. oxygen, pain medication, blood supply) while scaling up evidence-based COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment modalities.

Co-infections and co-morbidities with SARS-CoV-2

The co-occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with major diseases is likely to exacerbate the impact of the pandemic on health across all ages. Adults with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and bacterial superinfection have poorer outcomes, similar to superinfection in influenza and other viral pneumonias. Data on bacterial superinfection of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in children are sparse; available data are largely from small Chinese cohorts describing asymptomatic to moderate illness. There have been no African reports to date.

The gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 may mimic that of rotavirus diarrhea in children. More common respiratory and gastrointestinal infections present potential challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia and diarrhea for children in SSA. There are no published reports on the epidemiology, presentation, or disease course of SARS-CoV-2 and Plasmodium spp. co-infection in children. Understanding potential synergistic effects, if any, of SARS-CoV-2-related pulmonary disease and malaria-induced respiratory complications will be critical in preventing associated morbidity and mortality.

### Haemolytic anaemia: a consequence of COVID-19 [^0fbbc03f]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A man in his early 50s presented with jaundice, mild shortness of breath on exertion and dark urine. He had had coryzal symptoms 2weeks prior to admission. Medical history included obstructive sleep apnoea and hypertension. His initial blood tests showed a mild hyperbilirubinaemia and acute kidney injury stage 1. Chest X-ray and CT pulmonary angiogram were negative for features suggestive of COVID-19. He later developed a drop in haemoglobin and repeat bloods showed markedly raised lactate dehydrogenase and positive direct antiglobulin test. These results were felt to be consistent with a haemolytic anaemia. A nasopharyngeal swab came back positive for COVID-19. We suspect the cause of his symptoms was an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia secondary to COVID-19 which has recently been described in European cohorts.

### The prevalence of anemia and its association with 90-day mortality in hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia [^c4ddffc2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Anemia was common in hospitalized CAP, not only in those with severe illness or anemia risk factors, but also in those with mild illness and no risk factors. When moderate to severe (hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL), the development of anemia was independently associated with increased 90d mortality. Whether prevention or treatment of CAP-associated anemia would improve clinical outcomes remains to be seen.

### The association of anemia with the clinical outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia in children [^ce18239c]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Anemia is associated with severe outcomes in adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but few studies investigated its association with pediatric CAP. Hence, we tried to delineate the association of anemia with the clinical outcomes of CAP in children.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2010 to 2019 in a medical center. Inpatients aged 6 months to 17 years who were diagnosed with CAP and without major underlying diseases were included. The subjects' clinical data within 24h of admission and clinical outcomes were collected. We accessed the rates of adverse outcomes and the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of these outcomes between anemic and nonanemic patients, as well as among patients with different types of anemia.

Results

In this study of 3601 patients, the prevalence of anemia was 11.6% (418/3601). Anemic patients had higher rates of intensive care (16.8% vs. 3.6%; p < 0.001), endotracheal intubation (11.0% vs. 1.3%; p < 0.001), and empyema (8.6% vs. 0.6%; p < 0.001) than nonanemic patients. In addition, anemia was independently associated with intensive care (adjusted OR, 3.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.03–4.42), endotracheal intubation (adjusted OR, 3.79; 95% CI, 2.17–6.63), and empyema (adjusted OR, 4.72; 95% CI, 2.30–9.69). Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) and normocytic anemia were associated with these adverse outcomes but not with anemia due to thalassemia trait.

Conclusion

Anemia is a biomarker associated with poor outcomes in pediatric CAP, and patients with IDA or normocytic anemia should be carefully monitored and managed since they may have higher disease severity.

### Complement-mediated autoimmune haemolytic anaemia as an initial presentation of legionnaires' disease [^7942cdcf]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 42-year-old diabetic man presented to the hospital with severe sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction. A probable respiratory source of sepsis was suspected because of suggestive clinical and radiological findings. He was critically ill and was therefore admitted to intensive care for further management including ventilatory support and renal replacement therapy. He was also found to have marked anaemia requiring multiple blood transfusions with clinical and laboratory evidence pointing towards severe haemolysis. Further workup for the aetiology of pneumonia established a diagnosis of Legionella by confirmatory tests namely legionella antigen in the urine and exponentially rising serum antibody titres. The cause for the severe haemolysis was found to be complement-mediated autoimmune haemolysis as determined by direct antiglobulin test positive for complement components C3 and negative for IgG. Such clinically significant autoimmune haemolysis as a presenting feature, rather than a late complication, has never before been reported in the literature.

### The definition of pneumonia, the assessment of severity, and clinical standardization in the pneumonia etiology research for child health study [^e962a93e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the fact that pneumonia is the most common cause of serious illness and death in young children worldwide, our ability, as clinicians, to infer an infectious pathological process in the lung from specific features of the history and examination is poor. Many common conditions of childhood, including malaria, bacterial sepsis, and severe anemia, produce a spectrum of clinical symptoms and signs that overlaps significantly with pneumonia, and differentiating between these conditions is challenging. In adults, the definition of pneumonia relies heavily on characteristic changes on the chest radiograph. However, many children who have suggestive clinical signs of pneumonia and who respond to appropriate antibiotics do not have any abnormalities on the chest radiograph taken at the onset of the illness; furthermore, radiological facilities are not always available in developing countries. In short, there is no single definition of pneumonia in childhood that is sensitive, specific, and can be widely implemented.

This article describes the clinical features and classifications available to define pneumonia in children and reports the rationale for the definition adopted by the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study and the process by which that definition was developed and is being standardized across the 7 PERCH sites.

### About Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection… [^7d12a194]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Bacteria called Mycoplasma pneumoniaecan cause respiratory tract infections.
- These infections are generally mild but sometimes can be severe.
- Most will recover without medicine, but some people need antibiotics to get better.
- Call a healthcare provider about difficulty breathing or symptoms that concern you. Types In general, M. pneumoniae infections are mild. Most common: Tracheobronchitis Less common: Pneumonia Quick facts from a U. S. study M. pneumoniaeare a common bacterial cause of the infection. For children, they're the most common cause and, for adults, the second most common cause.

Chest cold symptoms Common symptoms include:

- Feeling tired
- Fever
- Headache
- Slowly worsening cough
- Sore throat Younger children may have different symptoms Instead of chest cold symptoms, children younger than 5 years old may have:

- Diarrhea
- Sneezing
- Sore throat
- Stuffy or runny nose
- Vomiting
- Watery eyes
- Wheezing. Pneumonia symptoms People with pneumonia caused by M. pneumoniae can seem better than expected for someone with a lung infection. With mild symptoms, people may not stay home or in bed. Thus, the phrase "walking pneumonia" was coined. Common symptoms include:

- Cough
- Feeling tired
- Fever and chills
- Shortness of breath. Complications While uncommon, serious complications can occur that require hospital care. M.

pneumoniae infections can cause or make the following conditions worse:

- Asthma attacks or new asthma symptoms
- Encephalitis
- Hemolytic anemia
- Renal dysfunction
- Serious pneumonia
- Skin disorders like Stevens-Johnson syndrome or mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis. Seek care for these symptoms Seek medical care if you or your child has persistent or worsening symptoms of M. pneumoniae infection, such as wheezing, especially if at risk of developing severe disease. Always seek medical care right away if you or your child is having difficulty breathing.

### Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a sickle cell disease adult patient: case report [^c49bd44b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a serious monogenic disorder that reduces life expectancy. The acute chest syndrome (ACS) is one of the most frequent condition requiring hospitalization in SCD patients, often with an infectious event as the initial cause, and the leading cause of death among SCD adult patients. Consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly known, with only a few case reports, including one non-severe case in a 21‐year‐old man hospitalized with a history of SCD (HbS/β0‐thalassemia) on maintenance hydroxyurea therapy; a series of four clinical cases of patients from 22 to 41 years old with ACS; two cases of ACS. Another case describes a patient with pneumonia and severe ACS successfully treated with Tocilizumab. None of these patients was reported to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

### Zika virus epidemic in brazil. I. fatal disease in adults: clinical and laboratorial aspects [^9000b73f]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Zika virus (ZIKV) was first detected in Brazil in May 2015 and the country experienced an explosive epidemic. However, recent studies indicate that the introduction of ZIKV occurred in late 2013. Cases of microcephaly and deaths associated with ZIKV infection were identified in Brazil in November, 2015.

Objectives

To determine the etiology of three fatal adult cases.

Study Design

Here we report three fatal adult cases of ZIKV disease. ZIKV infection in these patients was confirmed by cells culture and/or real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and by antigen detection using immunohistochemical assay. Samples of brain and other selected organs taken at autopsy from three patients were also analyzed by histopathological and immunohistological examination.

Results

The first patient, a 36-year-old man with lupus and receiving prednisone therapy, developed a fulminant ZIKV infection. At autopsy, RT-qPCR of blood and tissues was positive for ZIKV RNA, and the virus was cultured from an organ homogenate. The second patient, a previously healthy female, 16 years of age, presented classic symptoms of Zika fever, but later developed severe thrombocytopenia, anemia and hemorrhagic manifestations and died. A blood sample taken on the seventh day of her illness was positive RT-PCR for ZIKV RNA and research in the serum was positive for antinuclear factor fine speckled (1/640), suggesting Evans syndrome (hemolytic anemia an autoimmune disorder with immune thrombocytopenic purpura) secondary to ZIKV infection. The third patient was a 20-year-old woman hospitalized with fever, pneumonia and hemorrhages, who died on 13days after admission. Histopathological changes were observed in all viscera examined. ZIKV antigens were detected by immunohistochemistry in viscera specimens of patients 1 and 3. These three cases demonstrate other potential complications of ZIKV infection, in addition to microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and they suggest that individuals with immune suppression and/or autoimmune disorders may be at higher risk of developing severe disease, if infected with ZIKV.

### Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia due to immunodeficiency [^9f70815f]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Autoimmune disorders are common presenting manifestations of immunodeficiency syndromes. We present a case of a woman in her late teens, with a history of frequent sinopulmonary tract infections during her childhood, who presented to our hospital with anaemia, jaundice and fatigue. She also had significant physical growth retardation for her age and sex. With this case report, we intend to present the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges faced by the patient and our healthcare system and propose a few feasible solutions to tackle these challenges.

Case Report

A 2-year-old girl was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital following 3 days of abdominal discomfort, fever, and fatigue. Her past medical history was uneventful, and her immunization was up to date, including 4 doses of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) schedule. On arrival, vital signs were notable for fever (39.4 °C), tachypnea (48 rpm), tachycardia (180 bpm) with normal blood pressure (91/63 mm Hg), and oxygen saturation (99%). The patient presented labored breathing and a distended abdomen but had normal neurological and hemodynamic status. Extensive skin abrasions covering half the back and the left arm were noted. The initial laboratory investigation revealed pancytopenia (hemoglobin 80 g/L, white blood cell count 1.2 × 10 9 /L and platelet count 43 × 10 9 /L), acute renal failure (serum creatinine 145 μmol/L), normal urinalysis and elevated transaminases (ALT 985 U/L, AST 631 U/L). A chest x-ray showed opacification at the base of both lungs, and an abdomen ultrasound performed at the referral center identified a possible mass in the left upper quadrant. Sepsis and abdominal neoplasia were the initial diagnoses considered. However, schistocytes on a peripheral blood smear and the raised lactate dehydrogenase were consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The diagnosis of Streptococcus pneumoniae- associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (Sp-HUS) was confirmed with the identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 10A) in the blood culture, a serotype not covered by her previous PCV13 vaccination.

### The prevalence of anemia and its association with 90-day mortality in hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia [^cf16e3d9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

There are important caveats and limitations to our work that deserve consideration. We did not have access to pre-CAP hemoglobin levels, and were therefore unable to determine if anemia preceded the development of pneumonia. Yet anemia was common even among those without well-known risk factors for chronic anemia. Hemoglobin values were only available if drawn for clinical purposes, which occurred in 97% of subjects on day 1, but in slightly more than half of those remaining in the hospital on each subsequent day. Consequently, though our anemia prevalence rates for day 1 and the entire hospital stay are accurate; our day-specific rates (figure 2) may be either over or underestimated depending on hemoglobin values for those who were not sampled that day. The prevalence of anemia among inpatients increased over the hospital stay in part due to discharge of less severely ill patients, with the remaining patients subject to the hemoglobin lowering effects of additional blood draws. Even so, the prevalence of anemia in those who were discharged was quite high. We are unable to explain why chronic respiratory disease appeared protective for the development of anemia in our models when it is known to be a risk factor for anemia in the outpatient setting. Importantly, this observation did not seem to be due differential transfusion rates in our cohort. It was impractical to draw blood samples after hospital discharge; therefore our results only describe hemoglobin changes during the hospital stay. Whether anemia persists after hospital discharge remains to be seen. If so, this might present a unique time to intervene if persistent abnormalities were also associated with adverse outcomes.

### Coexistent sickle-cell anemia and autoimmune disease in eight children: pitfalls and challenges [^ede12e00]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common inherited condition in African, Caribbean, and Mediterranean countries. Production of abnormal hemoglobin S is responsible for the sickling of red blood cells in deoxygenated conditions. SCD manifests itself as chronic intravascular hemolysis, vaso-occlusion and painful crises. Over time, multiple organ damage can develop. Patients with SCD display a defective activation of the alternate complement pathway, leading to an increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria (pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae). It was suggested that complement abnormalities could predispose to autoimmune disease (AID). However, the frequency of coexisting SCD and AID has not been evaluated, and most data come from case reports. Manifestations of AID, such as fever, polyarthritis, and multiorgan involvement, can also be caused by SCD, leading to a delay in diagnosing the AID. Furthermore, antiinflammatory drugs such as steroids and immunosuppressive therapy used to treat AID can induce severe SCD complications.

### Hemolytic uremic syndrome [^437bab2e]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is the clinical triad of thrombocytopenia, anemia, and acute kidney injury. Classically associated with enterocolitis from Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, HUS is also associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae infections; genetic dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway or coagulation cascade; and, rarely, a hereditary disorder of cobalamin C metabolism. These share a common final pathway of a prothrombotic and proinflammatory state on the endothelial cell surface, with fibrin and platelet deposition. Much work has been done to distinguish between the different mechanisms of disease, thereby informing the optimal therapeutic interventions for each entity.

### Coronavirus disease among persons with sickle cell disease, United States, March 20-may 21, 2020 [^14515d7d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited hemoglobinopathy that most commonly affects persons of African ancestry, is estimated to affect 1 in 365 Black persons in the United States. Persons with SCD produce abnormal hemoglobin that causes erythrocytes to become rigid and deform under low oxygen conditions, leading to ischemia–reperfusion injury in the microvasculature with subsequent organ damage and pain. SCD affects nearly every organ system; average life expectancy estimates of affected persons are 43–54 years. Persons with SCD are at increased risk for pulmonary disease and pneumonia.

Previous studies have shown that influenza severity and hospitalization rates are higher among persons with SCD than those without SCD. Thus, persons with SCD could be at higher risk for development of severe disease if infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Although empirical data are limited, cases of COVID-19 have been reported in persons with SCD, and a study of COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) admissions reported 2 (4%) of 48 children had SCD. We describe a large series of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths among persons with SCD in the United States.

In conclusion, the findings from this evaluation challenge existing knowledge regarding the frequency of Chlamydophila pneumoniae, M pneumoniae, and respiratory syncytial virus in adults with SCD with ACS or PNA. Routine inclusion of a macrolide for empirical coverage of atypical bacteria in these patients may not be necessary. Future studies focused on pathogen characterization with standardized assessment are necessary to determine appropriate empirical therapy in adult patients with SCD presenting with ACS or PNA.

Other autoimmune haemolytic anaemias

Drug-induced haemolytic anaemia is usually mediated by immune mechanisms. The only evidence-based treatment is discontinuation of the suspected drug, but corticosteroids are often also implemented as an initial measure.

Mixed warm and cold-antibody AIHA is rare and often severe. Diagnosis requires a monospecific DAT strongly positive for both IgG and C3d, a cold agglutinin titre ≥ 64, and the presence of warm-reactive IgG in serum as demonstrated by indirect antiglobulin test at 37 °C.

Cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS) occurs secondary to overt B-cell lymphoma or specific infections (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, SARS-CoV-2, and others).

Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria (PCH) is an ultra-rare AIHA mediated by biphasic, polyclonal IgG antibodies. Today, virtually all cases occur in children after a viral or other febrile infection. The condition may be underdiagnosed. Diagnosis is established by the Donath–Landsteiner test. There is no documented treatment apart from transfusion, but infusion of the C5 inhibitor eculizumab was followed by immediate resolution in a single case.

DAT-negative AIHA, a term for AIHA cases with negative DAT, remains difficult to diagnose and requires a comprehensive exclusion of non-immune causes of hemolysis. Sensitive methods for detecting immunoglobulin at the RBC surface may confirm autoimmune pathogenesis, but the benefit is limited by lower specificity.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1d3c44d2]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells, and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both. Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction. Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension. Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies. Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include the thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms. A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of a hemolytic anemia.

### Clinical and epidemiological features of paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria: a systematic review [^e4af6b7f]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results, consisting of the largest review of PCH cases to date, generally support previously described epidemiological findings, with more than half of cases in our study being reports of PCH in children aged ≤ 5 years who presented with a median hemoglobin of < 5.5 g/dL. These findings illustrate that contemporary PCH most commonly presents as postinfectious hemolysis in children, and can be associated with severe anemia. Despite representing the largest compilation of cases to date, we only identified 230 reported cases of PCH in the English medical literature, highlighting the rarity of this condition. Prior authors have suggested that PCH is twice as common among males vs females. In contrast, our analyses, based on this large cohort, highlight a nearly equal male-to-female ratio (1.17:1) of PCH cases among all ages overall and in children aged ≤ 5 years (1.25:1).

Historically, PCH was frequently encountered in older patients with tertiary or congenital syphilis, illustrated by our finding that between 1950 and 1970, 53% of reported cases of PCH were diagnosed in patients with syphilis. During these 2 decades, the median age of all patients with PCH was 31 years, and 42 years for those with PCH secondary to syphilis. Conversely, our findings illustrate that contemporary PCH is essentially a different disease, generally afflicting children after acute infection, most commonly upper respiratory infections and gastroenteritis. The most common timeframe reported for infections preceding PCH onset was 2 weeks (range, 2 days to 5 weeks). Thus, clinicians should be cognizant of the fact that a diagnosis of PCH should not depend on the presence of an active infection, and an infection may not always precede the development of PCH. Notably, we identified no reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with PCH despite mounting evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may be a predisposing factor for autoimmune hemolysis. Nevertheless, continued surveillance of post–SARS-CoV-2 PCH is warranted. In addition, it is worth highlighting the dramatic increase in the incidence of syphilis in the United States over the previous few years; thus, healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for the re-emergence of chronic PCH in addition to the more commonly encountered acute form.

Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy remarkably improved the patient's neurologic deficit and resolved abnormalities evidenced on MRI. To our knowledge, this report is the first of a pediatric patient with autoimmune hemolytic anemia complicated by acute disseminated encephalomyelitis that developed after an apparently successful treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.

### Cholesterol granulomas of the lungs associated with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia in pulmonary hypertension [^fc65b4b0]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Cholesterol granulomas unrelated to endogenous lipoid pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, or cholesterol pneumonia are a rare finding during pneumectomy or autopsy. They have been occasionally reported in association with pulmonary hypertension. We report a case where these lesions were associated with long-standing pulmonary hypertension and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Plexiform lesions were present in the pulmonary vasculature secondary to pulmonary hypertension, causing hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. We suggest that destruction of red blood cells and platelets could provide membrane lipids that are taken up by phagocytic cells, which promotes the formation of these cholesterol deposits.

### A case of hemoglobin SC disease with cold agglutinin-induced hemolysis [^c08953ce]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

Children with sickle cell disease commonly require red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. We report the first case of hemoglobin (Hb) SC disease with development of severe anemia induced by cold agglutinin hemolysis after Mycoplasma infection. Complete blood count (CBC) showed falsely decreased RBC count and hematocrit and falsely elevated MCV and MCHC. Peripheral blood smear showed RBC clumping at room temperature; this disappeared after warming to 37 degrees C. Anti C3b-C3d was present on red cells, and indirect antiglobulin test revealed a circulating cold agglutinin. Furthermore, anti-Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM antibody was detected in serum. Careful evaluation of CBCs and peripheral blood smears is required in cases of worsening anemia among sickle cell patients and consideration should be given to cold hemagglutinin disease as an etiology.

Assessment of clinical signs and symptoms — Acute Q fever in children is less likely to cause symptoms than in adults and may be milder, with symptomatic illness typically febrile and accompanied by headache, weakness, cough, and other nonspecific systemic symptoms; illness is frequently self-limited, though a relapsing febrile illness lasting for several months has been documented. Gastrointestinal symptoms are reported in 50%–80% of pediatric cases, and skin rash is more common than in adults with a prevalence as high as 50% among diagnosed children. Q fever pneumonia is usually moderate with mild cough; severe manifestations are rare but can include hepatitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, myocarditis, pericarditis, encephalitis, meningitis, hemophagocytosis, lymphadenitis, acalculous cholecystitis, and rhabdomyolysis.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^638843e9]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) autoantibodies are a relatively uncommon cause of anemia. However, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) must be considered in the differential diagnosis of hemolytic anemias, especially if the patient has a concomitant lymphoproliferative disorder, autoimmune disease, or viral or mycoplasmal infection. Classifications of AIHA include warm AIHA, cold agglutinin syndrome, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, mixed-type AIHA, and drug-induced AIHA. Characteristics of the autoantibodies are responsible for the various clinical entities. As a result, diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation and a serologic work-up. For each classification of AIHA, this review discusses the demographics, etiology, clinical presentation, laboratory evaluation, and treatment options.

### Anti B cell targeted immunotherapy for treatment of refractory autoimmune haemolytic anaemia in a young infant [^43ae9f61]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

We report the case of an 8 week old infant with fulminant autoimmune haemolytic anaemia refractory to conventional immunomodulating treatment. Massive haemolysis resulted in cardiac decompensation and acute renal failure which necessitated mechanical ventilation and peritoneal dialysis. Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, halted progression of the haemolytic process, but the patient died of acute viral pneumonia and disseminated fungal infection. Earlier introduction of rituximab might have prevented the renal complications. Paediatricians should be aware of this useful therapeutic tool for treatment of refractory autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and balance its use against the risk of potential life threatening infection.

CASE 2

A 13-year-old male with transfusion-dependent Hemoglobin (Hgb) SS sickle cell anemia repeatedly presented to emergency departments with fever, chills, headache, body aches, abdominal pain, emesis, and diarrhea over a week. Infectious workup detected only Mycoplasma pneumoniae by respiratory PCR panel, and azithromycin was prescribed. On day 7 of illness, he was admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring noninvasive ventilation secondary to pulmonary edema without acute chest syndrome.

Laboratories showed anemia and leukocytosis without thrombocytopenia (Table 1). Abnormal red cells on the automatic differential prompted a manual review showing 5.1% infected red blood cells consistent with P. falciparum (Figure 1). Due to infected red blood cell count > 5%, severe anemia, and worsening hypoxia, he was diagnosed with severe malaria and treated with intravenous artesunate. His respiratory status improved during a 2-day intensive care unit (ICU) stay. He was transitioned to oral artemether-lumefantrine with complete recovery. Given the lack of travel to a malaria-endemic area, a diagnosis of TTM was made.

Table 1.
Case Comparison

The blood bank reviewed the 12 PRBC units received by the patient in the last 6 months from 12 donors. One donor had relevant exposures. This donor was from Nigeria and had childhood malaria there. He emigrated 4 years prior and had not subsequently visited a malaria-endemic country. Donor blood was negative via PCR, but serology testing was positive. Further CDC genotyping analysis indicated that the recipient was infected with a single strain of P. falciparum, likely from West Africa based on the molecular drug resistance profile.

Management of ACS in low-resource settings — Research question: How should patients with acute onset of signs and symptoms concerning for ACS be managed in low-resource settings? Supporting questions include which physical signs and symptoms are most indicative of ACS in settings without chest radiography and which sustainable interventions decrease ACS-related maternal mortality where hematologists and transfusion therapy are not uniformly available. ACS is a common cause of hospitalization in SCD in high-resource settings, but in many low-resource regions where SCD is highly prevalent, chest radiographs are unavailable.

### Autoimmune complications of COVID-19 [^9a6cfbf9]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still propagating a year after the start of the pandemic. Besides the complications patients face during the COVID-19 disease period, there is an accumulating body of evidence concerning the late-onset complications of COVID-19, of which autoimmune manifestations have attracted remarkable attention from the first months of the pandemic. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune thyroid diseases, Kawasaki disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and the detection of autoantibodies are the cues to the discovery of the potential of COVID-19 in inducing autoimmunity. Clarification of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 injuries to the host, whether it is direct viral injury or autoimmunity, could help to develop appropriate treatment.

### Infection complicated by autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) and focal seizures in a paediatric patient [^98d9b3f9]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae commonly causes atypical pneumonia with mild symptoms such as cough, fever and general malaise. However, it can be associated with more severe extrapulmonary manifestations affecting the cardiovascular, neurological and haematological systems. We report the case of a female toddler with mycoplasma pneumonia, initially presenting with typical symptoms such as cough and fever. The course of infection was later complicated by autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) and focal seizures. The patient responded to treatment with intravenous azithromycin and ceftriaxone. This case highlights the importance of promptly recognising and treating more severe and less common manifestations of M. pneumoniae infection.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^cd148728]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is characterized by significantly reduced ADAMTS13 enzyme activity. The ADAMTS13 enzyme cleaves von Willebrand factor aggregations and, when it is not present or functional, large von Willebrand factor multimers form. These multimers trap platelets, causing microthrombi and RBC destruction by shearing, creating schistocytes. Approximately 95% of TTP cases are associated with acquired autoantibodies, often without an inciting event or disorder. 8, 9 TTP is life-threatening and requires timely diagnosis and treatment. Thrombocytopenia, fever, renal injury, MAHA, and neurologic dysfunction are hallmarks of TTP. Additional laboratory findings include a negative DAT result and normal coagulation testing. Assessment of ADAMTS13 enzyme activity is diagnostic for TTP, but results usually are delayed, making a presumptive diagnosis imperative.

The PLASMIC score can be used to predict severely reduced ADAMTS13 enzyme activity and initiate early treatment. 16 A low lactate dehydrogenase–to–aspartate transaminase ratio can aid in distinguishing HELLP syndrome, because the rate of hemolysis is higher in the other TMAs and hepatic involvement is higher in HELLP syndrome. 17 Disseminated intravascular coagulation also can result in MAHA due to fibrin-rich microthrombi. Disseminated intravascular coagulation causes prolonged coagulation studies, positive d-dimer test results, and decreased fibrinogen levels.
18. Oxidative Hemolytic Anemia Oxidative hemolysis occurs when normal processes are unable to reduce ferric iron, also known as methemoglobin, to ferrous iron, which carries oxygen. This results in methemoglobinemia, leading to premature RBC destruction by phagocytosis.

G6PD is integral to these protective systems, and when it is deficient, oxidative insults may cause hemolysis. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked disorder and is common in individuals of Mediterranean and African descent. Classically, fava beans, sulfa drugs, and primaquine were the primary triggers of oxidative hemolysis, but the list of medications to avoid in persons with G6PD deficiency is extensive.

### Use of complement C5-inhibitor eculizumab in patients with infection-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome-a case-series report [^cee097d2]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is charaterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury (AKI). Infection is the most common cause of HUS as Shiga-like toxin (verotoxin) producing bacteria, including Shiga toxin-producing enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (STEC), mostly E. coli serotype 0157:H7 or Shigella dysenteriae type 1 are responsible for 90% of all HUS cases. The acute phase of STEC-HUS is severe, with a mortality rate of up to 5% while it may reach up to 20% when presenting with neurological involvement. At least 50% of pediatric HUS patients require dialysis and 30% survive with long-term renal sequelae. Streptococcus pneumoniae-associated HUS (SP-HUS) represents approximately 5–15% of all HUS cases, of which long-term kidney outcome seems to be similar to STEC-HUS. Higher mortality rate has been reported in 11–16% of SP-HUS patients, where neuraminidase-induced endothelium damage leads to the activation of the complement system and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).

Sickle cell disease — diagnosis, screening limits, and key complication are described as follows: The diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disorders, is made by hemoglobin electrophoresis, and in the homozygous form nearly all the hemoglobin is hemoglobin S with small amounts of hemoglobin A2 and hemoglobin F, whereas heterozygous sickle cell trait (hemoglobin AS) is identified by a larger percentage of hemoglobin A and an asymptomatic course; solubility tests alone are inadequate for diagnosis because they cannot distinguish between heterozygous AS and homozygous SS and are not useful for screening because they cannot identify hemoglobin C, hemoglobin E, and β-thalassemia trait; the most significant threat to patients with sickle cell disease is acute chest syndrome, characterized by a pulmonary infiltrate with fever that leads to hypoxemia and acidosis.

### Multiple anatomic sites of infarction in a pediatric patient with M. pneumoniae infection, a case report [^f6ca9564]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Mitsuo Narita published three possible mechanisms at work in the manifestation of extrapulmonary disease in mycoplasma infection: 1) a direct type in which bacterium is present at the site of inflammation and local inflammatory cytokines induced by the bacterium play an important role, (2) an indirect type in which the bacterium is not present at the site of inflammation and immune modulations, such as autoimmunity or formation of immune complexes, play an important role, and (3) a vascular occlusion type in which obstruction of blood flow induced either directly or indirectly by the bacterium plays an important role. Flateau et al. described how immune mediation may also play a part in the hypercoagulability seen in M. pneumoniae infection: "Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), including anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and lupus anticoagulant, react against proteins that bind to phospholipids on plasma membranes, contributing to thrombosis. The presence of transient aPL associated with viral, bacterial and parasitic infections is well documented, but their pathogenic role is uncertain. However, in M. pneumoniae infection, several cases of transient aPL associated with thrombosis have been reported, suggesting that they might actively contribute to hypercoagulability".

Chapin et al. describes an association between the complement system and the coagulation cascade, as interactions between the two have been well characterized by in vitro studies. Complement pathways, especially the alternative complement pathway, are activated in hemolytic anemias and are closely linked with thrombosis. Multiple coagulation proteases exhibit complements C3 and C5 convertase formation, including thrombin, coagulation factors Xa and XIa, and plasmin. However, it is still unclear how the interaction of these two systems impacts the development of thrombosis.

It has long been established that M. pneumoniae activates agglutination of red blood cells in cold environments. Cold agglutinin mediated hemolytic anemia is a well-documented phenomenon. The cold agglutination effects of M. pneumoniae may also be indirectly responsible for coagulopathy and thrombosis. The association between cold agglutination and the activation of the complement cascade has been previously described, but the role that the coagulation cascade plays in the development of thrombotic events is not well understood.

### Infections in sickle cell disease [^a191caf3]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

There are also less well documented deficiencies of adaptive immunity, with abnormalities of both B- and T-cell subsets and function. For example, studies suggest that children with SCD make relatively poor antibody responses to vaccination against pneumococcus and influenza, with lower and less persistent levels of antibodies, although importantly these vaccinations still seem to offer significant protection against infection. The complement pathway is also abnormal, with reduced opsonization of bacteria.

Some treatments used in SCD also add to the immunodeficiency. Blood transfusions have been shown to increase the risk of infection, and the accompanying iron overload also predisposes towards certain infections, particularly Yersinia, but possibly also tuberculosis and malaria. Increasing numbers of patients have been treated with stem cell therapies which require exposure to myeloablative chemotherapy and long-term immunosuppression, with the accompanying increased risk from many pathogens. Importantly, although hydroxycarbamide does cause myelosuppression, it does not cause significant immunosuppression in SCD, and indeed reduces the risk of many infections, probably by offering better control of the SCD itself.

Without appropriate treatment and prophylaxis, infections in SCD can be life-threatening, particularly for young children. Furthermore, infections are associated with exacerbation of other sickle-complications, often precipitating vaso-occlusion and pain as well as acute severe hemolysis. Since the introduction of antimicrobial prophylaxis and immunizations, most children born with SCD in Europe and North America survive to adulthood. Sadly, this is not the case in many low-income countries, where a lack of neonatal screening and early diagnosis remains an obstacle to initiation of even simple prophylactic measures, such as daily penicillin.

As is true for most research in SCD, most studies on infections in SCD examine complications and outcomes in individuals with homozygous HbSS, sickle cell anemia (SCA). As such, the main focus of this review is clinical infections in individuals with SCA.

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome in a hemodialysis patient [^b2c1c735]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infective disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus. We described the clinical course of the first long-term hemodialysis patient who developed SARS in the literature, and our experience in performing hemodialysis for this patient. Such patients may present with a less typical clinical picture, making diagnosis difficult. In this patient, the course of disease and duration of viral shedding was apparently prolonged, thus highlighting the need for increased infection control. Despite worsening the anemia in renal failure patients by causing hemolysis, ribavirin is well tolerated after dosage adjustment. Difficulties of diagnosis, infection control, and treatment of SARS in renal failure patients are discussed in this report.

### Dramatic presentation of acquired thombotic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with COVID-19 [^fe0210b4]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus causes not only acute respiratory distress, but also diffuse endothelial inflammation. Acute infections are also well-known triggers for acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). We herein report the case of an acute TTP episode triggered by a SARS-CoV-2 infection with a dramatic clinical presentation and course. The patient is a 55-year-old female with a previous episode of TTP caused by bacterial pneumonia 30 years ago, successfully treated at the time with corticosteroids and plasma exchange. A subsequent follow- up was unremarkable, with no TTP relapse. At the end of March 2020, during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, she had mild influenza-like symptoms that resolved spontaneously. After 1 month she developed malaise, fatigue, chest discomfort and dyspnea that led to her admission to the emergency room of another hospital in the outskirts of Milan. A chest CT-scan revealed interstitial pneumonia. Two nasopharyngeal swabs for SARSCoV- 2 performed at different timepoints (approximately 10 days after the onset of symptoms) were negative but a serological test was positive for specific IgG, featuring a previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. An empiric treatment with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine and low-dose corticosteroids was started, together with 4,000 IU daily dose of enoxaparin. Low-flow supplemental oxygen (2 L/min by nasal cannula) was also added. After 3 days there was a rapid drop of the platelet count from 184,000/μL to 14,000/μL. Heparin was stopped and, considering her past medical history, a relapse of TTP was suspected. This diagnosis was supported by the concomitant development of anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] dropped from 11.4 to 7.4 g/dL), increased hemolysis (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] increased from 425 to 2,128 U/L) and the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear. Infusion of fresh frozen plasma was immediately started with no beneficial effect on the hematological parameters and her clinical conditions worsened with the development of severe neurological symptoms (agitation and unconsciousness) and desaturation with the need of high-flow oxygen supplementation (15 L/min with mask and reservoir bag). Her blood lactate levels increased significantly (15 mmol/L) and at this point the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit of our TTP hub hospital in Milan. On arrival she was unconscious, with respiratory failure and the need of high-flow oxygen and continuous positive airway pressure cycling. Her laboratory tests confirmed intravascular hemolytic anemia (Hb 7.4 g/dL, LDH 18,015 U/L, undetectable haptoglobin) with a negative direct antiglobulin test and thrombocytopenia (14,000/μL) with the presence of numerous schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with consumption coagulopathy (PT ratio 3.3, PTT ratio 1.51, fibrinogen 159 mg/dL, D-dimer 35,187 fibrinogen equivalent units). Plasma ADAMTS13 activity was undetectable together with the presence of a high titer anti- ADAMTS13 inhibitor (31 U/mL), confirming the diagnosis of acute immune-mediated TTP associated with severe inflammation and DIC. Laboratory tests were also consistent with multiorgan failure syndrome involving the kidney (creatinine 3.18 mg/dL), liver (AST 12602 UI/L, ALT 5625 UI/L, total bilirubin 9.22 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 7.1 mg/dL) and the heart (T troponin 1,501 ng/mL, proBNP 61,720 pg/mL). Increased levels of C-reactive protein (20.3 md/dL), procalcitonin (1.82 ug/L) and IL-6 (6.1 pg/mL) together with an enormous increase in serum ferritin (145,069 ng/mL) and neutrophilic leukocytosis (38,420/μL) confirmed the presence of a generalized inflammatory status associated with immune-mediated TTP caused by COVID-19. An extended autoimmune and complement study was performed showing consumed C4 levels, compatible with the acute TTP and COVID-19 infection, but excluding an associated autoimmune disease. Therefore, specific therapy for TTP was promptly started using high dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg daily) and daily plasma exchange (PEX) (with 1–1.5 plasma volume exchange). Considering the life-threatening presentation, treatment with caplacizumab (10 mg daily after PEX) was also started with the first dose administered before the first PEX. Caplacizumab is a nanobody that binds the A1 domain of the von Willebrand factor (VWF), blocking its interaction with the glycoprotein gpIb-IX-V platelet receptor and therefore preventing platelet aggregation. Six hours after the first injection of caplacizumab her platelet count rose to 46,000/μL and reached a plateau level of 100,000/μL after 3 days. Due to a persistently altered level of consciousness, a brain CT-scan was performed, showing bilateral frontal parietal petechial hemorrhages and an extended hypodense area involving the right parietal occipital lobe with a smaller image on the left parietal lobe, indicating ischemic lesions. Due to the low platelet count, the hemorrhagic cerebral petechiae and the ongoing treatment with caplacizumab, the introduction of antiplatelet therapy and antithrombotic prophylaxis were withheld to avoid intracranial bleeding. When a second brain CT-scan angiography with perfusion study performed after 48 hours confirmed the ischemic nature of the lesions with no increase of the hemorrhagic petechiae, antiplatelet therapy with daily 100 mg aspirin was started. After 9 days of therapy, the basal brain CT-scan showed a complete resolution of the frontal hemorrhagic petechiae and an initial necrotic evolution of the ischemic lesions. At this time, considering her persistent immobilization, antithrombotic prophylaxis with a 4,000 IU daily dose of enoxaparin was initiated. At day 12 the patient had a sudden onset hemoptysis causing acute anemia (Hb dropped from 9.0 to 7.7 g/dL in a few hours), that required red blood cell transfusion and an urgent chest CT-scan that showed active bleeding from an ectasic artery with a fistulous tract in the main right bronchus. Therefore, caplacizumab, antiplatelet therapy and antithrombotic prophylaxis were stopped, and the patient underwent an emergency transcatheter arterial embolization following treatment with intravenous factor VIII/VWF concentrate (Haemate-P 2,000 IU) to counterbalance the caplacizumab effect on VWF ristocetincofactor activity (VWF:Rco). The bleeding complication subsided and the patient, after 12 days of therapy with caplacizumab, PEX and steroids obtained a sustained platelet count above 150,000/uL and the normalization of ADAMTS13 plasma levels (58%) with anti- ADAMTS13 antibodies remaining undetectable. Considering the recent major bleeding episode and the fact that ADAMTS13 had become normal, caplacizumab was not restarted. PEX was discontinued after 14 days and the plasma level of ADAMTS13 was monitored every 3 days together with a daily complete blood count.

The causes of hemolytic anemia are numerous and a systematic approach is critical for proper identification and classification. The direct antiglobulin test can establish the diagnosis and subclassify the majority of autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Further testing to identify the driver of AIHA can have significant implications in overall management. Advanced testing for rare nonimmune acquired hemolytic anemias or hereditary hemolytic anemias may be necessary if DAT testing is negative.

HIV-associated Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in pregnancy — alternative regimens and G6PD considerations: If an alternative therapeutic regimen is required for moderate-to-severe PCP, IV pentamidine is preferred (BIII). Primaquine plus clindamycin should be used only if other alternatives are not available or tolerated (BIII). If an alternative therapeutic regimen is required for mild-to-moderate PCP, atovaquone suspension is preferred (BIII); dapsone plus TMP can be used if atovaquone is not available or tolerated (BIII). As with other adults with HIV, G6PD levels should be checked before administration of dapsone. Because of concerns about hemolytic anemia in exposed fetuses who are G6PD-deficient (which cannot be diagnosed antenatally), primaquine or dapsone should be used in pregnancy only if other alternatives are not available or tolerated and benefit is felt to outweigh the risk (AIII).

### Treatment and management of children with haemolytic uraemic syndrome [^32ed896f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), comprising microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and acute kidney injury, remains the leading cause of paediatric intrinsic acute kidney injury, with peak incidence in children aged under 5 years. HUS most commonly occurs following infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC-HUS). Additionally, HUS can occur as a result of inherited or acquired dysregulation of the alternative complement cascade (atypical HUS or aHUS) and in the setting of invasive pneumococcal infection. The field of HUS has been transformed by the discovery of the central role of complement in aHUS and the dawn of therapeutic complement inhibition. Herein, we address these three major forms of HUS in children, review the latest evidence for their treatment and discuss the management of STEC infection from presentation with bloody diarrhoea, through to development of fulminant HUS.

None of our patients developed pneumonia or required oxygen or intensive care treatment. Among all individuals, 394 individuals (99.2%) had mild illness. All patients recovered without complications, except 3 patients in the first wave who presented with unusual manifestations associated with COVID-19. One of these patients developed multiple chilblains on the toes, which were resolved in 1 week with conservative management. The second patient, an ethnic non-Chinese individual, developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) approximately 4 weeks after being diagnosed with the infection. He presented with fever, sore throat, cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral conjunctival injection, cracked lips, and strawberry tongue but without cardiac complications. He was treated successfully with 2 doses of intravenous immunoglobulin. The third patient in the first wave developed steroid-dependent autoimmune hemolytic anemia 3 months after being diagnosed with the infection and achieved remission with 4 doses of rituximab.

### The prevalence of anemia and its association with 90-day mortality in hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia [^84ea2b9c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia over time

Three in five (62.1%) subjects developed at least mild anemia at some point during their hospital stay (table 2), most of which occurred by the second hospital day. Anemia was more common in women, those with comorbidities, and the more severely ill, yet was often present in those without these risk factors. For those remaining in the hospital, anemia became progressively more common with each passing day (figure 2). Over time, hemoglobin values converged to around 10 g/dL, regardless of the presenting hemoglobin value (figure 3). Of all subjects, 176 (9.3%) received at least one blood transfusion. Of those who were transfused, mean (SD) pre-transfusion hemoglobin was 8.5 (1.2) g/dL.

Figure 2
Prevalence of anemia by day for patients remaining in hospital on each day and having a hemoglobin obtained that day. ICU patients refers to those who spent at least one day in the ICU. Non-ICU patients were never admitted to the ICU. During the first week, the majority of hemoglobin values were obtained from non-ICU patients. After day 7, those still remaining in the hospital and providing daily hemoglobin values were more likely to have spent at least one day of their hospital stay in the ICU. Despite this, 2/3 (341 of 511) of those with moderate to severe anemia were non-ICU patients.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) therapy — monitoring and adverse events: Careful monitoring during PCP therapy is important to evaluate treatment response and to detect toxicity as soon as possible, and follow-up after therapy includes assessment for early relapse, especially if therapy has been with an agent other than TMP-SMX or was shortened because of toxicity. In people with HIV, rates of adverse reactions to TMP-SMX are high (20% to 85% of patients), with common adverse effects including rash (30% to 55% of patients), fever (30% to 40% of patients), leukopenia (30% to 40% of patients), thrombocytopenia (15% of patients), azotemia (1% to 5% of patients), and hepatitis (20% of patients). Supportive care for common adverse effects should be attempted before TMP-SMX is discontinued (AIII), but therapy should be permanently discontinued in the setting of life-threatening adverse reactions including possible or definite Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (AIII). Adverse effects from alternative regimens include methemoglobinemia and hemolysis with dapsone or primaquine, azotemia, pancreatitis, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, leukopenia, electrolyte abnormalities, and cardiac dysrhythmia with pentamidine, and anemia, rash, fever, and diarrhea with primaquine and clindamycin, while headache, nausea, diarrhea, rash, and transaminase elevations occur with atovaquone; patients with persistent hypoxemia despite apparent response should undergo evaluation for methemoglobinemia if taking potentially causative medications.

### Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim prophylaxis in pediatric oncology patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [^fc4d5161]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

We sought to determine whether Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is associated with an increased frequency of acute hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency versus non-G6PD-deficient controls in a pediatric oncology population. There was no statistically significant difference in change in hemoglobin or transfusion requirements after starting SMX-TMP between groups. These findings suggest no increased risk of acute hemolytic anemia with SMX-TMP administered at prophylaxis doses in patients with G6PD deficiency.

On hospital day 8, his hemoglobin fell to 5.9 g/dL, requiring a red blood cell transfusion. It was believed to be a non-hemolytic anemia, as haptoglobin was elevated to 209 mg/dL, LDH had normalized at 471 units/liter, and uric acid was low at the time at 2.1 mg/dL. A thorough workup for clotting deficiencies was begun. All values were normal except for von Willebrand Factor and Cofactor (see Table 1 below) which were both elevated; reasons for these factors being elevated are unclear. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed trilineage hematopoiesis, no pathologic cells, and were negative for malignancy.

Inflammatory markers continued to be elevated throughout his hospitalization: CRP peaked at 146.6 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was > 145 mm/hour (mm/hr) and ferritin was 704 ng/ml. Immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were found to be high and included total IgG, IgG subclasses, IgA, IgM, and M. pneumoniae specific IgG and IgM. Further investigation revealed the presence of red blood cell agglutination (cold agglutination testing was not performed) and positive lupus anti-nuclear antibodies with nuclear speckled and cytoplasmic patterns.

### Infections in sickle cell disease [^2f4b2223]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Immune function in sickle cell disease

Sickle cell disease (SCD) causes severe acute complications and chronic illness, driven by vaso-occlusion and hemolytic anemia. A significant part of the high morbidity and mortality in SCD is associated with an increased risk of infection – bacterial, viral and parasitic (Figure 1). This is in part due to progressive organ damage caused by recurrent vaso-occlusion, most notably splenic injury.

Hyposplenism

Invasive bacterial infections are a common occurrence in both children and adults with SCD. This is in large part due to the impairment of splenic function that develops in early childhood, leaving children with SCD extremely vulnerable to infections with encapsulated bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. The exact pathophysiology of hyposplenia in SCD remains unknown, but it is thought to be a consequence of repeated intrasplenic sickling causing infarction and inflammation, ultimately leading to progressive splenic fibrosis and, in some cases, complete splenic atrophy (autosplenectomy). In children with HbSS, hyposplenism typically develops within the first year of life. The onset of splenic dysfunction in subjects with other sickle cell genotypes is yet to be examined in detail, but as a precaution these children are most often presumed to be asplenic from an early age.

Other aspects of immune dysfunction

A full review of immune function in SCD is beyond the scope of this review but, briefly, in addition to hyposplenism, immune function is abnormal in several other ways. SCD is associated with chronic inflammation, driven by infection, virus; Flu: influenza; COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019.

Figure 1.
Diagrammatic overview of key infections in sickle cell disease by organ system. EBV: Epstein-Barr virus; CMV: cytomegalovirus; HIV: human immunodeficiency infarction and hemolysis, which leads to an overactive and dysregulated immune system, as shown by an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases, and evidence of uncontrolled macrophage activation causing various complications, such as severe hemolytic transfusion reactions. There is also evidence of immunodeficiency, with abnormalities of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. In addition to hyposplenism, innate immunity is impaired by tissue infarction allowing increased entry of bacteria through the skin, as occurs with leg ulcers, and the gastrointestinal tract; areas of infarcted tissue within the body, particularly in bones, further act as foci of infection.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia [^b87e66bd]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

All patients (2 male subjects/4 female subjects; median age, 49 years) described had pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, but they presented with cytopenia and were eventually diagnosed with AA or PRCA. The major differential diagnosis includes acquired marrow failure and hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome. In the absence of morphologic dysplasia or abnormal chromosomal and molecular results, hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome was less likely.

We report 6 cases of new onset of acquired marrow failure in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A similar case series was reported recently, including 4 adult cases of AA diagnosed a few weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infectionand 2 pediatric AA cases with concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. These are possibly coincidental due to the high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. However, based on the number of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results in the 2021 Dallas–Fort Worth catchment area, we would tentatively expect a case rate of 9 per million per year, which is higher than the typical Western incidence of ∼2 per million per year by several fold.

For SARS-CoV-2 infection to initiate immune-mediated marrow failure, the infection would need to precede pancytopenia by weeks to months. Although one-half of our patients had a short duration between positive PCR test results and pancytopenia (patients #1, #2, and #4; range, 0–10 days), they oftentimes had no or minimal symptoms of respiratory COVID-19 infection; had positive test results by the elevated SARS-CoV-2 PCR cycle threshold and immunoglobulin antibodies, suggesting distant infection (patient #2); and/or presented with symptoms of pancytopenia such as fatigue and ecchymoses (patients #1, #2, and #4). Thus, in all 6 patients, we estimated that their initial SARS-CoV-2 infections were weeks to months before pancytopenia development, the symptoms of which often resulted in their presentation to care; they may remain persistently positive on PCR testing, as has been noted in patients with AA.

### The acute hemolytic anemias: the importance of emergency diagnosis and management [^67a14840]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hemolytic anemias are defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells. These anemias have many causes that are mostly due to chronic diseases, but, occasionally, cases of acute life-threatening hemolysis can occur.

Objective

The objectives of this article were to review the pathophysiology of hemolytic anemias, to discuss the general emergency department (ED) evaluation, and to discuss the assessment and treatment of important and "cannot miss" hemolytic diseases.

Discussion

Because hemolytic anemias are rarely seen, the emergency physician may consider a patient's anemia as due to blood loss rather than hemolysis, and the workup and treatment may not be appropriate. The primary goal for the emergency provider is to resuscitate, but he or she also must recognize that a hemolytic process is present. Appropriate laboratory work and specialist consultation should be obtained. While focused treatment is rarely necessary in the ED, the avoidance of certain treatments, such as early platelet transfusion in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, may be necessary.

Conclusions

Hemolytic anemias are rare, but should still be considered in the ED differential diagnosis of low hemoglobin. Emergency physicians should first resuscitate, but should also be able to identify the presence of hemolysis and obtain the appropriate laboratory tests. Occasionally, specific treatments are needed but should be discussed in conjunction with a specialist.

### Cold agglutinin syndrome secondary to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in adults: results from a large French observational study (MyCOLD study) [^72447240]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

(MP) is a bacterium mainly responsible for respiratory infections. Its incidence is particularly high in children and young adults. MP outbreaks typically occur every 3 to 5 years with the latest epidemics occurred in 2011–2012 and 2017–2018 and more recently in 2023. The number of MP infection drastically increased in France — and worldwide — during fall and winter of 2023–2024 years. This epidemic situation led not only to an unusual number of potentially life‐threatening respiratory infections but was also responsible for a variety of serious extra‐respiratory manifestations including cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) or cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS) according to standard terminology.

Cold agglutinins are antibodies able to agglutinate red blood cells (RBCs) at an optimum temperature of 0°C–4°C. These antibodies are mostly of the IgM isotype, target autologous RBC membrane antigens, and can lead to their accelerated destruction. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) caused by antibodies with cold agglutinin properties can be classified into cold agglutinin disease (CAD), an indolent B cell clonal disorder, and CAS, where anti‐RBC antibodies are secondary to a malignancy or an acute infection such as MP. Previous studies have suggested that the avidity of MP for sialic acid residues on the surface of RBCs may lead to the formation of neoantigens inducing an autoimmune humoral response. The autoantibodies generated in this context are mainly IgM reacting with the I RBC surface antigen and with cold agglutinin properties. Confirmation of CAS relies on a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) reacting with C3d, combined with the presence of cold agglutinins (titer > 1/64) in the serum. While the detection of cold agglutinins is a common finding in MP infections, symptomatic CAS in this setting is rare and its optimal management is not consensual. This led us to raise the following questions: (i) what are the characteristics and outcomes of MP ‐associated CAS? (ii) Are there any risk factors for developing CAS during an MP respiratory tract infection? and (iii) Is there a place for a short course of glucocorticoids (GC) to shorten the duration of CAS and/or improve the prognosis? The 2023–2024 epidemic of MP gave us the opportunity to address these questions by analyzing a significant number of patients with MP ‐associated CAS, taking advantage of the large‐scale French collaborative observational study MYCADO on hospitalized patients with MP infection.

### Rapidly worsening pneumonia in a middle-aged woman: a rare diagnosis and a crucial management decision [^80851e6f]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 54-year-old Indian female presented to the hospital with a 4-day history of fever, shortness of breath and blood-streaked sputum. Chest radiograph showed consolidation and she was admitted as a case of bilateral bronchopneumonia. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals but she continued to deteriorate clinically with increasing oxygen requirement and worsening lung infiltrates. Since lab investigations also revealed significant anaemia and renal impairment, vasculitic workup for pulmonary renal haemorrhagic syndrome was ordered even though she had no haemoptysis in the hospital and haemoglobin was stable after initial blood transfusion. High-resolution computed tomography scan was done on day 5 to assess progression and for any clue to diagnosis. It showed extensive bilateral air space consolidation and ground-glass opacities with suggested radiological differential diagnosis of cryptogenic organising pneumonia or pulmonary haemorrhage. Pulmonology team did not recommend bronchoscopy at the time. In view of the clinical features of rapidly progressing pneumonia despite standard treatment, history of haemoptysis, anaemia, renal impairment and CT scan findings suggestive of pulmonary haemorrhage, pulse intravenous Methylprednisolone was initiated. The patient showed marked clinical and radiological improvement. The vasculitic workup later revealed positive myeloperoxidase antibody and a definitive diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis was made. She was discharged in a stable condition and advised to follow-up in rheumatology where she continues to follow-up 2 years after her initial diagnosis. This is the first case reported in literature, where treatment was initiated for this rare disease entity within a week of presentation based on highly suggestive clinical, laboratory and radiological evidence without waiting for a confirmatory diagnosis. Delay in this rapidly deteriorating patient could have been fatal and our prompt action was crucial in securing a favourable outcome.

Case presentation

Patient information

A 33-year-old man with a history of SCD and moderate overweight (BMI, 28.4 kg/m 2) presented on March 24, 2020 to the Emergency Department of Tenon hospital (a referral SCD center in Paris, France), for a febrile dyspnea. Sickle cell homozygous disease (baseline hemoglobin [Hb] value 11.5 g/dl, HbF 2.5%, HbS 87%) was known since childhood, and he had suffered mild episodes of vaso-occlusive crisis, and two episodes of ACS. Red blood cell transfusions had been required only once in the previous 20 years. Regular follow-up of SCD at our center had revealed early ophthalmological (Goldberg's stage III retinopathy) and renal (GFR 120 mL/min and microabuminuria at 0.75 g/L) damage.

Clinical findings

The symptoms first appeared 11 days before admission with cough and headache. Then, he developed fever and dyspnea. In the Emergency Room, physical examination revealed fever (39 °C) and signs of acute respiratory distress (RR 36 cycles/min, room air pulse oximetry 88%), without hemodynamic instability (BP 134/82 mmHg, HR 106/min). The patient had no history of recent medication, he reported a contact with his sick girlfriend. Chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar and interstitial infiltrates predominating in the middle lobe (Fig. 1). Blood analysis revealed moderate anemia, reticulocytopenia, moderate hemolysis, lymphocytopenia and a major inflammatory syndrome (Table 1). Respiratory condition worsened rapidly requiring intensive care unit admission and intubation with mechanical ventilation.

3.5 Safety

All 26 patients reported an AE (Table 2). The most common AE was diarrhea, which occurred in 42% of patients and was mild in all but 1 patient. Diarrhea was managed with dose modification (reduction or interruption), over‐the‐counter medication, or changes in dietary regimen. Fatigue was also common, and 4 of 8 cases were considered possibly/probably related to treatment. Hypertension was mild or moderate and managed with changes in the dose or type of concurrent antihypertensive medication, the addition of an antihypertensive medication, and if needed, study drug dose modification (reduction or interruption). Dizziness and insomnia AEs were mild and considered in the majority of patients to be unlikely related to study drug. There were no discernible differences in AEs between responders and nonresponders.

TABLE 2
Most common (> 10% of patients) adverse events (AEs)

Three patients (12%) in the initial treatment phase required a dose reduction (to 100 mg BID) due to liver toxicity, neutropenia, and diarrhea. Twelve patients (46%) had treatment interrupted or withdrawn due to AEs, and 4 (15%) of these were treatment related.

Seven patients (27%) reported at least one serious adverse event (SAE). These SAEs were anemia in 2 patients and, in 1 patient each, acute myocardial infarction, fall, hemoglobin decrease, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, infection, pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, sepsis, skin necrosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and urinary tract infection; all were considered by the investigators as not related to the study drug.

Two patients had events leading to death in this study. A 50‐year‐old female, receiving concomitant azathioprine, died 58 days after the last dose of fostamatinib due to events of skin necrosis and infection. An 83‐year‐old male, whose medical history was significant for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (in remission at study entry), died due to polymicrobial pneumonia 48 days after the last dose of fostamatinib. Both SAEs were considered as not related to study drug and related to underlying comorbidities with long‐standing prednisone.

### The successful use of eculizumab for treatment of thrombotic microangiopathy in pediatric acute SARSCoV2 infection and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [^00234f54]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Patient 1 (Figure 1A) is an 11-year-old Black female with sickle cell disease (HbS β thalassemia) who was initially hospitalized with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and acute chest syndrome. While hospitalized, she developed warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) with initial response to IVIG and methylprednisolone. She was discharged on prednisone (1 mg/kg every 12 hours). Five days after discharge she presented in status epilepticus and was notably hypertensive and intermittently febrile. Schistocytes and an elevated LDH were noted. Brain magnetic resonance imaging with angiography (MRI/MRA) was most consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Despite continuation of prednisone for AIHA, she developed worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia, both requiring transfusions, and worsening refractory hypertension requiring five antihypertensive medications. Elevated temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP; peak 27.3 mg/dL), ferritin (peak 34,053 ng/mL), and D-Dimer (peak > 20.0 µg/mL) also suggested a hyperinflammatory state (Figure 1A). This prompted, on hospital day (HD) 7–8, initiation of high-dose methylprednisolone (1 g/day divided every 6 hours), rituximab (560 mg), and IVIG (1 g/kg) for aggressive AIHA treatment, and anakinra (150 mg every 6 hours) and tocilizumab (400 mg twice) for treatment of hyperinflammation (Figure 1A). Despite these therapies, on HD 9 she developed new hypoxic respiratory failure and bronchoscopy revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). She also demonstrated pulmonary hypertension on transthoracic echocardiogram (TEE), proteinuria (peak 5.15 mg/mg creatinine), elevated LDH (peak 2,905 units/L), elevated sC5b-9 (peak 1,254 ng/mL), thrombocytopenia refractory to platelet transfusions, schistocytes, and a low C4, consistent with CM-TMA (Table 1). Following the diagnosis of CM-TMA, she received her first dose of eculizumab (HD 9), after which both her CH50 and sC5b9 levels normalized, and her DAH and pulmonary hypertension all rapidly improved. Prior to eculizumab she required platelets and blood almost daily. Following her second dose of eculizumab (HD 12) she did not require any transfusions for 3 weeks. Following her third dose of eculizumab (HD 14), she was transferred out of the intensive care unit. She was able to be discharged on HD 36.

### Minor cross-matching in the diagnosis of pneumococcal hemolytic uremic syndrome in an 18-month-old boy [^f45bd50b]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In developing nations, limitations in diagnostic facilities act as a barrier for differentiation of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) based on the etiology. A sick-looking 18-month-old boy presented to our hospital in Bhubaneswar, India, with clinical signs and symptoms of left lobar pneumonia, abnormal hematological and renal parameters, no growth in blood culture, a negative direct antiglobulin test (DAT) result, and low complement levels. A rapid deterioration in his clinical condition necessitated intensive care support, blood transfusion, and renal replacement therapy (peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis). Because his health care team suspected atypical HUS, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was initiated as soon as possible. In the absence of a lectin panel, minor cross-matching confirmed T-antigen exposure. With a diagnosis of HUS induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae (sp-HUS), TPE was stopped immediately, and washed blood components were administered. Despite the aforementioned measures, the boy died of HUS on day 20 after presentation. This case emphasized the role of minor cross-matching in the detecting of polyagglutination in resolving the diagnostic dilemma of sp-HUS.

Categories of AIHA: Based on serological findings, AIHA were classified as follows: warm AIHA in 67.6%, cold AIHA in 20.3%, mixed AIHA in 1.4% and DAT negative AIHA in 2%. Auto antibodies isotype was IgG alone in 35.1%, IgG + C3d in 34.5%, and C3d alone in 13.5% (Supplemental Table 2). Cold agglutinin titer was reported in 26 medical records and was positive in 20 (13.5%).

Hemolytic crisis' trigger: Triggers were identified in 35.1%, mostly bacterial infections (16.9%, primarily urinary tract infections and pneumonia) or viral infections (10.8%, mostly respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses). Other triggers included Rituximab infusion (2%), invasive acts (0.7%, cold exposition during surgery in a CAD) and treatment interruption (0.7%, steroids cessation). Supplemental Table S2 provides detailed information about AIHA types and hemolytic crisis triggers.

### IVIG-induced coombs-positive hemolytic anemia in a critically ill adolescent male… [^cf7f7f92]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: A well-described but not universally appreciated side effect of IVIG administration is clinically apparent, sometimes severe hemolysis. We describe a severe case of Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia secondary to IVIG. IVIG is a blood derivative manufactured from pools of 5, 000 to 10, 000 individual plasma donations. IVIG is not ABO-type restricted, so anti-A, anti-B and anti-A, B isoagglutinins are measureable in IVIG. A number of other RBC alloantibodies to minor blood group antigens have also been detected. CASE REPORT: A 16-year-old male with PMH of OSA and obesity was admitted for adenoviral pneumonia leading to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. A complicated PICU course included severe ARDS, septic-shock, AKI and Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia. The patient was treated with IVIG, 400 mg/Kg daily for five days, after which severe hemolysis occurred, associated with elevated LDH and total bilirubin. The hemolytic process dropped the hemoglobin from 13.

8 g/dL to a nadir of
6. 6 g/dL, requiring transfusion of four units of Red Blood Cells. The pre-transfusion peripheral blood smear showed spherocytosis with rouleaux formation and large clumped rbc aggregates. The patient's blood type was Blood Group A-negative and all transfusions were type specific. The Coombs test was positive with polyspecific and anti-IgG typing antisera, and acid eluate prepared from the Coombs-positive rbc's revealed anti-A. The patient's antibody screen was negative ruling out both allo- and autoantibodies. However, Anti-A was also detected in his plasma. The patient's hemolysis was associated with the anti-A passively transmitted from the IVIG. RBC transfusion support was changed to use of Group O-negative RBCs and the hemolytic process resolved. The patient later died due to complications of ARDS.

DISCUSSION: Before this severe hemolytic event, the patient was already in multi-system organ failure due to adenoviral pneumonia. He was not eligible for ECMO due to his progressive pulmonary hemorrhage, was ultimately made DNR, and died due to progressive hypoxia despite maximal ventilator support.

### Immune dysregulation and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in individuals with haploinsufficiency of SOCS1 [^7d1e8e2b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

We studied 2 unrelated patients with immune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia in the setting of acute infections. One patient developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in the setting of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

Objectives

We sought to identify the mechanisms underlying the development of infection-driven autoimmune cytopenias.

Methods

Whole-exome sequencing was performed on both patients, and the impact of the identified variants was validated by functional assays using the patients' PBMCs.

Results

Each patient was found to have a unique heterozygous truncation variant in suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1). SOCS1 is an essential negative regulator of type I and type II IFN signaling. The patients' PBMCs showed increased levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 phosphorylation and a transcriptional signature characterized by increased expression of type I and type II IFN-stimulated genes and proapoptotic genes. The enhanced IFN signature exhibited by the patients' unstimulated PBMCs parallels the hyperinflammatory state associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, suggesting the contributions of SOCS1 in regulating the inflammatory response characteristic of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.

Conclusions

Heterozygous loss-of-function SOCS1 mutations are associated with enhanced IFN signaling and increased immune cell activation, thereby predisposing to infection-associated autoimmune cytopenias.

### Mycoplasma disease and acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease [^0ecb20d3]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is the leading cause of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease. Radiographic and clinical findings in ACS resemble pneumonia; however, etiologies other than infectious pathogens have been implicated, including pulmonary fat embolism (PFE) and infarction of segments of the pulmonary vasculature. The National Acute Chest Syndrome Study Group was designed to identify the etiologic agents and clinical outcomes associated with this syndrome.

Methods

Data were analyzed from the prospective study of 671 episodes of ACS in 538 patients with sickle cell anemia. ACS was defined as a new pulmonary infiltrate involving at least 1 complete segment of the lung, excluding atelectasis. In addition, the patients had to have chest pain, fever > 38.5C, tachypnea, wheezing, or cough. Samples of blood and deep sputum were analyzed for evidence of bacteria, viruses, and PFE. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was determined by analysis of paired serologies. Detailed information on patient characteristics, presenting signs and symptoms, treatment, and clinical outcome were collected.

Results

Fifty-one (9%) of 598 episodes of ACS had serologic evidence of M pneumoniae infection. Twelve percent of the 112 episodes of ACS occurring in patients younger than 5 years were associated with M pneumoniae infection. At the time of diagnosis, 98% of all patients with M pneumoniae infection had fever, 78% had a cough, and 51% were tachypneic. More than 50% developed multilobar infiltrates and effusions, 82% were transfused, and 6% required assisted ventilation. The average hospital stay was 10 days. Evidence of PFE with M pneumoniae infection was seen in 5 (20%) of 25 patients with adequate deep respiratory samples for the PFE assay. M pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae was found in 16% of patients with diagnostic studies for C pneumoniae. Mycoplasma hominis was cultured in 10 (2%) of 555 episodes of ACS and occurred more frequently in older patients, but the presenting symptoms and clinical course was similar to those with M pneumoniae.

Conclusions

M pneumoniae is commonly associated with the ACS in patients with sickle cell anemia and occurs in very young children. M hominis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ACS. Aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including 1 from the macrolide class, is recommended for all patients as well as bronchodilator therapy, early transfusion, and respiratory support when clinically indicated.
