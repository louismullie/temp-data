## Question

What is cognitive dissonance as explained byFestinger?

Answer Choices:
A. Cognitive dissonance is a learning theory that describes the process by which people adapt their behavior to match their intentions
B. Cognitive dissonance is a condition where an individual experiences difficulty in decision-making due to the presence of too many choices
C. Cognitive dissonance is a motivational theory that suggests individuals are driven to change their attitudes when they experience positive reinforcement
D. Cognitive dissonance is a theory about memory retention
E. Cognitive dissonance is a state of mind where an individual is completely aware and accepting of their conflicting attitudes
F. Cognitive dissonance is a theory about emotional stability
G. Cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon where an individual's beliefs are in harmony with their actions at all times
H. Cognitive dissonance is a theory about personality traits
I. Cognitive dissonance is a theory that states that cognitions can have one of three relations to one another - consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what cognitive dissonance is as explained by Festinger, and to select the best answer among the provided options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and the three possible relations between cognitions. Then, I should verify the motivational nature of dissonance and the drive to reduce it. Next, I will examine classic experimental evidence that illustrates the theory. After that, I need to check each answer choice against these pillars and explicitly reject the incorrect ones. Finally, I will confirm the correct option and ensure it aligns with contemporary extensions and neural evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition. Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory posits that cognitions can be consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant, and dissonance arises when two cognitions conflict, producing psychological discomfort that motivates reduction of that discomfort, often by changing attitudes or beliefs rather than behavior, which is a key theoretical point I should not overlook.

> Wait, let me verify the motivational claim. Dissonance is not merely a passive state; it is a negative motivational drive that compels people to reduce the inconsistency through strategies such as changing beliefs, adding consonant cognitions, or downplaying dissonant information, which distinguishes it from simple learning or memory theories and supports the idea that attitude change is a common resolution pathway.

> I will now examine the classic evidence to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. The famous [1/20] experiment showed that participants paid $1 to say something counterattitudinal later reported greater attitude change toward the statement than those paid $20, because the smaller external justification left more dissonance to resolve internally, which directly demonstrates the motivational reduction of dissonance via belief change rather than behavior change [^115ZQgMH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the answer choices. I need to check each one against these pillars. Option A frames dissonance as a learning theory about matching behavior to intentions, which mischaracterizes it as behavior-change driven rather than attitude-change driven, so I should reject A. Option B conflates dissonance with choice overload, which is a different phenomenon, so B is incorrect. Option C incorrectly ties dissonance reduction to positive reinforcement, when the driver is negative tension from inconsistency, not reward, so C is wrong. Options D, F, G, and H misclassify the theory as being about memory, emotional stability, belief–action harmony, or personality traits, none of which capture the core of dissonance as a motivational state from conflicting cognitions, so they should be rejected. Option J mislabels it as a group decision-making theory, which is too narrow and off-target, so J is out [^1156Xq7t].

> Let me reconsider the remaining option. Option I states that cognitions can be consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant, that dissonant cognitions create discomfort, and that people are motivated to reduce that dissonance, which aligns perfectly with Festinger's original formulation and the subsequent literature describing dissonance as a negative motivational state with attitude-change resolution strategies [^1156Xq7t].

> But wait, what if contemporary work has refined the definition in ways that undermine I? I should double-check. Modern neuroimaging and behavioral studies continue to treat dissonance as a conflict-driven negative state that predicts attitude change, with anterior cingulate and anterior insula engagement linked to dissonance and its resolution, which reinforces rather than contradicts the classic account embodied in option I [^114dEbJM].

> Final answer: I is correct because it preserves the three relations between cognitions, the negative motivational nature of dissonance, and the drive to reduce it, which are the definitional cornerstones of Festinger's theory as supported by classic experiments and contemporary research [^1156Xq7t] [^115ZQgMH] [^114dEbJM].

---

The correct answer is **I**. Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory states that cognitions can be **consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant** [^1156Xq7t]; dissonant cognitions produce psychological discomfort, motivating individuals to reduce the dissonance by changing their attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors [^114dEbJM]. This motivational drive is a core feature of the theory, distinguishing it from purely cognitive or learning models [^114dEbJM].

---

## Core concepts of cognitive dissonance theory

Festinger's theory rests on several **core concepts**:

- **Cognitions**: Mental elements such as beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors [^1156Xq7t].

- **Relations between cognitions**: Cognitions can have one of three relations: consonant (harmonious), irrelevant (no relation), or dissonant (conflicting) [^1156Xq7t].

- **Dissonance**: The psychological discomfort or tension arising from holding conflicting cognitions [^114dEbJM].

- **Motivation to reduce dissonance**: Individuals are motivated to reduce dissonance, often by changing their attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors to restore consonance [^114dEbJM].

---

## Experimental evidence supporting cognitive dissonance theory

Festinger and his colleagues conducted several classic experiments that provided empirical support for the theory:

- **Forced compliance paradigm**: Participants who were paid $1 to perform a boring task later reported enjoying the task more than those paid $20, because the $1 condition created greater dissonance that they resolved by changing their attitude toward the task [^115ZQgMH].

- **Free-choice paradigm**: After choosing between two equally attractive options, participants later devalued the unchosen option, illustrating how dissonance from decision-making leads to attitude change [^114MNATZ].

- **Effort justification**: Individuals who undergo significant effort or hardship to achieve something tend to value the outcome more highly to justify their effort and reduce dissonance [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing the magnitude of cognitive dissonance

The magnitude of dissonance experienced by an individual is influenced by several factors:

- **Importance of the cognitions**: Greater importance of the conflicting cognitions leads to stronger dissonance [^1156Xq7t].

- **Degree of conflict**: Greater inconsistency between cognitions increases dissonance [^1156Xq7t].

- **Individual differences**: Personality traits, cognitive styles, and cultural factors can influence susceptibility to dissonance and preferred methods of reduction [^1162HMTJ].

---

## Common strategies for reducing cognitive dissonance

Individuals employ various strategies to reduce cognitive dissonance, including:

- **Changing cognitions**: Modifying beliefs or attitudes to align with behaviors or other cognitions [^1156Xq7t].

- **Adding consonant cognitions**: Introducing new information or beliefs that support the conflicting behavior or belief [^1156Xq7t].

- **Minimizing importance**: Downplaying the significance of the conflicting cognitions [^1156Xq7t].

- **Avoidance**: Avoiding situations or information that trigger dissonance [^114vdzH5].

---

## Contemporary relevance and applications

Cognitive dissonance theory remains highly relevant in contemporary psychology and has been applied to various fields, including:

- **Health behavior**: Understanding and promoting behavior change, such as smoking cessation, healthy eating, and exercise adherence [^112xpc6A].

- **Consumer behavior**: Explaining post-purchase dissonance and brand loyalty [^notfound].

- **Social psychology**: Analyzing attitude change, prejudice reduction, and conformity [^notfound].

- **Neuroscience**: Investigating the neural mechanisms underlying dissonance and its resolution [^114dEbJM].

---

## Criticisms and limitations

Despite its widespread acceptance, cognitive dissonance theory has faced criticisms and limitations:

- **Methodological concerns**: Some experimental paradigms have been criticized for lack of ecological validity or potential confounding variables [^notfound].

- **Alternative explanations**: Self-perception theory and impression management have been proposed as alternative explanations for some dissonance phenomena [^notfound].

- **Cultural variability**: The theory may not universally apply across cultures, as collectivist societies may experience and resolve dissonance differently [^notfound].

---

Cognitive dissonance theory, as explained by Festinger, posits that individuals experience psychological discomfort when holding conflicting cognitions, motivating them to reduce this dissonance through attitude or behavior change. This theory has been supported by extensive experimental evidence and remains a cornerstone in understanding human behavior and decision-making [^114dEbJM].

### Motivated misremembering of selfish decisions [^112ZZyFc]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Motive-dependence and choice-independence

The findings of Experiments 2 and 3 cohere with the possibility that the memory bias we observe is a motivated phenomenon. However, they only demonstrate this phenomenon indirectly. A motivated account of misremembering would receive compelling evidence over a rational inference account with direct evidence for two key conditions.

First, motivated misremembering should be motive-dependent. That is, misremembering should occur only when people have a motive to misremember, and should cease to occur if motives to misremember are removed. In particular, a rich, long-standing literature on motivated cognition suggests that when people no longer view themselves as personally responsible for a dissonance-inducing action, they no longer experience dissonance motivation –. Indeed, feelings of responsibility for an action serve as a bridge between the action and one's self-concept. As such, only if people feel personally responsible for their fairness violation should they experience a moral self-threat, and become motivated to reduce it via misremembering.

### Choice reminder modulates choice-induced preference change in older adults [^114MNATZ]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Choices not only reflect preference but also shape preference. The choice-induced preference change (CIPC) occurs when making a decision modifies people's attitudes about the options. When people rate a series of items and then must choose between 2 items rated as equally attractive, they later rate the unchosen item as less attractive than before. One explanation is that the choice and the equal preference for 2 options cause a psychological discomfort known as cognitive dissonance, which can be reduced by changing the preference. The current study aims to investigate the age-related differences in the CIPC effect, and how an explicit reminder of the previous choice modulates this effect.

Methods

Using an artifact-controlled free-choice paradigm, with a sample of 79 younger and 76 older participants, we manipulated the choice reminder in 2 experiments.

Results

We found that compared with young adults, older adults are less susceptible to CIPC when their previous choices were not explicitly reminded. After boosting the salience of choice-preference incongruency by reminding participants of their previous choices, older adults showed comparable CIPC as young adults.

Discussion

Our results suggest that older adults tend to downweigh the information that leads to cognitive dissonance and use this strategy only when such information is relatively implicit. The diminished CIPC in older adults could be one of the emotional regulation strategies that older adults engage in to maintain positive emotional states when making difficult decisions.

### Forced to be free? Increasing patient autonomy by constraining it [^112EMTo7]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

The simplest way to avoid these costs, it might be thought, is by ensuring that patients are given the chance to reassess their decisions. We may think that though patients may initially be overwhelmed by the stress of the decision facing them, if we allow them to reflect again, perhaps over the course of several days (when this is practicable) and change their minds, they will be able to avoid some of these pathologies. Indeed, this kind of strategy may be a part of the solution to the problems outlined above, but there is reason to think that it will be of limited usefulness by itself. There is a large literature on what happens to our judgements after we have made a decision. As a consequence of making the decision, our attitudes to the alternatives change: we come to think the option we have chosen is far superior to the options we have rejected. The relevant mechanism here seems to be cognitive dissonance: because we are aware of the attractive features of those options we have decided not to pursue, we experience dissonance, and dissonance can be resolved by changing our judgements. This phenomenon is known as the spreading of alternatives: alternatives that were initially thought of more or less equal (or at any rate, not very dissimilar) value come to be thought as very unequal after one is chosen. We tend to come to see the option we have chosen as very much better than those we have rejected. Lieberman et al showed that the spreading of alternatives does not require that subjects recall the option chosen. This evidence suggests that if patients do not change their minds about their initial judgements, this may not be because the initial judgement was the one that was really most in accord with their values.

### Neural activity predicts attitude change in cognitive dissonance [^114dEbJM]. Nature Neuroscience (2009). Medium credibility.

When our actions conflict with our prior attitudes, we often change our attitudes to be more consistent with our actions. This phenomenon, known as cognitive dissonance, is considered to be one of the most influential theories in psychology. However, the neural basis of this phenomenon is unknown. Using a Solomon four-group design, we scanned participants with functional MRI while they argued that the uncomfortable scanner environment was nevertheless a pleasant experience. We found that cognitive dissonance engaged the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula; furthermore, we found that the activation of these regions tightly predicted participants' subsequent attitude change. These effects were not observed in a control group. Our findings elucidate the neural representation of cognitive dissonance, and support the role of the anterior cingulate cortex in detecting cognitive conflict and the neural prediction of attitude change.

### American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: prevention and treatment in patients with cancer [^111PaS5K]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) — patient preferences and shared decision-making emphasize that clinicians should also be aware that patients put particular trust in the opinions of their clinician when deciding on VTE treatment options and, as such, it is important to avoid assumptions regarding a patient's preferences; data from discrete choice experiments and qualitative methodologies have shown that cancer patients most value an anticoagulant that does not interfere with their cancer treatment and has the best efficacy/safety profile over the convenience of oral administration; in summary, when engaging in shared decision-making, it is important to recognize that, for most patients, the diagnosis of cancer takes primacy over their VTE, and shared decision-making tools may help to facilitate meeting patients' needs and avoid the risks associated with cognitive dissonance for the prescribing clinician.

### Conflict before the courtroom: challenging cognitive biases in critical decision-making [^117RpMso]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Kahneman and Tversky also propose how a reference point is set, suggesting that the past and present context of experience defines an individual's adaptation level. Thus, external events are perceived in relation to this reference point. For instance, a certain level of health may imply disability for one person and great health for another, depending on their previous experiences of illness. As critics of normative models of decision-making, particularly Bernoulli's 'expected utility theory', Kahneman and Tversky offered a descriptive model whereby focus lay on people's beliefs and preferences. They argue that humans do not naturally make logical or rational choices but instead, the decision-making process is framed by 'cognitive biases'. This is secondary to a tendency to oversimplify decisions by basing their understanding of the decision on their previous experiences, which are probably unrepresentative sets of observations. Hence, Kahneman suggests that the mind primarily deals with 'known knowns', which are its observations. It rarely considers 'known unknowns', which are recognised as relevant but do not factor significantly into the decision-making process, due to a lack of experiential information. The human mind is therefore oblivious to 'unknown unknowns', i.e. occurrences, of which the mind has no prior knowledge or experience.

### Prior information differentially affects discrimination decisions and subjective confidence reports [^1163eitr]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In this study, both paradigms used informative, high level priors. Future work is necessary to investigate whether this result holds true when different kinds of priors are used. First, lower-level priors such as the light-from-above prior, cardinal orientation bias, or perceptual history bias might affect decisions differently, as they may act at an earlier stage and impact perception of the target stimulus more directly –. Second, non-informative or suboptimal priors might reveal that the pattern we see here reflects a confidence bias towards prior information, rather than more optimal use of priors in confidence. If so, in cases of suboptimal priors, confidence would still be more likely to be affected by the invalid prior information than decisions. This possibility is in line with recent studies that have shown that confidence is biased by suboptimal, false priors about stimulus precisionor about task performance. Other work testing the Bayesian confidence model has found confidence to suboptimally overweight evidence that is in line with the decision, leading to a form of confirmation bias in perceptual confidence. Our findings do not show a confirmation bias in favour of information in line with the decision, but might rather reflect a confidence confirmation bias in favour of information in line with the prior, even in cases where this actually contradicts the decision. Although at face value this may go against the previous confirmation bias findings in perceptual confidence, this might, speculatively, still be in line with the conclusions drawn, namely that confidence favours evidence consistent with one's beliefs. This could also be a strategy aimed at self-consistency and avoiding cognitive dissonance –, leading people to be more confident in response to information that fits in their belief system, and to doubt themselves when they act against their prior world models.

### Patient preference for cancer therapy: an overview of measurement approaches [^112xpc6A]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

In the era of evidence-based medicine and shared decision making, the formal assessment of patient preference for treatments or treatment outcomes has attracted much attention. In this article, the two most common approaches to the evaluation of preference, ie, utility assessment and probability trade-off assessment, are described. The purpose is to provide clinicians with the background knowledge needed to interpret preference studies published in the literature and to judge whether the reported findings are relevant to their own patients.

Methods

An overview is given of the methods used to assess utilities and probability trade-off scores. Evidence on determinants of such scores is presented. Examples from oncology are provided. Because experience with the treatment plays an important role as a determinant of preferences for both treatments and treatment outcomes, special attention is paid to the interpretation of studies in the light of subject selection. Directions for future research are suggested.

Conclusion

The choice of approach and the measuring instrument depend on the goal of the preference assessment. Normal psychologic processes, such as coping, adaptation, and cognitive dissonance reduction, cause patients who are about to undergo a therapy or have experienced a therapy to rate it more favorably than other patients do. This should be remembered when using evidence from the literature to inform patients or for patient decision making.

### A social model of loneliness: the roles of disability, social resources, and cognitive impairment [^115MJXXp]. The Gerontologist (2017). Low credibility.

In describing the cognitive discrepancy theorypointed to the potential for cognitive processes to modulate the loneliness experience. They suggested that labelling, causal attributions, social comparison, and perceived control could influence loneliness. Our results could be interpreted as incorporating elements of each of these. For example, internalization or identification with negative images of cognitive decline and social withdrawal could contribute to self-perceptions of loneliness. Elsewhere research has found minority groups are at risk of accepting and internalizing negative societal values which influences social engagement and impacts on loneliness. Furthermore, attributing loneliness to cognitive impairment may situate this beyond the individual's control resulting in anticipation of prolonged loneliness. According to the original social comparison theory "choice" plays a major role in how people contrast their situation to others. When faced with a threat such as ill health, suggested that downward comparison (comparing one's situation to others in a "worse" situation) could lead to improved self-esteem and wellbeing. Indeed, research has demonstrated this effect for older people with chronic disease. However, our results suggest that downward social comparison is not a significant modulator of loneliness for those with cognitive impairment. Alternatively, a social identity that is predominantly constructed through negative attitudes, norms and collective discourses may result in an upward comparison (comparing one's social situation to those "better off") and affects the experience of loneliness.

Making a judgment about the adequacy of social resources assumes that a person has self-knowledge to evaluate their situation against others. In the presence of anosognosia a person may rely upon a self-identity that is based on past behavior before the onset of cognitive impairment. Consequently, the desire for a certain level of social resources may be unrealistically optimistic and outstrip the objective assessment of social interactions. In this respect, cognitive dissonance between actual and desired social relation may be the result of an unwitting temporal social comparison with an earlier self-identity.

### The decision path not taken [^113RHnpV]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Real-life decisions often involve multiple intermediate choices among competing, interdependent options. Lorteije et al. (2015) introduce a new paradigm for dissecting the neural strategies underlying such decisions.

### Cognitive debiasing 2: impediments to and strategies for change [^112hHzZ9]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

This becomes even more challenging if one considers that biases tend to act unconsciously. A general problem with debiasing, as Horton notes, is that 'the same kinds of biases that distort our thinking in general also distort our thinking about the biases themselves'. Indeed, many biases are applied unconsciously, and if physicians are unaware of them, they will have difficulty recognising the need for debiasing. Clinicians themselves may be just as vulnerable as their patients to a number of psychological factors that might compromise decision making. Nevertheless, the topic has attracted considerable interest and effort, reflecting a widespread perception of the need for solutions to the vulnerability of human reasoning.

### A neural mechanism underlying failure of optimal choice with multiple alternatives [^111Ebwai]. Nature Neuroscience (2014). Medium credibility.

Despite widespread interest in neural mechanisms of decision-making, most investigations focus on decisions between just two options. Here we adapt a biophysically plausible model of decision-making to predict how a key decision variable, the value difference signal-encoding how much better one choice is than another-changes with the value of a third, but unavailable, alternative. The model predicts a surprising failure of optimal decision-making: greater difficulty choosing between two options in the presence of a third very poor, as opposed to very good, alternative. Both investigation of human decision-making and functional magnetic resonance imaging-based measurements of value difference signals in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) bore out this prediction. The vmPFC signal decreased in the presence of low-value third alternatives, and vmPFC effect sizes predicted individual variation in suboptimal decision-making in the presence of multiple alternatives. The effect contrasts with that of divisive normalization in parietal cortex.

### Decision-making under uncertainty in obsessive-compulsive disorder [^1162zJFJ]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2015). Low credibility.

Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) produces profound morbidity. Difficulties with decision-making and intolerance of uncertainty are prominent clinical features in many patients. The nature and etiology of these deficits are poorly understood. We used a well-validated choice task, grounded in behavioral economic theory, to investigate differences in valuation and value-based choice during decision making under uncertainty in 20 unmedicated participants with OCD and 20 matched healthy controls. Participants' choices were used to assess individual decision-making characteristics. OCD participants did not differ from healthy controls in how they valued uncertain options when outcome probabilities were known (risk) but were more likely than healthy controls to avoid uncertain options when these probabilities were imprecisely specified (ambiguity). Compared to healthy controls, individuals with OCD were less consistent in their choices and less able to identify options that should be clearly preferable. These abnormalities correlated with symptom severity. These results suggest that value-based choices during decision-making are abnormal in OCD. Individuals with OCD show elevated intolerance of uncertainty, but only when outcome probabilities are themselves uncertain. Future research focused on the neural valuation network, which is implicated in value-based computations, may provide new neurocognitive insights into the pathophysiology of OCD. Deficits in decision-making processes may represent a target for therapeutic intervention.

### Calibration of cognitive tests to address the reliability paradox for decision-conflict tasks [^114uNivY]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Differential psychology aims to measure the way in which individuals vary in their behavior and to understand the processes that cause those differences. These causes are conceptualized as stable individual characteristics, or traits, but the behavioral effects of traits on any given measurement occasion are modulated by fluctuations in transient states, such as arousal, attention, mood, fatigue, and the intrinsic variability in the nervous system. State variation acts as a type of measurement noise with respect to the correlation-based techniques that are used in differential psychology to estimate the proportion of behavior that can be explained by trait variation. It has long been acknowledged that correlations based on averages over measurement occasions under-estimate this proportion, leading to an emphasis on the development of reliable scales with levels of measurement noise that are small relative to the underlying level of trait variation. In this paper, we focus on the reliable measurement of individual differences in the ability to control the decision conflict caused by interference from misleading or irrelevant information. Decision conflict is apparent in many real-world high-stakes contexts, such as shoot/don't shoot scenarios, where strong inhibitory skills ensure superior performance. The ability to inhibit conflicting information is recognized as a key component of individual differences in areas ranging from executive-control, to aging.

Individual differences in conflict control are often measured using choice tasks, such as the Flanker, Simon, or Stroop. In such tasks, the conflict effect is traditionally measured by the difference in mean response time (RT) between an incongruent condition, where information from an irrelevant stimulus attribute conflicts with information from another stimulus attribute that is relevant for the choice, and a control condition, where the two sources of information are congruent, or the irrelevant attribute is absent (e.g. Fig. 1). The irrelevant attributes are chosen so they activate cognitive representations that interfere with response selection. This can occur because of pre-potent factors, including the tendency to respond based on reading a color word in the Stroop task instead of based on the color the word is printed in, or responding towards a stimulus position in the Simon task rather than the rule mapping stimulus color to a response button on the side opposite the stimulus. In the Flanker task, fine-grained spatially-based attention selection is required between the relevant (target) and irrelevant (distractor) characteristics due to high similarity (e.g. left- vs. right-facing arrows), differing only slightly in terms of their spatial location (central for the target with adjacent distractors nearby).

### Value-based decision making under uncertainty in hoarding and obsessive-compulsive disorders [^1115DwxW]. Psychiatry Research (2017). Low credibility.

Difficulties in decision making are a core impairment in a range of disease states. For instance, both obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) and hoarding disorder (HD) are associated with indecisiveness, inefficient planning, and enhanced uncertainty intolerance, even in contexts unrelated to their core symptomology. We examined decision-making patterns in 19 individuals with OCD, 19 individuals with HD, 19 individuals with comorbid OCD and HD, and 57 individuals from the general population, using a well-validated choice task grounded in behavioral economic theory. Our results suggest that difficulties in decision making in individuals with OCD (with or without comorbid HD) are linked to reduced fidelity of value-based decision making (i.e. increase in inconsistent choices). In contrast, we find that performance of individuals with HD on our laboratory task is largely intact. Overall, these results support our hypothesis that decision-making impairments in OCD and HD, which can appear quite similar clinically, have importantly different underpinnings. Systematic investigation of different aspects of decision making, under varying conditions, may shed new light on commonalities between and distinctions among clinical syndromes.

### The limits of shared decision making [^115WtzZy]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Lowered decisional capacity

It is perhaps obvious that SDM is not appropriate where an individual has lost the capacity for making decisions. This could be transient, as in loss of consciousness or the influence of drugs, or prolonged, as when cognitive decline is present. Decisional capacity is also a gradient and may vary over time, so clinicians can benefit from the assistance of time and repeated assessments to establish the threshold at which SDM with people who have insufficient cognitive capacity remains appropriate. It may well be that others can act as proxies and represent the views of the individual. Parents are asked to act as proxies for children, where the interest of the child may need to be represented by others.

These situations and the levels of involvement possible are special cases that deserve more detailed consideration elsewhere. Nevertheless, such cases should remind us that even for proxies, or for people who we deem as having sufficient decisional capacity, that the quality and simplicity of information are critical. Our capacity to process information can be severely compromised when we are under stress, realising that a close relative is seriously ill and may not recover. Health professionals tend to overestimate people's ability to assimilate and process information, especially in high volume or complexity.

### Reinforcement learning and decision making in anorexia nervosa [^114k4SFC]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Increasing empirical evidence supports the importance of choice behavior and decision-making in the emergence and maintenance of psychiatric disorders marked by inflexible or excessive goal pursuit, including AN; see for conceptual and systematic reviews. In the context of reinforcement learning, decision-making is influenced by stimulus valuation (e.g. appraisal of reward/threat) and requires cognitive flexibility to update information, modify behavior according to potentially changing states, and arbitrate between options to guide choices in pursuit of short- or long-term goals. This process also involves exploration of new options versus exploitation of gained knowledge. Individuals learn whether a decision was consistent with their goal based on the outcome.

Reinforcement learning and decision-making frameworks have informed conceptual models for understanding the onset and maintenance of eating pathology in AN. AN symptoms such as choices about food, caloric intake, or exercise are viewed as value-driven decisions that are learned through a series of rewarding and punishing outcomes. For example, food choices or avoidance may initially develop through receipt of positive outcomes (e.g. weight loss, social praise) or avoidance of negative outcomes (e.g. lack of weight gain). As an individual learns, they build expectancies based on reinforcement and punishment histories that influence their beliefs about the actions they can take and stimuli that predict different outcomes, shaping and motivating future behavior. Given that most people are exposed to information that could result in maladaptive food- and body-related learning, yet few individuals develop AN, theoretical models have posited that individuals with AN may have unique risk factors (e.g. genetic, neurobiological) that result in this learning happening more readily, becoming overgeneralized, or being more resistant to change.

### Decision making in depression: differences in decisional conflict between healthy and depressed individuals [^11455AsL]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

This study investigated differences in the emergence of decisional conflict in healthy and depressed participants. The two groups of interest were questioned about their experience of decisional conflict and ongoing thoughts and impressions during decision making. As predicted, depressed participants experienced more decisional conflict than healthy participants. Furthermore, the diverse processes hypothesis was supported: In healthy participants, preoccupation with the task was the only predictor of decisional conflict. In depressed participants, decisional conflict was predicted by a combination of depression-related processes (e.g., low self-efficacy, lack of concentration, rumination, etc.). This research reduces the gap between the relevance of the symptom of indecisiveness (e.g., for diagnostic purposes) and the lack of knowledge in this realm of psychopathology.

### Calibration of cognitive tests to address the reliability paradox for decision-conflict tasks [^113ty95T]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Procedure

To be eligible to begin the study, participants had to check a box confirming they have normal, or corrected-to-normal, vision and successfully completed two multiple choice English proficiency questions consisting of a sentence missing one word (e.g. He really didn't _______ to interrupt her. Please choose only one of the following: (a) hope, (b) gain, (c) mean, (d) suppose).

A tutorial then guided participants through each component of the task pertaining to the condition they were randomly assigned to. Each component was introduced with prompts explaining the aim of the task and how to respond (e.g. respond according to the direction of the central arrow). Next, they completed the component unprompted. The prompted and unprompted blocks each consisted of four trials (including both incongruent and congruent stimuli). An error message was displayed when an incorrect response was given, and the response had to be corrected to continue. For example, in Flanker2, the standard Flanker task (with then without prompts) was introduced, then Flanker with double shots (with then without prompts) was presented. Participants received points for correct responses and the total was constantly displayed. There were no time limits imposed on trials, however, a "Hurry up!" message appeared when participants responded slowly (i.e. > 2 s).

Participants then received eight chances to successfully complete four unprompted trials of each component (e.g. Flanker and Flanker2) without error in any element, before progressing to the experiment. Again, errors were required to be corrected to advance. Where eight attempts had been made without successful completion, participants were asked to exit the study and paid for their time. Once all trials were correct in a single attempt, participants proceeded to the experiment without the need to complete any remaining attempts.

The main experiment was separated into two sessions, the first consisted of 16 blocks and the second 20 blocks. The sessions were divided by a compulsory 10-minute break; however, participants were free to break for longer if desired. The bonus accumulated throughout the experiment and was visible to participants at the end of each block. This included the amount they earned in the preceding block as well as a running total. At the conclusion of both sessions, participants were informed of the total bonus they had accumulated and were given a completion code for MTurk.

### Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions [^116D2psU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Decision aids are interventions designed to help people make specific and deliberative choices among options (including status quo) by providing (at a minimum) information on the options and outcomes relevant to a person's health status. A systematic review is needed to summarize what is known about their efficacy.

Objectives

1. To create an inventory of existing decision aids. 2. To conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of decision aids aimed at improving people's decision making and outcomes.

Search Strategy

The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Aidsline, Cancerlit, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. In addition, individuals known to be active in the field of decision support were contacted.

Selection Criteria

We screened titles and abstracts for all interventions providing structured, detailed, and specific information on treatment or screening options and outcomes to aid decision making. Information about the decision aids was compiled in an inventory and those evaluated in a randomized controlled trial were reviewed in detail.

Data Collection and Analysis

Using Cochrane review methods, two reviewers independently screened and extracted data on several evaluation criteria. Results of randomized trials were pooled using weighted mean differences and relative risks with all data analysed using a random effects model.

Main Results

Eighty-seven decision aids were identified. Twenty-three of them had been evaluated in 24 randomized controlled trials. Among the trials comparing decision aids to usual care interventions, decision aids performed better in terms of: a) greater knowledge of options in seven of seven studies (weighted mean difference (WMD = 19 out of 100, 95% confidence interval (CI): 13,25); b) more realistic expectations in two of three studies (RR = 1.48 95%CI 1.02, 2.14); c) lower decisional conflict related to feeling informed in three of three studies (WMD = -9.0 of 100 95%CI: -15, -3); d) reducing the proportion of people who were passive in decision making in three of four studies (RR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.5, 0.8). When simpler decision aids were compared to more detailed ones, the relative improvement was significant in: a) improved knowledge in two of seven studies (WMD = 4 out of 100, 95% CI: 2, 5); b) realistic expectations in two of two studies (relative risk (RR ranged from 1.5 95%CI: 1.3,1.8); and c) decisional conflict in one of two studies (WMD = -4 95% CI -8,-0.2). There was a consistent trend for decision aids to do no better than comparison interventions in affecting: satisfaction with the decision in five of six studies, satisfaction with the decision making process in four of five studies, and anxiety in four of five studies. Decision aids had a variable effect on which screening or treatment options were selected. Exposure to decision aids relative to controls resulted in a consistent non-significant trend toward reduced preference for major surgery over conservative options by 21 to 42 per cent in five of five studies; however, they had no impact on circumcision in two of two studies. For colon and prostate cancer screening choices, the results were inconsistent. Two studies have shown no impact on persistence with chosen option and few studies have shown significant benefits on general health outcomes (two of three studies), or disease-specific health outcomes (one of four studies).

Reviewer's Conclusions

The number of decision aids is expanding, but there is considerable overlap in some areas leaving gaps in others. Trials of decision aids indicate that they are superior to usual care interventions in improving knowledge and realistic expectations of the benefits and harms of options; reducing passivity in decision making; and lowering decisional conflict stemming from feeling uninformed. When simpler versions of decision aids are compared to more detailed aids, the differences in knowledge are marginal but there are other benefits in terms of creating realistic expectations and in reducing decisional conflict. To date, decision aids have had little effect on anxiety or satisfaction with the decision making process or satisfaction with the decision. Their effects on choices vary with the decision. The effects on persistence with chosen therapies and health outcomes require further evaluation. The essential elements in decision aids for different groups and different types of decisions need to be established. Consensus needs to be reached regarding standards for developing and evaluating decision aids.

### Causal role of a neural system for separating and selecting multidimensional social cognitive information [^115DybAz]. Neuron (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Effects of the relevant and irrelevant information on choice

Intuitively, the observed influence of irrelevant traits on incongruent difficult trials should impair participants' performance. Indeed, participants' accuracy was lower on incongruent than congruent trials (Figure 2 D; W = 334, p = 0.03), and their accuracy was lower on incongruent difficult trials than congruent difficult trials (Figure 2 E; W = 361, p < 0.01). These differences may be driven by disruption from the irrelevant traits on incongruent trials and/or facilitation from the irrelevant traits on congruent trials. To assess these accounts, we compared incongruent and congruent trials where the characters differed substantially along the irrelevant traits with another subset of trials where this difference was small and where there should be no disruption and/or facilitation (neutral trials). Specifically, incongruent and congruent trials only included trials where the absolute standardized difference along the irrelevant traits was above 0.5, whereas the remaining trials were labeled as neutral. This analysis indicated that both disruption and facilitation were at play (Figure 2 F): participants' accuracy was lower on incongruent than neutral trials (disruption W = 444, p < 0.001, HBC) and higher on congruent than neutral trials (facilitation W = 464, p < 0.001, HBC).

### Experience-based risk taking is primarily shaped by prior learning rather than by decision-making [^112VKw9N]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A natural explanation for this phenomenon is that when a decision is based on the integration of many previous experiences, too many to recall individually, then learning simplifies each choice option to its most essential information, namely, the option's expected value. Given only the expected values of different options, one can no longer recognize which option is riskier and which is safer, nor can one revalue the contribution of past gains and losses to these expected values. This explanation seems to conflict with research showing that the brain is equipped to learn entire distributions of outcomes for each choice option, not merely expected values –. In the context of our task, such distributional learning would only require encoding the gain and loss probabilities for the risky and safe images, since these were the only images where the frequencies of gains and losses were similar. Consequently, memory load is only a little higher in our decision bias model, as compared to the learning-bias model. One way to reconcile our findings with prior work on distributional learning is to assume that the distributions that are learned are not distributions of objective outcomes, but rather of the outcomes' subjective values, thus obviating the need to convert outcomes into subjective values at decision.

Our findings only apply to decisions involving both potential gains and losses, where risk avoidance could stem from either a general aversion to losses or from a concave utility function. It would therefore be informative to test whether learning also primarily shapes risk-taking in decisions involving only gains or only losses, where loss aversion is irrelevant. Additionally, the simplicity of our task, where each choice is limited to two possibilities with only three possible outcomes, contrasts with real-life decisions, which often require integration of multiple cues and types of information. Therefore, testing this effect in more complex settings could help clarify the extent to which it applies in real life. We note, however, that the simplicity of the task also increases the likelihood that participants will learn the probabilities of different outcomes and could thus differently weight them at the time of decision. In contrast, when decisions involve cues associated with varied and complex outcomes, the ability to learn and consider them distinctly may be compromised, making it even more likely that decisions will primarily be based on prior evaluation of outcomes that occurred during learning.

### Causal inference and cognitive-behavioral integration deficits drive stable variation in human punishment sensitivity [^113msXGC]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a moderately large, diverse sample, we identified three enduring phenotypes of punishment sensitivity: Sensitives who adaptively avoid punishment through experience, Unawares who require explicit information to correct maladaptive choices, and Compulsives who persist in punished behavior despite both experiential and informational interventions. These phenotypes reflect stable, trait-like differences and predicted longitudinal decision-making outcomes, positioning them as robust markers for persistent harmful behavior.

We identify two dissociable cognitive mechanisms driving these phenotypes. First, causal inference deficits drive punishment insensitivity and maladaptive behavior in Unawares. These individuals misattributed punishment, failing to correctly link their specific action to the delivery of punishment. These causal inference deficits explain why experiential feedback often fails to drive behavior change- a finding that has proved challenging to policies relying on punishments (e.g. fines, sanctions, etc) to correct behavior –. Importantly, these causal inference deficits were remediable via an information-based intervention. Second, failures in cognitive-behavioral integration in Compulsives rendered punishment inert. Even with accurate causal knowledge (achieved post-intervention), these individuals could not synthesize their causal knowledge with action selection processes to avoid further punishment. This integration failure, driving resistance to both punishment experience and remedial information, identifies a core mechanism explaining the limitation of fact-based interventions (e.g. warnings, public health campaigns,) at correcting behavior in some individuals and suggests that suboptimal choices in these individuals may require alternative approaches.

These cognitive mechanisms exhibited striking stability within an individual. Behavioral phenotyping at baseline predicted individuals' learning trajectories and choice patterns six months later. Moreover, behavioral phenotyping outperformed self-reported cognitive and behavioral flexibility in forecasting long-term learning and decision-making outcomes, underscoring its potential as an objective marker for assessing the cognitive mechanisms that place individuals at risk of chronic, maladaptive decision-making. By mapping stable punishment decision-making phenotypes to distinct cognitive mechanisms, our work advances a framework to stratify punishment sensitivity (e.g. distinguishing misattribution from integration deficits)and prioritize mechanism-targeted interventions that address the different cognitive drivers of poor decision-making.

### Decision making as a window on cognition [^113xgn6k]. Neuron (2013). Low credibility.

A decision is a commitment to a proposition or plan of action based on information and values associated with the possible outcomes. The process operates in a flexible timeframe that is free from the immediacy of evidence acquisition and the real time demands of action itself. Thus, it involves deliberation, planning, and strategizing. This Perspective focuses on perceptual decision making in nonhuman primates and the discovery of neural mechanisms that support accuracy, speed, and confidence in a decision. We suggest that these mechanisms expose principles of cognitive function in general, and we speculate about the challenges and directions before the field.

### Determining whether a patient is feeling better: pitfalls from the science of human perception [^1113z3ea]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Human perception is fallible and may lead patients to be inaccurate when judging whether their symptoms are improving with treatment. This article provides a narrative review of studies in psychology that describe misconceptions related to a patient's comprehension, recall, evaluation and expression. The specific misconceptions include the power of suggestion (placebo effects), desire for peace-of-mind (cognitive dissonance reduction), inconsistent standards (loss aversion), a flawed sense of time (duration neglect), limited perception (measurement error), declining sensitivity (Weber's law), an eagerness to please (social desirability bias), and subtle affirmation (personal control). An awareness of specific pitfalls might help clinicians avoid some mistakes when providing follow-up and interpreting changes in patient symptoms.

Psychosocial Considerations and the Regret Paradox

Despite limited goal attainment, it is common for surrogates to elect to continue LST. Literature on patient and family attitudes toward the continuation of LST after SABI indicates that even when patients do not recover to their preestablished goals, families often do not pursue D-WLST and do not regret having continued LST.

These observations establish an apparent "regret paradox", that is, when surrogates decide to continue LST to meet the patient's goals but those goals are not ultimately attained, surrogates often do not regret the decision to have continued LST and do not pursue D-WLST. There are several possible explanations for this paradox. First, after patients and surrogates discover what neurologic disability actually entails and that an acceptable quality of life may be possible despite it, their goals may change to accommodate the patient's current state. A related phenomenon, termed the "disability paradox", refers to the discrepancy between the poor quality of life that nondisabled individuals presume disability entails and the high quality of life often reported by those with disability. Second, cognitive dissonance may play a role, that is, some patients and surrogates may reconcile protracted, hard-fought rehabilitation with ultimately severe disability by concluding that such disability must have been worthwhile. Third, patients and surrogates may have mentally committed to the difficult road of recovery, and it may be emotionally difficult for them to change course, akin to a sunk-cost fallacy. Fourth, the challenges of D-WLST, both practically and psychologically, may be so overwhelming to surrogates that they prefer to maintain the patient's disabled state. Fifth, some surrogates may feel that due to psychological, cultural, or religious reasons, WLST was never a viable option in the first place. And lastly, it is possible that the data suggestive of a regret paradox are the result of a selection and survivorship bias, as patients who survive and families who opt to defer WLST may be enriched for individuals who more heavily favor LST and/or are less strongly tied to the initially established goals. It remains uncertain which of these factors, none of which are mutually exclusive, contribute most strongly to this observed regret paradox. More data will be necessary to elaborate on this phenomenon and to determine how patient and surrogates reflect on their decision-making during and after the consideration of D-WLST. Nevertheless, it is an important phenomenon to recognize and consider when counseling patients and surrogates about D-WLST, as it may be relevant for surrogates to know that perceptions of quality of life and goals may evolve over time (Table 2).

### The ease and sureness of a decision: evidence accumulation of conflict and uncertainty [^114QpZjA]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

The likelihood of an outcome (uncertainty or sureness) and the similarity between choices (conflict or ease of a decision) are often critical to decision-making. We often ask ourselves: how likely are we to win or lose? And how different is this option's likelihood from the other? Uncertainty is a characteristic of the stimulus and conflict between stimuli, but these dissociable processes are often confounded. Here, applying a novel hierarchical drift diffusion approach, we study their interaction using a sequential learning task in healthy volunteers and pathological groups characterized by compulsive behaviours, by posing it as an evidence accumulation problem. The variables, Conflict (difficult or easy; difference between reward probabilities of the stimuli) and Uncertainty (low, medium or high; inverse U-shaped probability-uncertainty function) were then used to extract threshold ('a', amount of evidence accumulated before making a decision) and drift rate ('v', information processing speed) parameters. Critically, when a decision was both difficult (high conflict) and uncertain, relative to other conditions, healthy volunteers unexpectedly accumulated less evidence with lower decision thresholds and accuracy rates at chance levels. In contrast, patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder had slower processing speeds during these difficult uncertain decisions; yet, despite this more cautious approach, performed suboptimally with poorer accuracy relative to healthy volunteers below that of chance level. Thus, faced with a difficult uncertain decision, healthy controls are capable of rapid possibly random decisions, displaying almost a willingness to 'walk away', whereas those with obsessive compulsive disorder become more deliberative and cautious but despite appearing to learn the differential contingencies, still perform poorly. These observations might underlie disordered behaviours characterized by pathological uncertainty or doubt despite compulsive checking with impaired performance. In contrast, alcohol-dependent subjects show a different pattern relative to healthy controls with difficulties in adjusting their behavioural patterns with slower drift rates or processing speed despite decisions being easy or low conflict. We emphasize the multidimensional nature of compulsive behaviours and the utility of computational models in detecting subtle underlying processes relative to behavioural measures. These observations have implications for targeted behavioural interventions for specific cognitive impairments across psychiatric disorders.

### Exaggerated frontoparietal control over cognitive effort-based decision-making in young women with anorexia nervosa [^116yurnd]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Effortful tasks are generally experienced as costly, but the value of work varies greatly across individuals and populations. While most mental health conditions are characterized by amotivation and effort avoidance, individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) persistently engage in effortful behaviors that most people find unrewarding (food restriction, excessive exercise). Current models of AN differentially attribute such extreme weight-control behavior to altered reward responding and exaggerated cognitive control. In a novel test of these theoretical accounts, we employed an established cognitive effort discounting paradigm in combination with fMRI in young acutely underweight female patients with AN (n = 48) and age-matched healthy controls (HC; n = 48). Contrary to the hypothesis that individuals with AN would experience cognitive effort (operationalized as N-back task performance) as less costly than HC participants, groups did not differ in the subjective value (SV) of discounted rewards or in SV-related activation of brain regions involved in reward valuation. Rather, all group differences in both behavior (superior N-back performance in AN and associated effort ratings) and fMRI activation (increased SV-related frontoparietal activation during decision-making in AN even for easier choices) were more indicative of increased control. These findings suggest that while effort discounting may be relatively intact in AN, effort investment is high both when performing demanding tasks and during effort-based decision-making; highlighting cognitive overcontrol as an important therapeutic target. Future research should establish whether exaggerated control during effort-based decision-making persists after weight-recovery and explore learning the value of effort in AN with tasks involving disorder-relevant effort demands and rewards.

### The limits of shared decision making [^112uUxmN]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Absence of or insufficient evidence of benefit

Scientific evidence for or against a course of action is a key determinant of how clinicians frame decisions in discussions with patients, although the influence of peers and accepted norms are arguably just as important. In some situations, for a range of reasons, increased attention is frequently given to the absence of evidence of net benefit, especially when the evidence is of low quality or contradictory.

There are three common situations where this may be the case.

When there is no evidence

For many options there is little to no research available to allow comparison. However, it is not unusual for patients to have strong prior beliefs about the need for a specific treatment or a test. The clinician may need to become better informed, or may already be aware that insufficient evidence exists, or that there is likely harm, and that acquiescing risks the prospect of delaying effective treatment. Both these scenarios require skilful negotiation for either more time to search for information or to provide reasons why the request for the option may be declined, especially if the option likely brings harm or an unjustified use of resources. Such discussions are made more complex when patients are exposed to media that promote novel healthcare developments. Honesty and transparency can guide communication, however, a consensus is often difficult to achieve. This situation is often one where clinical equipoise does not exist, and therefore places limits on SDM.

Scientific evidence of inferiority

Clinicians may also be unwilling to consider SDM when evidence exists in favour of some options compared with others, or where situations have high stakes and the use of effective treatment is considered imperative or is widely viewed as a standard of care, even if individual patient preferences vary. Clinicians report feeling a moral and professional obligation to recommend superior versus inferior options in such situations. They may feel the need to follow clinical guidelines and harbour concerns that they will be viewed as either incompetent or negligent for not adhering to professionally held norms. There is evidence that the willingness of clinicians to practice SDM varies, especially in the face of strong clinical practice recommendations.

### Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions [^114opJKY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Decision aids prepare people to participate in 'close call' decisions that involve weighing benefits, harms, and scientific uncertainty.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of decision aids for people facing difficult treatment or screening decisions.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (Ovid) (1966 to July 2006); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library; 2006, Issue 2); CINAHL (Ovid) (1982 to July 2006); EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to July 2006); and PsycINFO (Ovid) (1806 to July 2006). We contacted researchers active in the field up to December 2006. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included published RCTs of interventions designed to aid patients' decision making by providing information about treatment or screening options and their associated outcomes, compared to no intervention, usual care, and alternate interventions. We excluded studies in which participants were not making an active treatment or screening decision, or if the study's intervention was not available to determine that it met the minimum criteria to qualify as a patient decision aid.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts for inclusion, and extracted data from included studies using standardized forms. The primary outcomes focused on the effectiveness criteria of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration: attributes of the decision and attributes of the decision process. We considered other behavioural, health, and health system effects as secondary outcomes. We pooled results of RCTs using mean differences (MD) and relative risks (RR) using a random effects model.

Main Results

This update added 25 new RCTs, bringing the total to 55. Thirty-eight (69%) used at least one measure that mapped onto an IPDAS effectiveness criterion: decision attributes: knowledge scores (27 trials); accurate risk perceptions (11 trials); and value congruence with chosen option (4 trials); and decision process attributes: feeling informed (15 trials) and feeling clear about values (13 trials). This review confirmed the following findings from the previous (2003) review. Decision aids performed better than usual care interventions in terms of: a) greater knowledge (MD 15.2 out of 100; 95% CI 11.7 to 18.7); b) lower decisional conflict related to feeling uninformed (MD -8.3 of 100; 95% CI -11.9 to -4.8); c) lower decisional conflict related to feeling unclear about personal values (MD -6.4; 95% CI -10.0 to -2.7); d) reduced the proportion of people who were passive in decision making (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8); and e) reduced proportion of people who remained undecided post-intervention (RR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3 to 0.8). When simpler decision aids were compared to more detailed decision aids, the relative improvement was significant in knowledge (MD 4.6 out of 100; 95% CI 3.0 to 6.2) and there was some evidence of greater agreement between values and choice. In this review, we were able to explore the use of probabilities in decision aids. Exposure to a decision aid with probabilities resulted in a higher proportion of people with accurate risk perceptions (RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4 to 1.9). The effect was stronger when probabilities were measured quantitatively (RR 1.8; 95% CI 1.4 to 2.3) versus qualitatively (RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5). As in the previous review, exposure to decision aids continued to demonstrate reduced rates of: elective invasive surgery in favour of conservative options, decision aid versus usual care (RR 0.8; 95% CI 0.6 to 0.9); and use of menopausal hormones, detailed versus simple aid (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6 to 1.0). There is now evidence that exposure to decision aids results in reduced PSA screening, decision aid versus usual care (RR 0.8; 95% CI 0.7 to 1.0). For other decisions, the effect on decisions remains variable. As in the previous review, decision aids are no better than comparisons in affecting satisfaction with decision making, anxiety, and health outcomes. The effects of decision aids on other outcomes (patient-practitioner communication, consultation length, continuance, resource use) were inconclusive. There were no trials evaluating the IPDAS decision process criteria relating to helping patients to recognize a decision needs to be made, understand that values affect the decision, or discuss values with the practitioner.

Authors' Conclusions

Patient decision aids increase people's involvement and are more likely to lead to informed values-based decisions; however, the size of the effect varies across studies. Decision aids have a variable effect on decisions. They reduce the use of discretionary surgery without apparent adverse effects on health outcomes or satisfaction. The degree of detail patient decision aids require for positive effects on decision quality should be explored. The effects on continuance with chosen option, patient-practitioner communication, consultation length, and cost-effectiveness need further evaluation.

### Experience-based risk taking is primarily shaped by prior learning rather than by decision-making [^113eJqo2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The tendency to embrace or avoid risk varies across and within individuals, with significant consequences for economic behavior and mental health. Such variations can partially be explained by differences in the relative weights given to potential gains and losses. Applying this insight to real-life decisions, however, is complicated because such decisions are often based on prior learning experiences. Here, we ask which cognitive process — decision-making or learning — determines the weighting of gains or losses? Over 28 days, 100 participants engaged in a longitudinal decision task wherein choices were based on prior learning. Computational modeling of participants' choices revealed that changes in risk-taking are primarily explained by changes in how learning, not decisions, weight gains and losses. Moreover, inferred changes in learning manifested in participants' neural and physiological learning signals in response to outcomes. We conclude that in experience-based decisions, learning plays a primary role in governing risk-taking behavior.

### Confidence reports during perceptual decision making dissociate from changes in subjective experience [^113Np6hb]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

In noisy perceptual environments, people frequently make decisions based on non-perceptual information to maximize rewards. Therefore, a central problem in psychophysics, metacognition and consciousness research is to distinguish between decisions resulting from changes in subjective experience and those arising from non-perceptual information. It has recently been proposed that confidence reports can be used to discriminate between changes in subjective experience and those arising from non-perceptual information. Here we use a Bayesian ordinal modelling framework combined with an explicit measure of subjective experience to show across two experiments (N = 204) and three bias manipulations that confidence during perceptual decision-making does not uniquely reflect subjective experience. Instead, non-perceptual manipulations affecting response bias 'leak' into perceptual confidence reports. This occurs not only for biases resulting from changes in the base rate of stimuli ('cognitive' priors), but also when biasing information does not inform decision correctness (asymmetric payoff matrix). The relative strength of biases in first-order responses and confidence may help disentangle whether a given bias manipulation is perceptual in nature or not.

### The suboptimality of perceptual decision making with multiple alternatives [^111j9QZg]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

It is becoming widely appreciated that human perceptual decision making is suboptimal but the nature and origins of this suboptimality remain poorly understood. Most past research has employed tasks with two stimulus categories, but such designs cannot fully capture the limitations inherent in naturalistic perceptual decisions where choices are rarely between only two alternatives. We conduct four experiments with tasks involving multiple alternatives and use computational modeling to determine the decision-level representation on which the perceptual decisions are based. The results from all four experiments point to the existence of robust suboptimality such that most of the information in the sensory representation is lost during the transformation to a decision-level representation. These results reveal severe limits in the quality of decision-level representations for multiple alternatives and have strong implications about perceptual decision making in naturalistic settings.

### Causal inference and cognitive-behavioral integration deficits drive stable variation in human punishment sensitivity [^116zsVzF]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Some individuals persist in behaviors that incur harm to themselves or others. While adaptive decision-making requires integrating such punishment feedback to update action selection, the mechanisms driving individual differences in this capacity remain unclear. Here, in a sample spanning 24 countries (N = 267), we used a conditioned punishment task to identify how individuals learn from and adapt to punishment. We identified three, behaviorally robust phenotypes: (1) Sensitive, who correctly inferred punishment causality and adaptively updated decisions through direct experience of punishment; (2) Unaware, who failed to correctly infer punishment causality from direct experience but corrected their decisions following an informational intervention clarifying consequences; and (3) Compulsive, who persisted in harmful decisions despite both punishment and informational intervention. These phenotypes were driven by distinct cognitive mechanisms: (1) causal inference deficits, where individuals misinterpreted punishment causality, impairing correct knowledge acquisition (remediable via targeted informational intervention); and (2) integration failure, a deficit in synthesizing causal knowledge, action valuation, and action selection that rendered decision-making inert to punishment feedback, even after targeted informational intervention. Remarkably, these phenotypes predicted longitudinal outcomes (learning trajectories, choice behavior) six months later. By identifying the cognitive mechanisms driving variation in human punishment learning, this work provides a framework to understand why individuals persist in harmful behavior and highlights the need for approaches to address these distinct cognitive barriers to adaptive decision-making.

### Effects of a cognitive dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program are similar for Asian American, hispanic, and white participants [^115kvS4i]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This study explored the effects of participating in a dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program on changes in thin ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, and eating symptoms among White, Asian American, and Hispanic participants.

Method

Participants were (n = 394), 13 to 20-year-old adolescent girls and young women who reported being White (n = 311), Hispanic/Latina (n = 61), or Asian-American/Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (n = 33). The current study used data drawn from the pre- and post assessments of an efficacy trial and an effectiveness trial of this eating disorder prevention program.

Results

The intervention reduced disordered eating behaviors and eating disorder risk factors for all three ethnic groups at post-intervention assessment; there was no evidence of significantly stronger effects in any particular ethnic group.

Conclusion

Results suggest that a cognitive dissonance-based prevention program for eating disorders may be equally effective for Asian American, Hispanic, and White adolescent women.

### Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions [^114Fssab]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Decision aids prepare people to participate in preference-sensitive decisions.

Objectives

1. Create a comprehensive inventory of patient decision aids focused on healthcare options. 2. Review randomized controlled trials (RCT) of decision aids, for people facing healthcare decisions.

Search Strategy

Studies were identified through databases and contact with researchers active in the field.

Selection Criteria

Two independent reviewers screened abstracts for interventions designed to aid patients' decision making by providing information about treatment or screening options and their associated outcomes. Information about the decision aids was compiled in an inventory; those that had been evaluated in a RCT were reviewed in detail.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data using standardized forms. Results of RCTs were pooled using weighted mean differences (WMD) and relative risks (RR) using a random effects model.

Main Results

Over 200 decision aids were identified. Of the 131 available decision aids, most are intended for use before counselling. Using the CREDIBLE criteria to evaluate the quality of the decision aids: a) most included potential harms and benefits, credentials of the developers, description of their development process, update policy, and were free of perceived conflict of interest; b) many included reference to relevant literature; c) few included a description of the level of uncertainty regarding the evidence; and d) few were evaluated. Thirty of these decision aids were evaluated in 34 RCTs and another trial evaluated a suite of eight decision aids. An additional 30 trials are yet to be published. Among the trials comparing decision aids to usual care, decision aids performed better in terms of: a) greater knowledge (WMD 19 out of 100, 95% CI: 13 to 24; b) more realistic expectations (RR 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1 to 1.9); c) lower decisional conflict related to feeling informed (WMD -9.1 of 100, 95%CI: -12 to -6); d) increased proportion of people active in decision making (RR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.3); and e) reduced proportion of people who remained undecided post intervention (RR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.3 to 0.7). When simpler were compared to more detailed decision aids, the relative improvement was significant in: a) knowledge (WMD 4 out of 100, 95% CI: 3 to 6); b) more realistic expectations (RR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.3 to 1.7); and c) greater agreement between values and choice. Decision aids appeared to do no better than comparisons in affecting satisfaction with decision making, anxiety, and health outcomes. Decision aids had a variable effect on which healthcare options were selected.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The availability of decision aids is expanding with many on the Internet; however few have been evaluated. Trials indicate that decision aids improve knowledge and realistic expectations; enhance active participation in decision making; lower decisional conflict; decrease the proportion of people remaining undecided, and improve agreement between values and choice. The effects on persistence with chosen therapies and cost-effectiveness require further evaluation. Finally, optimal strategies for dissemination need to be explored.

### Choice certainty is informed by both evidence and decision time [^1126HVWB]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

"Degree of certainty" refers to the subjective belief, prior to feedback, that a decision is correct. A reliable estimate of certainty is essential for prediction, learning from mistakes, and planning subsequent actions when outcomes are not immediate. It is generally thought that certainty is informed by a neural representation of evidence at the time of a decision. Here we show that certainty is also informed by the time taken to form the decision. Human subjects reported simultaneously their choice and confidence about the direction of a noisy display of moving dots. Certainty was inversely correlated with reaction times and directly correlated with motion strength. Moreover, these correlations were preserved even for error responses, a finding that contradicts existing explanations of certainty based on signal detection theory. We also contrived a stimulus manipulation that led to longer decision times without affecting choice accuracy, thus demonstrating that deliberation time itself informs the estimate of certainty. We suggest that elapsed decision time informs certainty because it serves as a proxy for task difficulty.

### Prediction accuracy of discrete choice experiments in health-related research: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LL391]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Third, DCE predictions may suffer due to assumption of rational choice inherent in DCEs, whereas the body of work from behavioural economics suggests people may often act 'irrationally' due to cognitive biases such as anchoring bias, availability heuristic, framing effects or optimism bias. For example, in the HIV prevention studies, this rational approach is being applied in a heightened emotional context of a sex act, and actual behaviour might not be a balanced evaluation of all evidence. As such, the individual's choice is no longer irrational, which violates the assumption of DCE, and thus affecting DCE's predictive accuracy. Another example is the intention–behaviour gap, resulting in individuals not always acting according to their stated intentions. For instance, when individuals are far from making a decision, they might commit to a significant course of action, such as quitting smoking. However, as the decision moment approaches, they may opt for a small reward, such as having a cigarette. This phenomenon of hyperbolic discounting indicates that the passage of time alters the perception of the situation and choices, potentially accounting for discrepancies between DCE predictions and actual behaviour. Furthermore, the external validity of DCEs might be influenced by the hot-cold empathy gap, where individuals underestimate the impact of emotional states on their decision-making. For example, decisions made in a 'cold' state when completing the survey (e.g. choice to use a condom) might be very different from a 'hot' state when the individual is confronted with the actual decision within context (e.g. before having sex). Emotional states can also distort how individuals perceive risks associated with medical interventions. Hence, this poses a challenge to the predictive accuracy of DCE findings in real-world scenarios where emotional states are subjected to fluctuations. More research is needed to expand our understanding of how these effects inherent in individuals impact the ability for DCEs to predict actual behaviours, and thus, how they can be adjusted for when collecting data within surveys.

### Biased belief updating and suboptimal choice in foraging decisions [^114xGfLu]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Deciding which options to engage, and which to forego, requires developing accurate beliefs about the overall distribution of prospects. Here we adapt a classic prey selection task from foraging theory to examine how individuals keep track of an environment's reward rate and adjust choices in response to its fluctuations. Preference shifts were most pronounced when the environment improved compared to when it deteriorated. This is best explained by a trial-by-trial learning model in which participants estimate the reward rate with upward vs. downward changes controlled by separate learning rates. A failure to adjust expectations sufficiently when an environment becomes worse leads to suboptimal choices: options that are valuable given the environmental conditions are rejected in the false expectation that better options will materialize. These findings offer a previously unappreciated parallel in the serial choice setting of observations of asymmetric updating and resulting biased (often overoptimistic) estimates in other domains.

### Affective integration in experience, judgment, and decision-making [^117FYU8L]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Still, it is difficult to answer the question "what is the role of affect in judgment and decision making?" as there are many contradictory observations explained through a large array of theoretical mediators. For instance, positive affect is associated with increased risk-taking in some studies (a mood-congruent, informational effect e.g. –) and decreased risk-taking in others (a mood-incongruent effect e.g. –). Affect-as-information account may predict that positive affect increases the perceived value of winning and thus drive risk taking for a potential gain. Affect-as-motivation, on the other hand, may predict that positive affect attributed to better-than-expected progress could cause individuals to be more risk-averse to protect their mood state. The prediction of affect-as-a-spotlight view would depend on how the probability information is weighted. As a result, an intense positive affect may increase risk taking for a small probability gain but not so much for a high probability gain. Thus, whether the valence of an incidental mood increases or decreases risk-taking depends upon which mechanism dominates. However, the research paradigms used in linking affect and decision-making are often unable to arbitrate between these alternative mechanisms. One reason for this is that many studies tend to focus on connecting a feeling state to an increased or a decreased tendency for a certain response. Recent advances in psychological science underlines the shortcomings of this type of essentialist feeling-to-behavior mapping that overlooks contextual factors –. Second, affect is often operationalized as feeling states that is implicitly (due to study design and methods) or explicitly (to simplify the problem) assumed to be static and limited in time to only here and now, a typical manifestation of the snapshot approach, which do not account for the fact that mental states and behavior are temporally dependent. Third, the traditional scientific paradigm in psychological research regards context effects as nuisance or moderators of underlying processes that can be removed by study design and analysis, e.g. by randomizing trials and analyzing summary scores. Collectively, these approaches are representative of a problem that is prevalent in the vast bulk of the paradigms and data on this topic – we effectively ignore the temporal nature of mental states and its dynamic impact on judgments and decisions. We argue that by ignoring the continuous nature of affect, the field can make little progress beyond simple models, and a better and systematic understanding of the mechanism through which affect influence judgments and decisions will be hard to achieve. To reconcile this issue, we suggest that there is a need to adopt an approach that attempts to understand how affect is constructed from the ongoing information flow and how this evolving state modulates information processing feeding into judgments and decisions continuously (for a similar approach, see).

### Contextual factors in shared decision making: a randomised controlled trial in women with a strong suspicion of breast cancer [^115Kw9aQ]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Satisfaction with the decision making process and general patient satisfaction with care was high and did not differ between groups. Though physicians involved in the patients' treatment did not see patients' assessment of treatment satisfaction, ratings were not blind to the research psychologists who performed the intervention. This may have lead to social desirability with regard to the evaluation of the decision aid intervention but may have had little impact on ratings of satisfaction with treatment. Variance constriction because of a ceiling effect may have contributed to the lack of a group difference. Results are in line with other studies, which reported null effects of decision aids on satisfaction judgements, whereas some studies demonstrated short or long-term effects. Discrepant findings may be related to individual differences in cognitive processing of the decision making phase on which the decision aids also have an impact. For most women with breast cancer the treatment-planning phase is a highly remembered time point in the disease trajectory. Many women feel relief post-treatment, experience few decisional conflict and satisfaction with treatment. On the other hand, some patients experience ongoing doubts and uncertainty whether they have undergone the 'right' treatment or even experience feelings of regret for not having taken some aspects into consideration they value important in retrospect. The degree to which patients experience high uncertainty or regret could both depend on situation-specific experiences how their treatment decision making occurred as well as on a rather stable personality trait of frequent rumination. These patient characteristics may interact with decision aid interventions on outcome measures.

### Dissonance thin-ideal and didactic healthy behavior eating disorder prevention programs: results from a controlled trial [^115FK3Gc]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Negative body image, a common problem among college-age women in the United States, strongly correlates with low self-esteem, disturbed eating behavior, and eating disorders. Psychoeducational programs have inconsistently shown improvement in body image, thin-ideal internalization, eating behaviors, psychosocial functioning, and self-esteem.

Method

In the current study, college women with body image concerns (N = 84) were randomly assigned to a cognitive dissonance-based, thin-ideal internalization, single-session workshop (DTI; n = 26); a psychoeducational, healthy behavior, single-session workshop (HB; n = 24); or a wait-list control (WL; n = 34).

Results

Comparing baseline data with 4-week follow-up data, results indicated that both DTI and HB participants reported improvement in body image, thin-ideal internalization, and eating behaviors.

Discussion

Results provide evidence that both interventions effectively reduce risk factors for eating pathology.

### Affective integration in experience, judgment, and decision-making [^114vdzH5]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Judgment formation through information sampling and integration

A domain in which modeling affective integration is likely to contribute greatly is judgment formation. Judgments are formed through a continued accumulation of information over time, which is not an isolated process. Goals and beliefs guide attention, which may naturally result in a skewed sampling of information, favoring evidence that supports prior views. In fact, humans exhibit information avoidance, confirmatory sampling of evidence, and misinterpretation of information. Some theories underline the role of affective processes in biased judgment formation e.g. Facing disconfirming evidence about an existing judgment may induce a negative affective state characterized by tension, discomfort, and arousal. The individual may be motivated to reduce negative affect through selective sampling, avoidance, and misinterpretation of information. It was also suggested that the decision maker accumulates evidence to make the chosen alternative as strong as possible with motivations to reduce pre-decision conflict and post-decision regret. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence for the direct impact of affective processes on skewed information sampling and biased judgments is limited. Considering affective state fluctuations during evidence accumulation may be necessary to understand the specific role of affect in biased and unbiased judgment formation.

There are several candidate mechanisms through which affect can temporarily influence information processing during evidence accumulation. First, affect can modulate attention in an affect-congruent manner, such that individuals are more likely to attend to stimuli that are congruent with their affective state. In connection to this, it was shown that evidence accumulation to reach an undesirable conclusion is faster when under perceived threat in comparison to a neutral state. Second, recent studies in perceptual decision-making show that phasic changes in arousal may reduce the weight of prior expectations during evidence accumulation. It has also been suggested that an increase in arousal can upregulate the efficiency of evidence accumulation. Third, observed consequences of actions (including counterfactual information) may generate prediction error signals. As we have discussed before, prediction errors induce changes in affect, which in turn may influence sampling and processing of new information. Taken together, a systematic investigation that combines computational models of evidence accumulation and affect dynamics may be fruitful to test the specific involvement of affect in biased and unbiased judgment formation (for an approach to test specific hypotheses, see BOX 3).

### Confidence drives a neural confirmation bias [^112SiTEK]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

A prominent source of polarised and entrenched beliefs is confirmation bias, where evidence against one's position is selectively disregarded. This effect is most starkly evident when opposing parties are highly confident in their decisions. Here we combine human magnetoencephalography (MEG) with behavioural and neural modelling to identify alterations in post-decisional processing that contribute to the phenomenon of confirmation bias. We show that holding high confidence in a decision leads to a striking modulation of post-decision neural processing, such that integration of confirmatory evidence is amplified while disconfirmatory evidence processing is abolished. We conclude that confidence shapes a selective neural gating for choice-consistent information, reducing the likelihood of changes of mind on the basis of new information. A central role for confidence in shaping the fidelity of evidence accumulation indicates that metacognitive interventions may help ameliorate this pervasive cognitive bias.

### Causal role of a neural system for separating and selecting multidimensional social cognitive information [^111qQtus]. Neuron (2023). Medium credibility.

Effect of relevant and irrelevant traits on choice

We first assessed whether participants based their social comparisons on the relevant trait domain only or whether there was an additional influence of the irrelevant trait domains. To this end, we ran a logistic mixed effects model in which we predicted trial-by-trial choices using the parametric differences between characters along the relevant trait (relevant value difference) and irrelevant traits (irrelevant value difference) as well as their interaction (see LMM1 [Linear models for behavioral data analysis] in STAR Methods). In all linear regression models, we assessed the statistical significance of model parameters by F-statistics (see STAR Methods). In all other cases, we used Wilcoxon signed-rank test for hypothesis testing and applied Holm-Bonferroni correction (HBC) for multiple comparison, where applicable. As expected, the relevant trait had a positive effect: the larger the difference between the characters in the relevant trait domain, the more likely participants were to select the character with higher ability within this domain (Figure 2 B; β ± 95% CI = 0.29 ± 0.03, F(1,29) = 371, p < 0.001, HBC). Notably, the irrelevant traits (defined as the average across irrelevant traits) also had a positive effect, with participants more likely to select the character of higher ability within the irrelevant trait domains (Figure 2 B; β ± 95% CI = 0.03 ± 0.02, F(1,29) = 9, p < 0.01, HBC). Finally, there was a marginally significant positive interaction between relevant and irrelevant traits, indicating that the impact of the relevant value difference depended on the irrelevant value difference and vice versa (Figure 2 B; β ± 95% CI = 0.01 ± 0.01, F(1,208) = 3.67, p = 0.05, HBC). We highlight that the differences between characters in relevant and irrelevant traits were uncorrelated, both by design and empirically (Figure S1). We also tested two alternative models, but our logistic model that we explained above provided a better fit (Figure S1).

### How disconfirmatory evidence shapes confidence in decision-making [^112pCSuz]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Empirically testing the model's prediction

The c-LPR models with the compression parameter showed superior fit, letting us conclude that the closeness to the category boundary is the deciding factor underlying the RIE effect. Based on this observation, a crucial prediction from our model is that the RIE effect should entirely depend on the position of the category boundary. However, this is simply a prediction made by the model and therefore needs to be tested empirically. As described in the "Methods", we therefore designed a preregistered experiment in which participants categorized the exact same purple stimuli (consisting of eight colored elements) twice: once in the context of blue stimuli composed of eight elements (i.e. Blue Context) and once in the context of red stimuli composed of eight elements (i.e. Red Context; Fig. 3A). Contrasting the exact same purple elements dependent on the color context they appear in allows us to see whether physically identical elements will be assigned different confidence weights once the task-relevant feature space is shifted. In other words, do participants really base their confidence more on incongruent elements, regardless of where the elements fall in the color space? The key results of this experiment are presented in Fig. 3B: First, we replicated the RIE effect in this new dataset (cf. Supplementary Note 2). Second, as hypothesized, the direction of the RIE effect depended on the color context (Hypothesis 4). In the Blue Context, confidence for the purple stimuli over-relied on the 'blueish' items. In the Red Context, on the other hand, confidence for the purple stimuli over-relied on the 'reddish' items. Post-hoc contrasts indeed found a significant negative slope for purple trials in the Blue Context, β = 45.11, SE = 11.54, z = 3.91, p < 0.001, and a positive slope for purple trials in the Red Context, β = 39.88, SE = 11.72, z = 3.40, p < 0.001. The error bars in Fig. 3B are noticeably larger than those in Fig. 2. This is unsurprising, as the data in Fig. 3B is based on only N = 32 participants, whereas the previous analysis in Fig. 2 was conducted on a larger sample of N = 176 participants. The full statistics together with all our other preregistered analyses including results for the blue and red categories are listed in Supplementary Note 2 (see Table S3 and Figs. S7 and S8).

### ACOG committee opinion no. 758: promoting healthy relationships in adolescents [^111RzKRB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Understanding adolescent development — counseling approaches differ across age groups due to cognitive differences and decision-making limitations. Young adolescents "(12–14 year olds) are typically concrete thinkers with poor or inconsistent abstract reasoning or problem-solving skills", whereas "Middle-aged adolescents (15–17 year-olds) often assume they are invulnerable", and "older females (18–21 year olds) have acquired problem-solving abilities and have relatively consistent abstract reasoning". Accordingly, "the clinical approach to counseling a cognitively younger adolescent will differ from the approach taken with a cognitively older adolescent or an adult", and "adolescents may have limitations to their capacity for consequential thought and ability to imagine alternative outcomes… thus, judgement can lag, and adolescents may not always make wise or healthy decisions". Adolescence is also framed as a period to learn "compromise, negotiation, conflict resolution, setting healthy boundaries, and other potentially protective behavior".

### Escalation of commitment in the surgical ICU [^1162HMTJ]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Escalation of commitment is a business term that describes the continued investment of resources into a project even after there is objective evidence of the project's impending failure. Escalation of commitment may be a contributor to high healthcare costs associated with critically ill patients as it has been shown that, despite almost certain futility, most ICU costs are incurred in the last week of life. Our objective was to determine if escalation of commitment occurs in healthcare settings, specifically in the surgical ICU. We hypothesize that factors previously identified in business and organizational psychology literature including self-justification, accountability, sunk costs, and cognitive dissonance result in escalation of commitment behavior in the surgical ICU setting resulting in increased utilization of resources and cost.

Design

A descriptive case study that illustrates common ICU narratives in which escalation of commitment can occur. In addition, we describe factors that are thought to contribute to escalation of commitment behaviors.

Main Results

Escalation of commitment behavior was observed with self-justification, accountability, and cognitive dissonance accounting for the majority of the behavior. Unlike in business decisions, sunk costs was not as evident. In addition, modulating factors such as personality, individual experience, culture, and gender were identified as contributors to escalation of commitment.

Conclusions

Escalation of commitment occurs in the surgical ICU, resulting in significant expenditure of resources despite a predicted and often known poor outcome. Recognition of this phenomenon may lead to actions aimed at more rational decision making and may contribute to lowering healthcare costs. Investigation of objective measures that can help aid decision making in the surgical ICU is warranted.

### Reminders of past choices bias decisions for reward in humans [^115ph9BB]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

We provide evidence that decisions are made by consulting memories for individual past experiences, and that this process can be biased in favour of past choices using incidental reminders. First, in a standard rewarded choice task, we show that a model that estimates value at decision-time using individual samples of past outcomes fits choices and decision-related neural activity better than a canonical incremental learning model. In a second experiment, we bias this sampling process by incidentally reminding participants of individual past decisions. The next decision after a reminder shows a strong influence of the action taken and value received on the reminded trial. These results provide new empirical support for a decision architecture that relies on samples of individual past choice episodes rather than incrementally averaged rewards in evaluating options and has suggestive implications for the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms.

### A perspective on judgment and choice: mapping bounded rationality [^111JUP59]. The American Psychologist (2003). Low credibility.

Early studies of intuitive judgment and decision making conducted with the late Amos Tversky are reviewed in the context of two related concepts: an analysis of accessibility, the ease with which thoughts come to mind; a distinction between effortless intuition and deliberate reasoning. Intuitive thoughts, like percepts, are highly accessible. Determinants and consequences of accessibility help explain the central results of prospect theory, framing effects, the heuristic process of attribute substitution, and the characteristic biases that result from the substitution of nonextensional for extensional attributes. Variations in the accessibility of rules explain the occasional corrections of intuitive judgments. The study of biases is compatible with a view of intuitive thinking and decision making as generally skilled and successful.

### Mixed methods realist evaluation of a co-designed intervention to promote shared decision-making with frail older adults, planning discharge from hospital: a protocol [^1174Yqft]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Hospital discharge of older patients is a high-risk situation in terms of patient safety with deficits in the quality of discharge documentation causing confusion among patients and informal caregivers. In 2016, the National Audit Office reported that older people occupy 62% of hospital bed days and are the group most likely to experience delayed discharges. It also identified difficulties with hospital staff maintaining knowledge of out-of-hospital services and a lack of shared understanding of what skills are needed for good discharge planning. Prolonged hospital stays can significantly impede patients' recovery, negatively affecting anything from physical health via issues like hospital-acquired infections and increased complications due to immobility to psychological health. For this reason, coordination of continued care and support at home is a growing area of focus in both research and policy making. A recent Cochrane review concluded that a structured discharge plan that is tailored to the individual patient probably brings about a small reduction in the initial hospital length of stay and readmissions to hospital for older people with a medical condition. Accordingly, recent guidance on hospital discharge from the Department of Health and Social Care insists that effective discharge planning can best be achieved through shared decision-making (SDM). That is, providing tailored, person-centred, strengths-based choice for individuals, who should be supported to make fully informed decisions, with input from their relatives or unpaid carers if they wish. Decisions such as care management, emergency planning, readmission risk and caregiver involvement.

However, despite efforts to improve the discharge planning process and subsequent outcomes, existing mechanisms fail to accurately identify older person's needs for follow-up care thus SDM remains challenging for both patients and healthcare professionals.

It is often hindered by time constraints, professionals not understanding or valuing SDM, patients lacking knowledge and confidence to participate, poor communication, and lack of trust between patients and professionals. Organisational barriers include lack of formal training for healthcare professionals, busy ward environments, lack of private spaces, and absent guidance and leadership for SDM. These barriers are exacerbated for frail older people facing discharge from hospital, due to patients' cognitive or physical impairments, limited communication skills among health professionals, risk averse approaches to discharge, limited family carer engagement, and organizational barriers, such as time pressure and high patient through-put.

### Listeners' perceptions of the certainty and honesty of a speaker are associated with a common prosodic signature [^11233JQB]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For each pair of stimuli and repetition, the SDT model with response bias c selects the stimulus presented in interval 1 if (s i + σ ir) < c, and the stimulus presented in interval 2 otherwise. There is agreement between the two repetitions (i.e. pc_agree = 1) if ((s i + σ i 1) > c and (s i + σ i 2) > c) or if ((s i + σ i 1) < c and (s i + σ i 2) < c). We ran computational simulations based on this formula to assess pc_agree and pc_int1 (averaged over the two repetitions) for different values of σ and c. A fitting procedure was then used to search for the specific values of σ and c that minimized the mean-square error between the values of pc_agree and pc_int1 predicted by the above model and the empirical estimates of pc_agree and pc_int1 observed in each task. Critically for the present study, this procedure allows controlling two aspects. First, it allows us to check that the observations made from the percentage of agreement are robust after accounting for interval response bias: the percentage of agreement does not return a transparent measure of consistency in a task where there is no ground truth, in particular because of potential response bias(e.g. imagine participants who would select response B after every trial: their percentage of agreement would be 100%, but this would be related to a strong decisional bias rather than choice consistency). In comparison, the internal noise values estimated with the SDT model accounting for response bias described above do return a transparent, readily interpretable image of individuals' consistency. Second, consistency estimates previously reported in the psychophysical literature are most often expressed in terms of internal noise (in units of external noise), because it allows comparing tasks related to different stimuli dimensions and involving different difficulties. Thus converting percentage of agreement values into internal noise estimates also allows us to compare our values to these references. Only values that fell within the interpretable range [0.2; 5] returned by the SDT modelwere considered for analyses (which was the case for 18 out of the 19 participants).

### Individual differences in decision making competence revealed by multivariate fMRI [^112ogbTx]. Human Brain Mapping (2018). Low credibility.

While an extensive literature in decision neuroscience has elucidated the neurobiological foundations of decision making, prior research has focused primarily on group-level effects in a sample population. Due to the presence of inherent differences between individuals' cognitive abilities, it is also important to examine the neural correlates of decision making that explain interindividual variability in cognitive performance. This study therefore investigated how individual differences in decision making competence, as measured by the Adult Decision Making Competence (A-DMC) battery, are related to functional brain connectivity patterns derived from resting-state fMRI data in a sample of 304 healthy participants. We examined connectome-wide associations, identifying regions within frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex that demonstrated significant associations with decision making competence. We then assessed whether the functional interactions between brain regions sensitive to decision making competence and seven intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) were predictive of specific facets of decision making assessed by subtests of the A-DMC battery. Our findings suggest that individual differences in specific facets of decision making competence are mediated by ICNs that support executive, social, and perceptual processes, and motivate an integrative framework for understanding the neural basis of individual differences in decision making competence.

### Altered social decision making in patients with chronic pain [^115E9X81]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Our findings also critically extend the existing literature on perceived injustice and pain outcomes. This growing body of research suggests that questionnaire scores of perceived injustice related to the origin and consequences of acute and chronic pain are correlated with a higher disability, greater pain severity, lower social functions, and a higher prevalence of depression (e.g. Scott & Sullivan; Sturgeon et al; Sturgeon, Ziadni, Trost, Darnall, & Mackey; Sullivan, Scott, & Trost; Trost et al; Yakobov et al.). In their recent reviews, Carriere et al. and Lynch et al. highlight that the self-report measure used in almost all of this research, the injustice experiences questionnaire (Sullivan et al.), is likely to confound subjective perceptions of injustices and objective injustices (the prevalence of which may vary considerably across individuals with chronic pain). In the current study, we demonstrate that chronic pain patients respond stronger to experimentally controlled, i.e. objectively matched, social inequity than healthy controls, avoiding this pitfall. Secondly, our results show – for the first time - that fairness-related judgments unrelated to the chronic pain condition itself are also systematically altered in chronic pain patients compared to those observed in healthy controls. This is relevant to the question of the nature of the relationship between perceived injustice and health outcomes. While previous studies are almost exclusively correlational in nature and lack a guiding conceptual framework, the dominant view in the literature is that injustice perceptions arise from experienced violations of human rights, equity norms or just word beliefs (McParland & Eccleston; McParland, Knussen, & Murray; Monden, Trost, Scott, Bogart, & Driver,) and are an antecedent of depressive symptoms and pain chronification (Lynch et al.). We were not able to assess the pre-morbid social preferences of our patients. However, we reason that a shift in fairness judgments and responses to social inequity could plausibly also be a cognitive−affective consequence of chronic pain itself or of the systematic changes in brain function observed in chronic pain. Pain and social inequity are both thought to activate our alarm system to protect us from physical harm and social exploitation, respectively. And, there is some tentative evidence that activation of this system by one of these two factors may increase vigilance or sensitivity to the other as well. In healthy volunteers, sensitivity to physical pain increases after an experimentally induced experience of disadvantageous social inequity (Zhang, Wang, Sun, & Xie, experiment 3) and of social rejection (Eisenberger, Jarcho, Lieberman, & Naliboff,) as well as following recall of an experience injustice (McParland et al.). While an effect in the opposite direction has not yet been tested, it is plausible that the pain that our patients experienced during testing (see Table 1) increased their vigilance for social equity too, and thereby made them respond more strongly to it. Given that individual differences in pain sensitivity have been shown to correlate with rejection rates in the UG in healthy subjects (Wang, Li, & Xie, experiment 3) and since pain sensitivity is increased in chronic pain patients (e.g. Compton, Wasser, & Cheatle; Ruscheweyh et al.), a complementary explanation could be that vigilance to social inequity is tonically increased in chronic pain patients as compared to healthy controls, independent of the concurrent pain experience.

### Cognitive debiasing 2: impediments to and strategies for change [^115LskFP]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Transtheoretical model of change.

Many clinicians presently appear to be at the precontemplative level. They may be unaware of the powerful influence of unconscious factors on their reasoning, may not realise that cognitive and affective biases can affect their decision making, and therefore, see no reason to take any action to change their thinking. Introducing these ideas and raising awareness is a prerequisite for debiasing. Sometimes a sentinel event can catalyse the uptake of an important idea such as the publication of Groopman's book How Doctors Think. Conventional forms of information exchange, such as rounds, seminars, and morbidity and mortality conferences, may provide opportunities to address cognitive pitfalls within the context of engaging case examples. At times, however, a single experience, which can be shared in such moments, can change thinking. This happens especially if the event is emotionally laden because we tend to be particularly influenced by emotionally arousing experiences. For example, if a physician misdiagnoses a headache as benign and the patient subsequently dies from a subarachnoid haemorrhage, the powerful impact of this experience might produce long-standing changes in the physician's approach towards the diagnosis of patients presenting with headache.

Increasing physicians' awareness of the need for debiasing does not guarantee, however, that debiasing actually occurs. Indeed, since Fischoff's pioneering work, a general mood of gloom and doom towards cognitive debiasing in the psychology and medical literature seems to have prevailed; it is accepted to be a difficult but not an impossible task. A variety of factors may explain the intractability of cognitive bias and why it is so difficult to change. In addition to lack of awareness of the impact of bias in clinical reasoning, clinicians' overconfidence in their own judgements may be one of the most powerful factors preventing debiasing. Even those physicians who are aware of the potential impact of biases on clinical judgement may not believe that they are vulnerable to them. Moreover, it is a human tendency to bolster existent beliefs rather than searching for new approaches, and it is easier to stay with the status quo rather than make efforts to learn new approaches and change current practice. Physicians are not immune to these tendencies. Finally, the invariably abstract, arid form of the discussions of cognitive processes contributes to these impediments: they typically lack the vividness and concrete nature of clinical disease presentations that are more appealing to clinicians.

### Biased expectations about future choice options predict sequential economic decisions [^117PVYTK]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Theoretical models

The purpose of the Ideal Observer described above was to assess bias, not to theoretically explain participants' bias. By the definition of an ideal observer, its parameter values should be fixed to ground truths established by the experimental design. Because of this feature, however, optimality models, in general, are not appropriate for use as theoretical models of potentially biased human sampling and choice behaviour, without modification added to account for sources of individual variability in bias. That is, the Ideal Observer only models the computations leading to accurate choices but not to systematic sources of error. To better understand which computations might be responsible for participants' errors, we formulated several theoretical models and fitted them to participants' take option versus sample again choices. As mentioned above with respect to ideal observer models, some previous studies have implemented models that aim to optimise the objective values of choices, while other model implementations optimise subjective values of those options, obtained via a separate rating task. Because there is no obvious determination of which procedure is correct, we implemented both objective values and subjective values versions of all our theoretical models, whenever a study condition involved a preceding rating task that enabled both model implementations. Then, we could assess using model comparison whether both objective values and subjective values versions of the models best fit human participant choices, or whether these two model varieties are relatively interchangeable (which we in fact discovered, see Results).

### Unveiling preferences in multiple sclerosis care: insights from an Italian discrete-choice experiment with patients and healthcare professionals [^114Mf2yU]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In recent years, there has been growing emphasis on incorporating patient preferences into healthcare interventions, as involving patients in clinical decision-making can improve treatment satisfaction and adherence. Information on patient preferences is valuable for healthcare providers, pharmaceutical industries, and policymakers. One method for evaluating these preferences is conjoint analysis. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are frequently employed in healthcare to assess patient preferences for managing conditions such as asthma and cancer. Understanding the key attributes that influence patient preferences for DMTs can help healthcare professionals in managing MS and provide important discussion points for shared decision-making. However, DCEs can be complex and cognitively demanding, posing challenges for MS patients who experience cognitive difficulties. In an international sample of RRMS patients, dosing regimen, efficacy, and safety profile were identified as equally important treatment attributes, although priorities may vary depending on individual patient characteristics.

Physician preferences for MS treatments have not been extensively studied, yet they may significantly impact treatment decisions. The perspective of patients and physicians regarding MS treatment strategies can differ, underscoring the importance of understanding both viewpoints to facilitate effective shared decision-making.

This project aims to investigate the preferences of patients, doctors, nurses, and hospital pharmacists for various attributes of MS treatments in Italy using the DCE methodology, a scientifically validated and innovative tool. This tool allows for the exploration of potential differences within each population based on certain conditions (age, disease duration, disease severity, etc.). In addition to evaluating clinical characteristics of treatments, the project seeks to determine whether other variables might influence therapeutic preferences among patients. It also aims to compare these preferences with those of healthcare professionals involved in MS management, including doctors, hospital pharmacists, and nurses.

### Neural substrates of cognitive biases during probabilistic inference [^112GibhC]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Decision making often requires simultaneously learning about and combining evidence from various sources of information. However, when making inferences from these sources, humans show systematic biases that are often attributed to heuristics or limitations in cognitive processes. Here we use a combination of experimental and modelling approaches to reveal neural substrates of probabilistic inference and corresponding biases. We find systematic deviations from normative accounts of inference when alternative options are not equally rewarding; subjects' choice behaviour is biased towards the more rewarding option, whereas their inferences about individual cues show the opposite bias. Moreover, inference bias about combinations of cues depends on the number of cues. Using a biophysically plausible model, we link these biases to synaptic plasticity mechanisms modulated by reward expectation and attention. We demonstrate that inference relies on direct estimation of posteriors, not on combination of likelihoods and prior. Our work reveals novel mechanisms underlying cognitive biases and contributions of interactions between reward-dependent learning, decision making and attention to high-level reasoning.

### Innovative interventions for disordered eating: evaluating dissonance-based and yoga interventions [^111zJhsq]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Eating-disordered behavior is prevalent among college women. Few interventions have successfully reduced risk factors for these behaviors, however. The most promising interventions are both selective and interactive. This study compared two newer types of interventions that meet these criteria: cognitive dissonance and yoga programs.

Method

This study advertised programs for women who were dissatisfied with their bodies. Participants (N = 93) were randomly assigned to dissonance, yoga, or control groups.

Results

Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that there were no significant post-intervention differences between the yoga and control groups. Dissonance group participants had significantly lower scores than the scores of both other groups on measures of disordered eating, drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, alexithymia, and anxiety.

Conclusion

These findings have important implications for interventions on college campuses. In particular, dissonance interventions appear to be an efficient and inexpensive approach to reducing eating disorder risk factors. Additional research regarding the value of yoga interventions is needed.

### Perceptions of risk and safety in the ICU: a qualitative study of cognitive processes relating to staffing [^115qk78U]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The majority of behavioral work in ICU has drawn on human factors, systems thinking, and the application of nontechnical skills analysis to better understand safety in this clinical context. A less well-researched area is the examination of staff cognitive processes in ICU safety. The aims of this study were to 1) examine individual professionals' perceptions of staffing risks and safe staffing in intensive care and 2) identify and examine the cognitive processes that underlie these perceptions.

Our study identified individual characteristics of pragmatism and perfectionism. Although we found ICU studies that focused on the conceivable consequences of such behavioral inclinations, such as moral distress and "burnout", few studies explored an underpinning psychologic concept called "cognitive dissonance", defined as the experiences of individuals when they perform an action, or confront new information that is contradictory to their existing beliefs, ideas, or values. We found that clinicians exhibiting perfectionist tendencies from all professions may experience cognitive dissonance in performing their work. This was mainly experienced when the clinician had to perform an action, usually the provision of patient care that was at odds with their beliefs about the optimal level of care that should be given. The impact of cognitive dissonance in this setting is that individuals with perfectionist tendencies may experience greater stress and isolation over time, as the dissonance between their belief system and the practical reality of delivering what they perceive to be compromised care becomes more pronounced. The negative emotion experienced when an individual is in cognitive dissonance can be related to the concept of moral distress in the ICU literature and over time may contribute to "burnout" or change of role (e.g. stopping work in ICU).

### Using an algorithmic approach to shape human decision-making through attraction to patterns [^117KqZ95]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The current study did not directly manipulate or assess a number of alternative motivational factors stated above, such as risk aversion or an experience of agency. The absence of targeted manipulations means that the influence (if any) of these factors remains speculative, and future research should design experiments that will systematically isolate and assess the relative contribution of these different factors. Additionally, future research where, for example, participants are explicitly asked about the amount of control they felt during the task, or their confidence in when rewards will be received, as well as their ability to explicitly reproduce the observed pattern, while using algorithms that systematically differ in the degree of regularity of the rewards allocated, could help tease these possibilities apart.

As mentioned above, recent reviews of the efficacy of nudges suggest that, to date, little is known about how or if people's choices can be substantially affected by subtle or concealed interventions. Nevertheless various actors have much to gain from devising such interventions, and may in fact take advantage of the belief that they are ineffective and hence harmless. The truth is that we do not know, yet given the scant data on potentially harmful nudges, malevolent actors may appear to meet the most stringent of regulations and still intentionally and adversely influence unsuspecting digital consumers or seekers of information. At the very least, the current demonstration should make it clear to regulators that subtle changes in the decision environment can have a real and negative impact on individual and societal interests.

By capitalizing on humans' preference for regularity, RaCaS biased participants' choices even as they were attempting to maximize their profit. This is crucial, especially when considered in light of current estimates regarding the (in)efficacy of nudging, at least in real world contexts. A limitation of the current study is that the controlled laboratory conditions may not fully reflect the complexity of real-world decision environments, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. On the other hand, while RaCaS' efficacy may decrease when deployed in such contexts, the fact that several of RaCaS' design decisions were admittingly arbitrary, leaves room for optimization and suggests that the current estimate of the bias created by RaCaS can be taken as a lower bound of its biasing potential. For example, other regularities could attract individuals even more, and using a more efficient reward allocation policy could minimize the number of cases in which the Bias + rewards are left to the very last trials, better harnessing their potential influence.

### Prediction accuracy of discrete choice experiments in health-related research: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111XpAm5]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review examines health-related studies comparing stated preferences, as modelled through predicted probability models from DCE choice data, to revealed preferences gathered through observational or survey means. The findings from the included studies shed light on several key aspects that warrant discussion, contributing to the understanding of the reliability and external validity of DCEs as a predictive tool in healthcare decision-making. We identified 14 studies from eight countries, employing different analytic methods and focusing on various health contexts. Consistent with past findings, our study demonstrates that DCEs are valuable for capturing health-related preferences and possess good external validity to predict health-related behaviours, particularly for opt-in choices. We add new knowledge by identifying that the analysis method and contextual factors, such as the type of health intervention and the setting in which choices are made, influence the predictive accuracy of DCEs. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference in DCEs examining a single occurrence of action compared to a prolonged commitment demanded from an individual within the intervention, suggesting that DCEs predict equally well in both scenarios.

While DCEs predict health-related behaviours well, they do not perform consistently well in all health dimensions. There may be reasons why real-world choices differ from those predicted by DCEs. First, the details provided in DCE choice tasks inherently simplify reality. Even in well-executed DCEs, unobserved factors in real-life decisions may be inadequately considered. When these unobserved factors impact participants' decisions, the stated and revealed preferences may diverge. Despite efforts to create high-quality DCEs, it is unlikely that all pertinent choice factors will always be encompassed comprehensively. Furthermore, we observed that certain studies contained a relatively high number of attributes or choice sets for each respondent. Six (43%) of the DCE questionnaires contained more than ten choice sets, and five (36%) featured more than five attributes. However, they did not necessarily improve the predictive accuracy. This could have been a result from cognitive load or heightened task complexity, leading respondents to simplify the task by applying heuristics, for example, ignoring certain attributes, focusing on one specific attribute or effectively making choices that they would follow on the basis of real-world scenarios. Future research should explore strategies to better account for unobserved factors and investigate methods to mitigate the impact of cognitive load in complex DCE tasks.

### Decision-making profiles and their associations with cognitive performance in mild cognitive impairment [^114Eoxfc]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

It is crucial for older adults, especially those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), to make profitable decisions routinely. However, the results regarding decision-making (DM) remain inconsistent.

Objective

The present study assessed DM profiles under uncertainty conditions in individuals with MCI and their associations with multi-domain cognitive performance.

Method

Fifty-three patients with MCI and forty-two age-, gender-, and education level-matched healthy controls (HCs) were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery test. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and Game of Dice Task (GDT) were used to assess DM competence in conditions involving ambiguity and risk, respectively. In addition, Spearman's correlations were used to examine relationships between GDT and multi-domain cognitive performance.

Result

The final capital (FC) and frequency of utilization of negative feedback (FUNF) and positive feedback (FUPF) in the GDT were lower in MCI patients than in HCs. In addition, the number of shifts between safe and risky alternatives was significantly different across groups. However, IGT performance was comparable across groups. In the MCI patients, risky DM performance was associated with language, whereas in HCs was correlated with memory and executive functions. Besides, in MCI, performance on IGT was significantly correlated with social cognition.

Conclusion

Individuals with mild cognitive impairment have difficulty utilizing feedback to make optimal decisions under risky situations. The association between decision-making performance and cognitive function is divergent regarding situational uncertainty and individuals' cognitive status. In mild cognitive impairment and normal aging, decision-making under ambiguity needs further investigation.

### Cognitive strategies regulate fictive, but not reward prediction error signals in a sequential investment task [^113HVA2D]. Human Brain Mapping (2014). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Recent computational models and experimental probes support the notion of multiple learning mechanisms in healthy individuals. Reward prediction errors derived from ongoing differences between expected and actually experienced rewards (temporal difference (TD) errors) have a significant impact on choice behavior. However, these signals do not fully capture the complexity of decision-making processes. Recent evidence demonstrates that learning can also be driven by fictive errors derived from foregone outcomes ("what might have happened"). One central physical substrate supporting these mechanisms is dopaminergic signaling in the brain. In healthy individuals, both fictive and reward prediction errors activate the striatum [Chiu et al;], a dopaminoceptive structure that is commonly implicated in decision-making tasks and works closely with a network of brain regions such as the anterior insular cortex (AIC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the amygdala.

An outstanding question is how these computational learning signals interact with top-down cognitive influences. In people with compromised top-down control (e.g. addicted individuals), fictive errors are computed in the brain, but fail to emerge as signals to guide choice behavior, suggesting that fictive learning signals might interact with top-down cognitive input. On the other hand, cognitive strategies used to regulate emotions such as reappraisal have been shown to modulate neural activity related to reward anticipation, loss aversion, and risky choices during decision-making. With the consideration of individual differences in learning and decision-making, it is therefore important to investigate the interplay between emotional regulation strategies and computational learning signals in individual decision-makers, which might open a window into intervention and treatment of psychiatric conditions with abnormal decision-making patterns.

### Counterfactual reasoning underlies the learning of priors in decision making [^111HDP9V]. Neuron (2018). Low credibility.

We have assumed that subjects can both report their belief that the block is biasedand represent the underlying magnitude of the base rate. To confirm this, we analyzed the choices on 0% coherence trials in which they were close to certain about the bias of the block (oron the previous trial). If the subject's representation of base rate matches that of the block, then on these trials with little net motion, the subject should report more frequently in the direction of bias when the base rate is more informative despite the belief being equally strong. Indeed, subjects were more likely to report the direction of the belief when the base rate was more extreme (Equation 24 ;, t test). This analysis presents model-free evidence that participants represent not only the quantity that they are asked to report (belief) but also a measure of the magnitude of the base rate.

### Experience-based risk taking is primarily shaped by prior learning rather than by decision-making [^112X3EUk]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We found evidence that risk-taking in experience-based decisions is primarily driven by fluctuations in learning, as opposed to fluctuations in decision-making. Reinforcement learning modelling showed that these fluctuations are explained by changes in people's subjective valuation of gains and losses at learning, with particularly large changes found in learning from losses. Importantly, these modelled behavioral changes cohered with changes in people's neural and physiological prediction error signals. These findings establish that learning processes, not decision processes, primarily determine risk-taking in experience-based decisions.

Up until recently, research on risk-taking in the behavioral and neural sciences has primarily focused on the processes by which decisions are formed –. Such research, however, predominantly employed experimental tasks where the probabilities of gains and losses are explicitly presented to experimental participants, such that no learning from experience is involved. More recent research has begun to examine experience-based decisions and thereby advanced the role of learning in shaping risk-taking –. Such research, however, was not equipped to dissociate between learning and decision-making. Here we achieved this dissociation using a specially designed longitudinal experienced-based decision task that participants performed daily over a period of four weeks. Our results revealed that decision processes only had a weak influence on risk-taking in our task. To put this concretely, we found that it mattered little how a participant valued gains and losses when they made their decisions. Rather, decisions adhered to how participants valued gains and losses at the time of learning.

### Preoccupation as psychopathological process and symptom in adjustment disorder: a scoping review [^1156Xq7t]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

CD theory proclaims that CD is psychologically uncomfortable and distressing. CD often causes counteracting mental strategies with the aim of reducing it (Festinger). This can include re‐evaluation of distressing information, adding consonant cognitions, or disregarding dissonant information (Harmon‐Jones & Mills). For instance, if an individual becomes unemployed, this person could start thinking that their job was not that good anyway or that a professional re‐orientation was necessary. However, counteracting strategies tend to be less effective in cases of strong CD (Gawronski & Brannon). For example, after working in a highly satisfying job for 20 years, an individual can experience high CD after being dismissed and might not be able to simply re‐evaluate the situation. It is at least more difficult to do so compared with a case of weak CD, like creating a white lie (Cotton). If CD becomes overwhelming to a point that it cannot be erased by counteracting strategies, an individual might remain in an ongoing state of CD and distress (Festinger; Gawronski & Brannon). This state could be identified as preoccupation. The discrepancy of cognitive elements in CD is similar to AjD, in which a stressor is also in conflict with the previous life condition. In addition, an ongoing CD, caused by repeated dissonance‐generating information, is equal to the reoccurring characteristics described for preoccupation (WHO).

### Neural substrates of cognitive biases during probabilistic inference [^112AAERT]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Moreover, an important and often neglected aspect of decision making and probabilistic inference is the influence of existing information on what is processed and subsequently updated when reward feedback is received. For example, during a flu epidemic, a doctor may first try to identify a few symptoms that strongly predict a correct diagnosis. For future patients, however, she would not only focus on those symptoms, but also attribute the resulting diagnosis success/failure to those symptoms, rather than the unattended ones. Existing information could influence what should be processed via attentional selection, which in turn could influence future learning and decision processes. Therefore, interactions between reward-dependent learning, decision-making and attentional processes could be crucial for probabilistic inference and could contribute to cognitive biases. Currently, little is known about how these processes interact, mainly because of the difficulty of separating them; therefore, it is unclear how and to what extent these interactions influence probabilistic inference.

Here we used a combination of experimental and modelling approaches to reveal neural mechanisms underlying probabilistic inference and related biases. First, we used a novel experimental paradigm to precisely measure cognitive biases during both choice and inference. The experiment involved predicting reward on two alternative options based on simultaneously presented cues and subsequently receiving reward feedback. This decision task was followed by an inference task where subjects provided their estimates of the predictive power of individual cues or combinations of cues. Second, we developed a biophysically plausible model of probabilistic inference to simulate subjects' behaviour during our experiment. We find that when alternative options are not equally rewarding, choice behaviour of individual subjects is biased towards the more rewarding option, whereas their inferences about individual cues show the opposite bias. Moreover, inferences about combinations of cues show a bias that depends on the number of cues, contradicting any normative accounts of inference. Our results indicate that inference relies on direct estimation of posteriors and not on combination of likelihoods and prior. We show that reward-dependent learning, decision-making and attentional processes occur concurrently and interact dynamically to determine probabilistic inference and corresponding cognitive biases.

### Cognitive processing in bipolar disorder conceptualized using the interactive cognitive subsystems (ICS) model [^112Yb94c]. Psychological Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

It may be hypothesized that a tendency to work at an implicational level of processing would have relevance to a range of everyday situations in the euthymic state for the BD individual. The ICS account suggests that individuals processing at a more abstract, higher schematic level prefer to allow details to be incorporated into the prevailing schema, rather than detect and act on dissonance. Clinically, for example, there may be evidence regarding an individual's mood from different sources (such as from friends, thoughts or behaviour), and it may be that reconciling potentially contradictory information is more difficult because of this processing bias. This could explain why some individuals with BD have difficulties in detecting and reconciling discrepant prodromal evidence and incorporating it into their daily lives. Potentially, a cognitive remedial training programme aiming to teach compensatory strategies for this deficit may be helpful.

Alternative explanations are that these findings reflect deficits in executive function or in depleted cognitive resources. Numerous studies have observed a broad pattern of cognitive impairments in individuals with BD (see Bearden et al. for review), and such persistent cognitive deficits within the BD population at all affective states may therefore provide an alternative explanation for the results of the present study. For example, in the present study we found that the BD group was less accurate than the control group at answering the filler questions, indicative of at least some problems with immediate retention. It is hypothesized that as the filler questions did not require much processing of semantic relationships, a general decrement would be consistent with a problem in coordinating access to, and use of, executive short-term storage systems. However, it is less clear that such an explanation would account for the pattern of responses for the experimental items. If deficits in attention and changing sets were able to account for differences between the groups on responses that were consistent with the schema, it would also be expected to be identified on the groups' abilities to correctly detect discrepancies; however, no such difference was identified. Further tentative evidence that performance on the test items is unrelated to executive deficits was indicated by the finding that mood change was related to change in performance on this task for the bipolar group but not for the control group.

### When should patient intuition be taken seriously? [^116vfu6T]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

As a style of information processing, intuition involves implicit perceptual and cognitive processes that can be quickly and automatically executed without conscious mental will, such that people know more than they can describe. Patient intuition can influence patient and clinician decision-making and behavior. However, physicians may not always see patient intuition as credible or important, and its management in the clinical setting is poorly understood. This paper takes a step toward suggesting conditions under which patient intuition should be taken seriously. These conditions relate to the credibility or accuracy of the intuitive beliefs held by the patient, and their significance to the patient. Credibility may be increased when the intuitions of patients (1) reflect their individualized knowledge, (2) can complement the common absence of scientific evidence in managing health problems, and (3) can quickly and effectively process key information in complex cognitive tasks. Even intuitions that lack credibility can be subjectively rational and meaningful to patients, and help to shape the decisions they and clinicians make.

### Unconscious emotional reasoning and the therapeutic misconception [^115s2rLv]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

The "therapeutic misconception" describes a process whereby research volunteers misinterpret the intentions of researchers and the nature of clinical research. This misinterpretation leads research volunteers to falsely attribute a therapeutic potential to clinical research, and compromises informed decision making, therefore compromising the ethical integrity of a clinical experiment. We review recent evidence from the neurobiology of social cognition to provide a novel framework for thinking about the therapeutic misconception. We argue that the neurobiology of social cognition should be considered in any ethical analysis of how people make decisions about participating in clinical trials. The neurobiology of social cognition also suggests how the complicated dynamics of the doctor-patient relationship may unavoidably interfere with the process of obtaining informed consent. Following this argument we suggest new ways to prevent or at least mitigate the therapeutic misconception.

### Calibration of cognitive tests to address the reliability paradox for decision-conflict tasks [^113nsw1m]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Standard, well-established cognitive tasks that produce reliable effects in group comparisons also lead to unreliable measurement when assessing individual differences. This reliability paradox has been demonstrated in decision-conflict tasks such as the Simon, Flanker, and Stroop tasks, which measure various aspects of cognitive control. We aim to address this paradox by implementing carefully calibrated versions of the standard tests with an additional manipulation to encourage processing of conflicting information, as well as combinations of standard tasks. Over five experiments, we show that a Flanker task and a combined Simon and Stroop task with the additional manipulation produced reliable estimates of individual differences in under 100 trials per task, which improves on the reliability seen in benchmark Flanker, Simon, and Stroop data. We make these tasks freely available and discuss both theoretical and applied implications regarding how the cognitive testing of individual differences is carried out.

### Heuristics in risky decision-making relate to preferential representation of information [^115USPkW]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

It is widely conjectured that differences in behavioral choice patterns relate to differences in what information individuals consider during evaluation. Here, we examined this question behaviorally and with neural data. Our findings are consistent with a hypothesis that individual differences in integration of reward and probability information into choice, in both a laboratory task and in real life, reflect differences in the nature of the information that is prioritized during evaluation.

Our behavioral analysis revealed that participants differed in the extent to which they relied on either reward versus probability comparisons when deciding. By decoding outcome representations using MEG, we show these distinct decision strategies reflected differences in what outcomes were neurally represented during evaluation. Participants who decided based on a difference in probability between the better and worse gamble outcomes preferentially reactivated high probability gamble outcomes, suggesting they primarily considered probability information. Conversely, participants who decided more based on the difference in reward between outcomes preferentially reinstated the high absolute reward gamble outcomes, suggesting they mainly considered the relative reward of gamble options with the safe option.

Our results add to the literature as to what accounts for individual differences in the treatment of reward and probability during risky choice. Although individual differences are ubiquitous in the literature of risky choice, the full range of factors that determine individual differences are unknown. Previous modeling approaches have demonstrated that models which preferentially integrate either reward or probability information account for some aspects of commonly observed variance in risky choice, though whether such variation is explained by differences in the types of outcomes considered during choice evaluation has not been shown. Here, by identifying a link between outcomes that are represented during choice evaluation and behavioral signatures that reflect consideration of either reward or probability information, we provide evidence that this variation is related to the types of information prioritized during evaluation. These results add to recent research demonstrating that heuristics and biases in choice can be explained for by individual differences in the types of information considered during the decision process – and demonstrate a link between these processes and previous research demonstrating the role of outcome reactivation in choice evaluation.

### Sources of confidence in value-based choice [^113k33CK]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Confidence, the subjective estimate of decision quality, is a cognitive process necessary for learning from mistakes and guiding future actions. The origins of confidence judgments resulting from economic decisions remain unclear. We devise a task and computational framework that allowed us to formally tease apart the impact of various sources of confidence in value-based decisions, such as uncertainty emerging from encoding and decoding operations, as well as the interplay between gaze-shift dynamics and attentional effort. In line with canonical decision theories, trial-to-trial fluctuations in the precision of value encoding impact economic choice consistency. However, this uncertainty has no influence on confidence reports. Instead, confidence is associated with endogenous attentional effort towards choice alternatives and down-stream noise in the comparison process. These findings provide an explanation for confidence (miss)attributions in value-guided behaviour, suggesting mechanistic influences of endogenous attentional states for guiding decisions and metacognitive awareness of choice certainty.

### The effectiveness of decision aids for pregnancy related decision-making in women with pre-pregnancy morbidity; systematic review and meta-analysis [^113oBsqW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Personalised care is one of the principal objectives of maternity care in the United Kingdom, and internationally. Care centred on the woman, based around her needs and decisions, and where she has genuine choice, informed by unbiased information, should be provided to women with pre-existing morbidities and those without. Women entering pregnancy with pre-existing morbidity arising from medical conditions or previous surgery (such as Caesarean section) are at higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to women without such morbidity. These women often face complex pregnancy-related decision-making that may be characterized by conflicting maternal and perinatal priorities. Women may be presented with pregnancy-related decisions where there remains substantial uncertainty due to an absence of research. Additionally, women are likely to have unique experience and knowledge of their condition that will influence their decisions. Decision-making is therefore likely to be distinctive to women entering pregnancy with pre-existing morbidity arising from medical conditions or previous surgery; and potentially characterised by substantial internal conflict.

Shared decision-making is a model of care where clinicians and patients share the best available evidence when faced with the task of making decisions; and where individuals are supported to consider options, to achieve informed preferences. In pregnancy, this is particularly well suited to situations where medication or surgical decisions are to be made, as they require professionals to share information, but importantly where the best course of action may include some uncertainty. Women with pre-existing medical morbidity often have experience in managing their condition and bring important perspectives to the decision-making process. Implementing patient decision aids that have been informed by the 'International Patient Decision Aid Standards' (IPDA) is an effective method to improve shared decision-making in different healthcare settings. They are designed to help support patients to make decisions regarding the balance of benefits and risks of treatment choices, and help support patients to synthesise and express their values, opinions and preferences in relation to the treatment decisions. Increasingly, patient decision aids are being introduced into a wide range of maternity contexts to help support clinicians to provide personalised care and to enable women to actively participate in decision-making regarding pregnancy and birth.

### A task-invariant prior explains trial-by-trial active avoidance behaviour across gain and loss tasks [^113FviZG]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Failing to make decisions that would actively avoid negative outcomes is central to helplessness. In a Bayesian framework, deciding whether to act is informed by beliefs about the world that can be characterised as priors. However, these priors have not been previously quantified. Here we administered two tasks in which 279 participants decided whether to attempt active avoidance actions. In both tasks, participants decided between a passive option that would for sure result in a negative outcome of varying size, and a costly active option that allowed them a probability of avoiding the negative outcome. The tasks differed in framing and valence, allowing us to test whether the prior generating biases in behaviour is problem-specific or task-independent and general. We performed extensive comparisons of models offering different structural explanations of the data, finding that a Bayesian model with a task-invariant prior for active avoidance provided the best fit to participants' trial-by-trial behaviour. The parameters of this prior were reliable, and participants' self-rated positive affect was weakly correlated with this prior such that participants with an optimistic prior reported higher levels of positive affect. These results show that individual differences in prior beliefs can explain decisions to engage in active avoidance of negative outcomes, providing evidence for a Bayesian conceptualization of helplessness.

### Dissociable encoding of evolving beliefs and momentary belief updates in distinct neural decision signals [^115a18Qn]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The non-linear transformation of the evolving belief, that is the key feature of the normative approach to solving this task, has a number of behavioural consequences. First, its slope is always < 1, which produces leaky accumulation and a recency effect in evidence weighting. Further, it produces choice behaviour that is particularly sensitive to samples indicating that a potential change in the generative state has occurred (i.e. samples that clearly conflict with a strongly held current belief), as well as to samples encountered when the belief is generally weak (i.e. when uncertainty about the current generative state is high; Fig. 1C). To test whether participants exhibited these behavioural hallmarks of normative belief updating, we fit logistic regression models estimating the average weight on choice of each sample in the trial sequence (Eq. 7 in Methods). The evidence provided by each sample was quantified in terms of its log-likelihood ratio (LLR). Further, we computed the surprise associated with a sample (defined here as the analytically computed change-point probability, which quantifies the likelihood, given the existing belief, that a sample directly followed a change in generative state; see Eqs. 4–6), and the uncertainty in the belief at the time of encountering that sample (see Methods). As predicted by the normative model, we found that participants weighted evidence occurring later in the trial more heavily (p < 0.001, two-tailed permutation test on weights for the first 5 versus the last 5 samples), and also upweighted samples associated with high change-point probability (p < 0.001, two-tailed cluster permutation test against zero; Fig. 1E). By contrast, we did not find a reliable positive modulation by uncertainty (p = 0.286 positive effect at sample 7). This null effect is in contrast to previous data from similar versions of our task, though a weaker effect in the present case is consistent with normative model predictions due to differences in task generative statistics (here, a higher H and higher signal-to-noise in generative distributions; see Methods). Note also that "surprise" and "uncertainty" are not quantities directly used in the normative computations, but rather sensitivities to these variables are diagnostic of the normative belief updating strategy that we can test for in our data. The normative model was able to account for these behavioural effects (Fig. 1E) with estimated participant-specific subjective hazard rates (H) that did not differ from the true generative H = 0.1 at the group level (M = 0.092, s.e.m. = 0.015; one sample t test, t (19) = − 0.54, p = 0.59, d = 0.12, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.12]). It also fits the data better than several alternative models (see Supplementary Fig. S1 for full parameter estimates and model comparison details).

### Optimal policy for value-based decision-making [^111jNEhn]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

For decades now, normative theories of perceptual decisions, and their implementation as drift diffusion models, have driven and significantly improved our understanding of human and animal behaviour and the underlying neural processes. While similar processes seem to govern value-based decisions, we still lack the theoretical understanding of why this ought to be the case. Here, we show that, similar to perceptual decisions, drift diffusion models implement the optimal strategy for value-based decisions. Such optimal decisions require the models' decision boundaries to collapse over time, and to depend on the a priori knowledge about reward contingencies. Diffusion models only implement the optimal strategy under specific task assumptions, and cease to be optimal once we start relaxing these assumptions, by, for example, using non-linear utility functions. Our findings thus provide the much-needed theory for value-based decisions, explain the apparent similarity to perceptual decisions, and predict conditions under which this similarity should break down.

### Insights into designing educational materials for persons living with dementia: a focus group study [^115hJpZG]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Theme 2: use straightforward delivery with simple language, activities, and design choices

Early versions of the brochure included a brief quiz with true/false items. This element was modeled after the EMPOWER brochure and its approach based on constructivist learning theory, which sought to introduce cognitive dissonance related to recipients' current prescription medication regimens. However, focus group participants expressed strong negative reactions to this mode of presenting information — for PLWD, the quiz felt like an opportunity to fail. Some said it conjured memories of a pop quiz being delivered in school. Then, in addition to the quiz itself causing anxiety, it was constructed such that the correct response for some items was true, while others were false — which also made interpreting the correct answers confusing. One respondent (CP, male) said:

It seems to me that all the answers should either be all true or all false. Because I could see [my wife, who is a PLWD] or my mother coming to me and saying, 'I got this brochure', and I had to kind of think through which wasn't true, when the other two were. I think I would just make them all true or all false.

As this participant stated, PLWD may find it difficult to keep track of which responses were true and which were false, and presenting facts as questions could impose unnecessary stress.

In addition to the content being a potential source of confusion, the presentation and layout were, as well. A participant in the second focus group (PLWD, female) reported:

"There's shapes, and there's black boxes, and there's different fonts — there's bold and there's different sizes of text. When I see this, I almost can't see anything. It's kind of like, when I'm searching for a can of soup at the market — I don't do that anymore because I just can't see… I can't find it. It's too overwhelming. All of a sudden, I can't… my brain… my eyeballs cannot find what you want me to find".

For PLWD, not just the content but also the presentation and layout of the content could contribute to information overload.

### Dyadic discrete choice experiments enable persons with dementia and informal caregivers to participate in health care decision making: a mixed methods study [^111x9ZSY]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study found that most persons with dementia in the individual DCE round were able to complete a median of six choice tasks that included two illustrated scenarios using a maximum of three attributes. The informal caregiver DCE round was helpful to identify their individual preferences, in which they experienced minimal difficulties with completing the choice tasks. In the dyadic DCE round, persons with dementia were able to complete more choice tasks and handle an increased number of attributes. Informal caregivers had a meaningful role in helping the persons with dementia complete the dyadic DCE. A surprising finding was the dyadic DCE enabled communication on care preferences between the persons with dementia and their informal caregiver.

Study results suggest that the number of attributes and choice tasks are decisive factors in establishing cognitive burden for persons with dementia. In this small sample we found a positive unadjusted association between cognitive screening test scores and maximum number of attributes within a choice task, and a positive unadjusted association between cognitive screening test scores and maximum number of choice tasks completed. In addition, we found that two options described by three attributes, and six choice tasks, was the limit for most participants with dementia. Longer and more complex surveys could lead to participants making simplified choices. Study participants adopted for example the single-attribute lexicographic rule, making decisions based on only the most important attribute. Also, participant adopted the majority of confirming dimensions decision rule, making decisions based on the number of favorable attributes instead of maximizing the total attractiveness of the attributes. Both decision rules do not include making trade-offs among the other attributes, which is essential in DCE decision-making. This type of adaptive behavior is not limited to populations with dementia but are widely recognized impacts of exceeding bearable cognitive burdens. Cognitive screening tests such as the TICS are recommended for respondent inclusion.

### Does self-deception play a role in questionable research… [^115ZQgMH]. ori.hhs.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Social scientist Leon Festinger did some fascinating studies in the 1950s on "cognitive dissonance. " He used the term to describe the uncomfortable tension people feel when they find their actions are inconsistent with their beliefs. Rather than change their behavior to fit their beliefs, they will change what they believe to be true to alleviate the tension. In one of Festinger's experiments, some subjects were paid $20 to tell a specific lie, while another group of subjects only got $1 to do the same. The ones who received $1 were far more likely to claim, after the event, that they had actually believed in the lie they were told to tell, as if that somehow made it easier to swallow the fact they'd sold out and told a lie for a pittance. One can imagine a graduate student or post-doctoral fellow engaging in questionable research practices due to perceived expectencies from the principal investigator. Do these people convince themselves that what they're doing is not wrong.

Is it possible that some researchers lie to themselves about engaging in questionable practices. What do you think.

### Memory and decision making interact to shape the value of unchosen options [^113XzUAP]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The inverse inference of value resonates with studies showing that making a decision leads to selective memory for information supporting the decision. The classical finding is that participants remember their chosen option more favorably and remember their unchosen option less favorably, and they also exhibit higher learning rates for the positive outcomes of their chosen options and the negative outcomes of their unchosen options. These tasks differ from our task in that participants are exposed directly to the outcomes of their unchosen options and exhibit biases in the memory of these outcomes. Here we show that even without any exposure to the unchosen option's outcome, participants infer that its value is opposed to that of the chosen option. Importantly, the inverse inference of value does not always support choices: unchosen options could be inferred as rewarding if the chosen option was not rewarding.

Our findings suggest that the act of deciding can modify an option's value, consistent with studies of choice-induced preference change. These studies show that for two equally valued options, the mere act of deciding induces a tendency to overvalue the chosen option and undervalue the unchosen one. Both options' values are modified right after the decision is made, as a by-product of it. Our study differs from, and therefore extends, choice-induced preference change studies in an important way. In choice-induced preference change, the change in value occurs as a function of a single choice and a choice alone, not as a function of learning from subsequent outcomes. The latter is what our task targets. While our study did not evaluate changes in subjective preferences (e.g. using ratings), but rather changes in the value people assign to choice options after learning about their outcomes, our results echo choice-induce preference-change effects. As with choice-induced preference-change, we find that people tend to separate the value of their choice options after the decision was terminated. Yet, importantly, we find that people use the outcomes they received for their chosen options as a reference point to infer the value of their unchosen options. They do not only devalue these options, but in some cases they might even assume they were better options than their chosen ones. Finally, our findings are also consistent with recent studies showing that choice-induced preference change effects were correlated with a better memory of the initial choice.

### Exploiting a cognitive bias promotes cooperation in social dilemma experiments [^114584UR]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neoclassical economics has ascribed human actions to a relentless rational drive to maximise the (expected) utility –, even as the economic models struggled to account for the full range of displayed behaviours –. The apparent discrepancy between theory and reality ultimately gave birth to the field of behavioural economics, which has since amassed indisputable evidence to the effect that various cognitive biases stand in the way of the completely rational behaviour of economic agents –. Our focus is on the decoy effect, also known as the asymmetric dominance effector the attraction effect, which appears in multiple-choice situations in which a particular choice called "decoy" shares some defining characteristics with another choice called "target", but is inferior to the target in one defining characteristic. Because we apply the concept of decoy in the novel context of evolutionary game theory, it is crucial to establish which defining (shared and inferior) characteristics are relevant to this context, as will be done in a moment. We emphasise for now that while decoys should be inconsequential to decision-making, they have been found to increase the attractiveness of the target, even in real-world political elections. The effect's strength, however, seems to diminish in the presence of more meaningful stimulus descriptions. Motivated by this finding, multiple recent studies questioned the limits of validity of the decoy effect –.

Apart from behavioural economics, evolutionary game theory is another research field in which considerable attention has been devoted to the study of human behaviour, offering, for instance, an updated view on cognitive biases –. The work on the evolution of human cooperation in particular boasts a rich mathematical modelling legacy, complemented by a more recent track of social dilemma experimentation –, as well as somewhat rarer attempts to reconcile theoretical and empirical perspectives –. While the basic concepts are shared with economics (cf. fitness vs. utility), evolutionary game theory introduces an extra explanatory dimension behind fitness maximisation via the process of selection. Specifically, selection describes temporal evolution towards maximum fitness during which human reasoning faculties eliminate suboptimal behaviours in a trial-and-error manner. It is largely unknown, however, if the process of selection can be manipulated by means of cognitive biases.

### Divergent neural mechanisms of self-concerned and prosocial decision-making under high and low cognitive loads [^116QTzG3]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

Cognitive load appeared to have a more pronounced effect on prosocial decisions than on self‐concerned decisions in our behavioral data, suggesting that altruistic behavior may be particularly susceptible to cognitive constraints, potentially due to its possible reliance on complex mentalizing processes. The data showed greater behavioral variability in prosocial decision‐making compared to self‐concerned decisions (Appendix S3), consistent with the possibility that individuals might rely more on heuristics when making self‐directed choices. While speculative, these findings could align with previous observations that cognitive constraints may promote emotionally driven decision‐making (Gao et al; Lerner et al.). Under conditions of cognitive load in our experiment, participants' choices appeared to reflect a tendency toward quicker decisions, possibly indicating constrained information processing capacity (Hinson et al; Sweller).

Interestingly, we found that the effect of cognitive load on prosocial decision‐making was moderated by EC traits (Gamble et al; Haruno et al; Rameson et al.), demonstrating that cognitive load enhances prosocial intuition in individuals with high empathy compared to those with low empathy (Bajouk and Hansenne). Cognitive load appears to facilitate bottom‐up emotional processing while constraining top‐down cognitive control (Kahneman). This shift may strengthen automatic empathic responses to those in need (Cui et al; Lerner et al.), thereby promoting increased engagement in prosocial behaviors (Hiraoka and Nomura).

### Surprising sounds influence risky decision making [^113EfSV4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Adaptive behavior depends on appropriate responses to environmental uncertainty. Incidental sensory events might simply be distracting and increase errors, but alternatively can lead to stereotyped responses despite their irrelevance. To evaluate these possibilities, we test whether task-irrelevant sensory prediction errors influence risky decision making in humans across seven experiments (total n = 1600). Rare auditory sequences preceding option presentation systematically increase risk taking and decrease choice perseveration (i.e., increased tendency to switch away from previously chosen options). The risk-taking and perseveration effects are dissociable by manipulating auditory statistics: when rare sequences end on standard tones, including when rare sequences consist only of standard tones, participants are less likely to perseverate after rare sequences but not more likely to take risks. Computational modeling reveals that these effects cannot be explained by increased decision noise but can be explained by value-independent risky bias and perseveration parameters, decision biases previously linked to dopamine. Control experiments demonstrate that both surprise effects can be eliminated when tone sequences are presented in a balanced or fully predictable manner, and that surprise effects cannot be explained by erroneous beliefs. These findings suggest that incidental sounds may influence many of the decisions we make in daily life.

### Patients with basal ganglia damage show preserved learning in an economic game [^116VpToS]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

A more general concern with our model-based approach is the possibility of model misspecification due to participants engaging in decision rules beyond the EWA model space. This is particularly the case with lesion cohort behavior, as model-based approaches such as RL or EWA inherently make strong assumptions regarding how past experiences are integrated over the course of learning. Our study addressed this in two ways. First, we focused on cross-cohort comparisons using goodness-of-fit measures, rather than specific parameters calibrated from behavior (e.g. the weight on belief-based learning). In particular, comparisons based on individual parameters provide meaningful insights into cognitive components if cohorts behave in accordance to model assumptions. For example, using comparison between HC strategic and non-strategic conditions, the belief learning parameter provided a good indication that HC relied less on belief learning in the non-strategic condition. On the other hand, a poor model fit raises the possibility that one or more model assumptions are violated. This misspecification issue is equally true for both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. More importantly, such model misspecification can result in either upward or downward biases in parameter estimates. This makes it difficult, even in the presence of significant differences in parameter estimates, to draw firm conclusions regarding differences in cognitive mechanisms between cohorts or conditions.

### Development of a dementia-focused end-of-life planning tool: the LEAD guide (ife-planning inarlylzheimer's andementia) [^1174EjsS]. Innovation in Aging (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

There are currently around five million adults living with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD) in the United States. This number is expected to nearly triple to 13.9 million by 2060. Globally, the number of individuals with dementia is expected to rise from 4.7 million in 2015 to 132 million by the year 2050. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD; e.g. vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, etc.) precipitate decline in memory, thinking, and behavior, and worsen over time. The later stages of dementias include difficulty initiating movement and walking, difficulty eating and swallowing, agitation, incontinence, and increased risk of pressure ulcers and infections, which invariably lead to death.

With new technologies that extend the length of life, older adults are often cognitively impaired, due to a variety of medical conditions, at the end-of-life (EOL) and cannot make independent decisions about their own medical and EOL care. An estimated 45%–70% of older adults facing EOL choices do not have the capacity to make their own treatment decisions as a result of various underlying diagnosis. Predictably, persons with ADRD due to the insidious progression of neurodegenerative diseases, medical decisions in the later stages are left to the patient's health care agents or surrogates.

For individuals with ADRD, the lack of decisional capacity to make one's own medical decisions at EOL impacts the treatments that they will or will not receive, and subsequently their physical and mental well-being at the end of life. Throughout this study, we use the terminology "ADRD" and "dementia". For the purposes of this study, we define these terms as any irreversible progressive neurological condition or disorder that impairs cognitive functioning and subsequently decision-making capabilities. Additionally, the majority of family members of persons with advanced dementia state that comfort is their primary goal; however, very few of these patients are referred to hospice and many experience repetitive unproductive and distressing transitions between the hospital and nursing home. However, advance care planning has been shown to increase rates of hospice utilization, reduce acute care interventions (e.g. resuscitation, artificial nutrition) and improve care outcomes in persons with dementia (e.g. reduced hospital and intensive care unit admissions, fewer visits to the emergency department, and more home versus hospital deaths).

### Individual differences in information-seeking [^1147UpM2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The estimated impact of information on action, affect and cognition is referred to as instrumental utility, hedonic utility and cognitive utility, respectively. Each of these estimates can be positive (increasing information seeking), negative (increasing information avoidance) or zero (inducing indifference). We hypothesized that these estimates are integrated into a computation of the value of information, which will trigger information seeking or its active avoidance. Here, over five studies testing 543 participants we provide an empirical test of this theory. To examine if the theory is domain general or domain specific, we test information seeking in three different domains — information about self-traits, finance and health.

We had further proposed that each of the three factors may be weighted differently, influencing the decision to seek or avoid information to different degrees(Fig. 1a). Individual differences in information seeking may be related to the different weight individuals assign to each motive. For example, certain individuals may care most about the instrumental utility of information, whereas others may care most about the need to regulate their affective state, while other may assign equal weight to all three motives when seeking information, etc. Here, we quantify those differences and examine to what degree they are stable, or change, over time within and across domains, by conducting three longitudinal studies.

We had hypothesized that the weights people assign to each motive are related to self-reported mental health. The reason for this hypothesis is that many psychopathology symptoms can be broadly characterized as problems in affective processes, cognitive functions as well as action planning and execution. Abnormalities in these domains may reveal themselves in the type of information people choose to seek or avoid. For example, depression is characterized by a reduction in the belief that one has agency over outcomes, which may lead to a reduction in the impact of instrumental utility on information seeking. As poor mental health is often associated with problems related to self-perception and thoughts regarding the self –, we test the relationship between mental health and information seeking in the domain of self-referential knowledge. If indeed psychopathology symptoms are related to specific patterns of information seeking, there is potential for using measured markers of information seeking to diagnose mental health problems.

### Cognitive testing in patients with CKD: the problem of missing cases [^115kE34B]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Cognitive testing is only valid in individuals with sufficient visual and motor skills and motivation to participate. Patients on dialysis usually suffer from limitations, such as impaired vision, motor difficulties, and depression. Hence, it is doubtful that the true value of cognitive functioning can be measured without bias. Consequently, many patients are excluded from cognitive testing. We focused on reasons for exclusion and analyzed characteristics of nontestable patients.

Design, Setting, Participants & Measurements

Within the Choice of Renal Replacement Therapy Project (baseline survey: May 2014 to May 2015), n = 767 patients on peritoneal dialysis (n = 240) or hemodialysis (n = 527) were tested with the Trail Making Test-B and the German d2-Revision Test and completed the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form cognition subscale. We divided the sample into patients with missing cognitive testing data and patients with full cognitive testing data, analyzed reasons for nonfeasibility, and compared subsamples with regard to psychosocial and physical metrics. The exclusion categories were linked to patient characteristics potentially associated with missing data (age, comorbidity, depression, and education level) by calculation of λ -coefficient.

Results

The subsamples consisted of n = 366 (48%) patients with missing data (peritoneal dialysis = 62, hemodialysis = 304) and n = 401 patients with full cognitive testing data (peritoneal dialysis = 178, hemodialysis = 223). Patients were excluded due to visual impairment (49%), lack of motivation (31%), and motor impairment (13%). The remaining 8% did not follow instructions, suffered from medical incidents, or had language difficulties. Compared with patients with full cognitive testing data, they were more likely to have depression; be treated with hemodialysis; be older, nonworking, or more comorbid; and experience poorer shared decision making. Reasons for exclusion were not related to levels of age, comorbidity score, depression score, or education level.

Conclusions

We excluded almost one half of eligible patients from cognitive testing due to visual, motivational, or motor difficulties. Our findings are consistent with exclusion categories reported from the literature. We should be aware that, because of disease-related limitations, conclusions about cognitive functioning in the CKD population may be biased. In the future, nonvisual and nonverbal cognitive testing can be a valuable resource.

### A scoping review on the influential cognitive constructs informing public AMR behavior compliance and the attribution of personal responsibility [^111w5m9x]. American Journal of Infection Control (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat to public health. Despite various attempts at educating the public on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and judicial antibiotic use, fallacies and misconceptions remain. To successfully promote behavior change, various cognitive constructs pertaining to antibiotic behavior need to be identified and targeted.

Methods

Using the Arksey and O'Malley (2005) methodological framework, a credible reflexive examination of literature was conducted, permitting identification of a breadth of literature that pertained to the influence of cognitive constructs on public antimicrobial behavior.

Results

From 393 abstracts identified, 67 full articles were screened, and 43 papers were chosen for review. Three themes were identified (1) sociodemographic influences; (2) knowledge, misconceptions, and fallacies; and (3) public attitudes and the social influence of friends and family. Geographical location, education level, cognitive dissonance, and social norms were found to influence AMR cognition, resulting in disproportionate risk assessments that are facilitated by social information brokering.

Conclusions

Public AMR resilience, responsibility, and behavior compliance are influenced by cognitive constructs, which are liable to the appropriation of misconceptions, fallacies, and social behavior models obtained via information brokering. A cohesive multidisciplinary participatory approach to AMR management and interventional design that applies the influence of cognitive constructs to inform public AMR behavior compliance is recommended.

### Human noise blindness drives suboptimal cognitive inference [^112A8md7]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Humans typically make near-optimal sensorimotor judgements but show systematic biases when making more cognitive judgements. Here we test the hypothesis that, while humans are sensitive to the noise present during early sensory encoding, the "optimality gap" arises because they are blind to noise introduced by later cognitive integration of variable or discordant pieces of information. In six psychophysical experiments, human observers judged the average orientation of an array of contrast gratings. We varied the stimulus contrast (encoding noise) and orientation variability (integration noise) of the array. Participants adapted near-optimally to changes in encoding noise, but, under increased integration noise, displayed a range of suboptimal behaviours: they ignored stimulus base rates, reported excessive confidence in their choices, and refrained from opting out of objectively difficult trials. These overconfident behaviours were captured by a Bayesian model blind to integration noise. Our study provides a computationally grounded explanation of human suboptimal cognitive inference.
