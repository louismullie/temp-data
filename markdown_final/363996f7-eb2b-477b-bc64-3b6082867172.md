## Question

Newborn when to do renal ultrasound

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to obtain a renal ultrasound in newborns. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context categories that drive timing and urgency. Then, I should verify the optimal timing for antenatally detected hydronephrosis. Next, I will review severity-based risk stratification and the corresponding imaging pathways. After that, I need to check special scenarios like febrile UTI, AKI, and syndromic or critical illness contexts. Finally, I will synthesize a practical timeline and highlight technical considerations and follow-up intervals, making sure I reconcile any conflicting data along the way.

> Let me first confirm the major clinical contexts that determine when renal ultrasound is indicated in newborns: antenatally detected urinary tract dilation or hydronephrosis, symptomatic presentations such as febrile UTI or suspected obstruction, acute kidney injury, and syndromic or high-risk neonates including those with critical cardiac disease or genetic syndromes. I should also remember that ultrasound is first-line for suspected nephrolithiasis in children, which can occasionally present in the neonatal period, so I need to keep that in mind as a niche indication [^116uYvsT] [^111SFqfp] [^117G2kG1] [^114cAJZ8] [^112x3hG4].

> Now, for antenatally detected hydronephrosis, I initially thought the first postnatal ultrasound should be obtained within 48 hours of birth to avoid missing time-sensitive obstruction. Wait, let me verify that because I recall conflicting data about early neonatal dehydration and oliguria potentially underestimating severity, and some studies suggest waiting until 7–10 days yields more accurate assessment of true dilation, which could change the timing recommendation [^116Vzq3k] [^116op1Cb]. Hold on, I should verify guideline positions: the ACR Appropriateness Criteria endorse obtaining a renal and bladder ultrasound as initial postnatal imaging for antenatal hydronephrosis, but they do not fixate on a precise day-of-life target, emphasizing individualized timing based on severity and clinical status, whereas a prospective study found that scanning at 7–10 days better reflects true hydronephrosis than within 48 hours; practically, many centers aim for about day 7–10 for routine cases, while earlier imaging is reasonable if there are red flags such as bilateral disease, poor urine output, or suspected posterior urethral valves [^116uYvsT] [^116Vzq3k] [^117UuvG2].

> Next, I should review severity-based risk stratification because it drives both timing and subsequent testing. Mild hydronephrosis, typically SFU grade 1–2 or anteroposterior renal pelvic diameter less than about 10 mm, generally warrants a baseline postnatal ultrasound and then follow-up ultrasound in 1–6 months, with many cases resolving spontaneously, so I need to ensure I do not over-imaging here [^1147BskN] [^116XNXV7]. For moderate to severe disease, typically SFU grade 3–4 or AP diameter greater than 15 mm, or when there are parenchymal abnormalities, hydroureter, or bladder wall thickening, I should confirm that additional imaging is indicated, including VCUG or voiding urosonography to assess for reflux or valves and diuretic renography to evaluate obstruction, with timing individualized to clinical urgency and stability [^111BxavT] [^1147hCqs] [^111rS7m6].

> I will now examine the febrile UTI context. I need to ensure I apply the correct age thresholds and timing. For infants under 2 months with a first febrile UTI, renal and bladder ultrasound is recommended to evaluate for congenital anomalies and hydronephrosis, and in acutely ill infants this should be obtained within 24 hours. For infants 2 months to 6 years, RBUS is still recommended after a first febrile UTI, acknowledging that the yield is lower but still meaningful for detecting actionable anomalies. I should double-check that RBUS does not reliably detect vesicoureteral reflux, so VCUG remains indicated when ultrasound is abnormal or clinical risk is high, and that prenatal normal ultrasounds do not obviate post-UTI imaging because VUR can still be present even with normal RBUS [^111SFqfp] [^1177NfAX] [^115zqME9] [^115B16df] [^115Wx7qy].

> For acute kidney injury, I should confirm that renal ultrasound is recommended as initial imaging in unspecified AKI to assess for obstruction, renal size, and morphology, and that urgent ultrasound within 6 hours is advised if pyonephrosis or high suspicion of obstruction exists. This applies across ages, including neonates, so I need to keep a low threshold for expedited imaging in obstructive presentations [^113cjUrc] [^117G2kG1].

> Let me consider syndromic and high-risk neonates. Turner syndrome guidelines recommend obtaining a renal ultrasound at the time of diagnosis to screen for CAKUT, and Rubinstein-Taybi consensus suggests a baseline renal ultrasound in the newborn workup. For neonates with critical cardiac disease, a kidney health assessment before discharge that includes a renal ultrasound to document baseline size and anatomy is recommended, with structured follow-up thereafter, so I should ensure these populations are not missed in routine pathways [^113oZJJ5] [^113AFoZV] [^114cAJZ8].

> But wait, what about special populations like infants of diabetic mothers or those exposed in utero to renin–angiotensin system blockade? I need to check whether early renal ultrasound is indicated. Although not mandated by a single universal guideline, expert consensus and regulatory labeling advise serial fetal assessments for oligohydramnios and close neonatal observation for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia after second–third trimester RAS exposure, and many centers obtain an early postnatal renal ultrasound to assess kidney size, echogenicity, and perfusion in this context, so I should individualize based on exposure timing and clinical status [^114Gx8EL] [^113Z9c7D] [^112Cmp3q].

> I should confirm technical considerations that affect image quality and timing. Neonatal kidneys are best imaged with high-frequency transducers, often 7–15 MHz, and the bladder should be evaluated when distended to improve detection of ureteral dilation, ureteroceles, and bladder wall abnormalities. If the first study is limited by poor hydration or bladder state, repeating after feeding and with a full bladder can improve diagnostic yield, which is particularly relevant in the first week of life when oliguria may limit visualization [^115r7DGQ] [^112QQk3C] [^115B16df].

> Next, I should review follow-up intervals to avoid premature closure. For mild antenatal hydronephrosis that is normal or near-normal on the initial postnatal scan, repeat ultrasound in 1–6 months is reasonable, whereas moderate to severe disease or abnormal findings warrant earlier reassessment and adjunct imaging. I need to remember that rare cases with apparent early resolution can later declare obstruction, so families should be counseled on symptom triggers and some programs extend low-intensity surveillance beyond infancy in select cases [^116XNXV7] [^1147BskN] [^115bRFoJ].

> Let me synthesize a practical timeline while keeping the nuances in mind: for routine antenatally detected hydronephrosis without red flags, obtain a renal and bladder ultrasound around day 7–10 of life, earlier if bilateral disease, oliguria, or suspected valves. For mild disease, repeat ultrasound in 1–6 months and de-escalate if stable. For moderate to severe disease or abnormal bladder or parenchymal findings, proceed to VCUG or voiding urosonography and diuretic renography within weeks, with timing driven by clinical stability. For febrile UTI in infants under 2 months, obtain RBUS within 24 hours if acutely ill. For AKI, obtain renal ultrasound urgently and within 6 hours if obstruction is suspected. For syndromic or critical cardiac neonates, include renal ultrasound in the baseline evaluation before discharge [^116Vzq3k] [^117UuvG2] [^111BxavT] [^111SFqfp] [^117G2kG1] [^114cAJZ8].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed the key controversies transparently: the optimal timing of the first postnatal scan remains debated, with some data supporting delay to day 7–10 to mitigate underestimation from early oliguria, while other centers prefer imaging before discharge for logistics and early detection of severe disease. I should also emphasize that RBUS cannot reliably exclude VUR, so negative ultrasound after UTI does not eliminate the need for VCUG when clinical risk is high, and that prenatal normal ultrasounds do not negate the indication for post-UTI imaging in symptomatic infants [^116Vzq3k] [^116op1Cb] [^115B16df] [^115Wx7qy].

## Timing of newborn renal ultrasound

The timing of renal ultrasound depends on the **severity of prenatal findings** and the **clinical presentation**:

- **Mild hydronephrosis (SFU grade 1–2 or AP diameter < 10 mm)**: Perform ultrasound at 7–10 days of life to avoid underestimation due to early neonatal dehydration [^116Vzq3k] [^116op1Cb].
- **Moderate to severe hydronephrosis (SFU grade 3–4 or AP diameter > 15 mm)**: Perform ultrasound within 24–48 hours of life to promptly identify and manage significant obstruction or reflux [^1147hCqs] [^114jTvNC].
- **Febrile UTI or acute symptoms**: Perform ultrasound urgently within 24 hours of presentation [^1177NfAX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several professional organizations provide **guidelines** on when to perform renal ultrasound in newborns:

- **American College of Radiology (ACR)**: Recommends renal and bladder ultrasound as initial imaging for antenatally detected hydronephrosis, with follow-up ultrasound at 1–6 months if the initial postnatal ultrasound is normal [^116uYvsT] [^116XNXV7].
- **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)**: Recommends renal and bladder ultrasound for febrile infants with UTIs to detect anatomical abnormalities [^111UAFgF] [^112pbeqA].
- **European Society for Paediatric Urology (ESPU)**: Recommends serial ultrasounds and subsequent diuretic renography or voiding cystourethrography for moderate to severe hydronephrosis [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of early renal ultrasound

Early renal ultrasound in newborns is **clinically significant** because it enables:

- **Early detection of congenital anomalies**: Such as hydronephrosis, renal agenesis, polycystic kidney disease, and ureteropelvic junction obstruction [^114a3FaT].
- **Prevention of renal damage**: By identifying obstructive uropathies or reflux early, allowing timely intervention to prevent renal scarring and chronic kidney disease [^114jTvNC].
- **Guidance for management**: Informing decisions regarding antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical intervention, or conservative management [^11628zGL].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While renal ultrasound is a valuable diagnostic tool, certain limitations and considerations must be acknowledged:

- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy of ultrasound findings depends on the skill and experience of the operator [^111BNW4v].
- **Limited sensitivity**: Some congenital anomalies, such as vesicoureteral reflux, may not be detected on ultrasound alone, necessitating additional imaging modalities (e.g. voiding cystourethrography) [^117PSy1d].
- **False positives/negatives**: Early neonatal dehydration may lead to underestimation of hydronephrosis, while transient physiological dilation may resolve spontaneously, leading to false positives [^116MXYph] [^114jTvNC].

---

## Follow-up and management strategies

Follow-up and management depend on the **initial ultrasound findings**:

- **Normal ultrasound**: No further immediate imaging required; routine pediatric follow-up recommended.
- **Mild hydronephrosis**: Repeat ultrasound at 1–6 months to monitor for resolution or progression [^1147BskN] [^114Uwujy].
- **Moderate to severe hydronephrosis**: Further evaluation with diuretic renography or voiding cystourethrography; surgical intervention may be considered if obstruction or significant reflux is detected [^111rS7m6] [^1147hCqs].

---

Newborn renal ultrasound is indicated for antenatally detected hydronephrosis, febrile UTI, oliguria/anuria, palpable mass, and specific risk factors. Timing varies by severity: **7–10 days for mild cases** and **within 24–48 hours for moderate to severe cases**. Early ultrasound enables timely detection and management of congenital renal anomalies, helping prevent renal damage and guide care [^114jTvNC].

Table 1.
Genetic causes of a kidney dysplasia phenotype

Prenatal screening for pathogenic variants in genes that cause kidney dysplasia (see Table 1) should not generally be recommended, because the molecular diagnosis is not reliably predictive for kidney function. However, in fetuses with syndromic features and/or hyperechogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios, prenatal genetic testing for chromosomal imbalances (cGH/karyotype) or ciliopathies may be offered and discussed carefully with the parents if termination of pregnancy is considered.

Prenatal genetic counselling and testing in fetuses with dysplastic kidneys may lead to termination of pregnancy and thus should be handled with the greatest caution. Prenatal sonography cannot reliably distinguish kidney dysplasia from other genetic kidney diseases such as ciliopathies. Hence, prenatal genetic testing should be focused on genetic conditions that, together with sonographic findings, correlate with a high degree of certainty with a dismal prognosis, e.g. syndromic diseases. Prenatal counselling should address these aspects and should be detailed and respectful to non-medical aspects relevant for patients and families mentioned in the previous section. Prenatal testing should only be offered after consultation with experienced pediatric nephrologists and human geneticists in line with local legislation. To provide families of children with kidney dysplasia with the best counselling possible, we suggest implementing multidisciplinary clinics, including a human geneticist, a pediatric nephrologist, and, e.g. in case of oligo/anhydramnios, a neonatologist and gynaecologist.

The causality of genetic variants in patients with kidney dysplasia should be interpreted with caution because many variants initially reported as causing CAKUT have not been confirmed in subsequent studies.

The rapidly growing knowledge about human gene variations is extremely helpful in re-evaluating variants that in the past have been considered pathogenic. This corrective instrument seems particularly important in CAKUT and has repeatedly led to reclassification of variants formerly considered pathogenic to likely benign. The classification for genetic variants of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics should be applied.

For genetic testing, we suggest next-generation sequencing (NGS) as the primary screening tool. If negative, consider trio-whole-exome sequencing (WES)/whole genome sequencing (WGS) with subsequent evaluation of all genes implicated in monogenic hereditary kidney diseases.

### The role of routine post-natal abdominal ultrasound for newborns in a resource-poor setting: a longitudinal study [^116bksp3]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Malrotation of the kidney is the commonest but least significant of renal abnormalities. It refers to an abnormal relationship between the renal pelvis and renal tissue. The condition may be isolated when it can be unilateral or bilateral; or be associated with other renal anomalies like ectopic kidney. UPJO is a common complication. Duplex collecting system of the kidney is the commonest anomaly of the upper collecting system and ureter (ureteropelvic duplication) resulting from premature division of the ureteral bud or simultaneous development of two ureteral buds. The pattern of abnormality ranges from bifid renal pelvis (incomplete type) to complete duplication of the ureter. The former is twice as common as the latter and unilateral cases are five times as common as bilateral cases for either type. The clinical significance of this condition is dependent on the ureteric insertion, whether normal or ectopic. Duplication of the renal collecting system as seen in this study is diagnosed on ultrasound when the central echo complex is divided into two with an interposed column of renal parenchyma.

### The role of routine post-natal abdominal ultrasound for newborns in a resource-poor setting: a longitudinal study [^113nvBkc]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study has been able to demonstrate a 5.9% incidence of various types of genito urinary anomalies in this small population. Routine pre- and post- natal USS has been known to be very useful in early identification and prompt intervention of congenital genito urinary abnormalities in the fetus/newborn. However, inadequate availability of skilled personnel and cost implication of such investigations create great challenges in poor resource settings like Nigeria. Even though the cost benefit of early diagnosis and prompt treatment of significant renal abnormalities is high, recommending routine neonatal abdominal/renal USS will most likely be hampered by persistent low socioeconomic status of most Nigerians. Public awareness on the possibility of detecting these cases early with resultant better prognosis should however be created such that parents who can afford such investigations can make informed decisions.

### The yield of early postnatal ultrasound scan in neonates with documented antenatal hydronephrosis [^116op1Cb]. American Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

We retrospectively assessed the yield of early postnatal ultrasound scans in neonates with documented antenatal hydronephrosis. We reviewed recording data of prenatal renal ultrasound for 178 newborn infants and the results of renal ultrasound performed during the first days of life. Of 119 infants with prenatal diagnosis of mild hydronephrosis (renal pelvic diameter < 10 mm), 116 (97.5%) had postnatal ultrasound results showing normal or mild hydronephrosis. Prenatal diagnosis of severe hydronephrosis (renal pelvic diameter > 20 mm; 10 infants) was correlated with high incidence (90%) of moderate and severe postnatal hydronephrosis. Prenatal diagnosis of moderate hydronephrosis (renal pelvic diameter 10 to 20 mm) resulted in moderate postnatal hydronephrosis in 20% and improvement in 80% of the newborn infants. Our evidence supports the option of delaying postnatal renal ultrasound in infants with prenatal diagnosis of mild hydronephrosis (renal pelvic diameter < 10 mm). This strategy can safely reduce the number of early postnatal studies and consequently significantly decrease hospitals' inpatient workload.

### State-of-the-art renal imaging in children… [^111FzooN]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging modalities for diagnosing kidney and urinary tract disorders in children have developed rapidly over the last decade largely because of advancement of modern technology. General pediatricians and neonatologists are often the front line in detecting renal anomalies. There is a lack of knowledge of the applicability, indications, and nephrotoxic risks of novel renal imaging modalities. Here we describe the clinical impact of congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract and describe pediatric-specific renal imaging techniques by providing a practical guideline for the diagnosis of kidney and urinary tract disorders. 1, 2 As a result, imaging is crucial for early detection of kidney and urinary tract disease, monitoring of kidney function, and enhancing the assessment of disease progression and prognosis.

Conventional methods for the diagnosis of renal dysfunction based on clinical chemistry measurements have been shown to be suboptimal for early detection of functional loss.
3. 8 Antenatal and postnatal UTD each have their own scoring system for reference. 8 Higher scores relate to a higher degree of dilatation and renal parenchymal, ureteral, and/or bladder abnormalities that require further workup and monitoring. 9 Close modal. 10–12 Although renal bladder ultrasound, fluoroscopy, and nuclear medicine functional studies remain the main tools for anatomic and functional diagnosis and management of UTD and CAKUT, novel technologies have been added to the armamentarium of pediatric renal imaging.

Emerging technologies that are increasingly being used in clinical settings include functional magnetic resonance urography, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and contrast-enhanced voiding ultrasound, which can delineate anatomy at a higher resolution and provide functional, perfusion, and excretion information of the kidneys and urinary tract without using ionizing radiation. Anatomic Imaging Ultrasound Renal and bladder ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality for evaluation of the renal anatomy in children because it is noninvasive, is broadly available, is relatively fast, lacks ionizing radiation, and is less costly than other imaging modalities. Additionally, ultrasound does not require specific patient positioning or the need to be in a machine, which allows for imaging of children while in supine, prone, semi-upright or upright positions or, in the case of infants, while being held by a caregiver.

RBUS depicts kidney size, echogenicity, echotexture, parenchymal thickness, the duplex system, and the degree of dilatation of the pelvocalyceal system and ureters in children. 13 RBUS can be used to identify masses and large calculi, can be used to measure pre- and postvoid bladder volumes, and can provide real-time images for guidance of interventional procedures. 15 Clearer and sharper ultrasound images allow accurate reconstructive analysis of the anatomy, better tissue differentiation, and improved identification of echo-enhancing structures, such as renal stones and renal parenchymal lesions. 16, 17 One has to be cautious in interpreting higher-resolution images, however, because the corticomedullary differentiation can be overly enhanced and may falsely mimic nephrocalcinosis. 18.

### The role of routine post-natal abdominal ultrasound for newborns in a resource-poor setting: a longitudinal study [^115aW8pG]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Of the 202 neonates studied, 108 were males while 94 were females with a male to female ratio of 1.1:1. Table 2 shows the gender distribution of the study subjects and age at which the USS were performed.

Table 2
Distribution of the sex and age at which the USS was performed in 202 neonates

There were 12 (5.9%) abnormal scans seen in five male and seven female neonates. Eleven of the twelve abnormalities were in the kidneys, six on the left and five on the right. Three of the four major renal anomalies- absent kidney, ectopic/pelvic kidney and two cases of severe uretero-pelvic junction obstructions (UPJO) were however on the left side. There was one suprarenal abnormality on the right suspected to be a possible haemorrage (table 3 and figures 1, 2, 3 and 4). The baby with the suprarenal mass was admitted due to suspected infected suprarenal haemorrage and managed with antibiotics. The mass gradually resolved and was not visualized at the 6 th month follow-up scan.

### Hydronephrosis… [^113xcbWQ]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Blood tests may show impaired kidney function or electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia or hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Urinalysis may indicate an elevated pH due to the secondary destruction of nephrons within the affected kidney, which impairs acid excretion. Physical examination in a thin patient may detect a palpable abdominal or flank mass caused by the enlarged kidney. In pregnancy, dextrorotation of the uterus can cause compression on the right ureter, thus making hydronephrosis more common in the right kidney than in the left kidney. Besides, hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and prostaglandin can cause ureter dilatation, thus causing hydronephrosis despite the absence of visible obstruction along the urinary tract. To diagnose the disease, it is necessary to know the patient's history as well as some other physical examination of the patient. This must be accompanied by some imaging tests.

Usually, an ultrasonogram can be used to determine the condition of the patient's urinary system, kidneys, etc. In addition, CT scans and MRIs can more clearly picture the urinary tract and obstructions. Diagnosis Prenatal diagnosis is possible, and in fact, most cases in pediatric patients are incidentally detected by routine screening ultrasounds obtained during pregnancy. However, approximately half of all prenatally identified hydronephrosis is transient, and resolves by the time the infant is born, and in another 15%, the hydronephrosis persists but is not associated with urinary tract obstruction. Diagnostic workup depends on the age of the patient, as well as whether the hydronephrosis was detected incidentally or prenatally or is associated with other symptoms. Blood tests are typically indicated, though they must be interpreted cautiously.

Even in cases of severe unilateral hydronephrosis, the overall kidney function may remain normal since the unaffected kidney will compensate for the obstructed kidney. Urinalysis is usually performed to determine the presence of blood or signs of infection. Impaired concentrating ability or elevated urine pH are also commonly found due to tubular stress and injury. Imaging studies Imaging studies, such as an intravenous urogram, renal ultrasonography, CT, or MRI, are also important investigations in determining the presence and/ or cause of hydronephrosis. Whilst ultrasound allows for visualisation of the ureters and kidneys, an IVU is useful for assessing the anatomical location of the obstruction.

Antegrade or retrograde pyelography will show similar findings to an IVU but offer a therapeutic option as well. Real-time ultrasounds and Doppler ultrasound tests in association with vascular resistance testing helps determine how a given obstruction is effecting urinary functionality in hydronephrotic patients. In determining the cause of hydronephrosis, the location of obstruction can be determined with a Whittaker test, wherein the collecting system of the kidney is accessed percutaneously, and the liquid is introduced at high pressure and constant rate of 10ml/min while measuring the pressure within the renal pelvis. Kay recommends that a neonate born with untreated in utero hydronephrosis receive a renal ultrasound within two days of birth. A renal pelvis greater than 12 mm in a neonate is considered abnormal and suggests significant dilation and possible abnormalities such as obstruction or morphological abnormalities in the urinary tract.

### A multinational survey on the management of the urinary tract in newborns with spina bifida: are we following current EAU / ESPU guidelines? [^1177FGCY]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

In August 2019, the European Association of Urology (EAU) and European Society for Paediatric Urology (ESPU) published updated guidelines on the management of neurogenic bladder in children and adolescents. Our study aimed to establish whether members of the ESPU are adhering to these guidelines.

Methods

We designed a survey comprising 26 questions using SurveyMonkey®. Respondents were asked about management of neurogenic bladder at birth in newborns with spina bifida (SB), urological investigations, as well as short and long-term follow-up in their institutions.

Results

There were 103 respondents to the survey (754 recipients, giving a response rate of 14%) spanning 36 countries. 100% of respondents carry out a renal/bladder ultrasound at birth. Only 53% routinely commence clean intermittent catheterization soon after birth as recommended by the guidelines. Only 56% recommend anticholinergic medications after abnormal videourodynamics (VUDs). The guidelines recommend the use of continued antibiotic prophylaxis if there is evidence of vesicoureteral reflux and hostile bladder/non-conclusive results on VUDs which is followed by only 30% of providers. 63% of respondents carry out baseline VUDs at the recommended time. Seeing larger volumes of SB patients, having a formal SB protocol, having formal SB multidisciplinary clinics and working in a tertiary referral center did not make respondents more likely to adhere to guidelines.

Conclusions

Our survey demonstrated that large variations from the EAU/ESPU guidelines exist in practice. The study confirms that further work is required across institutions and countries to implement these evidence-based recommendations for standardized practice.

### Congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract [^112GaL9D]. NeoReviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract encompass the spectrum of disorders that include the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. These abnormalities often lead to altered renal size and location, dysplastic changes in the kidney parenchyma, and anomalies in the collecting system. Though the etiology of each of these conditions can be variable, it is known that the collection of these defects represent 40% to 50% of all pediatric end-stage renal disease worldwide. The multifaceted management of these conditions is aimed at preserving kidney function and ultimately delaying the need for transplantation. With the advancement of prenatal ultrasonographic techniques, these conditions are more likely to be diagnosed before birth, which often leads to rapid postnatal intervention and better outcomes.

### Renal aplasia is the predominant cause of congenital solitary kidneys [^115zRQN9]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital solitary kidneys, which are susceptible to renal failure, have been considered mostly due to unilateral renal agenesis and partly due to renal aplasia. Risk of familial recurrence and of other associated anomalies is known to be much higher in renal agenesis than in renal aplasia. However, differential diagnosis between the two renal anomalies is difficult, and renal agenesis has been found much less frequently in ultrasound screening studies of fetuses than in autopsy studies.

Methods

In order to investigate the nature and incidence of the congenital solitary kidney, the present study performed ultrasound screening of the kidneys in 4000 newborn babies. A diagnosis of renal agenesis was made when ultrasound identified no renal parenchyma and renoscintigraphy showed no renal function, and renal aplasia when there was a renal parenchyma without any function.

Results

Primary screening detected 52 babies suspected of having small kidneys and one baby with a multicystic dysplastic kidney, but no baby with renal agenesis. Forty-seven of the 53 babies underwent a second ultrasound scanning at one month of age. Three small kidneys in three babies further decreased in size, had no function and were diagnosed as renal aplasia (which has an incidence rate of one in 1300). Follow-up ultrasound studies showed further regression in all three, which became very hard to distinguish by one year of age.

Conclusions

The present study showed that ultrasound in the neonatal period could identify the aplastic kidney, which had a reniform shape, not rudimentary, during the newborn period, and regressed rapidly thereafter. These findings indicate that most renal agenesis diagnosed clinically thus far might more correctly be renal aplasia.

### Surgery versus non-surgical management for unilateral ureteric-pelvic junction obstruction in newborns and infants less than two years of age [^114Vioet]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Unilateral ureteric-pelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is the most common cause of obstructive uropathy and may lead to renal impairment and loss of renal function. The current diagnostic approach with renal imaging cannot reliably determine which newborns and infants less than two years of age have a significant obstruction and are at risk for permanent kidney damage. There is therefore no consensus on optimal therapeutic management of unilateral UPJO.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical versus non-surgical treatment options for newborns and infants less than two years of age with unilateral UPJO.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 6, 2016), MEDLINE/Ovid, and EMBASE/Ovid databases from their inception to 13 June 2016. We searched the reference lists of potentially relevant studies without using any language restriction. We also searched the following trial registers for relevant registered studies: www.clinicaltrials.gov/; ISRCTN registry (controlled-trials.com/); www.trialscentral.org/; apps.who.int/trialsearch/; www.drks.de/; and www.anzctr.org.au/trialSearch.aspx.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with non-surgical interventions for the treatment of unilateral UPJO.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. In case of disagreements we consulted a third review author. The data reported in the two included studies did not allow us to perform a meta-analysis.

Main Results

We found only two studies at high risk of bias that were eligible for inclusion in this review. The total sample size, including both trials, was small (n = 107 participants less than six months of age from the UK and USA), and not all prespecified outcome measures were assessed. Reported measures only accounted for the short-term follow-ups. The mean split renal function was not statistically different between the surgical and non-surgical group at the six-month or one-year time point (very low-quality evidence). The surgical group showed a significantly less obstructed drainage pattern and a lower urinary tract dilatation than the non-surgical group (very low-quality evidence). Transfer from the non-surgical group to the surgical group was reported for about one out of five participants. Split renal function after secondary surgical intervention was reported with variable results, but most of the participants reverted to pre-deteriorated values. The studies either provided no or insufficient data on the following outcome measures: postoperative complications, UPJO-associated clinical symptoms, costs of interventions, radiation exposure, quality of life, and adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

We found limited evidence assessing the benefits and harms of surgical compared to non-surgical treatment options for newborns and infants less than two years of age with unilateral UPJO. The majority of participants in the non-surgical treatment group did not experience any significant deterioration of split renal function, and only about 20% of them underwent secondary surgical intervention, with minor risk of permanent deteriorated split renal function. The study follow-up period was too short to assess the long-term effects on split renal function in both treatment groups. We need further randomised controlled trials with sufficient statistical power and an adequate follow-up period to determine the optimal therapy for newborns and infants less than two years of age with unilateral UPJO.

### The anuric preterm newborn infant with a normal renal ultrasound: a diagnostic and ethical challenge [^112QRtWn]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2006). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment of an anuric premature infant with severe respiratory compromise and a normal renal ultrasound (US), is a difficult task that requires a multidisciplinary approach. A 29-week gestation premature male infant, born after 5 weeks of worsening oligohydramnios, was ventilated for respiratory distress and remained anuric. Intensive clinical investigations and pediatric nephrology consultation that predicted very poor prognosis were followed by progressive renal failure, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, ventricular arrhythmia, and finally cardiac arrest and death on day 5. In view of the predicted poor outcome, and after discussion with the parents, a decision was made not to start peritoneal dialysis (PD), and to offer only palliative therapy, with comfort care alone. Pre and postnatal diagnosis lead, in this case, to an ethical challenge that focuses on the question of futility.

### Prenatal ultrasonography: implications for pediatric urology [^115vD3zq]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Prenatal ultrasonography has become a critical and integral component of the obstetric care of women worldwide. As a result, a number of congenital anomalies are now routinely being detected prior to birth. Anomalies affecting the genitourinary system are among those most commonly detected, and thus pediatric urologists are increasingly being asked to provide parental counseling in such situations. However, much of the data needed to enhance these discussions and provide informed consent are absent from the literature. In this review, we hope to address the published literature describing the rapidly expanding role of ultrasound in prenatal care. More importantly, however, we hope to provide some insight into the manner in which prenatal ultrasound and subsequent urologic anomaly diagnosis has affected the practice of pediatric urology.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of duplex sonography of native renal vessels [^112QQk3C]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2024). High credibility.

AIUM practice parameter — duplex sonography of native renal vessels states that duplex and color Doppler ultrasound of the renal arteries should be performed in real time using a scanner with color and spectral Doppler capabilities, and transducer selection should be based on body habitus. In adults, typically used transducer frequencies range from 2 to 9 MHz, whereas in neonates transducer frequencies of 7–15 MHz are typically used. Policies and procedures related to quality assurance and improvement, safety, infection control, and equipment-performance monitoring should be developed and implemented in accordance with the AIUM Standards and Guidelines for the Accreditation of Ultrasound Practices, and the ALARA (As Low as Reasonably Achievable) principle should be observed. For infection control, transducer preparation, cleaning, and disinfection should follow manufacturer recommendations and be consistent with the AIUM's Guidelines for Cleaning and Preparing External- and Internal-Use Ultrasound Transducers Between Patients, Safe Handling, and Use of Ultrasound Coupling Gel, and monitoring protocols for equipment performance should be developed and implemented in accordance with the AIUM Standards and Guidelines for the Accreditation of Ultrasound Practice.

### Do babies with isolated single umbilical artery need routine postnatal renal ultrasonography? [^112KKkpS]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of isolated single umbilical artery (SUA) in infants has been associated with an increased risk of occult renal malformations. However, the need for routine postnatal renal imaging of such infants, especially in an era of now routine antenatal fetal sonography, is controversial.

Aim

To determine the prevalence of significant renal anomalies and the need for routine postnatal renal imaging in infants with isolated SUA.

Methods

Consecutive infants born over 6 years with isolated SUA were offered renal sonography at 4–8 weeks of age. The prevalence of clinically significant renal anomalies in these infants was compared with that detected through routine antenatal fetal scanning and postnatal case findings in a geographically defined control cohort.

Results

During the study period, SUA was found in 137 of 33 067 (4.1/1000) live born infants. Infants with isolated SUA (n = 129) were significantly more likely to be preterm and small for gestational age. 122 infants with isolated SUA (95%) underwent renal ultrasonography; only two infants (1.6%, 95% CI 0.20 to 5.5) had clinically significant renal anomalies, a prevalence similar to that in the control cohort (0.4%, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.45; p = 0.74). Four of eight infants with coexistent systemic malformations had abnormal postnatal renal imaging.

Conclusion

The presence of isolated SUA is associated with increased risk of prematurity and fetal growth restriction. In this largest series of isolated SUA, there was no excess of significant renal malformations among infants with isolated SUA. Postnatal renal ultrasonography is not routinely warranted in such infants.

### Sonographic assessment of renal size and growth in premature infants [^1137D2Es]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Low birth-weight infants are at risk for renal disease when renal insults occur in the neonatal period. Renal growth as measured by sonography over time is utilized by many nephrologists as predictors of future renal disease.

Objective

To identify infants at risk by defining normal renal growth for the very premature infant.

Materials and Methods

Renal growth was evaluated in 30 infants whose birth weight was 1,500 g or less and gestational age was < 31 weeks. During a 2-month time period, three US measurements were taken (first week of life, age 28 days, and age 56 days or earlier if discharged). Infants were divided according to birth weight: the extremely low birth-weight group (ELBW) was < 1,000 g (n = 14), and the very low birth-weight group (VLBW) was 1,000–1,500 g (n = 16).

Results

In both groups, the right and left renal lengths were similar. In the ELBW group, the initial mean length was 3.25 cm and grew to 4.16 cm, while the mean volume was 4.85 cm and grew to 10.39 cm. In the VLBW group the initial mean length was 3.69 cm and grew to 4.35 cm while the mean volume was 7.25 cm and grew to 11.83 cm.

Conclusion

These data establish normal expected growth for future studies.

### Utility of post-urinary tract infection imaging in patients with normal prenatal renal ultrasound [^115Wx7qy]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends renal ultrasound (RUS) and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) for all infants after a first urinary tract infection (UTI). However, many congenital renal anomalies are identified by a prenatal US. At the present time, there are no data regarding the yield of post-UTI imaging among infants who have a documented normal prenatal US. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients < 1 year of age with a first UTI who had normal kidneys noted on prenatal US to determine the frequency of abnormal findings. Abnormal RUS and VCUG results were noted in 5.1% (24 of 471) and 20.4% (75 of 368) of infants, respectively. While the abnormal US rate is significantly less than what has been previously reported, the frequency of abnormal VCUGs is similar. These results suggest that a post-UTI RUS may not be needed if the prenatal US was normal. However, a VCUG continues to be indicated.

### Appropriate timing of performing abdominal ultrasonography and termination of follow-up observation for antenatal grade 1 or 2 hydronephrosis [^111JD9yM]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Fetal hydronephrosis (HN) is the most common anomaly detected on antenatal ultrasonography, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 2–5.5%. In most cases, HN is diagnosed in the absence of urinary tract obstruction, when the anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis is just above the normal range for gestational age. Studies have shown that most cases of antenatal HN improve or resolve spontaneously with conservative treatment. The cases of 98% in the Society of Fetal Urology (SFU) grade 1or 2 HN improve or resolve in a systematic review of seven articles meta-analysis. The resolution rate of SFU grade 1 and 2 are reported to be 98–99% and 60–98% in two prospective studies. However, some patients do not show improvement or increase grade of HN, and a few cases need operation. The detection and postnatal follow-up of persistent antenatal HN is believed to help in the early recognition and prevention of progressive renal damage. There is no consensus on the duration of follow-up for cases of grade 1or 2 HN. In patients with SFU grades 1 and 2 HN, a more abbreviated follow-up may be warranted and could save costs. However, It has been pointed out that SFU grade 1 and grade 2 show different natural course, and there is concern whether similar follow-up may be acceptable for SFU grade 1 and grade 2. The aim of this study is to examine the hypothesis that there are different continuous follow-up period and new management for children with antenatal SFU grade 1or 2 HN.

### Non-radiologist-performed point-of-care ultrasonography in paediatrics-European society of paediatric radiology position paper [^112wSjcR]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-radiologist point-of-care ultrasonography (US) is increasingly implemented in paediatric care because it is believed to facilitate a timely diagnosis, such as in ascites or dilated renal pelvicalyceal systems, and can be used to guide interventional procedures. To date, all policy statements have been published by non-radiologic societies. The European Society of Paediatric Radiology hereby issues a position statement on paediatric non-radiologist point-of-care US from the point of view of those leading on children's imaging, i.e. paediatric radiologists. In this position statement, we will address the boundaries, education, credentialing, quality control, reporting and storage of images in paediatric practice.

### Irbesartan (Avapro) [^114Gx8EL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

AVAPRO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death [see Clinical Considerations]. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue AVAPRO as soon as possible.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes regardless of drug exposure. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and postpartum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions

Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death.

In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative treatment. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to AVAPRO for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia and other symptoms of renal impairment. In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to AVAPRO, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^115B16df]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline — Action Statement 5 (ultrasound evaluation): Febrile infants with UTIs should undergo renal and bladder ultrasonography (RBUS) (evidence quality: C; recommendation), and ideally, the patient should be well-hydrated for the examination and the bladder should be evaluated while distended. Concern has been raised that RBUS is not effective to detect vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), as it is frequently normal in infants with low-grade VUR and even in some who have high-grade VUR; although RBUS is not invariably abnormal in infants with grades IV and V VUR, it does identify most, and an abnormal RBUS is a major risk factor for scarring.

### Reversed cortico-medullary differentiation in the fetal and neonatal kidneys: an indicator of poor prognosis? [^115TBYdR]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Bilateral reversed cortico-medullary differentiation is rarely observed on fetal or neonatal renal ultrasound and is therefore a diagnostic challenge.

Objective

Our purpose was to widen the differential diagnoses of fetal and neonatal nephropathies introducing reversed cortico-medullary differentiation as a clue either on obstetric US or during follow-up of hyperechoic kidneys in order to improve the management of such rare clinical situations.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the US images of 11 patients showing bilateral reversed cortico-medullary differentiation on prenatal examination or in which this pattern developed postnatally in the follow-up of fetal hyperechoic kidneys. For each patient, a precise diagnosis was established either on clinical assessment or, when available, on histological or genetic findings.

Results

Six fetuses displayed bilateral reversed cortico-medullary differentiation on obstetric examination, and the pattern persisted throughout pregnancy. In the five other fetuses, the kidneys appeared initially homogeneously hyperechoic; this evolved into reversed cortico-medullary differentiation during the third trimester in two cases and shortly after birth in three cases. Two pregnancies were terminated because of estimated poor prognosis. In the nine surviving neonates, four died of renal failure in the post-natal period. The clinical evolution was more favorable in the remaining five newborns.

Conclusions

Six different diagnoses were established in patients presenting with a reversed cortico-medullary differentiation renal pattern. This finding was associated with poor outcome in six cases. An acute prenatal diagnosis of reversed cortico-medullary differentiation improves pre- and postnatal work-up and guides counseling and genetic testing.

### The role of routine post-natal abdominal ultrasound for newborns in a resource-poor setting: a longitudinal study [^114sGFJY]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background-

Neonatal abdominal ultrasound is usually performed in Nigeria to investigate neonatal symptoms rather than as a follow up to evaluate fetal abnormalities which were detected on prenatal ultrasound. The role of routine obstetric ultrasonography in the monitoring of pregnancy and identification of fetal malformations has partly contributed to lowering of fetal mortality rates. In Nigeria which has a high maternal and fetal mortality rate, many pregnant women do not have ante-natal care and not infrequently, women also deliver their babies at home and only bring the newborns to the clinics for immunization. Even when performed, most routine obstetric scans are not targeted towards the detection of fetal abnormalities.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the benefit of routinely performing abdominal scans on newborns with a view to detecting possible abnormalities which may have been missed ante-natally.

Methods-

This was a longitudinal study of 202 consecutive, apparently normal newborns. Routine clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound scans were performed on the babies by their mother's bedside, before discharge. Neonates with abnormal initial scans had follow-up scans.

Results-

There were 108 males and 94 females. There were 12 (5.9%) abnormal scans seen in five male and seven female neonates. Eleven of the twelve abnormalities were in the kidneys, six on the left and five on the right. Three of the four major renal anomalies- absent kidney, ectopic/pelvic kidney and two cases of severe hydronephrosis were however on the left side. There was one suprarenal abnormality on the right suspected to be a possible infected adrenal haemorrage. Nine of the abnormal cases reported for follow- up and of these, two cases had persistent severe abnormalities.

Conclusions-

This study demonstrated a 5.9% incidence of genito urinary anomalies on routine neonatal abdominal ultrasound in this small population. Routine obstetric USS is very useful but inadequate availability of skilled personnel and cost implications create great challenges in poor resource settings like Nigeria. However, awareness should be created so that parents who can afford such investigations can make informed decisions.

### Antenatally diagnosed kidney anomalies [^115XX7bR]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract encompass a broad spectrum of developmental conditions that together account for the majority of childhood chronic kidney diseases. Kidney abnormalities are the most commonly diagnosed congenital anomaly in children, and detection of this anomaly is increasing as a result of improved antenatal care and widespread access to more sensitive screening ultrasonography. Most paediatricians will encounter children with congenital kidney anomalies across a wide spectrum of disorders, and a broad understanding of the classification, investigation, and basis of management is important to appropriately direct their care.

### Association between severity of prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis and receipt of surgical intervention postnatally among patients seen at a fetal-maternal center [^115Sxyhh]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydronephrosis (HN) is a descriptive term for dilation of one or both kidneys. It is the most common prenatal abnormality detected by ultrasound and is diagnosed in one to five percent of pregnancies. Increased prenatal screening has enabled physicians to diagnose prenatal HN more readily. Renal ultrasonography (US) and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) are often performed postnatally for physicians to assess renal function and consider treatment plans.

The Society for Fetal Urology (SFU) has categorized the severity of HN into grades 1–4. This system takes into consideration the degree of pelvic dilation, presence of calyceal dilation, and thinning of parenchymal tissue in the kidneys. Despite advances in prenatal ultrasound screening for HN, there is still some ambiguity in criteria for diagnosing severity and appropriate management. There is debate about the cutoff values for the SFU grading system, though efforts have been made by various professional groups to consolidate findings into a more comprehensible management guide for practicing urologists. Another highly contested matter is the threshold at which surgical intervention is needed. Gender, age, and the presence of urological comorbidities are factors that must also be considered during the course of treatment.

### Potential of modern sonographic techniques in paediatric uroradiology [^111BNW4v]. European Journal of Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the potential of modern sonographic techniques in paediatric uroradiology.

Method

Ultrasound (US)-now being the primary imaging tool-has revolutionised imaging diagnostic in the urinary tract. Constant developments and technical refinements have secured the role of US in uroradiology. Colour Doppler Sonography (CDS) and innovative applications such as the transperineal approach or application of m-mode US to the urinary tract have helped to develop US from just a basic tool to a sophisticated and respected method. The ongoing introduction of new and even more sophisticated methods further enhance the sonographic potential, which shall be demonstrated by a more detailed discussion of these methods.

Results

Harmonic imaging, extended field of view US, amplitude coded CDS, echo-enhanced US, and three-dimensional US as the most recent new sonographic techniques are successfully applicable to paediatric urinary tract disease. They improve sonographic diagnosis in many conditions, such as detection of vesico-ureteral reflux, renal parenchymal volume assessment, comprehensive visualisation of hydronephrosis and complex pathology, evaluation of renal perfusional disturbances or defects, superior documentation with improved comparability for follow-up, or simply by offering clearer tissue delineation and differentiation.

Conclusion

Modern US techniques are successfully applicable to neonates, infants, and children, further boosting the value of US in the paediatric urinary tract. However, as handling became more sophisticated, and artefacts have to be considered, modern urosonography became not only a more powerful, but also a more demanding method, with the need for expert knowledge and dedicated training.

### The role of routine post-natal abdominal ultrasound for newborns in a resource-poor setting: a longitudinal study [^114MbFHm]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Caliceal diverticular cysts may be congenital or acquired and they communicate with the calyces or renal pelvis. It may be associated with hydronephrosis and diagnosed ante-natally. They may be asymptomatic but about 50% are associated with stones but this was not seen in the case above.

The incidence of incidental adrenal masses on imaging has been put at between 0.6 to 1.3% and is higher with abdominal CT scan. Adrenal tumors and adrenal haemorrhage can be diagnosed with USS and it has been reported that prenatal USS diagnosis of neuroblastoma results in a higher survival rate as it is identified at an early stage. Adrenal haemorrhage results from multiple patho-physiological factors. It is seen in about 1.9 per 1000 live births and it is the commonest cause of adrenal mass in the neonate, usually presenting between day 2 and day 7 of life. It is more commonly seen in neonates than in children or adults because the neonatal gland is about two times larger and therefore prone to hypotension and asphyxia. The neonate with suspected adrenal haemorrhage in this study also had jaundice which is a known association. Other known associations include a palpable flank mass, anaemia and hypovolemic shock but it could also be asymptomatic. Serial imaging with ultrasound until complete resolution is advised for these cases as was done for this patient in whom complete resolution was seen at six months. USS is the examination of choice in neonates with suspected adrenal hematoma. Initial USS typically shows a complex, echogenic mass with inferior displacement of the kidney if the bleed is large. Over time, the mass becomes smaller, cystic and echolucent over a period of weeks. It may also subsequently develop calcifications. The USS appearance is however variable as seen in this case where the initial finding was a hypoechoic mass on second day of life, which subsequently became smaller and echogenic at six weeks and disappeared by six months.

The limitations of this study include the small sample size and the cases lost to follow up, more babies need to be scanned to be able to make pronouncements on the incidences of documented abnormal cases in the study area. Another limitation is that all ultrasound scans were performed by a single operator (AMA). This was because only one portable ultrasound machine was available to perform bedside scans which ensured the cooperation of mothers and performance of scans before discharge from hospital. However, AMA is an experienced sonologist with over twelve years experience as a consultant sonologist.

### Neonatal and early infancy management of prenatally detected hydronephrosis [^113a2pwb]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Hydronephrosis discovered during prenatal ultrasound will often resolve spontaneously; however, it should be evaluated in the postnatal period in a manner commensurate with its risk of renal injury. Early intervention is appropriate in cases of bladder outlet obstruction or the severely obstructed solitary kidney. In most other cases, it is both safe and reasonable to allow the possibility of spontaneous improvement with the intensity of follow-up based on the severity of the hydronephrosis. Clinical decision making should be a shared process between families and caregivers.

### When fetal hydronephrosis is suspected antenatally – a qualitative study [^113sEtGF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Ultrasound examination plays an important role in diagnosing urogenital malformations, but it fails to detect all of the urogenital developmental. One of the most common malformations is suspicious fetal HN, also called mild renal pyelectasis. It is most frequently noted in the left kidney and is more prevalent in males. A dilatation of the pelvis and/or calyces of the kidney are signs of suspected fetal HN. Consensus has yet to be reached regarding a measurement of the renal pelvis that is considered to be normal. However, the dilatation of renal pelvis is associated with risk for unfavourable outcomes. It is difficult to accurately predict the outcome with dilatation between 4 and 10 mm. The dilatation can progress, regress or remain stable during gestation. In Sweden, the follow-up ultrasound examination is typically scheduled between gestational week 32–34, about four months after the initial detection, and at this time dilation more than 7 mm is considered pathologic. HN does not generally cause any long-term problems if it is diagnosed and treated promptly. Undetected HN however could cause pain, either in the side and back or abdomen or groin. Other symptoms can include pain during urination or incomplete urination or incontinence, infections, nausea and fever. About 35% of newborns with prenatal diagnosis of fetal HN show a normal anatomy upon ultrasound examination.

There are studies that relate to women's experiences of prenatal diagnosis of major fetal malformation, followed by decision of termination. In the published literature we were unable to find research that focused specifically on women's reactions to suspected HN.

The aim of this study was to explore women's reactions to the discovery of fetal hydronephrosis in the context of uncertainty regarding the prognosis.

### Postnatal investigation of fetal renal disease [^117UuvG2]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2001). Low credibility.

The antenatal ultrasound diagnosis of renal tract abnormalities is now firmly established. Postnatal imaging protocols are constantly evolving and still many questions remain unanswered. Most infants are asymptomatic at birth and aggressive imaging is unwarranted both for the infant and overburdened Radiology departments. The urgency with which to undertake imaging relates to the suspected antenatal diagnosis and clinical scenario, with bilateral hydronephrosis, posterior urethral valves and complicated duplex systems taking a high priority. The main imaging modality postnatally remains ultrasound, and together with nuclear medicine gives a powerful combination of both anatomy and function. Intravenous urography is never indicated in the neonate.

### Prenatal urinary tract dilatation [^117HLW1Z]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract dilatation (UTD) is the most common congenital anomaly detected on prenatal ultrasonography (US), affecting 1% to 3% of all pregnancies. This article focuses on the prenatal detection of UTD and the postnatal evaluation and management based on the UTD grading system risk assessment. Prophylactic antibiotics and postnatal imaging are discussed. The recent management trend is for a more conservative approach to minimize unnecessary testing and exposures to the fetus and neonate while detecting those who may have clinically significant disorder. The renal bladder US remains a critical part of the evaluation and helps guide further investigations.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^112pbeqA]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Renal and bladder ultrasonography after initial febrile UTI — Febrile infants with UTIs should undergo renal and bladder ultrasonography (RBUS) (evidence quality: C; recommendation). The purpose of RBUS is to detect anatomic abnormalities that require further evaluation, such as additional imaging or urologic consultation, and RBUS also provides an evaluation of the renal parenchyma and an assessment of renal size that can be used to monitor renal growth. The yield of actionable findings is relatively low, and widespread application of prenatal ultrasonography clearly has reduced the prevalence of previously unsuspected obstructive uropathy in infants, but the consequences of prenatal screening with respect to the risk of renal abnormalities in infants with UTIs have not yet been well defined.

### Kidney growth following preterm birth: evaluation with renal parenchyma ultrasonography [^111moU2D]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

This apparent "catch-up" and extrauterine increase of the thickness of the renal parenchyma of preterm infants between 32- and 37-weeks PMA may therefore be due to a combination of glomerulomegaly and hypertrophy of the proximal tubules, along with other interstitial structures within the parenchyma which are not yet clearly known. It is important to note that our study is a clinical study and therefore it is unable to directly demonstrate any components of impaired nephrogenesis. Rather, it provides non-invasive, clinical imaging which supports the pre-clinical and autopsy studies that demonstrate preterm birth does impair nephrogenesis.

Starting life with a reduced nephron number leads to an increased demand on the remaining nephrons. With further kidney insults during life, there can be further impacts on renal function and an increasing likelihood of developing CKD and hypertension. There is a need to optimize extrauterine renal development by seeking to modify factors that impact nephrogenesis in the extrauterine environment. Intervention would support the development of maximum nephron numbers and quality early in life to sustain optimal renal function throughout life. The impact of prematurity on extrauterine nephrogenesis and its potential impact on the long-term health of the infant should create awareness among clinicians to be more judicious on using potential nephrotoxic treatment options, such as aminoglycosides and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, while the infants are in the neonatal intensive care unit. – Tools such as measuring the renal parenchymal thickness may assist in identifying treatments that may have the least detrimental effect on renal growth and function.

Our study did not assess the different factors that may have precipitated the preterm birth or the many conditions and factors of the postnatal environment which can potentially disrupt kidney development and result in a decrease in the quantity and quality of nephrons. The focus of the study was to investigate the use of ultrasound to non-invasively measure the renal parenchymal thickness to evaluate extrauterine kidney growth. The study had a relatively small cohort size with some loss of follow-up due to transfers back to regional hospitals.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^113tYCv5]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Reflux nephropathy and Congenital Abnormalities of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT)

Guideline 5.6.1

We recommend women with previous bladder surgery (re-implantation of ureter, bladder reconstruction, all complex paediatric urology) should be discussed during pregnancy with a urologist with expertise in bladder reconstruction to evaluate options for delivery (1D).

Rationale

The majority of women with previous urinary tract surgery can have healthy, successful pregnancies without compromise to previous urinary tract reconstruction. No long-term adverse outcomes were identified in a case series of 29 pregnancies in the UK, although urinary tract infections (55%) and upper renal tract obstruction (10%) were common. The anatomy of the lower urinary tract following reconstructive bladder surgery can be variable, and the risk of obstruction caused by the gravid uterus, or damage to bladder and ureters during caesarean section, should be anticipated. Caesarean section is not mandatory but can be performed, and when feasible, should be done with input from a urologist with experience in bladder reconstruction.

Guideline 5.6.2

We recommend that antenatally detected abnormalities in the fetal kidneys and/or urinary tract should be discussed with fetal medicine and paediatric nephrology specialists to determine appropriate neonatal management (1D).

Guideline 5.6.3

We recommend that children with antenatally detected abnormalities in the fetal kidneys and/or urinary tract should have specialist follow up if features of urinary tract infection are identified (1C).

Rationale

There are inadequate data to define an evidence-based management strategy for antenatally detected abnormalities of the urinary tract. Expert consensus, based on observational data, is that infants of mothers with urinary tract abnormalities, who had normal urinary tracts on antenatal ultrasound scans do not need further follow up unless features of urinary tract infection are identified in childhood. Neonatal management of antenatally detected abnormalities of the urinary tract will be dependent on the severity of the radiologically identified abnormality and clinical features in the newborn.

The inheritance pattern and penetrance of forms of CAKUT from parent to child is poorly defined. Heterogeneous multifactorial genetic traits are likely but monogenic forms of inheritance have also been described. Cohort studies report between 36 and 67% of children of patients with vesicoureteric reflux demonstrate reflux on a voiding cystourethrogram. However, not all vesicoureteric reflux results in renal parenchymal damage and 80% of mild cases resolve by 5 years.

### Fetal urinary tract dilation: what to tell the parents [^115Mntd3]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract dilation (UTD), which refers to the abnormal dilation of the urinary collection system, is the most common finding on prenatal ultrasound and presents with varying severity, presentation, etiology, and prognosis. Prenatal classification and risk stratification aim to prevent postnatal complications, such as urinary tract infections and further kidney dysfunction. Parents expecting a child with UTD should be counseled by a multidisciplinary team consisting of maternal-fetal medicine specialists, and pediatric urology and nephrology providers. This review summarizes the key points in the diagnostic evaluation and management during the prenatal and initial postnatal period, focusing on the information that should be provided to future parents. We address frequently asked parental questions and concerns that our multidisciplinary clinical practice faces.

### Kidney growth following preterm birth: evaluation with renal parenchyma ultrasonography [^111zRSyG]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study used a non-invasive imaging technique to offer insights into extrauterine nephrogenesis and our data demonstrated that at 32-weeks PMA, after an approximately six weeks extrauterine growth, the preterm infants had a significantly thinner renal parenchyma compared to the intrauterine fetal measurements. This thinner renal parenchyma in the preterm infants implies they have fewer layers of nephrons and a reduced nephron endowment. In preterm infants nephrogenesis has been demonstrated to continue extrauterine for up to 40 days. It is, however, thought to be impacted by both prenatal and postnatal issues such as intrauterine and extrauterine growth restriction, nephrotoxic medications, hyperoxia, sepsis, and hemodynamic factors in the neonatal care of the infant. Our findings are supported by autopsy studies demonstrating preterm infants had a thinner nephrogenic zone with fewer layers of glomeruli. Studies using ultrasound to assess renal volume also suggest that preterm infants have fewer nephrons.

### Mild to moderate postnatal hydronephrosis – grading systems and management [^11628zGL]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2013). Medium credibility.

No universal guidelines exist for the management of patients with mild to moderate antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH). Unsurprisingly, practice patterns vary considerably with respect to recommendations for postnatal evaluation and follow-up imaging schedule. Although some clinical tools are available to specifically grade ANH and postnatal hydronephrosis, these are commonly used interchangeably with varying degrees of success. A universal classification system and nomenclature are needed to best identify patients at risk of renal deterioration, UTI and need for surgical intervention. We present our own approach to postnatal risk stratification and management, including recommendations regarding serial ultrasonography schedule, prophylactic antibiotics, voiding cystourethrogram and renal scintigraphy.

### Dysplastic and polycystic kidneys: diagnosis, associations and management [^114HA1JK]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2001). Low credibility.

Cystic and bright kidneys can pose a significant diagnostic dilemma when discovered as an incidental finding at the time of a routine fetal ultrasound scan. There are diverse aetiologies with equally variable implications for the prognosis in the affected fetus, and for future pregnancies. Accurate antenatal diagnosis in the absence of any positive family history is often not possible and a team approach to management (to include the fetal medicine specialist, paediatric nephrologist or urologist, geneticists and in some cases, pathologist) is essential. In this review we will attempt to describe the embryology and aetiology of these conditions and suggest an approach to management.

### Kidney growth following preterm birth: evaluation with renal parenchyma ultrasonography [^111cE9jK]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Preterm birth is inextricably linked to impaired nephrogenesis and reduced nephron endowment in infancy, leading to hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults. – With improving survival of preterm infants at earlier and earlier gestations we must also consider the impact of birth on the premature kidneys and long-term kidney function. Nephrogenesis continues in-utero until 36 weeks and therefore in preterm infants it is still in progress, to some degree, in the extrauterine environment. Studies have demonstrated that the extrauterine environment appears to adversely affect nephrogenesis, resulting in less layers of nephrons formed and an increased number of maldeveloped and dysfunctional glomeruli within the nephrons. Finally, during life, additional insults to the kidneys may further decrease nephron number making the development of CKD and hypertension much more likely, than for those born with a full complement of nephrons. Data from animal and human autopsy studies have demonstrated postnatal extrauterine nephrogenesis in preterm infants is different to normal intrauterine kidney development, with preterm infants having fewer functional nephrons. The challenge is to be able to assess nephron number non-invasively.

Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality for the assessment of neonatal kidneys as it is non-invasive, lacks ionizing radiation, mobile, widely available, and relatively inexpensive compared to other imaging. Renal volume, derived from measurement of the length, width, and height of the kidney, is used as a method to estimate nephron number, however, renal volume includes measurement of the parenchyma and the intrarenal collecting system. In the setting of hydronephrosis, a volume measurement would overestimate the true volume of kidney tissue and the kidney may actually have thinning of the parenchyma and a reduced nephron endowment. We have previously demonstrated that measuring only the renal parenchyma has less variance than renal volume and appears to be a more accurate method to estimate nephron number. There are currently, to our knowledge, no studies comparing renal parenchymal growth between preterm delivered infants and undelivered normally grown fetuses who would be expected to achieve optimal renal parenchymal growth and ideal nephron endowment.

The aim of this study was to compare the extrauterine growth of the renal parenchymal thickness in preterm infants to intrauterine renal parenchymal growth of appropriately grown fetuses at the same gestation. This study uses an ultrasound measurement of the renal parenchyma as an indirect estimate of in-vivo nephron number. As preterm birth is thought to impair nephrogenesis, we hypothesized that extrauterine renal parenchymal thickness is different from intrauterine fetal renal parenchymal thickness.

### Framework for kidney health follow-up among neonates with critical cardiac disease: a report from the neonatal kidney health consensus workshop [^114cAJZ8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Assessment of Kidney Health in Follow‐Up

The 2012 KDIGO AKI guidelines recommend evaluating patients at least 3 months after AKI events for resolution or to identify new‐onset or worsening of preexisting CKDWe recommend that a KHA include 3 key components: (1) appropriately obtained blood pressure, (2) assessment for microalbuminuria, and (3) kidney function tests including serum creatinine and cystatin C to allow calculation of eGFR. In addition, obtaining a kidney ultrasound before the index (neonatal) hospital discharge after birth is recommended to assess for congenital kidney anomalies and baseline kidney characteristics, including kidney size/volume.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends early routine annual blood pressure (BP) measurements for infants with critical cardiac disease, those who are born prematurely or are of low birth weight, and/or are admitted to an intensive care unit, at each well‐child visit before age 3 years given the increased risk of hypertension. In addition, those with a history of AKI during the neonatal period may benefit from earlier and more frequent BP measurements.BP measurements are often the mainstay of outpatient cardiology visits, aiding in the interpretation of progressive CKD, although hypertension may be related to underlying cardiac disease, so personalized management is necessary. In a small study, hypertension occurred with a prevalence of up to 17% of children 5 years after cardiac surgeryHypertension (defined as BP ≥ 95th percentile for height, age, and sex) is a modifiable risk factor for the progression of CKD in children. An appropriate technique for BP measurement is essential to diagnose hypertension accurately.

### Enalapril (enalapril maleate) [^112Cmp3q]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Enalapril maleate oral solution can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue enalapril maleate oral solution as soon as possible.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) are unknown. In the general U.S. population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Adverse reactions in the fetus or in neonates with a history of in utero exposure to enalapril maleate

Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, oligohydramnios, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydraminos may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to enalapril maleate oral solution for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria or hypotension occurs in neonates with a history of in utero exposure to enalapril maleate oral solution, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and substituting for disordered renal function.

### Efficacy of prenatal ultrasonography in diagnosing urogenital developmental anomalies in newborns [^113AVHMz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Postnatally and prenatally diagnosed fetal urogenital developmental malformations coincided in almost half of the cases. Our results have confirmed that ultrasound tests play an important role in diagnosing urogenital malformations but they do not always allow the detection of all urogenital developmental malformations. It has been concluded that among the disorders such as fetal hydronephrosis and other obstructive uropathies as well as the cases of renal dysplasia and female genital malformations, it is ovarian cysts that can be detected with great certainty in the fetus prenatally. In contrast, other renal disorders and male genital malformations are found at a low rate. Being aware of the above is important for experts performing ultrasound tests, health professionals in providing genetic counselling and prenatal care and, also, neonatologists and paediatricians seeing newborns. During prenatal care, the expectant mother should be given adequate information about the efficacy of the examinations. If a malformation is detected postnatally, the couple should also be informed how reliably the specific malformation is detectable by prenatal sonography.

### The role of routine post-natal abdominal ultrasound for newborns in a resource-poor setting: a longitudinal study [^116MXYph]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

There are conflicting reports on the optimal time to perform a postnatal abdominal scan for urological abnormalities after birth. Proponents of delaying scan till 72 hours after birth suggest that earlier scans may be misleading due to relative oliguria in the first 72 hours of life which may lead to underestimation of the degree of hydronephrosis. However, other studies have not corroborated this claim and it is technically more convenient to perform the scans before the mother and neonate are discharged home, usually within 48 hours after birth, as was done in this study. The default cases who failed to keep their follow-up visits also suggest that pre-discharge scans are more desirable in the study area.

On prenatal ultrasound, the most frequently seen fetal abnormalities are those of the urinary system. Of these, hydronephrosis is the commonest, seen in about 50% of such cases, and it occurs commonly in males. Fetal USS evaluation of the urinary system is possible from the 15 th week of gestation but USS at about 32 weeks gestation is the best time for detecting these abnormalities as an earlier scan in the same fetus may have been normal.

For cases of hydronephrosis not diagnosed in-utero, the role of post-natal abdominal ultrasound will be to determine the cases due to obstruction which can lead to renal damage and therefore require surgical intervention or long term follow-up of renal function. If hydronephrosis is seen in the fetal kidneys, the SFU grading system or the renal pelvis diameter (RPD) measurement is used to determine cases that need post-natal follow up with USS, micturating cysto-urethrogram (MCUG) or diuretic renogram. MCUG is done to rule out associated vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) seen in 20%- 33% of patients and posterior uretheral valves (PUV) which may co-exist in patients with bilateral hydronephrosis. Diuretic renography is useful to evaluate the degree of obstruction and determine differential renal function. There are no specific guidelines for these cases in our institution but the two cases with persistent hydronephrosis were referred for MCUG which is available in our centre.

### Renal ultrasound [^114jrwkE]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Renal US is one of several imaging modalities available to the EP in the evaluation of patients with acute urologic disorders. It offers excellent anatomic detail without exposure to radiation or contrast agents but is limited in its assessment of renal function. It is an important alternative to helical CT scanning for evaluating renal colic, especially in children and pregnant women. It has an important role in excluding bilateral renal obstruction as the cause of acute renal failure. It is likely that Doppler renal US also will take on a prominent role in the evaluation of renal vascular disorders. It already has become the standard of care in the management of renal transplant patients. Bedside emergency renal US performed and interpreted by EPs with limited training and experience is increasing in use and gaining acceptance. At present, the primary role of renal US is to identify hydronephrosis in patients with renal colic or acute renal failure but, in the future, its role likely will expand as technology advances and its use increases. In many patients, bedside renal US may obviate the need for further diagnostic workup and speed the diagnosis and treatment of an emergency patient.

### Ultrasound screening for congenital pyelectasis in term pregnancies [^113TpgUU]. American Journal of Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the role of antenatal ultrasound screening for congenital pyelectasis at term with postnatal screening. An ultrasonographic prospective study of 231 fetuses of low-risk pregnancies was performed, evaluating the renal pelvis at term (38 to 42 weeks gestation) and after birth (first and third months of life). Cut-off points used were 9 mm antenatally, and 10 and 12 mm, respectively postnatally, all in an anteroposterior view. A sensitivity of 20% and a specificity of 93.4% was obtained when comparing the antenatal versus the third-month scan, whereas when we compared the sonograms from the first versus the third month of life, we found a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 89.7%, with a positive predictive value of 14.7% in the first case and 25% in the second case. A p value < 0.001 was obtained when comparing the sensitivities; a p value of 0.2 was reported when comparing the specificities. Data on a comparative screening of the renal pelvis measured antenatally at term and postnatally do not exist. Although it is extremely feasible, the measurement of the fetal renal pelvis during the routine ultrasound scan at term of gestation seems of no benefit in terms of sensitivity and positive predictive values in identifying infants affected by congenital pyelectasis. Because of the low values of sensitivity obtained in our study, a screening program for the renal pelvis dilation both in fetuses and newborns cannot be recommended.

Develop estimating equations for GFR prior to and after hospital discharge using measured GFR in neonates and infants born preterm Compare measured GFR to estimated GFR in children aged 2 y born preterm Develop methods to determine when nephrogenesis is complete in humans Understanding how specific etiologies and severities of neonatal AKI affect long-term kidney health and risk for CKD progression. Preterm infants, critically ill infants with AKI, and infants with critical cardiac disease are at-risk of CKD following NICU discharge. We recommend all at-risk infants have a discharge kidney health evaluation that includes a properly obtained blood pressure, serum creatinine level, and kidney health education in preparation for hospital discharge. In infants with evidence of kidney disease at discharge, we recommend follow-up with pediatric nephrology according to local guidance. For all at-risk patients, we recommend BP monitoring at all health care encounters. For those at high risk of CKD, we recommend a comprehensive kidney health assessment at 2 years of age that includes serum creatinine and cystatin C levels to estimate glomerular filtration rate, BP assessment, and urine albumin/creatinine levels. We recommend at-risk preterm infants have BP assessment and kidney health education at age 2 years in conjunction with standard care. Clinicians should consider comprehensive kidney health assessment if there are significant exposures that modulate risk.

We recommend high-risk preterm infants have a comprehensive kidney health assessment in conjunction with standard care at age 2 years or sooner if there are significant exposures or events that modulate risk. In a Swedish birth registry study, the adjusted hazard ratio for CKD by adulthood in those born at less than 28 weeks' gestation was 3.
01. 14 Thus, we recommend, in addition to kidney health education and BP assessment at every health care encounter, infants born younger than 28 weeks' gestation have a 2-year comprehensive kidney health assessment. Assessment may occur sooner if additional CKD risk factors or significant exposures are present. Infants born at 28 to 34 weeks' gestation also have increased risk of CKD and HTN. A Swedish birth registry study found an HR for this population for CKD at 43 years was 1. 94.

### Urinary tract dilation in the fetus and neonate [^113SUZKF]. NeoReviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract dilation (UTD), previously known as hydronephrosis, is the most common congenital condition identified on prenatal ultrasonography. UTD can be physiologic and resolve spontaneously or can be caused by various congenital anomalies of the urinary tract, which can lead to renal failure if not treated properly. In 2014, a multidisciplinary consensus group established UTD definitions, a classification system, and a standardized scheme for perinatal evaluation. Various imaging modalities are available to help diagnose the cause of UTD in fetuses and neonates and to help identify those patients who may benefit from fetal or early postnatal intervention. In this article, we will review the diagnosis and quantification of antenatal and postnatal UTD based on the UTD classification system, outline the imaging studies available to both evaluateUTD and determine its cause, briefly review the most common causes of UTD in the fetus and neonate, outline management strategies for UTD including the role for fetal intervention and prophylactic antibiotics, and report on the outcome and prognosis in patients with UTD.

### Reference ranges of kidney dimensions in term newborns: sonographic measurements [^1168SEFd]. Pediatric Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Ultrasonographic measurement of kidney dimensions is important in evaluation of renal disease during the neonatal period, when renal abnormalities are common and renal size rapidly changes with age.

Objective

To determine the reference ranges of kidney dimensions in newborns and to provide a reference chart for daily practice.

Materials and Methods

In this prospective study, kidney dimensions were evaluated in 385 healthy newborns with a gestational age ≥ 37 weeks. Each neonate seen at an obstetrics clinic and neonatal intensive care unit was examined with sonography within the first week of life. Relationships of all dimensions with gender, gestational age, height and weight were statistically analyzed.

Results

All dimensions of the kidneys were smaller in girls than in boys (P < 0.05). The dimensions of the left kidney were larger than those in the right kidney in both genders (P < 0.01). Longitudinal and anteroposterior dimensions of the right and left kidneys showed no correlation with the gestational age in either gender. The dimensions correlated with the height in boys (P < 0.01), while no correlation was seen between the dimensions and height in girls (P < 0.05). Weight had the best correlation with all dimensions in both genders.

Conclusion

The reference values of kidney lengths and diagrams from this study may be useful in the sonographic evaluation of kidneys in newborns.

### Poor predictability of prenatal ultrasonography for a nonfunctional kidney [^114wmYUz]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

We present 2 cases in which the diagnosis of a unilateral nonfunctioning kidney was not anticipated. The first case appeared to be simple, antenatally diagnosed, unilateral hydronephrosis with adequate parenchyma. However, at 3 months postnatally, it was found to be nonfunctional, most likely secondary to early high-grade obstruction. The second case presented prenatally as a left hydronephrotic kidney with parenchymal cysts, and the right kidney showed only mild parenchymal cystic changes. By 6 months, however, the right kidney was nonfunctional. These cases emphasize the need for coordinated prenatal and postnatal care. The sonographic appearance of renal dysplasia is variable (in size, number of cysts, and degree of hydronephrosis), depending on the point at which it is evaluated during the disease course. Subtle signs of dysplasia, such as increased echogenicity, may be the only warning sign of a nonfunctioning kidney, for which one should have a high index of suspicion.

### US of renal insufficiency in neonates [^114a3FaT]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Congenital and acquired renal diseases that can produce renal insufficiency during the neonatal period may be classified according to their ultrasonographic (US) characteristics: increased parenchymal echogenicity (renal parenchymal diseases, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor fetopathy, cortical necrosis), cystic disease (glomerulocystic kidney disease, autosomal recessive polycystic renal disease, multicystic dysplastic kidney, cystic renal dysplasia), obstructive uropathies (ureteropelvic junction obstruction, posterior urethral valves), infections (candidal infections and bezoars), and renal agenesis. High-resolution sector and linear-array transducers allow characterization of the underlying pathologic conditions in many cases. Findings of renal parenchymal disease will vary at Doppler US and, during the acute phase, diastolic flow can be decreased, absent, or reversed. In patients with glomerulocystic kidney disease, US shows bilaterally enlarged kidneys with diffusely increased echogenicity and retention of a reniform contour, loss of corticomedullary differentiation, and cortical cysts. Obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction, the most common cause of hydronephrosis in neonates, can be seen at US as a dilated renal pelvis with dilated and communicating calices, lack of dilatation in the distal portion of the ureter, changes of renal dysplasia with increased echogenicity of the renal parenchyma, and parenchymal cysts, depending on the severity and duration of the obstruction.

Imaging modalities for diagnosing kidney and urinary tract disorders in children have developed rapidly over the last decade largely because of advancement of modern technology. General pediatricians and neonatologists are often the front line in detecting renal anomalies. There is a lack of knowledge of the applicability, indications, and nephrotoxic risks of novel renal imaging modalities. Here we describe the clinical impact of congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract and describe pediatric-specific renal imaging techniques by providing a practical guideline for the diagnosis of kidney and urinary tract disorders.

Renal biopsy

Guideline 4.8.1

We recommend if a histological diagnosis will change management in pregnancy then renal biopsy can be performed in the first and early second trimester of pregnancy (1C).

Rationale

Published data on antenatal renal biopsy are limited by heterogeneity and cohort size. The most commonly described risk is bleeding. Contributory factors are thought to include the increased renal blood flow in pregnancy and the technical difficulty in performing a renal biopsy in the standard prone position at later gestations. A systematic review on renal biopsy in pregnancy including 39 studies published between 1980 and 2012, examined 243 antenatal biopsies compared with 1236 postpartum biopsies. This showed that the risk of renal biopsy complications was significantly higher in antenatal biopsies compared with those postpartum (7% vs 1%, p = 0.001). Complications, including macroscopic haematuria, perirenal haematomata, and the need for blood transfusion were described between 23 and 28 weeks' gestation. No serious complications occurred prior to 22 weeks' gestation.

Women who undergo renal biopsy in pregnancy have histological diagnoses spanning the spectrum of glomerular disease, although treatment options may be limited in pregnancy due to the teratogenicity and/or fetal toxicity of available treatments. A change in management based on the results of a renal biopsy in pregnancy was reported in 39/59 (66%) of women.

The decision to undertake renal biopsy in pregnancy must balance the increased risk of bleeding, the likelihood of a change in management based on the biopsy result, and the risks of either iatrogenic preterm delivery or a delay in management until a biopsy can be performed post-partum. It is the consensus of the guideline group that renal biopsy in pregnancy should be performed by the most experienced clinician available, under ultrasound guidance.

Peripartum care

Guideline 4.9.1

We recommend women with CKD receive routine peripartum care, with additional specialist input (1D).

Guideline 4.9.2

We recommend women with CKD have observations taken and documented during any hospital admission. This includes temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. An early warning score should be calculated and actioned appropriately (1D).

### Fetal renal anomalies and genetic syndromes [^114qaSVz]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2001). Low credibility.

Renal abnormalities are some of the commonest and most easily detectable anomalies on ultrasound. Many are an isolated finding but the prognosis may be altered considerably by the detection of other anomalies which could indicate a genetic disorder or syndrome. It is often easier to detect presupposed anomalies and the purpose of this article is to introduce and discuss those syndromes that may present with a renal abnormality on ultrasound. Common renal findings are presented with the range of additional anomalies that should be sought and suggested diagnostic tests. It should be remembered that although for many genetic conditions specific mutation analysis is now available, this usually requires pre-pregnancy investigations. Furthermore, in some cases the definitive diagnosis may not be suspected until post mortem. By this time it may be too late to establish a cell line to confirm the suspicion using laboratory methods. It is therefore important to take tissue samples antenatally where possible, or at delivery, as postnatal samples may have a high culture failure rate.

### Prenatal diagnosis and postnatal outcomes of congenital kidney and urinary tract anomalies: results from a tertiary center [^111PwYba]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

With increasing access to advanced imaging technologies, second-trimester ultrasonography has become more widespread. This has facilitated the antenatal diagnosis of congenital kidney and urinary tract anomalies. These anomalies can progress during pregnancy, and due to their frequent association with structural and chromosomal abnormalities, prenatal diagnosis plays a crucial role in guiding postnatal follow-up. Since earlier diagnosis is often linked to more severe forms of CAKUT, timely detection may facilitate less traumatic decision-making processes for families, including early termination when indicated.

Accurate classification and a multidisciplinary approach are essential for planning appropriate postnatal care and interventions. Given the wide clinical spectrum of CAKUT, proper antenatal diagnosis is vital for improving neonatal outcomes and ensuring early and appropriate management.

Furthermore, due to the high incidence of coexisting other system anomalies in fetuses with CAKUT, meticulous antenatal evaluation of the fetal anatomy should be considered a critical component of prenatal care.

### Framework for kidney health follow-up among neonates with critical cardiac disease: a report from the neonatal kidney health consensus workshop [^113ra71F]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

A Framework for Comprehensive Follow‐Up in Critical Cardiac Disease (Suggestions)

We suggest that all at‐risk and high‐risk neonates with critical cardiac disease receive kidney‐focused family education and counseling, with kidney‐focused follow‐up and ongoing risk assessment coordinated and synchronized with institutional‐specific cardiac care.

Structured cardiac follow‐up already exists for patients with critical cardiac disease. We recommend that all neonates with critical cardiac disease have a comprehensive KHA synchronized with institution‐specific structured cardiac follow‐up. Additionally, starting at index hospital discharge and continuing with every visit, we recommend that families receive education on the importance of kidney health, instruction to avoid nephrotoxic medications when possible, and advocating for outpatient BP checks at any health care encounter (Recommendation Statement 1). Patients with normal KHA (ie, normal BP measurements, normal serum creatinine, and normal kidney ultrasound) should have a repeat KHA every 2 years, which can be performed by the pediatric cardiologist. If concerns arise during the KHA, the patient should be referred to a pediatric nephrologist for follow‐up.

There may be a subset of neonates with critical cardiac disease at even greater risk for AKI development, defined earlier in this review. In addition to the KHA and family education before discharge, we suggest that these patients have a repeat KHA every 6 months until at least age 2 years. Additionally, we recommend that these children have a consultation with a pediatric nephrologist by age 1 year of age or sooner, at the discretion of either the pediatric cardiologist or nephrologist (Recommendation Statement 1).

### Telmisartan [^113Z9c7D]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Use of drugs that act on the RAS in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: oligohydramnios, reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

In patients taking Telmisartan during pregnancy, perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue Telmisartan, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.

Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to Telmisartan for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Prenatal genetic considerations of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) [^116jKtKL]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Medium credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) constitute 20% of all congenital malformations occurring in one in 500 live births. Worldwide, CAKUT are responsible for 40% to 50% of pediatric and 7% of adult end-stage renal disease. Pathogenic variants in genes causing CAKUT include monogenic diseases such as polycystic kidney disease and ciliopathies, as well as syndromes that include isolated kidney disease in conjunction with other abnormalities. Prenatal diagnosis most often occurs using ultrasonography; however, further genetic diagnosis may be made using a variety of testing strategies. Family history and pathologic examination can also provide information to improve the ability to make a prenatal diagnosis of CAKUT. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of genetic considerations in the prenatal diagnosis of CAKUT disorders. Specifically, we discuss monogenic causes of CAKUT, associated ultrasound characteristics, and considerations for genetic diagnosis, antenatal care, and postnatal care.

### The predictive value of the first postnatal ultrasound in children with antenatal hydronephrosis [^1156Utkm]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of the first postnatal ultrasound (US) in predicting the final postnatal diagnosis using a database of children followed prospectively for antenatal hydronephrosis, and to compare these findings with a systematic review of the literature.

Methods

The study involved 1441 children who had their radiological evaluation between 3 and 60 days of life, including an US, performed at our institution in 1998–2006. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. A systematic review of articles on prenatal hydronephrosis resulted in 31 studies with 2202 patients who met the inclusion criteria for analysis.

Results

62.0% of renal units (RUs) had transient or non-obstructive hydronephrosis. Increasing degree of hydronephrosis correlated with increased risk of urological pathologies (from 29.6% RUs in the mild group to 96.3% RUs in the severe group). A systematic review of the literature indicated very poor quality data, but the findings appeared to be concordant with those from our patient population.

Conclusion

The findings from this study will help to quantify the incidence of postnatal pathology based upon the first postnatal US parameters. This information is useful for counseling and for determining which postnatal radiological tests will be necessary.

### Renal ultrasonography… [^1167Kyq2]. Wikipedia (2017). Low credibility.

Renal ultrasonography is the examination of one or both kidneys using medical ultrasound. Ultrasonography of the kidneys is essential in the diagnosis and management of kidney-related diseases. The kidneys are easily examined, and most pathological changes in the kidneys are distinguishable with ultrasound. US is an accessible, versatile inexpensive and fast aid for decision-making in patients with renal symptoms and for guidance in renal intervention. Renal ultrasound is a common examination, which has been performed for decades. Using B-mode imaging, assessment of renal anatomy is easily performed, and US is often used as image guidance for renal interventions. Furthermore, novel applications in renal US have been introduced with contrast-enhanced ultrasound, elastography and fusion imaging.

However, renal US has certain limitations, and other modalities, such as CT and MRI, should always be considered as supplementary imaging modalities in the assessment of renal disease. Technique The ultrasonic renal exam does not require any preparation of the patient and is usually performed with the patient in the supine position. The kidneys are examined in longitudinal and transverse scan planes with the transducer placed in the flanks. When insonation of the kidney is obscured by intestinal air, the supine scan position is combined with the lateral decubitus position with the transducer moved dorsally. Preferably, the exam is initiated in the longitudinal scan plane, parallel to the long diameter of the kidney, as the kidney is easier to distinguish. In the adult patient, a curved array transducer with center frequencies of 3–6 MHz is used, while the pediatric patient should be examined with a linear array transducer with higher center frequencies.

Artifacts of the lowest ribs always shadow the upper poles of the kidneys. However, the whole kidney can be examined during either normal respiration or breath hold, as the kidney will follow the diaphragm and change position accordingly. Cortical thickness should be estimated from the base of the pyramid and is generally 7–10 mm. If the pyramids are difficult to differentiate, the parenchymal thickness can be measured instead and should be 15–20 mm. The echogenicity of the cortex decreases with age and is less echogenic than or equal to the liver and spleen at the same depth in individuals older than six months. In neonates and children up to six months of age, the cortex is more echogenic than the liver and spleen when compared at the same depth. Doppler ultrasonography of the kidney is widely used, and the vessels are easily depicted by the color Doppler technique in order to evaluate perfusion.

Applying spectral Doppler to the renal artery and selected interlobular arteries, peak systolic velocities, resistive index, and acceleration curves can be estimated. RCCs are typically isoechoic and peripherally located in the parenchyma, but can be both hypo- and hyper-echoic and are found centrally in medulla or sinus. The lesions can be multifocal and have cystic elements due to necrosis, calcifications and be multifocal. RCC is associated with von Hippel–Lindau disease, and with tuberous sclerosis, and US has been recommended as a tool for assessment and follow-up of renal masses in these patients. Some RCCs are hypovascular and not distinguishable with Doppler US.

### Predictive value of specific ultrasound findings when used as a screening test for abnormalities on VCUG [^117PSy1d]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS) is often used as an initial screening test for children after urinary tract infection (UTI), and the 2011 AAP guidelines specifically recommend RBUS be performed first, with voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) to be performed only if the ultrasound is abnormal. It is uncertain whether specific RBUS findings, alone or in combination, might make RBUS more useful as a predictor of VCUG abnormalities.

Aims

To evaluate the association of specific RBUS with VCUG findings, and determine whether predictive models that accurately predict patients at high risk of VCUG abnormalities, based on RBUS findings, can be constructed.

Methods

and study sample: A total of 3995 patients were identified with VCUG and RBUS performed on the same day. The RBUS and VCUG reports were reviewed and the findings were classified. Analysis was limited to patients aged 0–60 months with no prior postnatal genitourinary imaging and no history of prenatal hydronephrosis.

Analysis

The associations between large numbers of specific RBUS findings with abnormalities seen on VCUG were investigated. Both multivariate logistic models and a neural network machine learning algorithms were constructed to evaluate the predictive power of RBUS for VCUG abnormalities (including VUR or bladder/urethral findings). Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and area under receiving operating curves (AUROC) of RBUS for VCUG abnormalities were determined.

Results

A total of 2259 patients with UTI as the indication for imaging were identified. The RBUS was reported as "normal" in 75.0%. On VCUG, any VUR was identified in 41.7%, VUR grade > II in 20.9%, and VUR grade > III in 2.8%. Many individual RBUS findings were significantly associated with VUR on VCUG. Despite these strong univariate associations, multivariate modeling didn't result in a predictive model that was highly accurate. Multivariate logistic regression built via stepwise selection had: AUROC = 0.57, sensitivity = 86% and specificity = 25% for any VUR; AUROC = 0.60, sensitivity = 5% and specificity = 99% for VUR grade > II; and AUROC = 0.67, sensitivity = 6% and specificity = 99% for VUR grade > III. The best predictive model constructed via neural networks had: AUROC = 0.69, sensitivity = 64% and specificity = 60% for any VUR; AUROC = 0.67, sensitivity = 18% and specificity = 98% for VUR grade > II; and AUROC = 0.79, sensitivity = 32% and specificity = 100% for VUR grade > III.

Conclusions

Even with the state-of-the-art predictive models, abnormal findings on RBUS provide a poor screening test for genitourinary abnormalities. Renal bladder ultrasound and VCUG should be considered complementary, as they provide important, but different, information.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® antenatal hydronephrosis-infant [^114jTvNC]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antenatal hydronephrosis is the most frequent urinary tract anomaly detected on prenatal ultrasonography. It occurs approximately twice as often in males as in females. Most antenatal hydronephrosis is transient with little long-term significance, and few children with antenatal hydronephrosis will have significant obstruction, develop symptoms or complications, and require surgery. Some children will be diagnosed with more serious conditions, such as posterior urethral valves. Early detection of obstructive uropathy is necessary to mitigate the potential morbidity from loss of renal function. Imaging is an integral part of screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of children with antenatal hydronephrosis. Optimal timing and appropriate use of imaging can reduce the incidence of late diagnoses and prevent renal scarring and other complications. In general, follow-up neonatal ultrasound is recommended for all cases of antenatal hydronephrosis, while further imaging, including voiding cystourethrography and nuclear scintigraphy, is recommended for moderate or severe cases, or when renal parenchymal or bladder wall abnormalities are suspected. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### The role of routine post-natal abdominal ultrasound for newborns in a resource-poor setting: a longitudinal study [^114fkHTh]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal abdominal ultrasound is usually performed in Nigeria to investigate neonatal symptoms rather than as a follow up to evaluate fetal abnormalities which were detected on prenatal ultrasound. The role of routine obstetric ultrasonography in the monitoring of pregnancy and identification of fetal malformations has partly contributed to lowering of fetal mortality rates. In Nigeria which has a high maternal and fetal mortality rate, many pregnant women do not have ante-natal care and not infrequently, women also deliver their babies at home and only bring the newborns to the clinics for immunization. Even when performed, most routine obstetric scans are not targeted towards the detection of fetal abnormalities. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the benefit of routinely performing abdominal scans on newborns with a view to detecting possible abnormalities which may have been missed ante-natally.

Methods

This was a longitudinal study of 202 consecutive, apparently normal newborns. Routine clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound scans were performed on the babies by their mother's bedside, before discharge. Neonates with abnormal initial scans had follow-up scans.

Results

There were 108 males and 94 females. There were 12 (5.9%) abnormal scans seen in five male and seven female neonates. Eleven of the twelve abnormalities were in the kidneys, six on the left and five on the right. Three of the four major renal anomalies- absent kidney, ectopic/pelvic kidney and two cases of severe hydronephrosis were however on the left side. There was one suprarenal abnormality on the right suspected to be a possible infected adrenal haemorrage. Nine of the abnormal cases reported for follow- up and of these, two cases had persistent severe abnormalities.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated a 5.9% incidence of genito urinary anomalies on routine neonatal abdominal ultrasound in this small population. Routine obstetric USS is very useful but inadequate availability of skilled personnel and cost implications create great challenges in poor resource settings like Nigeria. However, awareness should be created so that parents who can afford such investigations can make informed decisions.

### Optimal timing of initial postnatal ultrasonography in newborns with prenatal hydronephrosis [^116Vzq3k]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Conflicting data exist concerning optimal timing for initial postnatal ultrasound in newborns with prenatal hydronephrosis. To determine whether timing significantly affects the accuracy of postnatal ultrasound, we conducted a prospective study comparing ultrasound within 48 hours of birth and at 7 to 10 days of life.

Materials and Methods

A total of 21 consecutive newborns with prenatal hydronephrosis were enrolled in 14 months. Prenatal hydronephrosis was defined as a pelvic diameter 4 mm. or greater before 33 weeks and 8 mm. or greater beginning at 33 weeks of gestation. Postnatal hydronephrosis was assessed using the Society for Fetal Urology grading system. Patients were subsequently followed with serial ultrasound and adjunctive imaging studies.

Results

Of the 32 evaluable renal units a majority had a change in the degree of hydronephrosis between the first and second ultrasound. An increase in hydronephrosis was found in 14 (44%) renal units with an increase of 2 or greater grades in 8 (25%). At a median followup of 15 months only 3 renal units had a persistent increase in hydronephrosis. None had greater than grade 2 hydronephrosis or required therapeutic intervention. A decrease in hydronephrosis between the first and second ultrasound was noted in 8 (25%) renal units. Seven renal units were excluded from analysis due to unequivocal obstruction, and none of these demonstrated a change between the 2 sonograms.

Conclusions

The degree of hydronephrosis varied between scans performed in the first 48 hours and 7 to 10 days of life in most newborns. The initial ultrasound more commonly underestimated the degree of hydronephrosis but this difference was not clinically significant at further followup. We recommend initial postnatal sonogram at 7 to 10 days of life for routine prenatal hydronephrosis but earlier scans may be appropriate in select cases.

### Kidney growth following preterm birth: evaluation with renal parenchyma ultrasonography [^114BLeo2]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Kidney ultrasound

The kidney ultrasound examinations were performed using a Philips Epiq or IU22 Ultrasound System (Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA) with a compact (small footprint) curved linear 5–8 MHz frequency transducer. All ultrasound examinations were performed by one of three Australian Accredited Medical Sonographers using a clearly defined protocol and who were blinded to the clinical information. B-mode imaging was utilized with the depth, gray-scale gain, focus, and time-gain compensation adjusted to acquire the best images of the kidneys. The image was magnified so the kidney occupied most of the image. The method used in this study is similar to our previous ultrasound study of the renal parenchyma, where the intra- and interobserver intra-class coefficient (ICC) was demonstrated to be greater than 95% for measurement of the renal parenchyma.

Infants were examined in the prone position. A mid-sagittal view of the kidney was obtained, and the maximum length of the kidney was measured. The posterior parenchymal thickness was measured as the distance between the inner aspect of the posterior renal capsule and the sinus–pyramidal apex interface, in the middle third of the kidney (Fig. 1). The posterior parenchymal thickness was used as it was closest to the ultrasound transducer and our previous study demonstrated no significant difference between the anterior and posterior thickness. For each kidney, the measurement was performed twice and the mean of the two measurements was recorded. The fetal ultrasound measurements of the renal parenchyma were performed as outlined in our previous study of normal ranges of fetal renal parenchymal thickness. Pregnancy and birth outcomes, including GA at birth, birth weight, and sex were obtained from the electronic medical record.

### When a horseshoe is not a lucky find [^111w3uXD]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Identification of a neonatal horseshoe kidney in the emergency department is uncommon but has implications for future healthcare planning for patients. We present a case of a neonate with bloody diapers who was evaluated with renal point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) that identified a horseshoe kidney. The ultrasound was remarkable for its clear visualization of the isthmus of the horseshoe kidney in the midline abdomen. Midline interrogation is not part of the routine technique for ultrasound imaging of the kidney but should be considered when the limits of the lower pole of bilateral kidneys are difficult to visualize. This case highlights the importance of understanding normal anatomical landmarks when performing renal POCUS to identify renal anomalies.

### An unusual case of severe therapy-resistant hypertension in a newborn [^113ZZTZH]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Hypertension can occur in up to 2% of neonates, and the spectrum of potential causes is broad. Prompt and thorough evaluation with a main focus on kidney disease is key for appropriate therapy. Here we describe a 2-day-old neonate with feeding intolerance and elevated blood pressure readings. Within 24 hours after birth, the infant's blood pressure increased significantly, with sustained mean arterial pressure > 85. Renal Doppler ultrasound showed decreased venous blood flow in the right kidney with an abnormal Doppler wave form suggestive of unilateral renal venous thrombosis. Despite aggressive antihypertensive therapy including hydralazine and enalaprilat, hypertension remained sustained. On day-of-life 4, the infant developed clinical signs of hypertensive encephalopathy and significant cardiac dysfunction. A renal angiography showed complete, likely thrombotic occlusion of the right renal artery. Renal MAG3 imaging showed minimal function of the affected kidney, and a nephrectomy secondary to medically uncontrollable hypertension and worsening cardiac dysfunction was performed. The child is developing normally in all aspects on follow-up evaluations at 6 months and 1 year of age. Reevaluation of the working diagnosis in neonates with hypertension can be necessary to optimize the outcome. The overall prognosis can be excellent even in newborns with profound cardiac and neurologic involvement.

### Summary of the AUA guideline on management of primary vesicoureteral reflux in children [^112DvsXp]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — evidence summary for prenatally noted hydronephrosis (PNH) reports that approximately 16% of neonates and infants with PNH have reflux, that this incidence was independent of prenatal RPD with reflux also detected in non-dilated renal units, and that the incidence of VUR was similar when postnatal urinary tract ultrasonography was normal. Reflux grade was III or greater in two-thirds of patients, with renal abnormalities occurring in nearly 50% of those with grades IV–V, and given that VUR occurs in only approximately 1% of otherwise normal infants, those with PNH represent a group at increased risk for reflux. Together these considerations potentially support postnatal cystography in all neonates with PNH; however, the lack of a prospective study demonstrating benefit and recent data questioning efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent UTI make screening cystography an option, rather than a recommendation.

### Summary of the AUA guideline on management of primary vesicoureteral reflux in children [^115ucBnB]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — Topic 5: Screening of the neonate/infant with prenatal hydronephrosis defines the index patient as a healthy neonate with unilateral mild Society for Fetal Urology (SFU) grade 1 to moderate SFU grades 2–3 hydronephrosis identified on screening prenatal ultrasound at 30 weeks gestation. Postnatal evaluation of prenatal hydronephrosis (PNH) offers the opportunity to diagnose and manage vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) before secondary damage occurs from urinary tract infection (UTI), and prior studies recognize that maldevelopment in the absence of infection can contribute to the clinical picture of "reflux nephropathy". Evaluation of affected infants could additionally provide insights into the benefits, if any, of early identification of VUR and institution of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent UTI, pyelonephritis and renal scarring.

### Appropriate timing of performing abdominal ultrasonography and termination of follow-up observation for antenatal grade 1 or 2 hydronephrosis [^114Uwujy]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Most cases of antenatal HN improve or resolve spontaneously with conservative treatment. However, some patients do not show improvement without treatment. No consensus currently exists regarding the optimal schedule and duration of follow-up with SFU grade 1 or 2 HN. It is unclear which neonates require postnatal evaluation, when postnatal evaluation for HN should be performed, how long follow-up should be continued, how long an examination should be performed.

The timing of postnatal resolution of HN is quite variable, occurring over the first few years of life. Despite variabilities in the underlying diagnoses, mild grades of HN generally show early resolution, with most cases of SFU grade 1–2 HN resolving within 12–18 months of age. In our study, most cases of SFU grade 1–2 HN showed natural improvement or resolution within 4 years of age. In particular, since SFU grade 2 HN resolve more slowly than grade 1 on the early follow-up, the follow-up period is likely to be longer for many cases. However, A small number of cases showed worsening from SFU grade 1 to 2 or SFU grade 2 to 3, and this worsening was mainly noted within 6 months of age in our study. In SFU grade 2, the HN grade that increased within 6 months was a change to the higher risk SFU grade 3, so careful observation may be required for SFU grade 2 during this period. A previous study reported the need for surgical intervention in a small percentage of cases of mild-grade HN. In another previous report, of 225 kidneys with SFU grade 2 HN, 3 showed worsening of HN to a severe grade. Furthermore, following SFU grade 3 cases, there are cases that finally required surgery, so it is concluded that more closely monitoring is required than SFU grade 2. Previous study has been suggested that SFU grade 1 may be more physiologic in nature. If SFU grade 1 persists in perpetuity without need for intervention, perhaps it does not need to be followed as aggressively. We think that 6 months and 1 years SFU grade 1 patients should undergo ultrasonography at the time when the grade of HN may worse. After that, it is considered safe to stop close follow-up and spread the follow-up interval to about 1 year for stable cases. On the other hand, in SFU grade 2 patients, there is a possibility of worsening high grade of HN at 6 months or less, so it is considered necessary to perform serial ultrasonography. However, after that period, it will be possible to spread the follow-up interval as with SFU grade 1.

### Clinical practice guideline acute kidney injury [^117G2kG1]. UKKA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to renal ultrasound, UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain a renal tract ultrasound in all patients with AKI within 24 hours (unless a clear cause of AKI is apparent or AKI is improving) or within 6 hours if pyonephrosis is suspected or there is a high index of suspicion for urinary tract obstruction.
