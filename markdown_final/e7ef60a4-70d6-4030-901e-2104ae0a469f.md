## Question

Post-operative management of a pediatric patient after a high risk posterior spinal fusion.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step postoperative management plan for high-risk pediatric posterior spinal fusion, preserving the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about preoperative risk stratification and how it shapes postoperative disposition and monitoring. Then, I should verify immediate postoperative stabilization priorities in PACU, including airway, hemodynamics, and neurologic status. Next, I will examine pain control strategies, including multimodal analgesia, regional techniques, and opioid stewardship. After that, I need to check early mobilization, nutrition, and fluid management within an ERAS framework. I will then review infection prevention, wound care, and complication surveillance. Finally, I should confirm discharge readiness criteria, follow-up milestones, and special considerations for high-risk phenotypes such as neuromuscular disease, obesity, and diabetes, while integrating psychosocial and family-centered care throughout.

> Let me first confirm the preoperative risk stratification that drives postoperative intensity. High-risk features include neuromuscular etiology, syndromic scoliosis, high BMI, multiple comorbidities, revision surgery, and long constructs, which correlate with higher complication rates and extended length of stay; conversely, healthy AIS patients without major comorbidities are typically lower risk and may not require ICU admission postoperatively [^112HK4Le] [^116wKCBy] [^113aj8Hy]. I should double-check that institutional protocols and consensus best-practice guidelines align with this risk tiering to standardize disposition and monitoring intensity across cases [^116ZBKhP].

> Now, immediate postoperative stabilization in PACU needs verification. I need to ensure airway patency and extubation readiness, recognizing that neuromuscular patients and those with prolonged opioid exposure have higher reintubation risk; continuous pulse oximetry and close respiratory assessment are essential, and I should avoid routine ICU admission for stable AIS patients without high-risk features [^113aj8Hy] [^113VNwXT]. Hemodynamically, I should confirm blood pressure support and transfusion thresholds using a goal-directed approach rather than overly restrictive fluids, and I must monitor for bleeding given the risk of large intraoperative losses in complex fusions [^113pdCkM] [^116d39QC]. Neurologic status demands frequent checks of motor and sensory function, with a low threshold for urgent imaging if deficits emerge, consistent with neuromonitoring-informed intraoperative care and postoperative vigilance [^112cXgCN].

> Next, I should review pain management, and I need to ensure a multimodal regimen anchored by acetaminophen and NSAIDs unless contraindicated, as recommended by APS/ASA/ASRA, while balancing fusion biology concerns about NSAIDs in the early postoperative window; if fusion healing is a priority, I should consider NSAID timing and dose minimization in the first weeks and individualize decisions with the surgical team [^113811oA] [^113wjoo4]. Wait, let me verify the role of regional anesthesia: epidural analgesia can modestly improve pain and reduce muscle spasms but has a meaningful early failure rate; continuous bupivacaine infusions and liposomal bupivacaine have shown reductions in opioid requirements and earlier mobilization, so I should weigh these benefits against catheter risks and local expertise [^1115z587] [^1135A1ci] [^111Sxj9N]. For opioids, I should confirm that IV PCA is appropriate for developmentally ready patients and avoid routine basal infusions due to increased sedation without consistent analgesic benefit; I will also consider ketamine, alpha-2 agonists, and gabapentinoids selectively, noting mixed evidence for pregabalin in this population [^113xsKYj] [^114rHKeu] [^1147yRY5].

> I will now examine early mobilization and rehabilitation, since this is central to ERAS. Hold on, I should verify that day-of-surgery mobilization is feasible and safe in pediatrics; evidence suggests earlier ambulation reduces length of stay without increasing complications when paired with adequate analgesia and education, so PT/OT should start as soon as hemodynamic stability and pain control permit, with clear safety criteria and family coaching [^113pdCkM] [^1145THdK]. Let me consider the practical steps: sitting at bedside on POD0, standing and assisted walking on POD1, and progressive independence thereafter, with daily goals and metrics to track functional recovery and detect delays early [^notfound].

> Nutrition and fluids require careful balance. I should confirm early feeding within 24 hours when tolerated, as this supports recovery and is consistent with ERAS principles; however, I need to ensure that fluid management remains goal-directed rather than restrictive, especially in patients with substantial blood loss or comorbidities, and I should monitor for ileus or nausea that could delay advancement [^113pdCkM]. But wait, what if the child is high risk for refeeding or has baseline malnutrition? In that case, I should involve nutrition services early and consider supplementation to support wound healing and energy needs during mobilization [^112vLZwJ].

> Infection prevention and wound care must be proactive. I should double-check that perioperative cefazolin is given within 60 minutes of incision and appropriately redosed, with consideration of gram-negative coverage in high-risk patients, and I should minimize dressing changes while using impervious dressings when possible to reduce contamination risk [^114WJFB4] [^115Drvwj]. Let me verify adjuncts: vancomycin powder in the wound is supported by consensus for high-risk cases, and chlorhexidine skin prep the night before may reduce bioburden; I should also monitor for seroma, which can often be managed conservatively with observation and sterile dressings, reserving intervention for signs of infection or failure to resolve [^115Drvwj] [^114sCAyi]. I need to ensure strict aseptic technique for any catheter manipulations and maintain vigilance for early and late SSI, especially in patients with obesity, diabetes, or prolonged operative times [^114WJFB4].

> Complication surveillance should be systematic. I should confirm daily neurologic checks for the first 48–72 hours, monitor for respiratory complications including atelectasis and pneumonia, and assess for wound complications, ileus, and urinary retention; I must also watch for early hardware issues such as prominent implants or skin breakdown, which can herald deeper problems [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that pseudarthrosis risk is low but real in adolescents and higher in neuromuscular disease, so persistent pain or mechanical symptoms warrant imaging and surgical evaluation; similarly, proximal junctional problems can occur in long fusions to the pelvis and should be suspected with new pain or deformity [^113CFYZV] [^112AVLkV].

> Discharge readiness should be explicit. I need to ensure adequate pain control on oral agents, independent ambulation with assistive devices as needed, stable wound without drainage, and no concerning neurologic deficits; education on activity restrictions, brace wear if prescribed, bowel regimen, and red flags must be documented and taught back by caregivers [^116ZBKhP]. Let me reconsider the role of ICU stay: for stable AIS patients, floor care is safe and associated with shorter length of stay and lower costs without compromising safety, whereas ICU remains appropriate for neuromuscular patients, those with significant comorbidities, or prolonged ventilation needs [^113VNwXT] [^113aj8Hy].

> Follow-up should be structured and risk-adapted. I should confirm an early check-in within 2 weeks to assess wound healing, pain trajectory, and function, with explicit screening for chronic postsurgical pain risk factors such as anxiety, catastrophizing, and parental protective behaviors; persistent pain at 2 weeks should trigger early referral for multidisciplinary pain management to mitigate transition to chronic pain [^116rWJgp] [^116bmAPx]. I need to ensure long-term surveillance for fusion integrity, alignment maintenance, and patient-reported outcomes using validated tools like SRS-22R, with imaging if symptoms persist or new deformity is suspected [^1154sDYV].

> Special populations require tailored protocols. For neuromuscular scoliosis, I should verify that multidisciplinary perioperative planning, aggressive respiratory optimization, and selective ICU admission improve safety; minimally invasive or staged strategies may reduce blood loss and complications in the most complex cases [^1153929r] [^112ic9iZ]. For obesity, I should confirm higher risks of infection, wound complications, and pseudarthrosis, and therefore intensify infection prophylaxis, wound surveillance, and activity guidance; for diabetes, tighter perioperative glycemic targets may reduce SSI risk, though evidence is mixed, so I should individualize and coordinate with endocrinology [^111MUyaF] [^116bKYry] [^113pdCkM].

> Finally, I need to ensure family and patient education are embedded throughout. Developmentally appropriate pain assessment training, medication administration teaching, and expectation setting reduce anxiety and improve adherence; I should also screen parents for pain catastrophizing and protective behaviors that can amplify pediatric pain and disability, and offer coping and activity-engagement strategies to support recovery [^116Mp5tb] [^116bmAPx]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about one-size-fits-all pathways; while standardized ERAS protocols improve efficiency, I should personalize analgesic choices and monitoring intensity to patient-specific risk phenotypes to optimize outcomes and minimize chronic pain risk [^116c2Htm].

Postoperative care after high-risk pediatric posterior spinal fusion centers on **multimodal analgesia** [^114fEZA7] and **early mobilization** [^113pdCkM] to reduce opioid use, speed recovery, and shorten length of stay. Key elements include scheduled acetaminophen and NSAIDs [^113811oA], short-course opioids for breakthrough pain, and regional techniques (epidural or continuous bupivacaine) when appropriate [^1115z587] [^1135A1ci]. Early mobilization within 24–48 hours with physical therapy, goal-directed fluids, and early feeding are essential [^113pdCkM]. Monitor for neurologic changes, bleeding, infection, and respiratory complications; use antifibrinolytics and cell salvage to limit transfusions [^113H1cq1] [^116d39QC]. Discharge when pain is controlled on oral meds, the patient is ambulating, and there are no red flags; arrange close follow-up for wound care, radiographs, and functional recovery [^116ZBKhP].

---

## Pain management

- **Multimodal analgesia**: Scheduled acetaminophen and NSAIDs are foundational; opioids are reserved for breakthrough pain and tapered quickly to minimize adverse effects [^113811oA] [^114fEZA7].

- **Regional anesthesia**: Epidural analgesia or continuous bupivacaine infusions reduce opioid requirements and improve pain scores; consider in high-risk patients [^1115z587] [^1135A1ci].

- **Adjuncts**: Ketamine, gabapentinoids, and muscle relaxants can be added selectively based on patient factors and response [^115tc3Xu] [^114U26Mn].

---

## Early mobilization and rehabilitation

Begin **early mobilization** within 24–48 hours with physical therapy to promote recovery, reduce complications, and shorten length of stay [^113pdCkM]. Provide **patient and family education** on pain control, activity restrictions, and warning signs to support safe mobilization and home readiness [^116Mp5tb].

---

## Monitoring and complication prevention

- **Neurologic monitoring**: Frequent neurologic checks every 4 hours for the first 48 hours, then daily, to detect deficits early [^notfound].

- **Respiratory care**: Incentive spirometry, chest physiotherapy, and early ambulation to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia [^notfound].

- **Infection prevention**: Strict aseptic technique, prophylactic antibiotics, and vigilant wound surveillance; treat seromas conservatively when possible [^114sCAyi] [^114WJFB4].

- **Bleeding management**: Antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid) and cell salvage reduce transfusion needs and complications [^113H1cq1] [^116d39QC].

---

## Fluid and nutritional management

Use **goal-directed fluids** to maintain perfusion without overload, especially in high-risk patients [^113pdCkM]. Initiate **early feeding** within 24–48 hours to support healing and recovery [^notfound].

---

## Discharge criteria and follow-up

Discharge when pain is controlled on oral medications, the patient is ambulating independently, and there are no complications or red flags. Arrange **follow-up** within 2 weeks for wound check, radiographs, and functional assessment, with ongoing monitoring for chronic pain and other late complications [^116ZBKhP] [^116rWJgp].

---

Postoperative care after high-risk pediatric posterior spinal fusion requires a coordinated, **multidisciplinary approach** emphasizing multimodal analgesia, early mobilization, and vigilant monitoring to optimize outcomes and reduce complications.

Perioperative Pharmacologic Analgesic Strategies

From a perioperative standpoint, broad recommendations include the use of multimodal analgesia, and when applicable, the use of neuraxial or regional anesthesia. However, perioperative analgesic studies in children are often in heterogenous populations, and the outcomes associated with specific pharmacologic therapies are often conflicting, even for the management of acute postsurgical pain. Available perioperative interventional analgesic pediatric studies rarely assess pain beyond the early postoperative period, limiting our understanding of their utility for preventing CPSP.

Additionally, perioperative analgesic strategies have become increasingly protocolized through the use of surgery-specific enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways in contrast with precision-based patient care models that account for inter-individual differences. This is relevant to long-term pain recovery as there is substantial evidence demonstrating that postsurgical pain severity and duration are predominantly defined by patient factors. As ERAS protocols often fail to allow for risk adjustment to patient-specific phenotypes, it is essential that as clinicians, we prioritize the care of patients as individuals, including their previous pain experience and baseline characteristics, to determine an appropriate analgesic approach, particularly for those at higher risk of having more severe and prolonged pain after surgery. A regional anesthetic, for example, may be offered based on anatomical considerations of surgery type and the estimated severity of postoperative pain. However, regional anesthesia use could be more strongly considered in a child or adolescent with multiple risk factors, even for less extensive surgery, to improve early postoperative pain and potentially mitigate CPSP. Personalization of the perioperative analgesic approach could represent a valid path forward for individualized care, particularly for those patients who are phenotypically at an increased risk for persistent postoperative pain after a surgical insult.

In addition to standardized protocols being largely procedure-specific, there is great variation in the implementation of analgesic ERAS approaches across institutions. In pediatrics, published protocols for idiopathic spinal fusion surgery, a procedure with high incidence of CPSP, are highly variable in their use of opioids, regional anesthesia, and adjuvant analgesic medications including gabapentinoids, muscle relaxants, ketamine, subcutaneous local anesthetic infusions, and dexmedetomidine. At this time, there is little evidence to support the use of one perioperative analgesic protocol over another for acute pain in pediatric patients undergoing major musculoskeletal surgery, and no evidence to support any specific pharmacologic approach to prevent the transition to CPSP. Thus, we propose that operative protocols and institutional "best practice" should incorporate universal screening of each child or adolescent undergoing surgery to determine their risk level for developing CPSP.

19. Postoperative nutrition and fluid management

Many of the studies report on early mobilization in conjunction with dietary libertization. When performed together, the two can reduce length of stay and costs without increasing early or late complications in adolescents undergoing posterior spinal fusion. Results of the RELIEF trial suggest that we should be more cautious with postoperative restrictive fluid strategies in patients having major abdominal surgery. In patients having major spine surgery, goal orientated post-operative fluid management may be more appropriate than a restrictive approach, although specific evidence is currently lacking. Intraoperative haemodynamic framework may be continued into the post-operative period in the high-risk patient group. In line with other ERAS guidelines patients should be encouraged to transition as early as tolerated to oral intake.

20. Postoperative glycemic control

A retrospective cohort study incorporating population undergoing spine surgery found that perioperative hyperglycemia increases the risk of adverse post-operative events in the non-diabetic patient group. Tighter glycemic control may mitigate the risk of surgical site infection in patients with diabetes. There remains insufficient evidence that strict glycemic control is advantageous over conventional management for prevention of surgical site infection. Although it is clear that perioperative hyperglycemia is deleterious, the optimal management paradigm in the postoperative period remains uncertain.

It is prudent to maintain more conventional blood glucose target in the postoperative period in patients undergoing spinal surgery. There is low quality evidence for conventional postoperative blood glucose control.

21. Early mobilization

Early mobilization is thought to be a key component of ERSS. There is no clear definition of mobilizing, which may include simple exercise in bed, walking in the room or walking further distances. The overall outcome of these pathways has been that of significant decreased length of stay; as well as improved patient satisfaction measures in selected studies. A study focusing on behavioral outcomes of early mobilization and rehabilitation education, identified decreased postoperative patient anxiety and enhanced self-care ability. Reduced complication rates, improved patient-reported outcomes and decreased length of stay were noted in a narrative review in patients undergoing early mobilization.

Patients should be encouraged to mobilize actively on the day of surgery as guided by clinical condition and surgical concerns. In the absence of a clear definition of early mobilization, institutions should be encouraged to set their own benchmarks. There is moderate quality evidence for the intervention due to the imprecision in defining mobilization as well as retrospective nature of studies.

### Day-to-day risk and resilience factors in the context of pediatric post-surgical recovery – A network analysis of intensive longitudinal data from adolescents undergoing spinal fusion surgery and their parents [^116bmAPx]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, millions of children undergo surgery each year. Adequate post-operative pain management improves recovery after surgery and has been the focus of a global health initiative in recent years.–However, many pediatric patients still receive insufficient post-operative care. Ineffective pain management may result in unnecessary patient suffering and poorer recovery, and increases the risk of Chronic Post-Surgical Pain (CPSP).–CPSP is defined as pain that persists longer than the usual period of healing (typically > 3 months) and that cannot be explained by any other peri- or post-operative complications. CPSP affects around 20% of pediatric patients undergoing major surgery and is associated with reduced quality-of-life and impaired functioning. One example of major surgery is spinal fusion surgery, one of the most invasive pediatric procedures, used for correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), leading to an increased risk of CPSP and associated long-term health problems for this patient group.

Several psychological mechanisms have been identified as predictors of pediatric post-operative recovery. For instance, anxiety and pain catastrophizing are known risk factors for CPSP, whereas pain coping and pain acceptance represent key resilience factors. Resilience here means the capacity to maintain effective functioning despite the exposure of external and/or internal stressors, such as pain. The biopsychosocial model can be used to understand the transition from acute pain to CPSP, in which resilience and parental factors are underscored as important targets for future research. Parental factors are associated with child pain and functioning in the context of pediatric chronic pain where both parental emotional states and behavior can affect child outcomes. In two recent studies investigating parental factors in relation to CPSP, pain catastrophizing and psychological flexibility in parents before surgery, predicted recovery in the children at one-year follow-up. Yet, more research is needed to further investigate how different psychological processes in the children themselves, and how parental processes, before and after surgery, impact post-operative recovery in children and adolescents.

### Development of consensus-based best practice guidelines for postoperative care following posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^116ZBKhP]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

Delphi process with multiple iterative rounds using a nominal group technique.

Objective

The aim of this study was to use expert opinion to achieve consensus on various aspects of postoperative care following posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).

Summary Of Background Data

Significant variability exists in postoperative care following PSF for AIS, despite a relatively healthy patient population and continuously improving operative techniques. Current practice appears based either on lesser quality studies or the perpetuation of long-standing protocols.

Methods

An expert panel composed of 26 pediatric spine surgeons was selected. Using the Delphi process and iterative rounds using a nominal group technique, participants in this panel were presented with a detailed literature review and asked to voice opinion collectively during three rounds of voting (one electronic and two face-to-face). Agreement > 80% was considered consensus. Interventions without consensus were discussed and revised, if feasible.

Results

Consensus was reached to support 19 best practice guideline (BPG) measures for postoperative care addressing non-ICU admission, perioperative pain control, dietary management, physical therapy, postoperative radiographs, surgical bandage management, and indications for discharge.

Conclusion

We present a consensus-based BPG consisting of 19 recommendations for the postoperative management of patients following PSF for AIS. This can serve to reduce variability in practice in this area, help develop hospital specific protocols, and guide future research.

### Perioperative blood management in pediatric spine surgery [^117DA9Ei]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Blood management strategies are integral to successful outcomes in many types of orthopaedic surgery. These strategies minimize blood loss and transfusion requirements, ultimately decreasing complications, improving outcomes, and potentially eliminating risks associated with allogeneic transfusion. Practices to achieve these goals include preoperative evaluation and optimization of hemoglobin, the use of pharmacologic agents or anesthetic methods, intraoperative techniques to improve hemostasis and cell salvage, and the use of predonated autologous blood. Guidelines can also help manage allogeneic transfusions in the perioperative period. Although the literature on blood management has focused primarily on arthroplasty and adult spine surgery, pediatric spinal fusion for scoliosis involves a large group of patients with a specific set of risk factors for transfusion and distinct perioperative considerations. A thorough understanding of blood management techniques will improve surgical planning, limit transfusion-associated risks, maintain hemostasis, and optimize outcomes in this pediatric population.

### Error traps and preventative strategies for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis spinal surgery [^11374tTL]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Anesthesia for posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis remains one of the most common surgeries performed in adolescents. These procedures have the potential for significant intraprocedural and postoperative complications. The potential for pressure injuries related to prone positioning must be understood and addressed. Additionally, neuromonitoring remains a mainstay for patient care in order to adequately assess patient neurologic integrity and alert the providers to a reversible action. As such, causes of neuromonitoring signal loss must be well understood, and the provider should have a systematic approach to signal loss. Further, anesthetic design must facilitate intraoperative wake-up to allow for a definitive assessment of neurologic function. Perioperative bleeding risk is high in posterior spinal fusion due to the extensive surgical exposure and potentially lengthy operative time, so the provider should undertake strategies to reduce blood loss and avoid coagulopathy. Pain management for adolescents undergoing spinal fusion is also challenging, and inadequate analgesia can delay recovery, impede patient/family satisfaction, increase the risk of chronic postsurgical pain/disability, and lead to prolonged opioid use. Many of the significant complications associated with this procedure, however, can be avoided with intentional and evidence-based approaches covered in this review.

Conclusion

SIJ fusion is a rapidly growing and evolving therapy with developing evidence to support its safety and efficacy. In the setting of a desired surgical outcome, safety and efficacy can be adversely impacted by poor post-operative care. The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience has created this best practice document in an effort to improve and standardize care in this critical time of patient recovery.

### Perioperative pain management in pediatric spine surgery [^116dptcL]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Pain management after spinal deformity correction surgery for scoliosis in the pediatric population can be difficult. Deformity correction with posterior spinal fusion causes significant tissue trauma. Historically, pain control has been achieved with intravenous opiates. Opiates provide excellent analgesic effect; however, they have serious consequences when used alone. In adult total joint arthroplasty, multimodal pain control has become an increasingly common method to achieve pain control without these sequelae. Recently, the same techniques have been studied in pediatric spinal deformity correction surgery. This article outlines the state of pain management in pediatric spine patients.

### Anesthetic management for pediatric spinal fusion: implications of advances in spinal cord monitoring [^112cXgCN]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Currently, the detection of emerging injury through intraoperative neurologic monitoring is the best way to prevent neurologic injury. This requires a team approach that includes the anesthesiologist, neurophysiologist, and surgeon. The monitoring modalities available for the patient must be considered in planning the anesthetic management. In addition, intraoperative care for the patient requires an ongoing attention to how the anesthetic drugs affect spinal cord monitoring.

### Predicting pediatric patient rehabilitation outcomes after spinal deformity surgery with artificial intelligence [^1154sDYV]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a structural curvature of the spine that begins during the teenage growth spurt. AIS is the most prevalent form of scoliosis, affecting 1 to 4% of adolescents, with young women disproportionately affected more frequently than men. If left untreated, scoliosis may lead to altered spinal mechanics and degenerative changes, resulting in pain, loss of spinal mobility, possible function loss or disability, and decreased quality of life.

Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) accounts for 90% of scoliosis surgery, with approximately 38,000 spinal fusion surgeries performed annually in the United States. The decision to perform an intervention on patients with idiopathic scoliosis depends on multiple factors, including patient maturity, curve characteristics, curve magnitude, location of the curve, and the possibility of progression. As most individuals with AIS progress during growth periods, the primary goal of intervention is to limit or halt the progression of the deformity and enhance the patient's quality of life.

In routine scoliosis care, patients have serial radiographic scanning with detailed radiographic measurements for surgical planning, correction assessment, and correction maintenance (i.e. rehabilitation) over time. The development of the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) patient questionnaire, a specific health-related quality-of-life instrument for AIS, has allowed orthopedists to measure subjective patient-reported outcomes (PROs) before and after corrective surgery. The Scoliosis Research Society-22R (SRS-22R) is one of the most widely used health-related quality-of-life instruments. It evaluates AIS patients' surgical success and back management from multiple perspectives, including function, mental health, pain, satisfaction, and self-image. However, pre-operative radiographic parameters currently used during surgical planning have not been shown to correlate with post-operative PROs. Thus, disentangling the relationship between pre-operative radiographic measurements and post-operative self-assessments will assist surgeons in setting expectations with patients and their families.

### Seromas following pediatric spinal deformity surgery: is operative management necessary? [^114sCAyi]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Seromas are known complications after pediatric spinal deformity surgery. Although many surgeons perform an early debridement to prevent deep surgical site infections (SSIs), a less invasive approach to seroma management has not been studied. We hypothesized that a conservative approach to seroma management would be safe and yield equivalent outcomes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of patients who developed a postoperative seroma with or without nonpurulent drainage. Inclusion criteria were patients below 21 years who underwent primary posterior spinal fusion from 1996 to 2016 and developed a postoperative wound seroma. Seromas were clinically defined as an afebrile patient with a fluid collection that was soft and nontender to palpation and without induration or erythema. Growing spine surgeries and revision procedures were excluded from this study.

Results

Twenty-five of 790 total patients with a mean follow-up of 57.8 months (± 48.5mo) developed a seroma. Seromas were identified at a mean of 13.6 days postoperatively and resolved after a mean of 12.2 days following the presentation. Seromas occurred in 12 patients with idiopathic scoliosis, 12 with neuromuscular scoliosis, and 1 patient with Scheuermann kyphosis. All cases were managed conservatively with monitoring of the incision without an operative procedure. In cases of spontaneous drainage, a sterile dressing was applied to the wound and changed as needed until drainage ceased. Two patients underwent bedside needle aspiration and 5 patients received prophylactic antibiotics at the treating surgeon's discretion. All cases resolved spontaneously without development of an acute SSI. Three cases subsequently developed a late SSI (range, 18 to 38mo postoperatively). Two had idiopathic scoliosis and 1 had neuromuscular scoliosis. None of these seromas drained spontaneously.

Conclusions

Conservative management of postoperative seromas after pediatric spinal deformity surgery is appropriate. It is unclear if seromas contributed to the development of the 3 late infections. Further studies are needed regarding the relationship of late infections in seroma patients.

### Day-to-day risk and resilience factors in the context of pediatric post-surgical recovery – A network analysis of intensive longitudinal data from adolescents undergoing spinal fusion surgery and their parents [^1173kVX4]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The present results provide insights into adolescent and parental psychological risk and resilience factors in everyday life throughout the pediatric post-operative recovery process. Findings warrant further investigation and indicate important targets for post-operative pain treatments. Pain catastrophizing and pain-related fear, in both adolescents and parents, parent protective behavior and parent instructions towards their child to engage or avoid in daily life activities as well as adolescent psychological flexibility, and activity engagement and avoidance seem to be particularly important targets. The results are also essential in the light of the current under-treatment of pediatric post-operative pain. Finally, interventions may be needed to target different mechanisms at different moments during the recovery process as dynamics within and between adolescents and parents appear to vary over time.

### Patient factors are associated with poor short-term outcomes after posterior fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^116wKCBy]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) is commonly performed for patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Identifying factors associated with perioperative morbidity and PSF may lead to strategies for reducing the frequency of adverse events (AEs) in patients and total hospital costs.

Questions/Purposes

What is the frequency of and what factors are associated with postoperative: (1) AEs, (2) extended length of stay (LOS), and (3) readmission in patients with AIS undergoing PSF?

Patients and Methods

Patients, aged 11 to 18 years, who underwent PSF for AIS during 2012, were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program® (ACS NSQIP®) Pediatric database. Patient were assessed for characteristics associated with AEs, extended LOS (defined as more than 6 days), and hospital readmission using multivariate logistic regression. Individual AEs captured in the database were grouped into two categories, "any adverse event" (AAE) and "severe adverse events" (SAEs) for analysis. A total of 733 patients met inclusion criteria.

Results

Twenty-seven patients (3.7%) had AAE and 19 patients (2.6%) had SAEs. Both AAE and SAEs were associated with BMI-for-age ninety-fifth percentile or greater (AAE: odds ratio [OR], 3.31; 95% CI, 1.43–7.65; p = 0.005. SAE: OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.32–9.09; p = 0.012). Extended LOS occurred for 60 patients (8.2%) and was associated with greater than 13 levels instrumented (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.11–3.61; p = 0.021) and operative time of 365 minutes or more (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.39–4.76; p = 0.003). Readmission occurred for 11 patients (1.5%), most often for surgical site infection, and was associated with the occurrence of any complication during the initial hospital stay (OR, 180.44; 95% CI, 35.47–917.97; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Further research on prevention and management of obesity and surgical site infections may reduce perioperative morbidity for patients with AIS undergoing PSF.

### Predicting pediatric patient rehabilitation outcomes after spinal deformity surgery with artificial intelligence [^1125D5yc]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To solve this problem, we developed an AI-enabled surgical planning and counseling support system to predict AIS patient rehabilitation outcomes after PSF surgery in a multi-site pediatric patient cohort from Shriners Children's (Fig. 1). We conducted our experiments on a multi-site cohort of 455 pediatric patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery at two Shriners Children's hospitals from 2010; this is a rare pediatric patient cohort given that the prevalence of severe AIS is less than 0.1% in the United States. Specifically, we predicted three key outcomes to facilitate surgical planning and shared decision-making: (1) post-operative patient response to each question in SRS-22R; (2) achievement of minimum clinically important difference in SRS-22R; and (3) improvement of both objective radiographic measurements and subjective patient self-assessment. In addition, we presented explainability analysis and statistical analysis to quantify the contribution of input pre-operative radiographic parameters and PROs for clinical validation and novel biomarker discovery. Moreover, we enabled responsible AI considerations by calibrating model confidence for human intervention and mitigating gender bias for model fairness. The proposed framework may facilitate pre-operative counseling and pre-operative assessment aid while advancing personalized medicine in pediatric healthcare.

EHR electrical healthcare record, PRO patient-reported outcome.

In summary, the main contribution of our work is three-fold: Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive analysis on a multi-site AIS patient cohort with 6-month to 2-year post-operative follow-ups to develop a prediction model for post-operative PRO prediction (Task 1). To our knowledge, this is the first study to predict SRS-22R questionnaire responses after PSF surgery to enhance pediatric patient care; Secondly, we developed an AI-enabled surgical planning and counseling support system to predict patient surgical outcomes based on subjective PRO improvements and objective radiographic metric correction rates for personalized surgical planning (Task 2 and 3); Thirdly, regarding personalized medicine, we incorporated explainable and responsible AI considerations into our framework by interpreting feature importance to gain clinical validation and insights, calibrating model confidence to enable human intervention, and mitigating health disparities to ensure algorithm fairness.

### Pediatric scoliosis surgery – is postoperative intensive care unit admission really necessary? [^113aj8Hy]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Background

It is common practice for patients to be admitted to the intensive care unit following scoliosis surgery, because of the prolonged anesthesia, the need for efficient pain control and the known immediate postoperative complications. However, this may be unnecessary in many patients.

Purpose

We aimed to establish possible associations between pre- and perioperative parameters and early postoperative complication rates, in particular the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation (> 1 day), and the presence of major complications in children undergoing primary spinal fusion by thoracolumbar spine instrumentation.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of children undergoing primary scoliosis surgery at a university-affiliated general hospital from 1998 to 2008.

Results

Surgical approaches were as follows: anterior spinal fusion, posterior spinal fusion, and combined anterior and posterior fusion. Prior to mid-2005, anesthesia included morphine; thereafter, remifentanil was used. Major complications correlated significantly with neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS) (OR, 4.94; 95% CI, 1.02–24.05), comorbidity conditions (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.16–10.42), and anterior or combined fusion (OR, 7.81; 95% CI, 2.12–28.57). Late extubation correlated significantly with NMS (OR, 31.25; 95% CI, 1.06–100.00) and morphine use during anesthesia (OR, 17.91; 95% CI, 1.44–222.9).

Conclusions

Relatively young, healthy idiopathic scoliosis children receiving intraoperative remifentanil sedation and undergoing posterior fusion can be successfully managed in regular wards in the immediate postoperative period. However, intensive care unit admission should be considered in NMS patients, patients with comorbidity conditions, those undergoing anterior or combined spinal fusion, and patients whose anesthesia involves long-acting opioids.

### Do benefits overcome the risks related to surgery for adult scoliosis? A detailed analysis of a consecutive case series [^114ztggY]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The surgical approach to adult spine deformities is complex and presents a high incidence of complications.

Methods

We report here a prospective consecutive case series analysis of 20 patients submitted to posterior correction and instrumented fusion for adult degenerative scoliosis. Clinical outcomes were assessed by self-reported measures. Pre-operative and post-operative complications were analysed during a mean 30-month follow-up period.

Results

Eleven patients (55%) presented pre-operative or post-operative complications. Fifteen different complications occurred, six in the early pre-operative period and nine during follow-up period: ten of these complications occurred in patients who underwent a previous surgery for spine disease.

Conclusions

The clinical improvement at the final follow-up resulted as statistically significant only for the group of patients exposed to posterior fusion without interbody fusion. The observations reported here have to be considered for a shared decision-making in the management of adult scoliosis.

### Chronic postsurgical pain in children and adolescents: a call for action [^116rWJgp]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this review, we described what is known about the clinical and mechanistic factors influencing the development of CPSP in children and adolescents. We also highlighted four specific areas that are needed to improve the care of the pediatric surgical patient in clinical practice. First, universal screening can be implemented preoperatively to identify and stratify patients at high risk of CPSP to allow for better presurgical optimization. Second, standardized perioperative analgesic protocols can be refined to allow for more flexibility and personalization of perioperative management in high-risk patients. Third, patients with ongoing pain at two weeks after surgery can be expeditiously referred for additional treatment, including personalized multidimensional interventions and interventional procedures. Finally, treatment can be based on individual patient physical and psychosocial phenotypes as determined by validated assessments and somatosensory testing. While more work remains to complete our understanding of pediatric CPSP, as clinicians, we have the opportunity to put into practice the knowledge that is currently available. This call to action serves as a reminder that the individual patients can benefit from the proactive implementation of CPSP-mitigating strategies. Identifying and removing system-level or institutionally driven barriers is paramount towards ensuring that these approaches can be routinely incorporated into pediatric perioperative care.

### Risk stratification for early postoperative infection in pediatric spinal deformity correction: development and validation of the pediatric scoliosis infection risk score (PSIR score) [^111MUyaF]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background Context

Postoperative infection after spinal deformity correction in pediatric patients is associated with significant costs. Identifying risk factors associated with postoperative infection would help surgeons identify high-risk patients that may require interventions to minimize infection risk.

Purpose

To investigate risk factors associated with 30-day postoperative infection in pediatric patients who have received posterior arthrodesis for spinal deformity correction.

Study Design/Setting

Retrospective review of prospectively collected data.

Patient Sample

The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric database for years 2016–2021 was used for this study. Patients were included if they received posterior arthrodesis for scoliosis or kyphosis correction (CPT 22,800, 22,802, 22,804). Anterior only approaches were excluded.

Outcome Measures

TThe outcome of interest was 30-day postoperative infection.

Methods

Patient demographics and outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Multivariable logistic regression analysis using likelihood ratio backward selection method was used to identify significant risk factors for 30-day infection to create the Pediatric Scoliosis Infection Risk Score (PSIR Score). ROC curve analysis, predicted probabilities, and Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were done to assess the scoring system on a validation cohort.

Results

A total of 31,742 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 13.8 years and 68.7% were female. The 30-day infection rate was 2.2%. Reoperation rate in patients who had a post-operative infection was 59.4%. Patients who had post-operative infection had a higher likelihood of non-home discharge (X2 = 124.8, p < 0.001). In our multivariable regression analysis, high BMI (OR = 1.01, p < 0.001), presence of open wound (OR = 3.18, p < 0.001), presence of ostomy (OR = 1.51, p < 0.001), neuromuscular etiology (OR = 1.56, p = 0.009), previous operation (OR = 1.74, p < 0.001), increasing ASA class (OR = 1.43, p < 0.001), increasing operation time in hours (OR = 1.11, p < 0.001), and use of only minimally invasive techniques (OR = 4.26, p < 0.001) were associated with increased risk of 30-day post-operative infection. Idiopathic etiology (OR = 0.53, p < 0.001) and intraoperative topical antibiotic use (B = 0.71, p = 0.003) were associated with reduced risk of 30-day postoperative infection. The area under the curve was 0.780 and 0.740 for the derivation cohort and validation cohort, respectively.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the largest study of risk factors for infection in pediatric spinal deformity surgery. We found 5 patient factors (BMI, ASA, osteotomy, etiology, and previous surgery, and 3 surgeon-controlled factors (surgical time, antibiotics, MIS) associated with risk. The Pediatric Scoliosis Infection Risk Score (PSIR) Score can be applied for risk stratification and to investigate implementation of novel protocols to reduce infection rates in high-risk patients.

### Surgical management of neuromuscular scoliosis in paediatric patients: experiences from a tertiary centre multidisciplinary team [^1153929r]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Despite these limitations, this research has shed light on several key areas. We identified the main seven comorbidities that negatively impacted short-term outcomes (table 3). These are commonly not modifiable factors, but anticipatory care and more aggressive perioperative management could reduce immediate postoperative complications. However, conservative route may need to be considered in patients with high number of comorbidities particularly those with higher BMI, significant lung function impairment, established respiratory failure requiring NIV and reduced mobility requiring full-time wheelchair use (table 3). Further studies should focus on how these comorbidities affect longer term quality of life and mortality and efficacy of preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative care.

The long-term benefits of surgery, especially in terms of improved quality of life, are evident from previously published research. Our study aligns with these findings, demonstrating improvements in posture, breathing and pain, with most patients experiencing no long-term complications from surgery. Factors such as the patient's functional status and quality of life, the potential for curve progression, as well as the ability to optimise these risk factors require ongoing careful review by the MDT. Once assessed by the NMS MDT, patients were evaluated and followed up the spinal surgeons or at their local hubs, with the possibility of being referred again to the MDT. It is good practice for MDTs to re-evaluate patients who are initially not offered surgery to determine whether the risk-benefit profile has changed over time.

### Pseudarthrosis in adult and pediatric spinal deformity surgery: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of incidence, characteristics, and risk factors [^113CFYZV]. Neurosurgical Review (2019). Medium credibility.

We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis and qualitative synthesis. This study aims to characterize pseudarthrosis after long-segment fusion in spinal deformity by identifying incidence rates by etiology, risk factors for its development, and common features. Pseudarthrosis can be a painful and debilitating complication of spinal fusion that may require reoperation. It is poorly characterized in the setting of spinal deformity. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for clinical research including spinal deformity patients treated with long-segment fusions reporting pseudarthrosis as a complication. Meta-analysis was performed on etiologic subsets of the studies to calculate incidence rates for pseudarthrosis. Qualitative synthesis was performed to identify characteristics of and risk factors for pseudarthrosis. The review found 162 articles reporting outcomes for 16,938 patients which met inclusion criteria. In general, the included studies were of medium to low quality according to recommended reporting standards and study design. Meta-analysis calculated an incidence of 1.4% (95% CI 0.9–1.8%) for pseudarthrosis in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, 2.2% (95% CI 1.3–3.2%) in neuromuscular scoliosis, and 6.3% (95% CI 4.3–8.2%) in adult spinal deformity. Risk factors for pseudarthrosis include age over 55, construct length greater than 12 segments, smoking, thoracolumbar kyphosis greater than 20°, and fusion to the sacrum. Choice of graft material, pre-operative coronal alignment, post-operative analgesics, and sex have no significant impact on fusion rates. Older patients with greater deformity requiring more extensive instrumentation are at higher risk for pseudarthrosis. Overall incidence of pseudarthrosis requiring reoperation is low in adult populations and very low in adolescent populations.

### Post-traumatic spinal deformity [^115cCg6k]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

There are approximately 50,000 fractures to the bony spinal column each year in the United States. The vast majority of unstable spinal injuries are recognized early and managed appropriately. Rarely, the initial treatment may have been inadequate, or in less obvious injuries, less aggressive immobilization techniques may have been chosen. This along with continued exposure to physiologic stresses may lead to a gradual post-traumatic deformity that may further impede the functional as well as emotional status of these often already compromised patients. The management of post-traumatic deformity can be extremely challenging. A post-traumatic kyphotic deformity may occur in the cervical, thoracic, thoracolumbar, or lumbar spine, and once appropriate imaging studies are obtained, careful surgical considerations must be undertaken. Surgical intervention is considered if the kyphotic deformity is progressive over time or there is new onset or progression of a neurologic deficit. Surgical procedures include either a posterior or anterior only approach or any variation of a combined anterior or posterior procedure. In most cases a posterior only fusion is often insufficient for optimal correction and stabilization. Although the majority of patients developing a post-traumatic deformity usually occur after spinal column trauma initially treated nonoperatively, several miscellaneous causes of post-traumatic deformity may occur after surgery. These include nonunion, implant failure, Charcot spine, and technical error. The overall outcome after the surgical management of post-traumatic deformity has been satisfactory with better outcomes in the patients treated earlier as opposed to later. Operative complications include the increased risk of neurologic injury because of the draping of the neural elements over the anterior vertebral elements, any pre-existing spinal cord injury, and possible scarring with cord tethering. Trauma to the spinal cord and column is a devastating injury that may be fraught with many complications including post-traumatic deformity. Certainly, the best treatment is prevention with close follow-up and early intervention when needed. Once present, the treatment of post-traumatic deformity follows basic biomechanical principles consisting of re-establishing the integrity of the compromised spinal columns so that spinal stability can be restored.

### Validation of the scale on satisfaction of adolescents with postoperative pain management-idiopathic scoliosis (SAP-S) [^114KxYhS]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Every year, thousands of children younger than 18 years of age undergo surgery in Canada, averaging 64,000 per year, with the numbers reaching and exceeding half a million in the USand in the UK. Pain is a symptom commonly experienced following surgery due to tissue damage. Idiopathic scoliosis surgery (posterior spinal fusion), a common orthopedic surgery in children and adolescents, is a surgical procedure to correct spinal deformities, which generates high levels of pain. This major invasive surgical procedure entails considerable nociceptive input in a highly innervated area, rendering the pain assessment and management an important challenge for clinicians and patients postoperatively.

Inadequate postoperative pain relief can lead to negative psychological and physiological outcomes, with children undergoing orthopedic surgery remaining particularly vulnerable. Postoperative pain may delay recovery and rehabilitation, delay ambulation, and increase the risk of vomiting and sleep disturbancesas well as persistent post-surgical pain.–Furthermore, pain management is an important predictor of patients' overall satisfaction with the quality of care.

Patient satisfaction is often considered an indicator of the quality of care and used as a proxy to measure the hospitals' and the clinicians' success in delivering a timely and efficient patient-centered care. It has gained more attention in recent years as many countries such as the US and the UK offer incentives for physicians to reach quality targets. This is because patients' satisfaction impacts clinical outcomes, financial gains, patient retention, reimbursement rates and malpractice claims. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) recognizes pain management as an obligation and part of the health care professionals' commitment toward their patients. Effective pain management is also positively associated with patient satisfaction. Furthermore, a survey found a strong correlation between patient satisfaction and the perception that health care professionals did everything they could to control their pain.

### Best practices for postoperative management of posterior sacroiliac joint fusion [^113wjoo4]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Monitoring the incision for infection is critical. Patients should be instructed to watch for signs of infection including increased pain, localized swelling, excessive drainage, warmth or redness at the incision site or surrounding skin, as well as fevers or chills. If any of these symptoms occur, patients should contact their provider promptly.

Surgical incision site infections are most likely to arise two to four weeks out of surgery. Any condition reducing immune response in the preoperative period can increase risk of a surgical site infection, which can include uncontrolled diabetes, chemotherapy, autoimmune diseases, chronic steroid use and smoking. Attaining an early definitive diagnosis and initiating appropriate management is crucial in mitigating risks and reducing morbidity.

Summary of Best Practices for Wound Care

Class 1 wound should remain dry for at least 48 hours.
Bathing or submerging the wound should be avoided for at least 3 weeks.
Patient may wait 7–10 days prior to showering, though current evidence does not suggest that early showering causes increased surgical site infections.

Medication Usage

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory (NSAID)

In addition to surgical wound care, the immediate post-operative phase must promote fusion of the posterior SIJ for the procedure to be successful. In novel posterior intra-articular SIJ fusion systems, an allograft is used with demineralized bone matrix (DBM) which creates an osteoinductive environment. Spinal fusion models have confirmed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have an inhibitory effect on healing of a fusion. Although data are limited, it appears this effect is most significant when NSAIDS are administered in the early postoperative period. Goodman et alconducted a study with non-spinal models suggesting early administration of NSAIDS resulted in greater inhibition of bone formation. One study showed that patients who continued to take NSAIDs for more than 3 months postoperatively showed significantly lower fusion success rates.

The length of the inflammatory phase in humans is not clearly defined. Additionally, the data on NSAIDS inhibitory effect on bone healing are not consistent. Certain animal studies have noted inhibitory effects of NSAIDS during the first 8 weeks, but recommendations for avoidance of NSAIDs in practice may be as long as six months following spinal fusion. The authors recommend a shared physician-patient decision taking into account the risk and benefits of resuming or starting postoperative NSAIDS, although NSAIDS are best avoided when possible.

### Evaluation of high-risk patients undergoing spinal surgery: a matched case series [^114U4ajZ]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Neuromuscular (NM) spinal deformities necessitating surgical intervention present a difficult challenge to the medical community. Underlying comorbidities lead to extended hospital stays, significant complications, and social challenges in the extensive perioperative period. In response to this problem, a therapeutic algorithm, the Care Pathway for Spinal Surgery (CAPSS) has been developed at our institution to address this complex medical issue.

Methods

In 1999, a multidisciplinary team developed a treatment protocol, CAPSS, that emphasized perioperative work up and operative scheduling under the direction of a dedicated care coordinator. A case series analysis was conducted to compare the surgical outcomes from before and after CAPSS implementation. Statistical analyses were performed on a carefully paired subset of NM patients (N = 9). Outcome measures were hospital length of stay (LOS), pediatric intensive care unit LOS, number of days intubated, surgical estimated blood loss, postoperative curve magnitude, percent curve correction, and perioperative complications.

Results

Statistical analyses indicated that the use of CAPSS provided significant reduction in overall LOS, pediatric intensive care unit LOS, and perioperative complication rate within this patient group.

Conclusions

CAPSS is an effective method to improve perisurgical care within the NM patients with spinal deformity necessitating operative stabilization.

Level Of Evidence

### Building consensus: development of a best practice guideline (BPG) for surgical site infection (SSI) prevention in high-risk pediatric spine surgery [^115Drvwj]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative surgical site infection (SSI) after pediatric spine fusion is a recognized complication with rates between 0.5% and 1.6% in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and up to 22% in "high risk" patients. Significant variation in the approach to infection prophylaxis has been well documented. The purpose of this initiative is to develop a consensus-based "Best Practice" Guideline (BPG), informed by both the available evidence in the literature and expert opinion, for high-risk pediatric patients undergoing spine fusion. For the purpose of this effort, high risk was defined as anything other than a primary fusion in a patient with idiopathic scoliosis without significant comorbidities. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to decrease the wide variability in SSI prevention strategies in this area, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced health care costs.

Methods

An expert panel composed of 20 pediatric spine surgeons and 3 infectious disease specialists from North America, selected for their extensive experience in the field of pediatric spine surgery, was developed. Using the Delphi process and iterative rounds using a nominal group technique, participants in this panel were as follows: (1) surveyed for current practices; (2) presented with a detailed systematic review of the relevant literature; (3) given the opportunity to voice opinion collectively; and (4) asked to vote regarding preferences privately. Round 1 was conducted using an electronic survey. Initial results were compiled and discussed face-to-face. Round 2 was conducted using the Audience Response System, allowing participants to vote for (strongly support or support) or against inclusion of each intervention. Agreement > 80% was considered consensus. Interventions without consensus were discussed and revised, if feasible. Repeat voting for consensus was performed.

Results

Consensus was reached to support 14 SSI prevention strategies and all participants agreed to implement the BPG in their practices. All agreed to participate in further studies assessing implementation and effectiveness of the BPG. The final consensus driven BPG for high-risk pediatric spine surgery patients includes: (1) patients should have a chlorhexidine skin wash the night before surgery; (2) patients should have preoperative urine cultures obtained; (3) patients should receive a preoperative Patient Education Sheet; (4) patients should have a preoperative nutritional assessment; (5) if removing hair, clipping is preferred to shaving; (6) patients should receive perioperative intravenous cefazolin; (7) patients should receive perioperative intravenous prophylaxis for gram-negative bacilli; (8) adherence to perioperative antimicrobial regimens should be monitored; (9) operating room access should be limited during scoliosis surgery (whenever practical); (10) UV lights need NOT be used in the operating room; (11) patients should have intraoperative wound irrigation; (12) vancomycin powder should be used in the bone graft and/or the surgical site; (13) impervious dressings are preferred postoperatively; (14) postoperative dressing changes should be minimized before discharge to the extent possible.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we present a consensus-based BPG consisting of 14 recommendations for the prevention of SSIs after spine surgery in high-risk pediatric patients. This can serve as a tool to reduce the variability in practice in this area and help guide research priorities in the future. Pending such data, it is the unsubstantiated opinion of the authors of the current paper that adherence to recommendations in the BPG will not only decrease variability in practice but also result in fewer SSI in high-risk children undergoing spinal fusion.

### Management of postoperative pain: a clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists' committee on regional anesthesia, executive committee, and administrative council [^113811oA]. The Journal of Pain (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 15 — multimodal analgesia with acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): The panel recommends that clinicians provide adults and children with acetaminophen and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as part of multimodal analgesia for management of postoperative pain in patients without contraindications (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Research indicates that the combination of acetaminophen with NSAIDs might be more effective than either drug alone, and most research indicates no clear differences between i.v. versus oral administration of acetaminophen or NSAIDs in reducing postoperative pain, although onset of action might be faster with i.v. administration. NSAIDs are associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and ulceration, cardiovascular events, and renal dysfunction; gastrointestinal risks are thought to be lower with the cyclooxygenase 2-selective NSAID celecoxib. High-quality evidence on the effect of NSAIDs on nonunion rates after orthopedic surgical procedures is not available; in spinal fusion, a possible association between high-dose NSAID use and nonunion was not statistically significant in an analysis restricting to higher-quality studies and was not observed in children. Observational studies suggest that NSAID use might be associated with increased risk of anastomotic leakage after colorectal surgery.

### Predicting pediatric patient rehabilitation outcomes after spinal deformity surgery with artificial intelligence [^115xf2iW]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Besides radiographic and questionnaire parameters prediction for surgical decision-making, predictive models focusing on other outcomes were also developed, including major complications, length of hospital stay, costs, and other clinical relevant endpoint –. For example, Scheer et al.developed a pre-operative predictive model for major complications following adult spinal deformity surgery using ensemble decision-tree models. Safaee et al.proposed a linear model to predict the length of hospital stay following adult spinal deformity correction with a 653-patient cohort and achieved an accuracy of 75% within 2 days. Ames et al.proposed tree-based machine-learning models to predict patients with high direct costs to provide insights for reducing costs outside of bundled payment plans (e.g. insurance).

Although few studies have been accomplished for AIS patients, deep learning-enabled pre-operative PRO prediction models for precision medicine have demonstrated their strong feature extraction capability in other elective surgery decision-making. For example, Staartjes et al.proposed a deep feed-forward artificial neural network to evaluate the feasibility of lumbar disk herniation patients. In recent studieson adult scoliosis patient cohorts, researchers also demonstrated that neural networks achieved more accurate and consistent performance in identifying risk factors of developing complications following posterior adult lumbar spine fusion.

AI-enabled clinical decision-support systems hold great promise to significantly improve healthcare in the coming decades. Previous pre-operative prediction models for both curve progression and PRO improvement have demonstrated the efficacy of AI to predict patient rehabilitation outcomes based on patient-specific characteristics in order to facilitate personalized surgery planning. However, the majority of current research focuses on adult scoliosis patients or a relatively small cohort of pediatric patients. In addition, most existing prediction models mainly focused on one perspective of rehabilitation outcomes, either PROs or curve progression. In this study, we hope to deliver a surgical planning and counseling support system for comprehensive patient rehabilitation prediction to guide operative decision-making and enhance post-operative patient care for pediatric scoliosis patients. While our predictive models for AIS outcomes draw inspiration from methodologies used in adult spinal deformity research, it is crucial to recognize the distinct differences between these two populations. Unlike adult spinal deformity, which often involves iatrogenic or degenerative conditions primarily treated for pain relief, AIS treatment focuses on preventing future complications and curve progression. The AIS population also exhibits less variability in etiology and presentation compared to adult spinal deformity.

### Day-to-day risk and resilience factors in the context of pediatric post-surgical recovery – A network analysis of intensive longitudinal data from adolescents undergoing spinal fusion surgery and their parents [^111bQfYd]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ineffective pediatric post-operative pain management increases the risk of Chronic Post-Surgical Pain (CPSP), affecting around 20% of children undergoing major surgery. Psychological predictors of recovery, in both children and their parents, have been identified. However, how these variables change throughout the recovery process remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations of adolescent and parental risk and resilience variables in everyday life, during post-operative recovery, for adolescents undergoing spinal fusion surgery.

Methods

Participants were adolescents with Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS), aged 12–18 years, undergoing spinal fusion surgery, and their parents, recruited at four hospitals in Belgium. Participants completed daily assessments for 7 consecutive days, at 5 time-points, before surgery, and at 3 and 6 weeks, and 6 and 12 months, post-surgery. Diary measures included adolescent and parental pain and recovery variables known to be relevant in the context of pediatric post-operative pain. Network analysis was used to explore correlations between all variables throughout the post-operative recovery process.

Results

The sample comprised N = 190 participants. Associations were stronger within adolescent and parent variables, than between them. For adolescents, psychological flexibility was associated with positive mood and activity engagement, and pain intensity with pain catastrophizing and activity avoidance. For parents, higher levels of pain-related fear and catastrophizing were related to more parent-to-child instructions to avoid activities. Regarding adolescent-parent between correlations, parental instructions to avoid activities were associated with adolescent physical complaints and activity avoidance, and parent pain catastrophizing was associated with adolescent pain-related fear and catastrophizing. Generally, networks displayed both similarities and differences across post-operative phases.

Discussion

The study sample was small in relation to the statistical analyses conducted. Even so, the present findings provide a new perspective on psychological predictors at play in everyday life throughout the pediatric post-operative recovery process, indicating important targets, both clinical and for future investigation.

### Prevalence of and recommendation for measuring chronic postsurgical pain in children: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113KGufq]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review summarized results from 20 unique samples and found that the pooled prevalence CPSP was 28% (95% CI 21.4% to 36.1%) with moderate certainty, with a reported range of 10%–63%. This rate is higher than our previous systematic review, which reported a prevalence rate of 20% from four unique samples. Despite considerable clinical heterogeneity, the current estimate of 28% received a moderate degree of certainty as per GRADE, indicating that this is a representative assessment of pediatric CPSP. Further, we subanalyzed the data by surgery type and found that the prevalence rate for spinal fusion surgery was 31% (95% CI 21.4% to 43.5%). This is double the recently reported prevalence of CPSP in adult spine surgeries (ie, 14%). While the aim of the review was to include all types of surgeries, the majority of studies that met inclusion criteria consisted of major surgeries (eg, spinal fusion, orthopedic surgeries), and thus our results reflect major surgeries.

### Acute postoperative opioid consumption trajectories and long-term outcomes in pediatric patients after spine surgery [^116YPKuu]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this study of adolescents undergoing posterior spinal fusion surgery, 5 acute postoperative opioid consumption trajectories were identified that could be broadly divided into high opioid consumers and low opioid consumers. Intraoperative intrathecal morphine dose was a significant predictor of opioid trajectory membership. Notably, high/low opioid consumers were not associated with pain, functional activity or use of pain medications (opioids and non-opioids) 6 months after surgery. Future studies examining the role of pharmacogenetic variations and pain on opioid consumption trajectories are required.

### Surgical management of neuromuscular scoliosis in paediatric patients: experiences from a tertiary centre multidisciplinary team [^115a8DZE]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence formally recognised shared decision-making in 2015 as a cornerstone of patient-centred care. Although MDTs are resource intensive, our findings show that they play a crucial role in making informed, comprehensive and patient-centred decisions for complex patients with NMS. While immediate postoperative complications are common, effective postoperative care allowed all patients to eventually be discharged from hospital with LOS comparable to what has been previously reported. Our MDT appears successful at identifying high- and low-risk patients. For the patients with NMS who cannot be so clearly stratified into high- and low-risk groups, the correlation between comorbidities and surgical risk is more nuanced, and future research should focus on these patients.

In conclusion, our findings highlight the complexity of decision-making in the management of paediatric patients with NMS. The involvement of MDTs is essential, as these patients present with a range of complex medical, surgical and social challenges that cannot be distilled into a standardised algorithm. The expertise of the MDT allows for individualised, case-by-case assessments but further research is needed to identify factors that predict better surgical outcomes or indicate when conservative management is more appropriate. Larger, multicentre studies and understanding of variations in MDT composition are necessary to optimise preoperative and postoperative care for patients with NMS to ensure the maximum number of patients able to benefit from the quality-of-life improvements provided by spinal correction surgery.

The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of risk and resilience factors in everyday life, in both adolescents and parents, and daily post-operative recovery variables in adolescents undergoing spinal fusion surgery, throughout the post-operative recovery process, in an explorative network analysis. As expected, the results showed that the network edges within adolescent and parent variables, respectively, were stronger than the edges between adolescent and parent variables.

### The incidence and risk factors for short-term morbidity and mortality in pediatric deformity spinal surgery: an analysis of the NSQIP pediatric database [^112HK4Le]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective review of a prospective cohort.

Objective

To determine the incidence and risk factors for 30-day morbidity and mortality after pediatric deformity spinal surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

Pediatric deformity spinal surgery is generally considered a safe and effective treatment option. The rising costs associated with spinal surgery and related perioperative complications have received national attention. Few studies with standardized definitions and data collection methods exist.

Methods

A large, multicenter clinical registry specifically designed to collect pediatric surgical outcomes was queried for all patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery in 2012. Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to select patients undergoing anterior, posterior, and combined fusions. Detailed patient and case characteristics were analyzed. Thirty-day morbidity and mortality rates were calculated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify patient characteristics, comorbidities, and operative variables predictive of complication.

Results

In total, 2005 pediatric patients undergoing deformity spinal fusion were included. The rate of 30-day complications was 10.0%; with a mortality rate of 0.15% (3 patients), a morbidity rate of 8.4%, reoperation rate of 3.74%, and readmission rate of 3.94%. The morbidity rate was highest in the neuromuscular group (13.09%) and lowest in the idiopathic cohort (5.69%), P < 0.01). Compared with posterior fusions, anterior fusions and those extending to the pelvis were associated with higher complication rates (P < 0.01). Risk factors for complication included hepatobiliary disease (P = 0.03), cognitive impairment (P = 0.02), elevated American Society of Anesthesiologists class (P < 0.01), and prolonged operative time (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

The overall rate of 30-day morbidity after pediatric spinal deformity surgery was 10%. Multiple patient comorbidities and surgical duration and invasiveness were associated with an increased complication risk. These data may aid in the informed consent process, facilitate patient risk assessment, and allow quality comparisons between surgeons and institutions.

### Best practices for postoperative management of posterior sacroiliac joint fusion [^113J9vHR]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain is a major health issue and creates a significant impact on both quality of life and health-care costs. An estimated 70% to 85% of the western population will develop low back pain at least once during their lifetime.SIJ pain is a common cause of low back pain accounting for 15% to 30% of all cases. It is the most likely source of low back pain in patients having undergone either lumbar or lumbosacral fusion surgery. Spinal imaging shows the incidence of SIJ degeneration in patients who have undergone lumbar fusion surgery is 75% at 5 years post-surgery. Pain caused by SIJ disorders has also been linked to hip osteoarthritis as well as lumbar disorders.

Although SIJ pain is common in the general population, it can be difficult to find long-term therapy to treat this problem. Conservative interventional treatment options including intra articular steroid injections and radiofrequency ablation focus on decreasing inflammation and blocking the pain, respectively. These interventions have been shown to have moderate success in the short to intermediate term, but poor long-term resolution of symptoms. Surgical fusion, a potentially curative intervention of the SIJ, aims to stabilize the joint to prevent laxity and inflammation. SIJ fusion is appropriate as part of the care algorithm for this disorder requiring a plan that follows more conservative attempts at joint pain resolution. This often includes a period of 6 months or more of non-operative treatment including medication optimization, activity modification and physical therapy.

6. Perioperative blood conservation strategies

Patients undergoing moderate and major spinal surgery are at risk of significant blood loss necessitating fluid and blood product replacement. Recent systematic analysis of tranexamic acid use in spinal surgery patients concluded that the use of tranexamic acid (TXA) was effective in reducing intra-operative blood loss and decreased the volume of blood transfusion. It is likely that the higher bolus doses employed (greater or equal to 15 mg/kg followed by intraoperative infusion) were more effective in attenuating blood loss and transfusion requirements. Lower perioperative blood loss has consistently been demonstrated with the use of -amin-caproic acid (EACA) in spinal surgery. Point of care testing devices allow for standardization of transfusion practices and early identification and treatment of hypofibrinogenemia. In a study of patients undergoing major spinal surgery ROTEM (ROtational ThromboElastoMetry) device used with TXA was found to lead to a significantly lower blood loss and lower transfusion of packed red blood cells as compared to the TXA alone. Studies have demonstrated the utility of ROTEM in decreasing the rate of blood product transfusion.

Blood conservation options include preoperative autologous blood donation and intraoperative cell saver use.

Preoperative autologous blood donation in elective major spine surgery has been effective in reducing allogenic transfusion, however inclusion in the program resulted in increased risk of transfusion. A Cochrane meta-analysis assessing the use of cell saver in major surgery demonstrated significantly decreased rate of allogenic blood transfusion. The use of the cell saver in posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion surgery in school-aged children and adolescents was able to decrease the amount of intraoperative allogeneic RBC transfusion but failed to decrease total perioperative allogeneic RBC transfusion. In contrast, use of cell-saver was found to be associated with increased risk of bleeding in patients having spinal fusion surgery. There is no evidence supporting the use of controlled hypotension to minimize the risk of bleeding, particularly in prone patients. Perioperative blood conservation is aided through simple clinical measures such as temperature regulation, optimal patient positioning and meticulous surgical techniques.

There is high quality evidence for antifibrinolytic use in surgery of the spine when significant blood loss is anticipated. There is moderate quality evidence for cell saver use when significant blood loss is anticipated. There is low quality evidence for use of point of care testing to decrease the number of red blood cell units transfused.

### Pathway for enhanced recovery after spinal surgery-a systematic review of evidence for use of individual components [^111JP59K]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria

Our patient population included adult and paediatric patients undergoing spinal surgical procedure on any spinal anatomical site. These anatomical sites cervical (anterior or posterior cervical decompression and fusion), thoracic (e.g. thoracic decompression and fusion), lumbar (e.g. lumbar decompression and fusion, lumbar laminectomy, sacral or any one combination of these). The interventions of interest have been classified in 5 perioperative pillars: preadmission period, preoperative period, intraoperative period, postoperative period, and audit and compliance processes (Table 1). These interventions (22 individual pathway components) have been defined through previous published work. We reviewed the evidence with regards to each component studied independently or in any one combination. Comparator interventions consisted of standard of care, no treatment or placebo.

In line with other ERAS reviews, we defined our primary outcomes in the following groups:
Morbidity, including pulmonary, cardiac, and renal complication rates; surgical complication rates; and
readmission rates.
Mortality from all causes.
Patient-reported experiences and outcomes (PREMs/PROMs), including pain-related outcomes.
(pain score rating and/or opioid consumption, pain management satisfaction), readiness for surgery, quality of care patient scores, and quality of recovery outcomes.
Health service-related outcomes, including length of stay and reported economic/financial outcomes (e.g. costs of the length of stay).

We included systematic reviews and meta-analysis, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled studies, and observational studies (e.g. cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, and case series). We included human data studies published in the English language after 1990.

### Day-to-day risk and resilience factors in the context of pediatric post-surgical recovery – A network analysis of intensive longitudinal data from adolescents undergoing spinal fusion surgery and their parents [^113Rw5ub]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Procedure

Patients (ie adolescents) received standard surgical care at their respective hospital. Participants, including both adolescents and parents, were asked to complete daily assessments over a period of seven days at five time-points: two weeks prior to surgery (T0), at three (T1) and six weeks (T2), and six (T3) and 12 (T4) months post-surgery. Hence, 35 daily assessments were expected from each participant. Data were collected via an online survey platform, Limesurvey 2.0. A week prior to each diary period, participants were contacted via telephone and instructed to complete the daily assessment in the evening for seven consecutive days. For each daily assessment, instructions included prompts to complete all items at once. Participants were reminded daily to fill in the diary, via automatic text messages. When there was a non-response, participants were reminded by a research team member the following day and prompted to fill in the diary assessment before 10 am the next day. Demographical data were collected through self-report questionnaires at T0. Biomedical data were retrieved via medical records.

Measures

Two diaries were developed to measure adolescent and parent variables, respectively, and were validated with regard to reliability, validity and variability, showing good psychometric properties. For both diaries, all items were rated on a 7-point numerical rating scale, ranging from "0" to "6" (from "not at all true" to "totally true", if not otherwise specified). The adolescent diary assessed pain intensity, fatigue, physical complaints, pain-related fear, pain catastrophizing, psychological flexibility, activity engagement, activity avoidance, positive and negative affect/mood, general functioning, and pain interference. The parent diary measured: positive and negative affect/mood (parental), pain catastrophizing (about child pain), pain-related fear (regarding child pain), parent instructions towards their child to avoid or engage in activities, and parent protective behaviour. The diaries were developed based upon validated questionnaires measuring constructs related to pediatric pain and function. The Discriminant Content Validity (DCV) procedure was applied. Variables, number of items, items, response scales, and sources for development are presented in Table 1 for the adolescent diary and Table 2 for the parent diary.

Patients and Methods

Overview

We performed a retrospective analysis of a previous prospective, multicenter study that recruited patients after fusion for adult spinal deformity with minimum of 2 years follow-up as part of the Scoli-RISK-1 trial. From this cohort, the GAP score was applied to patients who fulfilled these inclusion criteria: (1) age ≥ 18 years; (2) at least one of the following radiological parameters preoperatively: scoliosis ≥ 20 °, sagittal vertical axis (SVA) ≥ 5 cm, thoracic kyphosis > 60 °, pelvic tilt > 25 °; (3) undergone ≥ four-vertebrae posterior instrumented fusion; and (4) minimum of 2 years follow-up. Patients were excluded from this secondary analysis if they had neuromuscular disease, active infections, trauma or tumors, if a full-length radiograph was not available at baseline, early postoperative period (between 3 and 12 weeks) or latest follow-up, or if the planned uppermost instrumented vertebra was within a previously fused segment.

There were 272 patients in the original Scoli-RISK-1 cohort. Patients with fewer than four levels of fusion (0.7%; 2 of 272), those who dropped out before the 2-year timepoint (20%; 55 of 272), those without postoperative whole-spine standing radiographs at 2 years (24%; 64 of 272), and those whose GAP score could not be calculated on 3- to 12-week radiographs because of missing data (14%; 37 of 272) were excluded, leaving 159 patients (58%) were included in the current analysis (Table 1). The baseline characteristics and radiographic parameters used to calculate the GAP score were similar between the patients who were included in this study and those who were excluded (Table 2).

Comparison between patients included and excluded from the current analysis

The mean (range) age of the analyzed patients at the time of surgery was 58 ± 14 years (18 to 80), and the median number of levels involved in the surgery was 11 (4 to 23). Sixty-two percent (99 of 159) had previous spine surgery. The median total operative time was 405 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 329 to 499 minutes), with a median estimated total blood loss of 2000 mL (IQR 1500 to 3000 mL). Seventy-five percent (120 of 159) of the patients underwent a three-column osteotomy.

### Does routine subspecialty consultation before high-risk pediatric spine surgery decrease the incidence of complications? [^116tTqUu]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Children with neuromuscular disorders and syndromic scoliosis who require operative treatment for scoliosis are at increased risk for postoperative complications. Complications may include surgical site infection and pulmonary system problems including respiratory failure, gastrointestinal system disorders, and others. The purpose of our study was to determine the effect of a standardized perioperative pathway specifically designed for management of high-risk pediatric patients undergoing surgery for scoliosis.

Methods

The High-Risk Protocol (HRP) at our institution is a multidisciplinary process with subspecialty consultations before scoliosis surgery. This was a retrospective chart and radiographic review at a single institution. Inclusion criteria were high-risk subjects, age 8 to 18 years old, who underwent surgery between January, 2009 and April, 2009 with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Diagnoses included neuromuscular scoliosis or Syndromic scoliosis.

Results

Seventy one subjects were analyzed. The mean age was 13 (± 2 SD) years. Follow-up was 63 (± 24 SD) months. The study group consisted of 35 subjects who had fully completed the HRP and the control group consisted of 36 subjects who did not. Nine of the 35 (26%) subjects in the HRP had surgery delayed while interventions were performed. Compared with controls, the study group had larger preoperative and postoperative curve magnitudes: 90 versus 73 degrees (P = 0.002) and 35 versus 22 degrees (P = 0.001). Pulmonary disease was more common in the HRP, 60 versus 31% (P = 0.013). The overall incidence of complications in the study group was 29% (10 of 35 subjects) and for controls 28% (10 of 36). There were no differences between groups for types of complications or Clavien-Dindo grades. Three subjects in the study group and 1 in the controls developed surgical site infection. Eleven subjects required unplanned reoperations during the study period.

Conclusions

The findings of our study suggest a structured pathway requiring routine evaluations by pediatric subspecialists may not reduce complications for all high-risk pediatric spine patients. Selective use of consultants may be more appropriate.

### Perioperative management and outcomes for posterior spinal fusion in patients with friedreich ataxia: a single-center, retrospective study [^115LUgem]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Friedreich ataxia is a rare genetic disorder associated with progressive mitochondrial dysfunction leading to widespread sequelae including ataxia, muscle weakness, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, and neuromuscular scoliosis. Children with Friedreich ataxia are at high risk for periprocedural complications during posterior spinal fusion due to their comorbidities.

Aim

To describe our single-center perioperative management of patients with Friedreich ataxia undergoing posterior spinal fusion.

Methods

Adolescent patients with Friedreich ataxia presenting for spinal deformity surgery between 2007 and 2023 were included in this retrospective case series performed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Perioperative outcomes were reviewed along with preoperative characteristics, intraoperative anesthetic management, and postoperative medical management.

Results

Seventeen patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age was 15 ± 2years old and 47% were female. Preoperatively, 35% were wheelchair dependent, 100% had mild-to-moderate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with preserved systolic function and no left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, 29% were on cardiac medications, and 29% were on pain medications. Intraoperatively, 53% had transesophageal echocardiography monitoring; 12% had changes in volume status on echo but no changes in function. Numerous combinations of total intravenous anesthetic agents were used, most commonly propofol, remifentanil, and ketamine. Baseline neuromonitoring signals were poor in four patients and one patient lost signals, resulting in 4 (24%) wake-up tests. The majority (75%) were extubated in the operating room. Postoperative complications were high (88%) and ranged from minor complications like nausea/vomiting (18%) to major complications like hypotension/tachycardia (29%) and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in one patient (6%).

Conclusions

Patients with Friedreich ataxia are at high risk for perioperative complications when undergoing posterior spinal fusion and coordinated multidisciplinary care is required at each stage. Future research should focus on the utility of intraoperative echocardiography, optimal anesthetic agent selection, and targeted fluid management to reduce postoperative cardiac complications.

### Complications of surgical treatment of pediatric spinal deformities [^1149x34w]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Surgery in a child with spinal deformity is challenging. Although current orthopedic practice ensures good long-term surgical results, complications occur. Idiopathic scoliosis represents the most extensively investigated deformity of the pediatric spine. Nonidiopathic deformities of the spine are at higher risk for perioperative and long-term complications, mainly because of underlying comorbidities. A multidisciplinary treatment strategy is helpful to assure optimization of medical conditions before surgery. Awareness of complications that occur during or after spine surgery is essential to avoid a poor outcome and for future surgical decision making. This article summarizes the complications of surgical treatment of the growing spine.

### Perioperative care of patients undergoing major complex spinal instrumentation surgery: clinical practice guidelines from the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care [^116d39QC]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2022). High credibility.

Transfusion management and antifibrinolytic use — risk factors for intraoperative transfusion include anterior spinal instrumentation and fusion with a 25% to 29% transfusion rate and multilevel (> 3 levels) surgery, among others. Benefits of balanced transfusion ratios (1:1 plasma-reduced red cell:fresh frozen plasma and 1:4 plasma-reduced red cell:platelets) and restrictive (7 g/dL) versus liberal (10 g/dL) targeted transfusion strategies are described as unclear. Recommendations include: preparation and allocation of resources for transfusion should be considered for high-risk groups including age over 50 years (Class I, Level of Evidence B-NR); hemoglobin and hematocrit values should be monitored frequently, every 1 to 2 h or more often on a case-by-case basis (Class I, Level of Evidence C-EO); anesthesiologists should consider blood loss, physiologic profiles, perfusion pressure, and end-organ function in informing perioperative transfusion decisions (Class I, Level of Evidence C-EO); no specific recommendation can be made for transfusion thresholds or ratios (Class IIb, Level of Evidence B-NR); preoperative blood donation may be considered for selected patients (Class IIb, Level of Evidence B-NR); and cell salvage may be considered to help to reduce red blood cell transfusion requirement in patients at risk for blood loss (Class III [No benefit], Level of Evidence A).

### Prevalence of and recommendation for measuring chronic postsurgical pain in children: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1165WA3Q]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

According to the prior 2017 review (Rabbitts et al), approximately 20% of children and adolescents develop chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP; ie, pain persisting > 3 months after surgery) after major surgeries, which is associated with adverse functional and psychological consequences. A major barrier was that definitions of CPSP applied were highly variable. Since that prior review was conducted (n = 4 studies in meta-analysis), numerous relevant studies have been published warranting an update.

Objective

The aims of this current review were to: (1) provide an updated prevalence estimate for pediatric CPSP and (2) examine definitions of pediatric CPSP applied in current research.

Evidence review

Prospective, observational studies examining CPSP using a validated self-report pain intensity measure in children were included. 4884 unique publications were screened with 20 articles meeting inclusion criteria. Risk of bias using Quality in Prognostic Study tool ranged from low to high.

Findings

The pooled prevalence of CPSP among mostly major surgeries was 28.2% (95% CI 21.4% to 36.1%). Subgroup analysis of spinal fusion surgeries identified a prevalence of 31% (95% CI 21.4% to 43.5%). Using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, the certainty in prevalence estimates was moderate. Studies used a range of valid pain intensity measures to classify CPSP (eg, Numeric Rating Scale), often without pain interference or quality of life measures.

Conclusions

The overall prevalence of pediatric CPSP is higher than estimated in the prior review, and quality of studies generally improved though with some heterogeneity. Standardizing the measurement of CPSP will facilitate future efforts to combine and compare data across studies.

### Error traps in developing a pediatric enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program [^111oWXzJ]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways have been shown to improve patient outcomes, increase patient satisfaction, and decrease costs. First created and implemented in the adult population, these pathways are now commonplace and continue to expand in the pediatric realm. While there are many proven benefits to ERAS pathways, there continue to be challenges to their proper implementation and long-term success. This article aims to explore common challenges in pediatric ERAS development and implementation, along with strategies to avoid potential pitfalls. Key themes include departmental and institutional support, stakeholder engagement, awareness of pathways, data management and dissemination, and long-term maintenance including Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. Pathway development teams should be aware of these considerations and potential pitfalls, and focusing on them can promote long-term success for a well-designed pathway.

### Adverse impact of obesity on lumbar spine fusion, patient-reported outcomes and costs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115jdggN]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This meta-analysis confirmed that obesity is a significant risk factor for nonunion, worse patient-reported clinical outcomes, and increased hospitalization costs following lumbar spinal fusion surgery. The clinical implications of this study include optimized perioperative protocols and patient management. Further research on surgical techniques, bone grafts, and medical optimization is required. High-quality prospective studies are essential to establish the independent effects of obesity on surgical outcomes and to improve safety in this high-risk population.

Key Points

Obesity is a significant risk factor for nonunion after lumbar spinal fusion surgery, doubling the risk.
Patients with obesity showed significantly worse quality of life and functional outcomes.
Obesity also demonstrated a higher economic burden by increasing hospitalization costs associated with lumbar spinal fusion surgery.

### The association between adjuvant pain medication use and outcomes following pediatric spinal fusion [^114U26Mn]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

A comparative effectiveness database study.

Objective

The aim of this study was to describe variation in use of adjuvant therapies for managing postoperative pain in in patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and determine association between use of these therapies and patient outcomes.

Summary Of Background Data

Variation in postoperative pain management for children undergoing PSF for AIS likely impacts outcomes. Minimal evidence exists to support strategies that most effectively minimize prolonged intravenous (IV) opioids and hospitalizations.

Methods

We included patients aged 10 to 18 years discharged from one of 38 freestanding children's hospitals participating in a national database from December 1, 2012, to January 5, 2015, with ICD9 codes indicating scoliosis and PSF procedure. Use of ketorolac, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogues (GABAa), and benzodiazepines was compared across hospitals. Hierarchical logistic regression adjusting for confounders and accounting for clustering of patients within hospitals was used to estimate association between these therapies and odds of prolonged duration of IV opioids, prolonged length of stay (LOS), and early readmissions.

Results

Across hospitals, use of ketorolac and GABAa was highly variable and increased over time among 7349 subjects. Use of ketorolac was independently associated with significantly lower odds of prolonged LOS [odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.64–0.89] and prolonged duration of IV opioid (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73–0.98). GABAa use was significantly associated with decreased odds of prolonged IV opioid use (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.53–0.75). Readmission rate at 30 days was 1.6% and most strongly associated with prolonged LOS.

Conclusion

In this national cohort of children with AIS undergoing PSF, patients who received postoperative ketorolac or GABAa were less likely to have prolonged IV opioid exposure. Given the rapid increase in use of adjuvant therapies without strong evidence, resources should be devoted to multicenter trials in order to optimize effectiveness and outcomes.

Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care (SNACC) perioperative care guidelines for major complex spine surgery — epidemiology, definition, risks, and pathways — are outlined as follows: Complex spine surgery is defined as surgery on 2 or more thoracic and/or lumbar spine levels and is also described as surgery involving 2 or more levels of the spinal column with associations including in-hospital cardiopulmonary events, stroke and wound complications, prolonged hospitalization, high 30-day hospital readmission rates, and discharge to skilled nursing or rehabilitation facilities. In the United States, upwards of 400,000 spinal fusions occur annually, with a 15-fold increase in spine procedures reported between 2000 and 2007. A retrospective review of 1,288,496 patients reported lumbar spine fusion mortality of 0.2%, with over half of fatalities by postoperative day 9. The document emphasizes a multidisciplinary, patient-centric team approach and notes that Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) clinical pathways aim to improve measurable outcomes, with the ERAS Society having recently published evidence-based ERAS pathway recommendations for lumbar fusion.

Given the widening use of spinal instrumentation, the management of related postoperative deep wound infections has become increasingly important. In the literature, there have been reports of several treatment methods yet no firmly established protocol for management of postoperative deep wound infections exists. The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of our protocol employing (CSIS) in the treatment of postoperative deep wound infections.

Methods

A retrospective record review of 500 posterior instrumented fusions between 1990 and 2002. Twenty-eight consecutive infections (5%) were diagnosed and treated by a standardized treatment protocol of Incision and Drainage, and CSIS. Cultures were obtained, wounds closed primarily, and appropriate intravenous antibiotic treatments initiated. For statistical evaluation, patients were assigned a risk factor (RF) described by Levi et al (J Neurosurg. 1997;86:975–980). Point values were assigned to medical comorbidities that may contribute to postoperative infection risk; higher RF values indicate an increased risk.

Results

Twenty-one acute and 7 late (> 6 months) infections were followed for 22.3 months (1–86 months), post-CSIS treatment. Twenty-one (75%) resolved without recurrence with one CSIS treatment. Seven acute infections (25%) required a second course of treatment. Hospitalization for the index procedure averaged 15.4 days; 28.9 days for reinfections. No patient with an acute infection required implant removal. The reinfection group had higher blood loss, more levels fused, and longer hospitalization. The reinfection group was comprised entirely of pediatric patients.

Conclusion

No correlation was found between RF values and greater risk of recurrent infection. Removal of implants is unnecessary in acute infections, provided the infection does not return. CSIS is an effective method for treatment of postoperative wound infections following instrumented spinal fusion avoiding the need for secondary closure.

### Surgical management of neuromuscular scoliosis in paediatric patients: experiences from a tertiary centre multidisciplinary team [^113monwV]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This study offers valuable insights into the clinical decision-making process around treatment options for patients with NMS, a complex and multifaceted clinical area still fraught with challenges. To our knowledge, it is the first study dedicated to analysing decision-making in this patient group. As acknowledged in previous published studies, NMS management poses considerable difficulty for practitioners, with surgical intervention often being the only long-term treatment option. The decision to offer surgery is a complex one, involving the evaluation of numerous comorbidities. Each case was discussed in depth by the MDT, taking into consideration the severity and combination of comorbidities, the patient's overall health status, the potential benefits and risks of surgery and the opinion of the patient and their family. There were no strict criteria or scoring system employed; rather, decisions were made on a case-by-case basis after thorough discussion. It is within this realm that MDTs have proven their worth, encompassing a range of professionals whose collective expertise enhances the decision-making process.

Our data show how diverse this group of patients is, in terms of underlying diagnosis, comorbidities and scoliosis progression. To a certain extent, this explains the lack of standardised risk stratification and guidelines. In this disease, MDTs have limited evidence from which they must make difficult decisions. Looking at this centre's experience, patients who received conservative treatment had significantly higher total comorbidities and a higher incidence of respiratory issues. Our findings support previous studies in that a significant correlation was observed between comorbidities and postoperative complication risk, specifically respiratory ones. Furthermore, the low postoperative mortality outcomes (n = 0) observed are consistent with existing studies that show a 30-day mortality rate of 0%. These results may be due to the MDT's ability to select the most appropriate candidates for surgery as well as high-quality perioperative care, optimised for this high-risk group, in mitigating complication risk related to comorbidities.

### Psychosocial mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain in youth following spinal fusion: a 6-month longitudinal study [^115tc3Xu]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Potentially eligible participants were identified from medical record surgery reports, screened for eligibility through medical chart review, and sent recruitment materials along with consent/assent forms approximately 2 months before surgery. Potentially eligible participants were contacted through phone, confirmed eligibility criteria, and completed informed consent. Participants who were nonresponsive to phone contact attempts were met at the surgery clinic during a presurgery visit. Youth–parent dyads who agreed to participate in the study completed presurgery (T1, between 8 and 0 weeks before surgery) self-report measures. Adolescent participants completed daily diary assessments of pain intensity and pain interference for 30 days after surgery (T2). At the 8-week (T3) and 6-month (T4) follow-up assessments, both adolescents and parents completed self-report surveys. Adolescents and parents earned gift cards on completion of assessment at each time point. Adolescents and parents earned up to $420 and $150 in gift cards for study participation, respectively. The Seattle Children's Institutional Review Board (Federal Wide Assurance Number FWA00002443) at Seattle Children's Hospital (Study IRB ID: STUDY00001241) and the Children's Hospital Orange County Institutional Review Board #1 - In-House Board (Federal Wide Assurance Number FWA00000255) at Children's Hospital Orange County (Study IRB ID: 181089) approved the study.

Patients received standard surgical, anesthetic, and analgesic care, which was not altered for this study. Typical intraoperative management included a total intravenous anesthetic to facilitate neuromonitoring during surgery and analgesics including ketamine, opioids, and methadone. Postoperative management included expedited nutrition intake, physical therapy, and early ambulation, and multimodal pain management including scheduled nonopioid analgesics (acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), scheduled or as needed muscle relaxants, and patient controlled opioid analgesia for 24 hours followed by enteral opioid. Patients were typically discharged on day 2 to 4 with scheduled nonopioid analgesia and a limited course of as needed oxycodone and muscle relaxant. In this study, the mean interval between surgery and hospital discharge was 3.3 days (SD = 0.9, median = 3).

### Evidence for a multimodal pain management regimen in reduction of postoperative opioid use in pediatric patients receiving posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^111Sxj9N]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Objective

This project aims to evaluate the relationship between increased use of intraoperative nonopioid analgesics, muscle relaxers, and anesthetics and postoperative outcomes, including opioid utilization, time until ambulation, and hospital length of stay.

Summary Of Background Data

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a structural deformity of the spine that occurs in otherwise healthy adolescents, occurring with a frequency of 1% to 3%. Up to 60% of patients receiving spinal surgeries, particularly posterior spinal fusion (PSF), experience at least 1 day of moderate-to-severe pain after surgery.

Patients and Methods

This is a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 having received PSF with > 5 levels fused for AIS at a dedicated children's hospital and a regional tertiary referral center with a dedicated pediatric spine program between January 2018 and September 2022. A linear regression model was used to evaluate the influence of baseline characteristics and intraoperative medications on the total amount of postoperative morphine milligram equivalents received.

Results

There were no significant differences in the background characteristics of the two patient populations. Patients receiving PSF at the tertiary referral center received equivalent or greater amounts of all nonopioid pain medications and demonstrated decreased time until ambulation (19.3 vs. 22.3h), postoperative opioid use (56.1 vs. 70.1 MME), and postoperative hospital length of stay (35.9 vs. 58.3h). Hospital location was not individually associated with a difference in postoperative opioid use. There was not a significant difference in postoperative pain ratings. When accounting for all other variables, liposomal bupivacaine had the greatest contribution to the decrease in postoperative opioid use.

Conclusion

Patients receiving greater amounts of nonopioid intraoperative medications utilized 20% fewer postoperative morphine milligram equivalents, were discharged 22.3 hours earlier and had earlier recorded evidence of mobility. Postoperatively, nonopioid analgesics were as effective as opioids in the reduction of subjective pain ratings. This study further demonstrates the efficacy of multimodal pain management regimens in pediatric patients receiving PSF for AIS.

### Epidural analgesia compared with intravenous analgesia after pediatric posterior spinal fusion [^1115z587]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pain management remains challenging for pediatric patients after posterior spinal fusion (PSF). This study compares the effectiveness of hydromorphone and bupivacaine administered through patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with hydromorphone patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (IV-PCA) in this population.

Methods

Patients aged 8 to 18 years undergoing PSF for idiopathic scoliosis were randomized to receive either PCEA (0.1% bupivacaine plus hydromorphone 10 mcg/mL at 8 mL/h plus bolus dosing) or IV-PCA (hydromorphone 2 mcg/kg/h continuous infusion; 2 mcg/kg bolus dose). Pain scores, severity of muscle spasms, and analgesic doses were recorded for 3 postoperative days (PODs). Adverse events were followed until discharge.

Results

Thirty-eight patients were included (19 PCEA and 19 IV-PCA). Seven in the PCEA group (37%) experienced early epidural failure, and 2 in the IV-PCA group remained intubated, sedated, and ventilated for several hours postoperatively; these patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. All data are presented as "per protocol" unless otherwise specified. Pain scores were significantly lower on days 2 and 3 (P ≤ 0.042). Eight percent of the patients who received PCEA experienced moderate-to-severe spasms through POD 3 compared with 35% of those in the IV-PCA group (P = NS). Seven (58%) patients in the PCEA group and 17 (100%) in the IV-PCA group required diazepam (P = 0.007).

Conclusions

Epidural catheters provide modestly improved analgesia in patients after PSF for idiopathic scoliosis. However, the high failure rate in this population emphasizes a need for a close assessment for adequate blockade early in the recovery period. This study provides an excellent platform on which to build future trials that could include increased baseline dosing for the epidural medications, radiographic confirmation of catheter placement, and dual catheter techniques toward the goal of improving pain control in these patients.

### Soft-tissue defects after spinal instrumentation in 5 children: risk factors, management strategies, and outcomes [^1149NHFb]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Wound-related complications following complex posterior spine procedures in children may result in the need for serial debridements and may place spinal instrumentation at risk. In this study, the authors review their experience with the management of soft-tissue defects from spinal instrumentation in 5 high-risk pediatric patients. The use of various rotational and transpositional flaps in the management of these complicated cases is discussed, as well as their outcomes.

Methods

The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 patients who returned to the Neuro-Spine service at Texas Children's Hospital for erosion of spinal instrumentation through the skin between September 1, 2007, and October 31, 2012. Patient demographics and clinical and operative data were recorded.

Results

Risk factors such as young age (1 case), poor nutritional status (1 case), multiple previous surgeries (3 cases), severe neurological deficits (2 cases), and history of radiation therapy for malignancy (2 cases) were noted in the 5 patients. The paraspinous flap (4 cases) was the mainstay of the treatment. Follow-up ranged from 7.5 to 17.5 months (mean 11 ± 4.2 months). One of the patients required more than 1 procedure for revision of the wound. Cultures were positive in 2 of the 5 cases. Spinal instrumentation was removed in 3 of the 5 cases; however, in all 3 of the cases there was evidence of delayed instability that developed after the removal of spinal instrumentation.

Conclusions

The use of local tissue flaps is safe and efficacious for treatment of posterior wound complications due to spinal instrumentation in children. Removal of spinal instrumentation should be avoided due to the development of delayed instability. Highly vascularized tissue is used to speed healing, clear bacteria, and eliminate dead space, obviating the need to remove contaminated spinal instrumentation.

### Effectiveness and sustainability of a standardized care pathway developed with use of lean process mapping for the treatment of patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^1161eFGT]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recent changes in health care have begun to shift the industry from a volume-based to a value-based focus. This shift has led to standardized care pathways that decrease care variability, improve outcomes, and decrease cost. Although numerous studies have described standardized pathways for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), few have demonstrated sustainability. We report the effectiveness and sustainability of a standardized care pathway for patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion for AIS.

Methods

A standardized care pathway was developed and implemented (in March 2015) at our pediatric hospital for all patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion for AIS. This pathway was developed with use of the Lean process mapping technique to create an evidence-based protocol for preoperative, operative, postoperative, and post-discharge care. The 44 patients managed prior to implementation of the pathway (pre-pathway group) were compared with the 169 patients managed after implementation (post-pathway group). The post-pathway group was divided into 5 cohorts, each representing a 6-month time period. Clinical outcomes (pain scores, medication requirements, transfusions) and efficiency metrics (length of stay) were used to determine pathway sustainability.

Results

The pre-pathway group included patients managed in the 8 months prior to implementation (July 2014 to February 2015) and the post-pathway group included patients who underwent surgery from March 2015 to July 2017, divided into 5 cohorts representing 6 months each. Patients in the post-pathway group had lower postoperative pain scores, and used significantly less opioids at each time interval, compared with the pre-pathway group. Perioperative transfusion requirements and postoperative length of stay were significantly lower across all post-pathway cohorts compared with the pre-pathway group. There were no significant differences in clinical results among the 5 post-pathway cohorts.

Conclusions

Implementation of a standardized care pathway developed with use of Lean process mapping demonstrated effective and sustained improvements to the care of patients with AIS, as well as decreased postoperative length of stay. These outcomes have been maintained over 2.5 years, indicating that high-quality care for patients with AIS undergoing spinal fusion can be achieved and sustained with use of a standardized care pathway.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^112hMrFt]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Neurosurgery — spinal cord exposures (laminectomy, laminoplasty) list potential late effects of scoliosis/kyphosis, and periodic evaluation specifies a physical exam of the back/spine yearly until growth completed, with more frequent assessment during puberty or if a curve is detected. Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include spine films in patients with clinically apparent curve and orthopedic consultation as indicated based on physical and/or radiographic exam. Health links note Scoliosis and Kyphosis, and the listing indicates SYSTEM = Musculoskeletal with SCORE = 1. Additional information advises considering risk factors, including young age, cancer/treatment factors such as radiation to the spine, increasing number of laminae removed (especially > 3 laminae removed), facetectomy, laminectomy (versus laminoplasty), laminectomy without fusion, increasing number of resections, surgery of thoracolumbar junction, and preoperative deformity.

### The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia recommendations for the use of opioids in children during the perioperative period [^114rHKeu]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

8.4 Use of continuous infusion simultaneous with PCA

Randomized controlled trials that have compared continuous opioid infusion with PCA to PCA alone have suggested that the addition of continuous infusion may have many possible effects on the overall impact of PCA therapy. Comparative studies of 6‐12 year olds postappendectomy 65, 66; 5‐20 year olds postelective spinal fusion for scoliosis 67; school‐age children postlower extremity orthopedic surgery 68; and 6‐15 year olds postappendectomy 69 fail to show an overall improvement in pain scores with the addition of a continuous infusion. There is evidence of an increase in overall opioid usage and an increased level of sedation with continuous infusions. The impact on sleep has been inconsistent. Some data indicate an increase in sleep duration 65, 66 but there has also been documentation of an interruption of normal sleep patterns in a single‐center retrospective audit of 126 children. 70

In terms of the risk of adding continuous infusion to PCA, a meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (including both adult and pediatric patients) indicated that pediatric patients have an overall lower risk of serious adverse events associated with a continuous infusion combined with PCA when compared to the adult population. 71 This finding may be confounded by routine use of continuous respiratory monitoring in the pediatric population. 72 Another meta‐analysis examining randomized controlled studies comparing PCA vs PCA plus background infusion for postoperative children showed no difference in pain scores, opioid consumption, or risk of adverse events at 12 and 24 hours. 73

Recommendation: There is conflicting and insufficient evidence to indicate a difference in overall analgesia, sleep patterns, or adverse events with the addition of continuous opioid infusion to PCA in children. Use of a basal infusion should be individualized based on consideration of the clinical situation, pain severity, and risk factors.

Strength of Evidence: B.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) management — "it is now imperative to adopt evidence based antiemetic combination for prophylaxis, as well as appropriate rescue antiemetics". Although "individual antiemetics differ in their efficacy", it "is not yet clear how this translates to the efficacy of combination prophylaxis". "There are robust PONV risk scores that are accurate for risk stratification at a population level", and clinicians "should be cognizant of additional factors which could modify individuals' PONV risks and management". Pediatric care is highlighted: "PONV management in children should follow algorithmic approach, using evidence-based interventions". A "paradigm shift towards personalized medicine" offers research opportunities, and policies "should include considerations to the socioeconomic and equity aspects of healthcare delivery".

### Perioperative surgical home: evaluation of a new protocol focused on a multidisciplinary approach to manage children undergoing posterior spinal fusion operation [^114XfWAH]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The concept of Perioperative Surgical Home has been gaining significant attention in surgical centers. This model is delivering and improving coordinated care in a cost-effective manner to patients undergoing surgical procedures. It starts with the decision for surgical intervention, continues to the intraoperative and postoperative periods, and follows into long-term recovery. Constant re-evaluation of outcomes and modifications of delivery provides a feedback loop for improvement. Children's Hospital Los Angeles initiated a new protocol in June 2014 to manage children undergoing Posterior Spinal Fusion (PSF) with the goal to improve patient experience and lower the hospital length of stay and cost.

Methods

A retrospective chart review identified patients who underwent a PSF for idiopathic scoliosis before and after initiation of a new treatment protocol designed by a team of anesthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, and physical therapists. The new protocol included preoperative teaching of parents and patients, intraoperative anesthetic and surgical management, and immediate to long-term postoperative medical management. In addition to demographics, we examined length of stay, cost of hospitalization, pain scores on discharge, length of patient-controlled analgesia use, time to first solid food intake, and time to ambulation.

Results

Thirty-six patients were identified preinitiation and postinitiation of the protocol (total n = 72). There was no statistically significant difference in age, sex, use of intrathecal morphine, or estimated blood loss. Patients enrolled in the new protocol had higher American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (P = 0.003), significantly lower duration of patient-controlled analgesia use, time to first solid food intake, and time to ambulation (P = 0.001). The pain scores were higher at the time of discharge, although the difference was not statistically significant. Length of stay was significantly shorter in the new protocol group (P = 0.001), accounting for $292,560 in cost savings for the hospital.

Conclusions

These data show that the cooperation of different teams in designing new management guidelines for patients requiring a PSF can significantly decrease the total length of stay and cost of hospitalization without altering quality of care.

### Bipolar spinal correction reduces transfusion rate and hospital stay compared with traditional posterior spinal fusion in children with scoliosis secondary to cerebral palsy [^112ic9iZ]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Patients with neuromuscular scoliosis due to Cerebral Palsy (CP) are complex due to their curve severity and associated medical comorbidities. Spinal fusion is associated with high risk of peri-operative complications and large blood loss requiring allogenic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. In June 2017, our tertiary paediatric institution implemented a new minimally-invasive approach for the treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis, Bipolar Spinal Correction (Bipolar), a technique first published by Miladi et al. in 2018. This study represents an analysis of the initial experience of this technique to see if it achieves the goal of minimally invasive surgery by decreasing surgical stress in this high-risk population.

Methods

We identified patients with an underlying diagnosis of CP who underwent primary single-day surgical correction for their scoliosis between 2010 and 2024 at a single paediatric institution. Patients either underwent a primary posterior spinal fusion (PSF) or Bipolar surgeries. Revision procedures and patients undergoing anterior spinal surgery were excluded. Patient charts and x-rays were reviewed to collect data on demographics, pre-operative curve severity and peri-operative details.

Results

PSF cohort included 46 patients and Bipolar included 78 patients. Demographic and curve severity data were similar between the groups. Bipolar surgery resulted in shorter operative times than PSF (228 min vs. 270 min) and reduced blood loss based on cell-saver return (113 mL vs. 382 mL) and lowest post-operative Hgb level (99.8 g/L vs. 89.6 g/L). Allogenic RBC transfusion rate was markedly reduced in the Bipolar cohort compared to the PSF cohort both intra-operatively (2.6% vs. 23.9%) and post-operatively (14.1% vs. 23.9%). No patient in the Bipolar cohort required mass transfusion protocol, defined as needing more than 3 units of allogenic RBC, compared with 2 patients in the PSF cohort. Post-operative hospital length-of-stay was reduced in the Bipolar cohort compared to PSF (6.5 days vs. 8 days).

Conclusions

When compared with traditional posterior spinal fusion, Bipolar Spinal Correction resulted in decreased operative times, less surgical blood loss, decreased allogenic transfusion rate, and reduced post-operative hospital length of stay in the treatment of children with CP and scoliosis.

### Intensive care unit versus hospital floor: a comparative study of postoperative management of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^113VNwXT]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were admitted to the intensive care unit until two years ago, at which time we changed our protocol to admit these patients to the general hospital floor following a brief stay in a postanesthesia care unit. This study compared postoperative management on a hospital floor with that in the intensive care unit for patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal fusion.

Methods

A retrospective review of 124 consecutive patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis treated with spinal fusion from August 2007 to August 2010 was performed. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion surgery.

Results

Of 124 patients, sixty-six were managed postoperatively in the intensive care unit and fifty-eight, on the hospital floor. The mean age at the time of surgery was fourteen years. A mean of eleven vertebral levels (range, six to fifteen levels) were fused. No significant difference between the groups was found with respect to the mean age at the time of surgery, mean weight, mean preoperative and postoperative Cobb angles, and mean number of levels fused (p ≥ 0.12). However, the use of analgesic and antianxiety medication, number of postoperative blood tests, days of hospital stay, and number of physical therapy sessions were significantly decreased in the floor group compared with the intensive care unit group (p ≤ 0.05). No patient from the floor group had to be admitted to the intensive care unit. The mean charge was $33,121 for the floor group and $39,252 for the intensive care unit group (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Initial postoperative management of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis following a posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion surgery on a general hospital floor, rather than in an intensive care unit, was associated with a shorter hospital stay, fewer blood tests, less analgesic and antianxiety medication usage, and fewer physical therapy sessions at this high-volume, academic, tertiary-care children's hospital. In addition to improved patient outcomes, there was a significant decrease of 16% in hospital charges for the group that did not go to the intensive care unit.

### Perioperative nutritional optimization in complex pediatric hip and spine surgery: a systematic review [^112vLZwJ]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric orthopaedic surgeries for complex hip and spine conditions, particularly in children with cerebral palsy, are associated with high complication rates. Malnutrition, common in this population, contributes to poor wound healing, infections, and prolonged recovery. Despite its impact, definitions and assessments of malnutrition remain inconsistent. Posterior spinal fusion and hip reconstruction carry complication rates over 50%. While interest in nutritional optimization is growing, no standardized approach exists, especially in pediatric orthopaedic populations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the existing literature on perioperative nutritional assessment and optimization of pediatric patients undergoing complex hip and spine surgery.

Methods

We conducted a PRISMA-compliant systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases in April 2025. Inclusion criteria were studies on patients 21 years or younger undergoing hip or spine surgery that reported perioperative nutritional status or interventions alongside clinical outcomes. Eligible study designs included RCTs, cohort studies, and case series (> 10 patients). Data were independently extracted and study quality assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).

Results

Out of 371 studies, 23 met the inclusion criteria. Eighteen were retrospective cohorts, 1 prospective cohort, 2 cross-sectional, and 2 case-control studies. Fifteen were high quality (NOS ≥ 7). Thirteen studies (57%) examined laboratory-based markers; 10 (43%) assessed nutritional interventions or classifications. Common outcomes included wound complications (48%), respiratory complications (26%), LOS/readmissions (26%), and patient-reported outcomes (17%). Laboratory findings were inconsistent, though transferrin < 200 mg/dL was linked to respiratory risk. BMI-based metrics better predicted complications, especially in those who were underweight or experiencing > 10% weight loss. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols improved LOS, pain, and IL-6 levels, while routine nutrition assessments showed no clear benefit.

Conclusion

While isolated laboratory values are inconsistent predictors, underweight status and weight loss are more reliable indicators of risk. ERAS protocols incorporating nutritional strategies may improve outcomes, although more pediatric-focused data are needed. The lack of standardized malnutrition definitions across studies limits comparability. Future research should establish uniform nutritional screening practices and evaluate specific interventions in high-risk pediatric orthopaedic populations. Despite limitations in study heterogeneity and small sample sizes, this review supports integrating structured perioperative nutrition into care pathways.

### Acute postoperative opioid consumption trajectories and long-term outcomes in pediatric patients after spine surgery [^1146breq]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This study was part of a larger study assessing perioperative pain in children undergoing orthopedic surgery. Ethics approval was obtained prior to the beginning of the study from the Research Ethics Board of McGill University (A08-M71–17B).

Study participants

Patients between the ages of 10 and 18 years with AIS were recruited from the outpatient spine clinic of the Shriners Hospitals for Children-Canada between 2013 and 2018. Prior to the beginning of the study, written informed patients' consents were obtained. In patients under the age of 18, written informed consent was obtained from a parent or legal guardian. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Inclusion criteria included adolescents diagnosed with AIS and scheduled to undergo first time posterior spinal fusion (PSF) surgery with instrumentation. Exclusion criteria included children with neuromuscular scoliosis, children unable to speak, write or read English or French, children diagnosed with intellectual disability that would interfere with understanding of questions being asked and children with major chronic medical conditions (American Society of Anesthesiology status III or higher). Research assistants collected information on demographics, medical history and self-reported questionnaires. A total of 126 patients consented to participate in the study. Prior to surgery, 8 patients were excluded from analysis due to drop out (n = 6) and incomplete baseline questionnaires (n = 2). After surgery, an additional 12 patients were excluded due to drop out (n = 1), surgical complications (n = 5), deviation from the anesthesia protocol (n = 2), incomplete postoperative data (n = 2) and lost to follow-up (n = 2). The final opioid consumption trajectory analysis included 106 study participants. Out of the 106, only 76 patients were analyzed for long-term patient outcomes at 6 months due to loss to follow-up (n = 30). Patients dropped out of the study or were lost to follow-up for one of the following reasons: patients were no longer interested in participating in the study, patients were unable to attend the 6-month follow-up appointment due to distance/difficulty of travel or patients had not yet attended their scheduled follow-up appointment at the time of the data analysis.

Experimental design

Study variables were assessed at different timepoints throughout the perioperative period: baseline (7–10 days before surgery during the standard preoperative consultation at the hospital); postoperative hours (POH) 1 to 120 from the moment the patient left the operating room; and follow-up (6 months after surgery).

### Do antifibrinolytic agents reduce the risk of blood transfusion in children undergoing spinal fusion? a propensity score-matched comparison using a national database [^117M7i1s]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytic (AF) agents in reducing perioperative blood transfusion in pediatric patients undergoing spinal fusion.

Summary Of Background Data

The potential for AF to decrease bleeding and reduce exposure to allogenic transfusions has led to widespread off-label use in a number of major pediatric surgical procedures. Recent reviews call for improving the body of evidence for their effectiveness and safety in pediatric spinal fusion.

Methods

Children undergoing spinal fusion were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric (NSQIP-P) 2016 and 2017 databases. Univariate analyses of patient and perioperative characteristics informed the creation of a propensity score model predicting treatment with AF, followed by 1:1 matching to allow comparison of allogenic red blood cell transfusion rates and secondary outcomes between treated and untreated patients.

Results

Of 6626 total patients, 5434 (81%) received AF and 1533 (23%) received a blood transfusion. Analysis of data for 1192 propensity score-matched pairs revealed that treatment with AF was associated with a statistically nonsignificant 16% reduction in perioperative transfusion (OR 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.68–1.05, P = 0.119) and a statistically significant 43% reduction in postoperative transfusion (OR 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.39–0.81, P = 0.002). No differences in the incidences of postoperative seizure or thrombosis were observed, with overall rates of 7.5 and 22.5 events per 10,000 patients, respectively.

Conclusion

AF agents appear to reduce postoperative allogenic transfusion in children undergoing spinal fusion surgery. Adverse drug effects such as thromboembolic complications and seizure were extremely rare and warrant continued monitoring, though this is the largest study to date providing evidence for the safety profile of these drugs.

### Treatment of severe pediatric spinal deformities [^114Lcsj6]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2014). Low credibility.

The management of severe pediatric spinal deformities continues to evolve as advances in spinal instrumentation, surgical techniques, and neuromonitoring occur. The techniques of spinal osteotomies have been refined to allow surgeons to perform better corrections with less operative time, more safely, and through a posterior approach alone, making multiple patient positioning changes during surgery a less common occurrence. With these techniques comes a learning curve for the entire surgical team, wherein communication and planning can help minimize major complications and morbidity. This overview will review various techniques used in the correction of severe spinal deformities. Topics reviewed include the role of anterior release, traction, posterior releases, and osteotomies. Indications, techniques, and pitfalls will be reviewed. A clear understanding of the patient's deformity, normal sagittal parameters, spinal anatomy, and the principles of neuromonitoring will help improve surgical planning and patient outcome.

### Management of postoperative pain: a clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists' committee on regional anesthesia, executive committee, and administrative council [^113xsKYj]. The Journal of Pain (2016). Medium credibility.

Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (i.v. PCA) — adults and pediatrics — is endorsed for appropriately selected patients; the panel recommends the use of i.v. PCA, and i.v. PCA is recommended over health care provider–initiated intermittent bolus dosing of opioids in adults. Administration by proxy should be avoided in adults, particularly when patients are sleeping, although limited evidence suggests safe use in children, and developmentally appropriate children as young as 6 years are able to use i.v. PCA appropriately. Boluses of opioids might be considered in the immediate (first several hours) postoperative period for more rapid pain relief and analgesic titration, and in patients with postoperative sedation who are closely monitored.

### Complications in ambulatory pediatric patients with nonidiopathic spinal deformity undergoing fusion to the pelvis using the sacral-alar-iliac technique within 2 years of surgery [^112AVLkV]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Significant investigation in the adult population has generated a body of research regarding proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) and proximal junctional failure (PJF) following long fusions to the sacrum and pelvis. However, much less is known regarding early complications, including PJK and PJF, in the ambulatory pediatric patient. As such, the objective of this study was to address the minimal literature on early complications after ambulatory pediatric patients underwent fusion to the sacrum with instrumentation to the pelvis in the era of sacral-alar-iliac (S2AI) instrumentation.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective review of pediatric patients with nonidiopathic spinal deformity < 18 years of age with ambulatory capacity who underwent fusion to the pelvis at a multisurgeon pediatric academic spine practice from 2016 to 2018. All surgeries were posterior-only approaches with S2AI screws as the primary technique for sacropelvic fixation. Descriptive, outcome, and radiographic data were obtained. The definition of PJF included symptomatic PJK presenting as fracture, screw pullout, or disruption of the posterior osseoligamentous complex.

Results

Twenty-five patients were included in this study. Nine patients (36.0%) had 15 complications for an overall complication rate of 60.0%. Unplanned return to the operating room occurred 8 times in 6 patients (24.0%). Four patients (16.0%) had wound issues (3 with deep wound infection and 1 with wound breakdown) requiring reoperation. Three patients (12.0%) had PJF, all requiring reoperation. A 16-year-old female patient with syndromic scoliosis underwent extension of fusion due to posterior tension band failure at 6 months. A 17-year-old male patient with neuromuscular scoliosis underwent extension of fusion due to proximal screw pullout at 5 months. A 10-year-old female patient with congenital scoliosis underwent extension for PJF at 5 months following posterior tension band failure. One patient had pseudarthrosis requiring reoperation 20 months postoperatively.

Conclusions

Fixation to the pelvis enables significant deformity correction, but with rather high rates of complications and unexpected returns to the operating room. Considerations of sagittal plane dynamics for PJK and PJF should be strongly analyzed when performing fixation to the pelvis in ambulatory pediatric patients.

Patient subpopulations — pediatric patients — Aggressive and proactive pain management is necessary to overcome the historic undertreatment of pain in children, and perioperative care for children undergoing painful procedures or surgery requires developmentally appropriate pain assessment and therapy. Analgesic therapy should depend upon age, weight, and comorbidity and, unless contraindicated, should involve a multimodal approach; behavioral techniques should be applied whenever feasible; sedative, analgesic, and local anesthetics are all important components of appropriate analgesic regimens; and because many analgesic medications are synergistic with sedating agents, it is imperative that appropriate monitoring be used during the procedure and recovery.

### New concepts in acute and extended postoperative pain management in children [^113mCpQd]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Increased knowledge of the pathophysiology of pain in children and an improved understanding of the pharmacology and pharmacodynamics of multiple agents have provided the clinician with a wide variety of tools to treat postoperative pain in children. The interest in a multimodal approach is kindled by the realization that the combination of a number of therapies can enhance analgesia with fewer untoward side effects. The expertise of other health care professionals should be tapped to open new avenues of treatment. Many therapies still require critical evidence-based evaluations to assess how well they work in larger patient populations. Dedication to research, compassionate patient care, and a willingness to teach the next generation of clinicians will bring us closer to the goal of safe and pain-free surgery.

### Acute postoperative opioid consumption trajectories and long-term outcomes in pediatric patients after spine surgery [^114v7H1K]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Opioids are the mainstay method of pain management in the acute postoperative period. The problem with this practice is 2-fold: (1) opioid-induced adverse events such as respiratory depression are serious and life-threatening, and (2) acute opioid exposure after surgery increases the risk of chronic opioid use. With over 300,000 children and adolescents undergoing surgery in Canada and the United states each year, postoperative opioid exposure is a prevalent issue.

The days following surgery are a critical period where the progression of opioid consumption has the potential to influence long-term outcomes. Most studies examining the acute postoperative period in the pediatric population focused on total opioid consumption over the in-hospital period.–However, these studies omitted to report consideration of the evolution of opioid intake over time. Recently, Kwan et alreported opioid intake at 12–24 hr intervals for up to 2 weeks after surgery in a cohort of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients. While opioid consumption was considered in relation to time, variability existed in the mean analgesic intake at each timepoint, suggesting heterogeneity of the study population and the presence of multiple subgroups.

Recently trajectory analysis has emerged as a method to capture longitudinal change of a variable over time. Given that populations are not homogenous, latent subgroups with unique opioid consumption trajectories may be elucidated using this method. Highlighting the practical application of trajectory analysis, Pagé et alidentified 4 pain trajectories in the acute postoperative period in adults after total hip arthroplasty. Importantly, preoperative variables such as pain and anxiety predicted pain trajectory membership. Pain trajectories were in turn associated with long-term outcomes such as pain and functional disability. Recently, Pagé et alidentified 4 pain trajectories and 4 in-hospital opioid consumption trajectories among patients undergoing hepatic resection. Trajectory membership in this case did not predict chronic postsurgical pain at 6 months but predicted patients' levels of pain catastrophizing at follow-up.

To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been done to examine opioid consumption trajectories in the acute postoperative period in the pediatric patient population. Therefore, the aims of this study were to (1) identify opioid consumption trajectories in the acute postoperative period, (2) identify predictors of opioid consumption trajectories and (3) identify associations between trajectory membership and long-term patient outcomes in a cohort of AIS patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery.

### Adverse impact of diabetes on spine fusion and patient-reported outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116bKYry]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence that patients with diabetes, as compared with those without, have a higher risk of developing lumbar pseudarthrosis following spinal fusion surgery. Analyses of patient-reported outcomes showed that patients with diabetes experience higher postoperative pain and functional disability. Diabetes is a relevant risk factor to consider in the perioperative management and follow-up of patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery.

Key Points

Diabetes significantly increases the risk of pseudarthrosis following lumbar spinal fusion surgery.
Postoperative pain and disability are worse in patients with spinal fusion and diabetes. Our findings underscore the importance of optimized pain management and rehabilitation strategies in the diabetic population.
Diabetes status is an important patient characteristic to evaluate and account for risk stratification, surgical planning, and follow-up care for spinal fusion. The recognition of diabetes as a risk factor can help improve outcomes in vulnerable patients.

Results

Study selection

The 3 updated database searches yielded 4871 unique total records. After automated removal duplicates in Covidence, 3460 records were identified for the selection process. After title and abstract screening, 185 articles were retrieved and assessed for full-text review, 13 of which were included from the original 2017 publication. On initial full-text review from the updated search and the original n = 13 articles, 31 articles met inclusion criteria. However, of these articles, 16 were then removed for the following reasons after further assessment: cohort described in multiple articles (n = 12), article already identified in initial review search (n = 2), indirect effect on chronic pain outcomes (n = 1), and age range out of bounds (n = 1).

In total, 15 studies were included in this review update, including 2 studies from the original 2017 publication. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram, depicting the selection process, is shown in figure 1.

### Continuous infusion of bupivacaine reduces postoperative morphine use in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis after posterior spine fusion [^1135A1ci]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis.

Objective

To determine if an infusion of bupivacaine will reduce the need for intravenous opioids following posterior spine fusion.

Summary Of Background Data

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is estimated to occur with a frequency of 1% to 3% among the at-risk age group of 10 to 18 years. A small percentage of these patients will require surgical intervention. Data are limited regarding continuous infusion of local anesthetic after posterior spine fusion for pain control. METHODS.: Retrospective review of children 10 to 18 years with idiopathic scoliosis admitted to a tertiary care, 20-bed pediatric intensive care unit (P pediatric intensive care unit), following posterior spine fusion. The primary outcome was postoperative opioid use stratified by the presence of a catheter for continuous bupivacaine. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, side effect management, depth of catheter placement, and fluid resuscitation.

Results

Two hundred and forty-four children were eligible, 129 received a catheter for continuous bupivacaine, 115 did not. There were no differences in demographics. Significantly fewer patients receiving bupivacaine required a continuous basal infusion of morphine (32.6% vs. 85.2%, P < 0.001) resulting in an overall reduction opioid use on postoperative day 1 (18.9 vs. 26.4 mg, P < 0.001). Overall, pain scores were low in both groups. Limiting the analysis to only those with a bupivacaine catheter, the depth of catheter placement did not impact postoperative opioid use (P > 0.15).

Conclusion

The use of a continuous infusion of bupivacaine provided good analgesia with low pain scores. The significant reduction in basal morphine use may reflect a replacement by bupivacaine, although this is limited by potential treatment bias. Multivariate analysis was required to control for ongoing changes in anesthesia practice over the many years of the study. The optimal depth of catheter placement is unclear from this analysis and should be studied prospectively.

### Surgical sagittal correction of symptomatic sweeping thoracolumbar lordosis in an adolescent with congenital kyphoscoliosis [^113z8SAF]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Participation in collision sports after long spinal fusions carries inherent risks, including increased susceptibility to implant fatigue, pseudarthrosis, and adjacent segment disease. Despite these risks, studies have demonstrated that carefully selected athletes can safely return to high-impact sports after thorough rehabilitation and medical clearance. For this patient, shared decision making included a review of these risks versus the notable benefits to his quality of life, with the understanding that long-term surveillance would be necessary.

While these cases demonstrate uses of posterior spinal fusion and osteotomies to improve spinal alignment in patients with lordotic spinal deformity, our case remains unique because the patient's thoracolumbar lordotic deformity was driven by congenital thoracic kyphoscoliosis. We believe that this case sheds light on the importance of considering the deleterious effects of abnormal sagittal spinal alignment, even in the face of a moderate, stable, or nonprogressive congenital deformity in isolation. While nonsurgical management is often safely and appropriately pursued in these cases, spinal balance in association with symptoms and function should not be ignored. Thus, we share a case in which symptomatic sagittal spinal deformity is the primary surgical indication in an adolescent patient. Although correction with posterior spinal instrumented fusion is not without risks, it remains a powerful means to treat pain and deformity associated with thoracic congenital kyphoscoliosis and associated sagittal plane deformities. Shared decision making with the patient, family, and surgeon is important, with a thorough review of the goals, risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery.

### Perioperative management in children with chronic pain [^113Khvrw]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Children with chronic pain often undergo surgery and effective perioperative management of their pain can be challenging. Identification of the pediatric chronic pain patient preoperatively and development of a perioperative pain plan may help ensure a safer and more comfortable perioperative course. Successful management usually requires multiple different classes of analgesics, regional anesthesia, and adjunctive nonpharmacological therapies. Neuropathic and oncological pain can be especially difficult to treat and usually requires an individualized approach.

### Pregabalin and persistent postoperative pain following posterior spinal fusion in children and adolescents: a randomized clinical trial [^1147yRY5]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical correction of spinal deformity requires major surgical intervention with extensive manipulation of the spine and neural elements. Persistent postoperative pain affects patient quality of life and can also cause financial burden for patient families and for society. We aimed to investigate the effect of perioperative pregabalin on the incidence of persistent pain following instrumented spinal fusion.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled single-center clinical trial. Adolescents and children 10 to 21 years old with a spinal deformity who were scheduled for pedicle screw instrumentation and fusion were randomized into either the pregabalin or placebo group. Patients received 2 mg/kg of pregabalin or a placebo twice daily preoperatively and for 5 days postoperatively. The duration of follow-up was 2 years. The primary outcomes were cumulative opioid consumption during the first 48 hours postoperatively and the incidence of persistent postoperative pain over the course of the 2-year follow-up.

Results

Sixty-four of 77 eligible patients were enrolled in the study, with all patients completing the 2-year follow-up. Thirty-three patients were randomized into the pregabalin group and 31 into the placebo group. There was no significant difference in cumulative 48-hour opioid consumption between the study groups. The Scoliosis Research Society 24-Item Questionnaire pain domain score improved significantly, from a mean value of 3.8 in both groups to 4.3 in the pregabalin and 4.0 in the placebo group at 2 years postoperatively, with no differences between the study groups at any time point (p = 0.317). The Scoliosis Research Society total scores of the study groups were similar (p = 0.678). Back pain, as measured with use of a visual analogue scale, improved significantly (p = 0.001) with no significant differences at any time point (preoperatively and 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively).

Conclusions

Perioperative pregabalin does not reduce postoperative opioid consumption or the incidence of persistent postoperative pain following instrumented posterior spinal fusion for spinal deformities in an adolescent population.

### Bone grafting and biologics for spinal fusion in the pediatric population: current understanding and future perspective [^116HusNW]. Neurosurgical Focus (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric spinal fusions have been associated with nonunion rates of approximately 25%, putting patients at risk for neurological complications while simultaneously incurring significant costs for revision surgery. In an effort to decrease nonunion rates, various bone grafts and biologics have been developed to increase osseous formation and arthrosis. The current gold-standard bone graft is autologous bone taken from the iliac crest or ribs, but this procedure is associated with significant morbidity and postoperative pain due to an additional graft harvesting procedure. Other bone graft substitutes and biologics include allografts, demineralized bone matrix, bone morphogenetic protein, and bioactive glass. Ultimately, these substitutes have been studied more extensively in the adult population, and there is a paucity of strong evidence for the use of these agents within the pediatric population. In this review, the authors will discuss in detail the characteristics of the various bone graft substitutes, their fusion efficacy, and their safety profile in this subpopulation.

Surgical site infections — risk factors and antibiotic prophylaxis for complex spine surgery. Risk factors for surgical site infection include prolonged preoperative hospitalization, diabetes, elevated serum glucose (≥ 125 mg/dL preoperatively or ≥ 200 mg/dL postoperatively), smoking, alcohol abuse, previous surgical site infection, and obesity. Specific procedure-related risk factors include surgery duration > 2 to 5 hours, blood loss > 1 L, staged procedures, multilevel fusions, screw/plate placement, and combined anterior-posterior fusion. General considerations include optimal timing of administration for different antibiotics (eg, vancomycin infusion should be started as early as 120 min before the surgical incision). Intravenous antibiotics should be administered within 60 minutes before surgical incision, followed by appropriate redosing during surgery (Class I, Level of Evidence A). The recommended antibiotic regimen is cefazolin (2 or 3 g for those > 120 kg) or an equivalent first-generation cephalosporin; if there is evidence that gram-negative organisms are the cause of surgical site infection, consider combining clindamycin or vancomycin with another agent, for example, cefazolin for those not beta-lactam allergic or aztreonam/gentamicin/single-dose fluoroquinolone for those beta-lactam allergic (Class I, Level of Evidence A).

### Pain control in pediatric posterior spine fusion patients… [^114p1nZo]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

There is no significant difference in pain control when adding gabapentin to a multimodal pain management protocol in pediatric post-operative posterior spinal fusion patients.
- There is no significant difference in the amount of opioid medication required for pain control in pediatric post-operative posterior spinal fusion patients. In the post-operative period, nursing staff assessed patient pain using the VAS at 4-hour intervals from 06: 00 until 22: 00 for the duration of hospitalization for a minimum of 4 daily scores recorded per patient. After the third post-operative day, but before discharge, the parent or guardian of each subject was asked to complete an IRB-approved survey to measure parent demographics and parental satisfaction with the patient's hospitalization and pain control. Intra-operative IV propofol and IV hydromorphone were titrated to desired effect.

In the post-operative period, gabapentin was administered to the experimental group at 10mg/kg PO q8h, beginning at Phase II and continued through postoperative day four. The control group received equivalent volume doses of placebo at the same intervals. Post-operative medication was administered according to the following protocol for both groups: ketorolac continued at 0. 5mg/kg up to 15mg IV q6h for 12 total doses. Once ketorolac doses were complete, the patient may have received Ibuprofen 10mg/kg up to 600mg PO as needed. Hydromorphone was given through patient-controlled analgesia at a basal dose of 0. 002mg/kg/hr for 24 hours and demand dose of
0. 004mg/kg with an 8-minute lockout. Once basal PCA was discontinued, administration of oxycodone 0. 1–0. 2mg/kg PO up to 15mg PO q4h as needed supplemented the PCA demand dose. Acetaminophen 12. 5mg/kg up to 650mg PO q6h hours was administered after the IV was removed. All patients received one Senokot-S tablet and Miralax 0.

8 g/kg up to 17g daily for bowel regimen. For the entire hospitalization, nursing staff monitored vital signs and assessed sedation using the standardized Pasero Opioid-induced Sedation Scale protocols at 4-hour intervals. 16 Any POSS score of 3 or greater resulted in more frequent monitoring of respiratory status and sedation level, decreased opioid dosing, and administration of naloxone as needed.

### Rapid recovery pathway after spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis… [^1145THdK]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is associated with significant pain and prolonged hospitalization. There is evidence that early mobilization and multimodal analgesia can accelerate functional recovery and reduced length of stay. Using these principles, we implemented a quality improvement initiative to enable earlier functional recovery in our AIS–PSF population. We designed and implemented a standardized rapid recovery pathway with evidence-based management recommendations for children aged 10 to 21 years undergoing PSF for AIS. Our primary outcome, functional recovery, was assessed using statistical process control charts for LOS and average daily pain scores. Our process measures were medication adherence and order set utilization. The balancing measure was 30-day readmission rate.

We included 322 patients from January 1, 2011 to June 30, 2015 with 134 serving as historical controls, 104 representing our transition population, and 84 serving as our RRP population. Baseline average LOS was 5. 7 days and decreased to 4 days after RRP implementation. Average daily pain scores remained stable with improvement on postoperative day 0 and 1 after RRP implementation. In the second quarter of 2015, gabapentin and ketorolac use became routine and order set utilization was 100%. Readmission rates did not increase as a result of this pathway. Implementation of a standardized RRP with multimodal pain management and early mobilization strategies resulted in reduced LOS without an increase in reported pain scores or readmissions.
