## Question

What is the role of hydroxychloroquine in preventing SLE flares and reducing disease activity?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of hydroxychloroquine in preventing SLE flares and reducing disease activity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality guideline positions to anchor the strength of recommendation. Then, I should verify the magnitude of benefit from randomized and quasi-experimental data. Next, I will examine dose–response and therapeutic drug monitoring considerations. After that, I need to check special populations and safety trade-offs. Finally, I will integrate this into practical, treat-to-target recommendations and note any controversies or gaps that might change practice in the future.

> Let me first confirm the guideline foundation, because I need to ensure we are not overinterpreting lower-level evidence. Contemporary guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology and EULAR uniformly recommend hydroxychloroquine for essentially all patients with SLE unless contraindicated, emphasizing its role in reducing flares, preventing organ damage, and improving survival, with conditional support for indefinite continuation even in remission, which signals a strong, evidence-based consensus for maintenance therapy [^111Ax6n6] [^111Ax6n6] [^116gw8dg].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit rather than assume it is large just because guidelines endorse it. The Canadian randomized withdrawal trial showed that stopping hydroxychloroquine doubled the risk of flares compared with continuation, with a hazard ratio around 2.5, and this has been repeatedly cited as pivotal evidence for maintenance therapy in SLE, including in nephrology guidelines, which strengthens the causal inference despite the modest sample size [^116P3HBs] [^116P3HBs]. Observational cohorts consistently associate hydroxychloroquine use with fewer flares and lower disease activity, with meta-analytic and cohort estimates suggesting roughly a 30–60% reduction in flare risk depending on adherence and dose, which aligns with clinical experience and supports routine use as background therapy [^114cmXEL] [^1124SekS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose without checking the dose–response signal. I initially thought the 5 mg/kg/day cap might be the optimal therapeutic dose, but wait, I should double-check whether lower dosing increases flares. A high-quality case-crossover analysis found that dosing at or below 5 mg/kg/day was associated with higher flare risk, with an apparent threshold near 5 mg/kg/day, implying that many patients may need more than 5 mg/kg/day to maintain control, albeit with a trade-off in retinal toxicity risk that must be managed carefully [^111Ax6n6]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: guidelines still advise a long-term average of 5 mg/kg/day to minimize retinopathy, but allow short-term higher dosing up to about 6.5 mg/kg/day when needed for disease control, which fits the observed dose–response and safety profile [^111Ax6n6] [^115oocWc].

> I need to check whether therapeutic drug monitoring refines this further. Several cohorts and a meta-analysis suggest that maintaining whole-blood hydroxychloroquine levels above about 750–1000 ng/mL is associated with substantially lower odds of active disease and fewer flares, and that low levels correlate with nonadherence and worse outcomes, supporting periodic level checks when control is suboptimal or adherence is uncertain [^112Tza6S] [^115sg8d3]. But wait, I should verify whether level-guided dose adjustments reduce flares in trials; the PLUS randomized study did not show a reduction in flares with level-adjusted dosing over a short follow-up, likely confounded by spontaneous adherence improvements, so I should be cautious not to overstate causality from observational level data despite their consistency [^113MnrGB].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts where the net benefit remains favorable. In pregnancy, hydroxychloroquine reduces disease activity and is associated with better maternal and fetal outcomes, including fewer flares and less preterm birth, so continuation is generally recommended unless contraindicated, which reinforces its foundational role across the disease course [^1134XGEg] [^113XSVH9]. In lupus nephritis, both rheumatology and nephrology guidelines recommend hydroxychloroquine for all patients given reductions in renal flares and improved long-term outcomes, again reflecting broad, cross-domain benefit even when organ-threatening disease prompts additional immunosuppression [^116EJfeF] [^113XSVH9].

> I should confirm the safety trade-offs and monitoring, because benefit must be balanced with toxicity. Retinopathy risk is dose- and duration-dependent and rises meaningfully after 5 years, so baseline and then annual retinal screening is advised, with dose reduction if toxicity risk factors emerge or if levels are supratherapeutic, while recognizing that underdosing increases flares and that abrupt discontinuation can precipitate rebounds, so tapering should be slow and deliberate when contemplated [^114cmXEL] [^113XSVH9]. Let me verify that real-world discontinuation is common and risky: large cohorts show that tapering or stopping hydroxychloroquine increases flare rates and therapy augmentation, especially in younger patients, non-White populations, and those with active disease, which argues for maintaining therapy whenever feasible and addressing adherence proactively [^114cP8Kn] [^111WkH7h].

> I will now examine how this integrates with treat-to-target strategies and glucocorticoid withdrawal, since hydroxychloroquine is often the anchor during steroid tapering. Multiple retrospective cohorts indicate that hydroxychloroquine maintenance, along with achieving remission or low disease activity and using a slow prednisone taper over more than 6 months, markedly reduces flares during and after glucocorticoid withdrawal, supporting its continued use as a steroid-sparing backbone in treat-to-target care plans [^114jivKr] [^112RQR9j]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies beyond highly selected patients; the cohorts included patients with moderate to severe disease and still showed benefit, which strengthens external validity for routine practice [^114jivKr].

> But wait, what if we are overgeneralizing from predominantly adult cohorts; I need to check pediatric data. Pediatric SLE cohorts and pharmacokinetic studies suggest that weight-based dosing may underexpose some children, and low hydroxychloroquine levels correlate with increased flares, so clinicians should consider adherence support and, in select cases, level-guided adjustments to ensure therapeutic exposure while monitoring growth and ocular safety in children [^113Pw818]. I should confirm that this aligns with adult guidance; yes, the same principles of maintaining therapeutic levels and minimizing toxicity apply, with pediatric-specific PK nuances guiding dose individualization when control is suboptimal [^113Pw818].

> Let me synthesize the practical role so I don't miss anything critical. Hydroxychloroquine is the foundational, first-line therapy for essentially all patients with SLE because it reduces flares by roughly 30–60% depending on adherence and dose, lowers disease activity across organ systems, prevents organ damage accrual, improves survival, and facilitates glucocorticoid withdrawal when combined with treat-to-target strategies, with the caveat that many patients may require short-term dosing above 5 mg/kg/day to maintain control and that periodic level checks can help distinguish nonadherence from underdosing when response is inadequate [^112Y8QX7] [^1154sACr] [^115sg8d3]. I should double-check that this conclusion matches the totality of evidence: yes, converging randomized, quasi-experimental, and high-quality observational data, alongside unanimous guideline endorsement, support this integrated, dose-optimized, adherence-aware approach to hydroxychloroquine as the anchor of SLE care [^112Y8QX7] [^116gw8dg] [^112KtaWP].

---

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the **cornerstone therapy** for SLE because it reduces flares, lowers disease activity, and prevents organ damage [^112KtaWP] [^113XSVH9]. HCQ reduces flares by about 50–60% and is recommended for all patients unless contraindicated [^114cmXEL] [^112Y8QX7]. It also reduces mortality, thrombosis, and infection risk, and is safe in pregnancy [^1124SekS] [^113XSVH9] [^1134XGEg]. Dosing at 5 mg/kg/day balances efficacy and retinopathy risk; **therapeutic drug monitoring** can help maintain levels ≥ 750 ng/mL to optimize outcomes and detect nonadherence [^111Ax6n6] [^112Tza6S] [^115sg8d3]. HCQ should be continued long term, even in remission, unless toxicity occurs [^111Ax6n6] [^115oocWc].

---

## Mechanisms of action relevant to SLE

HCQ exerts **immunomodulatory effects** that reduce SLE activity:

- **Toll-like receptor inhibition**: HCQ inhibits TLR7/9 signaling, reducing innate immune activation and autoantibody production [^117DxjVh].
- **Antigen presentation**: HCQ alters antigen processing, decreasing T cell activation and autoimmunity [^114cmXEL].
- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: HCQ reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) and oxidative stress [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence for HCQ in SLE

### Prevention of flares

- **Canadian Hydroxychloroquine Study**: Stopping HCQ increased flare risk 2.5-fold (HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.08–5.58) [^113XSVH9].
- **Meta-analysis**: HCQ reduces flares by 57% and disease activity by 32% [^114cmXEL].
- **Case-crossover study**: Doses ≤ 5 mg/kg/day increase flare risk, with a threshold near 5 mg/kg/day [^1154sACr].

---

### Reduction of disease activity

HCQ lowers disease activity across domains, including **cutaneous, musculoskeletal, and hematologic** manifestations [^112Sxet4] [^117DxjVh]. It also reduces **SLEDAI scores** and improves quality of life [^115sg8d3].

---

### Organ damage prevention

HCQ reduces **organ damage accrual**, including renal, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal damage [^113eoW9q] [^113XSVH9]. It also lowers **cardiovascular events** and thrombosis risk, including in antiphospholipid antibody-positive patients [^113qL4DJ] [^113XSVH9].

---

### Mortality benefit

HCQ is associated with a **significant reduction in mortality** (OR 0.128, 95% CI 0.054–0.301) [^117CM4RS].

---

## Safety profile and monitoring

- **Retinopathy**: Risk is dose- and duration-dependent; keep ≤ 5 mg/kg/day and monitor annually after 5 years [^115rRyxc] [^111Ax6n6].
- **Other adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal upset, rash, myopathy, and rare QT prolongation; overall well tolerated [^115rRyxc].
- **Pregnancy**: Safe and recommended; reduces flares and improves outcomes [^1134XGEg] [^113XSVH9].

---

## Dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring

- **Standard dosing**: 5 mg/kg/day actual body weight balances efficacy and toxicity [^116gw8dg] [^111Ax6n6].
- **Therapeutic levels**: Maintaining whole-blood HCQ ≥ 750 ng/mL is associated with fewer flares and lower disease activity [^112Tza6S] [^115sg8d3].
- **Individualized dosing**: Adjust for adherence, body composition, and pharmacokinetics [^116HGNxD] [^116zaMuX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ACR 2025 | - HCQ for all SLE patients unless contraindicated <br/> - Continue indefinitely even in remission <br/> - Target ≤ 5 mg/kg/day long term [^112Y8QX7] [^111Ax6n6] [^115oocWc] |
| EULAR 2023 | - Initiate HCQ in all patients <br/> - Individualize dose to flare risk and retinal toxicity [^116gw8dg] |
| KDIGO 2022 | - HCQ for SLE, including LN, unless contraindicated <br/> - Benefits include fewer flares, less damage, and improved survival [^113XSVH9] |

---

## Limitations and controversies

Evidence quality is largely from observational studies; **RCTs are limited** [^113MnrGB]. Retinopathy risk rises with prolonged use, necessitating **careful monitoring** [^115rRyxc]. Adherence is often suboptimal, contributing to subtherapeutic levels and flares [^112YwFdT].

---

## Practical clinical implications

- **Initiation**: Start HCQ in all SLE patients unless contraindicated [^112Y8QX7] [^116gw8dg].
- **Maintenance**: Continue long term, even in remission, unless toxicity occurs [^111Ax6n6] [^115oocWc].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess adherence, disease activity, and retinal health; consider therapeutic drug monitoring to maintain therapeutic levels [^115sg8d3] [^112Tza6S].
- **Dose adjustment**: Modify dose based on body weight, adherence, and clinical response [^111Ax6n6] [^116zaMuX].

---

Hydroxychloroquine is **essential SLE therapy** that reduces flares, lowers disease activity, prevents organ damage, and improves survival. It is safe, including in pregnancy, and should be continued long term with appropriate monitoring and dose optimization [^112KtaWP] [^113XSVH9].

### Reference range of hydroxychloroquine blood levels that can reduce odds of active lupus and prevent flares [^112Tza6S]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Recent data show that lower hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) doses are associated with a two- to six-fold higher risk of lupus flares. Thus, establishing an effective reference range of HCQ blood levels with upper and lower bounds for efficacy may support individualizing HCQ dosing to prevent flares.

Methods

HCQ levels in whole blood and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) were measured during the baseline visit and again during a standard of care routine follow-up visit. Active cross-sectional lupus at baseline was defined as SLEDAI ≥ 6; a within subject flare was defined as a subsequent three-point increase in SLEDAI with clinical symptoms requiring therapy change. We examined associations between active lupus and HCQ blood levels at baseline and flares and HCQ levels during 6 to 12-month routine lupus follow-up visits using mixed regression analysis.

Results

Among 158 baseline patient visits, 19% had active lupus. Odds of active lupus were 71% lower in patients with levels within a 750 to 1,200 ng/mL range (adjusted odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.08–0.96). Using convenience sampling strategy during a pandemic, we longitudinally followed 42 patients. Among those patients, 17% flared during their follow-up visit. Maintaining HCQ levels within 750 to 1,200 ng/mL reduced the odds of a flare by 26% over a nine-month median follow-up.

Conclusion

An effective reference range of HCQ blood levels, 750 to 1,200 ng/mL, was associated with 71% lower odds of active lupus, and maintaining levels within this range reduced odds of flares by 26%. These findings could guide clinicians to individualize HCQ doses to maintain HCQ levels within this range to maximize efficacy.

Significance — initial and standard therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Hydroxychloroquine should be standard therapy for all people with SLE unless contraindicated, glucocorticoids should be used primarily for initial control of immune-mediated inflammation and during flares as needed, with tapering as soon as possible, and early introduction of immunosuppressive therapies (conventional and/or biologic) for ongoing SLE activity is encouraged to achieve control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduction in SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimization of glucocorticoid-related toxicities.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^114oLyiw]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the treatment and management of non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); treatment and management of lupus nephritis are addressed in a separate guideline.

Methods

Clinical questions for treatment and management of SLE were developed in the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). Systematic literature reviews were developed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess evidence quality and formulate recommendations. The Voting Panel achieved a consensus of ≥ 70% agreement on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation.

Results

We present recommendations and ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the treatment and management of SLE that are applicable to pediatric and adult patients. Recommendations emphasize uniform treatment with hydroxychloroquine, limiting duration of glucocorticoid use, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve and maintain control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize medication-related toxicities.

Conclusion

This guideline presents direction regarding treatment and management of SLE and provides a foundation for well-informed, shared clinician-patient decision-making. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each person with SLE.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^114cmXEL]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology, characterised by bouts of immune-mediated inflammation and tissue injury. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the main drug used to treat lupus; HCQ has been shown to reduce flaresand confer a protective effect on survival. Additionally, HCQ use is associated with reduced frequency and severity of organ damage. Recent data show that HCQ reduces SLE flares by 57% and disease activity by 32%.HCQ is classified as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug due to its ability to alter 'antigen-processing' by antigen-presenting cells. This is thought to decrease SLE activity at a molecular level and has direct anti-inflammatory effects.

HCQ is generally a well-tolerated drug. That said, HCQ use is linked to a number of adverse effects, which may be broadly classified by severity. While more common, gastrointestinal distress, aquagenic pruritus and other dermatological complaints rarely necessitate discontinuation of treatment. On the other hand, retinal, neuromuscular and cardiac effects usually dictate withdrawal and are occasionally irreversible.

### Hydroxychloroquine is associated with lower platelet activity and improved vascular health in systemic lupus erythematosus [^112RQpWb]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune disease characterised by a wide array of symptoms that can affect virtually all organ systems. The antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the most frequently prescribed long-term medication used to treat this disease, a practice driven by extensive literature supporting its benefits in patients with SLE. Notably, HCQ has been associated with several benefits in patients with SLE, including a decrease in the rate of disease flares, protection against organ damage, improvement in overall survivaland reduction in the risk of thrombosis. Although antithrombotic effects have been demonstrated in clinical studies, the underlying mechanisms driving this protective effect are not fully understood. Accordingly, we compared platelet phenotypes and measures of vascular health in patients with SLE who were and were not prescribed HCQ to define the cardiovascular effects of this therapy in SLE.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^113Vu3Jh]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Recently, measurement of HCQ in whole blood was proposed to help clinicians distinguish non-adherence versus lack of efficacy of HCQ and eventually adjust the daily dosage based on individual pharmacokinetic variability. Several studies underline a significant role for routine monitoring of HCQ levels as a measure of non-adherence.

Despite this finding, there is insufficient information on the overall clinical impact of incorporating routine testing of HCQ blood levels and potential benefits of individualising HCQ doses.

Therefore, the main aim of this study was to assess if the HCQ dose influenced the risk of SLE flare (less than or equal to 5 mg/kg per day or greater than 5 mg/kg per day). As a secondary analysis, we aimed to: (1) compare HCQ blood levels between the two different oral dosages, and (2) evaluate the frequency of non-adherence in patients with SLE treated with HCQ.

---

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^113cibwM]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study suggests that patients who take the HCQ dosage of 5 mg/kg/day of actual body weight tend to have more exacerbation, although the differences were not statistically significant. The risks and benefits must be balanced in choosing the HCQ dose.

However, we found that low HCQ blood levels predicted lupus flares. Our study supports previous published studies reporting that periodical monitoring of HCQ levels might allow identification of early non-adherence, improve subsequent adherence, adjust the daily dosage based on individual pharmacokinetic variability and overall improve outcome in SLE. Further research focused on defining the optimal conditions for HCQ reduction is needed.

### Changing paradigms in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^113MnrGB]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine: anchor drug, but more caution may be needed

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is rightfully considered as the mainstay of SLE treatment due to its multifaceted beneficial effects and despite the paucity of randomised evidence. Indeed, use of HCQ has been consistently associated with favourable responses in 'hard' disease outcomes, like irreversible damage and even mortality, as well as with other disease aspects, ranging from prevention of congenital heart blockto improved metabolic and lipid profile(figure 1). Therefore, the focus has recently switched to more 'practical' questions regarding adherence to treatment and, furthermore, the relationship between HCQ blood concentrations ([HCQ]) and disease course. Compliance to treatment has been shown in several observational studies to be suboptimal; complete non-adherence rates (ie, undetectable blood levels of HCQ) range from 7% to 29%, while a recent Chinese study in 276 patients with SLE reported subtherapeutic levels in 77% of patients. Nevertheless, data regarding the association between lower blood concentrations and worse disease outcome have been less robust; certain studies have shown lower disease activity in patients with higher concentrations, while others have not. The Plaquenil LUpus Systemic (PLUS) randomised study failed to show difference in flare prevention between patients receiving [HCQ]-adjusted dosing versus stable dose, although the results were 'blurred' by the spontaneous increase in [HCQ] in both patient groups just prior to randomisation, owing to better 'last-minute' adherence.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^1139bC5B]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune systemic disease of multifactorial aetiology and with an unpredictable course. It can be characterised by the occurrence of flares, eventually leading to organ damage and an impaired quality of life.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), inexpensive and well-tolerated antimalarial drug, is now one of the most important medications for SLE, showing multiple benefits over several outcomes associated with the disease itself, as controlling disease activity, preventing flares and damage accrual, but also to its related comorbidities.HCQ binds strongly to melanin and can deposit in melanin-containing tissues such as the skin and the eyes, which might explain some side effects like retinopathy or skin hyperpigmentation.

Currently, HCQ is prescribed according to body weight. The recommended daily dosage of HCQ has varied during the years. The 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology recommendations stated that the safe daily dose of HCQ is no more than 5 mg/kg of actual body weight per day in SLE to decrease retinopathy occurrence. The current 2020 Joint Statement on HCQ and the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) guidelines confirmed the ophthalmological recommendations. An important concern with the current guidelines is that the efficacy of the recently recommended maximum dose (5 mg/kg/day of real body weight) has not been evaluated for patients with SLE. Many past studies evaluating the efficacy of HCQ considered a dosage of at least 6.5 mg/kg ideal body weight per day and it is unclear if this change in HCQ dose would be effective in controlling the disease. Moreover, this dosage is based on data from patients who effectively collected their medication. Unfortunately, less than half of the patients are taking HCQ as prescribed. Adherence to HCQ treatment is an unmet need in SLE, particularly for younger patients who may concern about adverse effects such as of retinopathy. Although non-adherence is an important issue, over two-thirds of rheumatologists are unaware of HCQ non-adherence. Low adherence rates to HCQ, if combined with a lower prescribed dose, may potentially lead to HCQ undertreatment.

### Temporal trends in glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in Sweden [^116pSsPV]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous disease with a variable course involving multiple organs and requiring different and dynamic treatments. Treatment guidelines have been updated over time as more evidence on treatment effectiveness and safety has accumulated. Acknowledging the increased risk of organ damage associated with long-term use of glucocorticoids (GC), the 2019 update of EULAR guidelines recommended a maximum daily dose of 7.5 mg prednisolone-equivalent GC, which was recently updated to a maximum of 5 mg. In general, GC should only be used during periods of increased disease activity and, when possible, be reduced or discontinued. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is recommended for all patients with SLE, considering the individual's risk for flares and retinal toxicity. However, it is not well understood to what extent new guidelines have led to changes in SLE treatment in practice. Immunosuppressants (IS) and more recently biologic agents are also important options to be considered to control the disease and facilitate GC tapering/discontinuation.

### Treating systemic lupus erythematosus in the 21st century: new drugs and new perspectives on old drugs [^115sfBeS]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Besides treating acute flares, the management of SLE should aim at preventing organ damage accrual and drug-associated harms, improving health-related quality of life and prolonging survival. At present, therapy is based on combinations of antimalarials (mainly HCQ), considered the backbone of SLE treatment, glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs. However, these regimens are not universally effective and a substantial degree of damage can be caused by exposure to glucocorticoids. In this review we provide a critical appraisal of the efficacy and safety of available treatments as well as a brief discussion of potentially novel compounds in patients with SLE. We emphasize the use of methylprednisolone pulses for moderate-severe flares, followed by low-moderate doses of oral prednisone with quick tapering to maintenance doses of ≤ 5mg/day, as well as the prompt institution of immunosuppressive drugs in the setting of severe disease but also as steroid-sparing agents. Indications for the use of biologic agents, namely belimumab and rituximab, in refractory or organ-threatening disease are also presented. We conclude by proposing evidence- and experience-based treatment strategies tailored to the clinical scenario and prevailing organ involvement that can aid clinicians in managing this complex disease.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: diagnosis and treatment [^1113unX5]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematologic, integumentary, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, pulmonary, renal, and reproductive systems. It is a chronic disease and may cause recurrent flare-ups without adequate treatment. The newest clinical criteria proposed by the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology in 2019 include an obligatory entry criterion of a positive antinuclear antibody titer of 1: 80 or greater. Management of SLE is directed at complete remission or low disease activity, minimizing the use of glucocorticoids, preventing flare-ups, and improving quality of life. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended for all patients with SLE to prevent flare-ups, organ damage, and thrombosis and increase long-term survival. Pregnant patients with SLE have an increased risk of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. Preconception counseling regarding risks, planning the timing of pregnancy, and a multidisciplinary approach play a major role in the management of SLE in patients contemplating pregnancy. All patients with SLE should receive ongoing education, counseling, and support. Those with mild SLE can be monitored by a primary care physician in conjunction with rheumatology. Patients with increased disease activity, complications, or adverse effects from treatment should be managed by a rheumatologist.

### Combination of clinical factors predicts successful glucocorticoid withdrawal in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): results from a multicentre, retrospective cohort study [^112Ja3sz]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

According to a recently proposed conceptual framework, therapeutic agents with putative disease-modifying effects in SLE should be able to minimise disease activity and prevent flares, especially severe ones. However, a literature reviewrevealed definitive evidence only for belimumab and anifrolumab in reducing severe lupus flares. We found a significant impact of hydroxychloroquine coadministration on reducing overall and severe flares following GC withdrawal. This agrees with Ji et al and Fasano et al, who showed a flare-protective effect of hydroxychloroquine in patients with prolonged clinical remission who stopped GC. Accordingly, a non-inferiority RCT in patients with SLE with sustained clinical and serological quiescence on ≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone-equivalent for > 6 months showed that GC withdrawal while maintaining hydroxychloroquine was non-inferior to continuing both drugs in terms of relapses. Our data align with observational studiesand RCTssupporting the protection of hydroxychloroquine/antimalarials against SLE flares, including renal flares. Moreover, they are consistent with the EULAR recommendationsadvocating for the timely introduction of immunomodulating/immunosuppressive agents when GC cannot be tapered to ≤ 5 mg/day.

In the CORTICOLUP trial, abrupt cessation of prednisone from 5 mg/day to 0 mg/day precipitated flares. Still, there is limited evidence to guide the optimal tapering speed, particularly at low doses (≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone-equivalent) approaching complete withdrawal. In serologically active clinically quiescent patients with SLE receiving ≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone-equivalent, Katsumata et al showed that a 1 mg/day dose reduction was safe, however no specific time frame was provided. For patients who are in sustained clinical remission on 5 mg/day, previous studies have suggested a slow tapering over approximately 9 monthsor 12–24 monthsuntil complete withdrawal. Our analysis used the LLDAS criterion of 7.5 mg/day prednisone-equivalent as a starting point for subsequent tapering and it was not confined to patients in a specific disease state at the time of GC discontinuation. Therefore, our finding derived through unbiased threshold detection, that a minimum duration of 6 months independently facilitates the safer GC dose reduction and withdrawal, may apply to a range of clinical conditions, pending confirmation in further studies.

What is the efficacy of interventions for cutaneous disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in randomized clinical trials (RCTs)?

Bottom Line

Available RCT evidence on the management of cutaneous disease in SLE is sparse and of limited quality. Among traditional options, methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine have the strongest evidence compared with placebo in the end points of complete clinical response and number of clinical flares, respectively, while chloroquine appears noninferior to methotrexate in achieving complete clinical response.

### Disease-modifying therapies in systemic lupus erythematosus for extrarenal manifestations [^116RsSj4]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our 2022 published working definition of disease modification in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was 'minimising disease activity with the fewest treatment-associated toxicities and slowing or preventing organ damage progression'. The objective of this review was to classify current SLE treatments according to the proposed non-renal disease modification criteria excluding toxicities. Based on a review of select clinical trial (n = 32) and observational study (n = 54) publications for 14 SLE medications across different therapeutic classes, and the authors' clinical experience, we evaluated disease modification potential as per the proposed framework at three time points. Specific criteria used to determine disease modification potential included a drug's capacity to reduce: (1) non-renal disease activity, (2) severe flares, (3) use of steroids/immunosuppressants and (4) organ damage accrual. Criteria 1–3 were assessed at 1 year and 2–5 years and, when positive, were considered evidence for disease modification potential; criterion 4 was used to confirm disease modification at > 5 years. Each treatment received one of four mutually exclusive designations at each time point: (a) criterion met, (b) indications of criterion met despite insufficient evidence in the literature, (c) inconclusive and (d) no available supportive data. This review excludes an assessment of potential toxicities. Eight of the 14 SLE treatments met ≥ 1 disease modification criteria up to year 5. Hydroxychloroquine improved overall survival at > 5 years, suggesting long-term disease modification, but no data on specific organ systems were reported. Belimumab was the only treatment to meet all criteria. Belimumab and hydroxychloroquine met disease modification definitions across three time points. Evidence for other SLE therapies was incomplete, particularly at > 5 years. Future studies are warranted for other treatments to meet the disease modification criteria. We discuss challenges to classification and possible updates to our published criteria.

Antimalarials

Antimalarials are among the oldest drugs for treating SLE. Following empirical use for years, the Canadian Hydroxychloroquine Study demonstrated in 1991 the efficacy of HCQ in preventing lupus flares. However, for many years the use of antimalarials was limited to patients with cutaneous and/or articular involvement, thus playing a marginal role in core lupus therapy. This scenario has changed substantially during the last 10 years.

Clinical efficacy of antimalarials

Two observational cohort studies published in 2006 and 2007 showed for the first time that antimalarials can reduce mortality in SLE patients by > 50% (Table 1). Both studies used propensity score–adjusted analysis, thus overcoming the confounding by indication bias. Indeed, subsequent studies have widely confirmed these results in various ethnic groups, including Latin American and Chinese populations.

Table 1
Antimalarials and GCs in SLE

Apart from the well-known effects of antimalarials on disease activity, improvement in long-term prognosis is mediated by a reduction in the risks of thrombosis, vascular disease and damage accrual. A recent study from the Toronto Lupus Cohort showed that treatment with antimalarials for > 60% of the time during the first 5 years of disease may reduce the number of flares, damage accrual and cumulative dose of glucocorticoids (GCs). In addition, protection against infections has been observed in several cohort studies. A reduced risk of cancer was already suggested in 2007 by an early study of the Lupus-Cruces cohort. A 2017 British population-based study of patients with connective tissue diseases exposed and not exposed to HCQ did not find a reduced risk of developing cancer, however, the risk of metastases and death were significantly lower in the former group. More recently, a large nested case–control study including > 14 000 Chinese lupus patients has confirmed a protective, dose-dependent effect of HCQ against neoplastic diseases.

Collectively, there is wide consensus in considering HCQ an essential drug for lupus. Recent consensus guidelines agree in recommending indefinite therapy with HCQ (unless contraindicated) for all SLE patients, including patients with LN and during pregnancy. However, there is some controversy regarding the optimal dose, mostly due to concerns about retinal toxicity.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^111WkH7h]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a cornerstone medication for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and sustained HCQ use might greatly reduce disease flares. However, there is concern over retinal toxicity, an irreversible complication that may affect 20% of patients after long‐term exposure. Uncertainties about the relative risks/benefits of long‐term treatment are a primary concern voiced by patients with SLE, and almost one‐third of patients with SLE discontinue HCQ treatment by 5–8 years.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Although some patients may do well after reducing therapy, others will have potentially life‐threatening complications related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares, and there is no information available to guide individual decision‐making.
Three cohorts of patients with SLE who were tapering, stopping, or maintaining hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were evaluated. The crude flare rate was significantly lower in patients maintaining HCQ therapy than in those tapering or discontinuing the drug.
Non‐White patients (especially Black, Asian, or First Nations patients), those age ≤ 25 years at SLE diagnosis, and those with active disease, including patients receiving prednisone or immunosuppressors, are at higher risk of having flares.
Our results suggest caution in tapering or discontinuation of HCQ in some groups of patients with SLE. The identification of these predictors is an important approach to promote personalized medicine to avoid unnecessary toxicities, as well as to monitor for flares in situations such as the current setting of potential HCQ shortages due to interest in this drug as a therapy for COVID‐19.

On an individual level, patients with SLE and clinicians struggle with many treatment decisions, since there is little information available on tapering or stopping HCQ to guide individual decision‐making. Some patients may do well after HCQ withdrawal, but others will have potentially life‐threatening complications. Recently, new concerns have arisen regarding HCQ shortages for patients with SLE due to potential COVID‐19 treatment. Clearly, we need better predictors of flare risk after HCQ is lowered or discontinued. The aim of this study was to identify baseline factors associated with a poor outcome once HCQ is tapered or discontinued in SLE.

### Hydroxychloroquine and cardiovascular events in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^113qL4DJ]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by flare-ups and organ damage. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with SLE treated with hydroxychloroquine had a better overall relative survival rate than untreated patients, and that they were significantly less likely to develop severe SLE, while discontinuing hydroxychloroquine was associated with increased risk of disease flare-ups in the months after discontinuation. In parallel, recent studies, identified trends in the reduction of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and venous thromboembolism among patients with SLE, but lacked statistical power to conclude a significant benefit associated with hydroxychloroquine use. However, data on the protective effects of hydroxychloroquine on individual cardiovascular (CV) events, especially arterial events, in patients with SLE, remain scarce.

We aimed to evaluate the association between current hydroxychloroquine exposure and the overall relative risk of composite CV events and individual events (MI, stroke, and other thromboembolic events [OTEs]) in patients with SLE. Evaluating the persistence of this link after discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine was the secondary objective.

Background therapies and slow tapering and withdrawal of GCs mitigate the risk for flare

Preventing flares, especially severe ones, is one of the proposed criteria for assessing the disease-modifying potential of SLE drugs. This prompted us to investigate whether the use of immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive drugs influences the flare risk on GC discontinuation. Using hydroxychloroquine for at least 50% of the follow-up period (starting from the time of GC discontinuation until the occurrence of a flare, or last follow-up if no flare occurred) was associated with decreased risk of overall flares (HR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.53) and severe flares (HR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.52) (figure 2). Use of mycophenolate or azathioprine (≥ 50% of follow-up period) were also linked to reduced overall flares (HRs of 0.46, 95% CI: 0.19 to 1.13, and 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.67, respectively) but not to severe flares (HRs: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.34 to 2.05 and 0.69; 95% CI: 0.37 to 1.31, respectively) (figure 2). A similar trend was observed for cyclophosphamide but not methotrexate, while for other agents we could not demonstrate a protective effect, likely due to the small number of events and limited number of patients exposed to these treatments (online supplemental figure S3).

Table 1 guiding principles — goals, care approach, and assumptions: The goals of SLE treatment are to achieve and maintain SLE remission or low disease activity state, reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize treatment related toxicities; collaborative care between rheumatologists and appropriate specialists should be provided whenever possible, and shared decision-making is essential to respect patient values and preferences and lead to better treatment adherence and outcomes. Healthcare disparities, including racialized and socioeconomic disparities, are crucial factors impacting outcomes of those living with SLE; treatment recommendations are aimed to alleviate health disparities, and evidence-specific guidance is provided when possible. Some therapies are presented without hierarchy when evidence-based data, clinical expertise, and patient-reported experiences do not clearly support the use of one medication over another; treatment decisions should be individualized to the patient's clinical status and preference, and potential limitations to implementing care recommendations may arise due to limitations in access to testing, specialists, procedures, and medications; if recommended therapies are unavailable, are not tolerated, or are not preferred by patients, we encourage discussion of reasonable alternative therapies. Assumptions include that all treatment recommendations assume other appropriate workups have been done to rule out non-SLE etiologies and organ-specific treatment recommendations assume all patients are taking hydroxychloroquine unless there is a contraindication to therapy.

It is worth noting that data were lacking on whether glucocorticoid use impacts immunosuppressant use at year 1. Therefore, as criterion 3 at year 1 requires a reduction in glucocorticoid and/or immunosuppressant use, we deemed glucocorticoids to have not met this criterion. Taken together, although relevant published data are lacking, based on authors' clinical experiences and published treatment recommendations, glucocorticoids were considered to have met the reduction in disease activity criterion at year 1.

No data were found to support any disease modification potential at year 1 for mizoribine.

Treatments with disease modification potential: years 2–5 outcomes

The criteria required to demonstrate disease modification potential at years 2–5 comprised at least one of the following: (1) sustained improvement in multiple organ domains/no worsening in multiple organ domains; (2) prevention of severe flares; and (3) a continued reduction in the use of glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressants (table 1).

For belimumaband anifrolumab, there were sufficient data to meet all three criteria for disease modification potential at years 2–5 (table 1). Hydroxychloroquine met the criteria for improvement/no worsening in multiple organ domains, where its use was associated with reduced risk and delayed onset of organ damage; however, criteria 2 and 3 (the prevention of severe flares, and continued reduction in use of glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressants, respectively) were classified as inconclusive based on the available literatureand author experience. Withdrawal of hydroxychloroquine resulted in a larger proportion of patients with flares (34.1%), defined as new SLEDAI-2K scores ≥ 4, compared with patients who continued treatment (17.9%). However, any abrupt discontinuation of an SLE treatment may be expected to exacerbate flare rates versus tapering, and so the interpretation of these results in the context of the published framework should not be considered. In a small retrospective extension study, the relative risk for major flares was not significantly reduced with hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo, whereas in another study, the severe flare rate in the low-dose hydroxychloroquine group was not significantly different from the rate observed in the high-dose hydroxychloroquine group. Overall, these conflicting observations resulted in an inconclusive classification for hydroxychloroquine.

### Hydroxychloroquine in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: how much is enough? [^116zaMuX]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The analysis of our inception patients confirms that doses of HCQ of 200 mg/day have been used in the Lupus-Cruces cohort for more than 20 years. The frequent use of methylprednisolone to treat flares and the early addition of IS completed our standard of care. In this study, we found that patients treated with HCQ at sustained doses of 3–3.5 mg/kg/day achieved high rates of prolonged remission and also received low cumulative doses of oral glucocorticoids.

HCQ at 400 mg/day has been frequently prescribed worldwide, which is over 6.5 mg/kg/day for a 60 kg-average patient. Recently updated guidelines recommend keeping patients on HCQ under that limit, however, studies in the SLICC cohortand the Massachusetts General Hospital cohortfound an increased risk of flare among patients who reduced the daily dose of HCQ to < 5 mg/kg/day.

It is expected that patients with reduced doses have lower blood levels of HCQ. However, the relation between both is not linear and is subjected to many interactions. Very low HCQ levels are a good marker for poor adherence, on the contrary, a French multicentre controlled trial failed to demonstrate a reduction of SLE flares among patients in whom the daily dose of HCQ was adjusted to blood levels.

Antimalarials have very large volumes of distribution including aqua-soluble compartments and organs such as liver, heart and muscle, pigmented tissues and mononuclear cells, with 45% of the daily dose of HCQ being stored in lean tissues, fitting a three-compartment model of distribution. The concentration in the acidic compartments of organ-settled lymphocytes and other immune cells mediates the beneficial immunoregulatory effects of HCQ. Such tissue concentrations are not well related to either blood levels or daily doses. Actually, reaching a steady state within the target organs may take several months which can be related to the slow onset of the effect of antimalarials. Once this state has been achieved at a given dose, the brisk reduction in the daily dosage, for instance, from 400 to 200 mg/day, the scenario of those studies finding a high rate of lupus reactivation with lower doses, could cause an imbalance in the tissue levels of HCQ and thus promote flares.

### Impact of systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity, hydroxychloroquine and NSAID on the risk of subsequent organ system damage and death: analysis in a single US medical centre [^114t9GD1]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterised by a complex and multifactorial aetiology. It affects multiple organ systems, which contributes to the complicated patient burden of SLE. Some patients with SLE experience a waxing and waning pattern of disease activity during the course of disease, whereas others have continuous activity. Cumulative SLE disease activityand SLE therapiesimpact the risk of developing organ system damage and survival. The 5-year survival among individuals with SLE has increased dramatically in the last four decades to 95%, with similar trends observed for 10-year survival. The impact of irreversible organ system damage in the prognosis of SLE remains a major concern because patients who develop damage are more likely to accrue additional damage and die. Published research from prospective cohorts has demonstrated that SLE disease activity is a strong predictor of SLE prognosis and survival.

The objective of this analysis was to investigate whether the pattern of SLE disease activity (as measured by the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA) version of the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)) during a 12-month period after enrolment in a racially diverse cohort of patients prospectively followed quarterly by protocol impacted the risk of developing damage (overall or by specific organ system) and death over time.

We did not aim to compare the 3 cohorts directly in terms of flare rate. However, the crude flare rate was significantly lower in the HCQ maintenance cohort (16.1 events per 100 person‐years [95% CI 13.2–19.6]) than in the taper cohort (35.7 [95% CI 31.6–40.3]) and in the discontinuation cohort (29.0 [95% CI 25.5–33.0]). Of course, these crude rates do not consider the fact that variables like disease activity and concomitant medications may differ considerably between the cohorts. If patients tapered or discontinued HCQ solely because of inactive disease, we would expect lower outcome rates in the taper than in the discontinuation group. However, reasons for lowering the dose or discontinuing a medication are multifactorial and may have included patient tolerance, adherence, or even changes in guidelines, including the 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommendations, which cautioned against cumulative use of HCQ and lowered dosing to 5 mg/kg per day. Thus, not all patients were in remission when HCQ was tapered or discontinued. In fact, we observed that the proportion of patients with active disease (SLEDAI‐2K score ≥ 4) at baseline was higher in the HCQ taper cohort (46.7% [95% CI 41.8–51.6]) than in the discontinuation cohort (31.6% [95% CI 27.0–36.2]). Given this finding, the relatively high number of patients in the taper group with a poor outcome makes sense. The fact that the maintenance group had higher baseline disease activity (and more use of immunosuppressives, corticosteroids, and biologics) than the discontinuation group, but a significantly lower (not higher) flare rate, suggests that HCQ is beneficial is this group.

### Combination of clinical factors predicts successful glucocorticoid withdrawal in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): results from a multicentre, retrospective cohort study [^114jivKr]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Glucocorticoid (GC) tapering and withdrawal to reduce damage represents a key aspect of the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) SLE recommendations. However, optimal strategies for relapse-free GC cessation remain ill-defined. We characterised clinical predictors and their combined effect on flares in patients with SLE who discontinued GC.

Methods

Retrospective cohort of 324 patients with active SLE (PGA ≥ 1.5 and/or SLEDAI-2K ≥ 6) who received GC as part of treatment intensification (median follow-up 60 months). Survival and generalised linear models estimated SELENA-SLEDAI flare risks and their predictors.

Results

GCs were discontinued in 220 (67.9%) patients with 1-year risks for overall and severe flares of 50% and 25%, respectively (HR: 1.48; 95%CI: 1.12 to 1.96 for overall flares; HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.03 to 2.25 for severe flares, compared with non-withdrawers). Flare risk was lowered when GCs were ceased during remission (DORIS) or Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS; excluding remission) (HR for severe flares: 0.23; 0.12 to 0.43 and 0.30; 0.18 to 0.50, respectively), with each additional month in targets providing further protection. Hydroxychloroquine prevented total (HR: 0.37; 0.26 to 0.53) and severe flares (HR: 0.33; 0.21 to 0.52), while mycophenolate and azathioprine reduced overall flares. Prednisone tapering from 7.5mg/day to 0 over > 6 months improved severe flare-free outcome (HR: 0.57; 0.37 to 0.90). Random survival forests identified DORIS/LLDAS, hydroxychloroquine use and slow GC tapering as top predictors, whose coexistence reduced overall and severe flares by ~25fold and ~50fold, respectively. This combination reduced damage (IRR: 0.31; 0.08 to 0.84) without inducing flares (IRR: 0.52; 95%CI: 0.18 to 1.16) compared with GC non-withdrawers.

Conclusion

Low or absent disease activity, slow tapering and hydroxychloroquine use minimise the risk of flares, facilitating GC discontinuation-a major goal in SLE.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: a review [^112KtaWP]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and immune-mediated injury to multiple organ systems, including the mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, hematologic, and kidney systems. Approximately 3.4 million people worldwide have received a diagnosis of SLE.

Observations

Approximately 90% of people with SLE are female. Although there are no uniformly accepted diagnostic criteria for SLE, the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (formerly the European League Against Rheumatism)/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria developed for scientific study are an estimated 96.1% sensitive and 93.4% specific for SLE. These classification criteria include both clinical factors, such as fever, cytopenia, rash, arthritis, and proteinuria, which may be indicative of lupus nephritis; and immunologic measures, such as SLE-specific autoantibodies and low complement levels. Approximately 40% of people with SLE develop lupus nephritis, and an estimated 10% of people with lupus nephritis develop end-stage kidney disease after 10 years. The primary goal of treatment is to achieve disease remission or quiescence, defined by minimal symptoms, low levels of autoimmune inflammatory markers, and minimal systemic glucocorticoid requirement while the patient is treated with maintenance doses of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications. Treatment goals include reducing disease exacerbations, hospitalizations, and organ damage due to the disease or treatment toxicity. Hydroxychloroquine is standard of care for SLE and has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality. Treatments in addition to hydroxychloroquine are individualized, with immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide, typically used for treating moderate to severe disease. Three SLE medications were recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration: belimumab (for active SLE in 2011 and for lupus nephritis in 2020), voclosporin (for lupus nephritis), and anifrolumab (for active SLE).

Conclusions and Relevance

Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with immune-mediated damage to multiple organs and increased mortality. Hydroxychloroquine is first-line therapy and reduces disease activity, morbidity, and mortality. When needed, additional immunosuppressive and biologic therapies include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, belimumab, voclosporin, and anifrolumab.

### Combination of clinical factors predicts successful glucocorticoid withdrawal in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): results from a multicentre, retrospective cohort study [^112RQR9j]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

Glucocorticoid (GC) tapering and withdrawal to reduce damage represents a key aspect of the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) SLE recommendations. However, optimal strategies for relapse-free GC cessation remain ill-defined. We characterised clinical predictors and their combined effect on flares in patients with SLE who discontinued GC.

Methods

Retrospective cohort of 324 patients with active SLE (PGA ≥ 1.5 and/or SLEDAI-2K ≥ 6) who received GC as part of treatment intensification (median follow-up 60 months). Survival and generalised linear models estimated SELENA-SLEDAI flare risks and their predictors.

Results

GCs were discontinued in 220 (67.9%) patients with 1-year risks for overall and severe flares of 50% and 25%, respectively (HR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.96 for overall flares; HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.03 to 2.25 for severe flares, compared with non-withdrawers). Flare risk was lowered when GCs were ceased during remission (DORIS) or Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS; excluding remission) (HR for severe flares: 0.23; 0.12 to 0.43 and 0.30; 0.18 to 0.50, respectively), with each additional month in targets providing further protection. Hydroxychloroquine prevented total (HR: 0.37; 0.26 to 0.53) and severe flares (HR: 0.33; 0.21 to 0.52), while mycophenolate and azathioprine reduced overall flares. Prednisone tapering from 7.5 mg/day to 0 over > 6 months improved severe flare-free outcome (HR: 0.57; 0.37 to 0.90). Random survival forests identified DORIS/LLDAS, hydroxychloroquine use and slow GC tapering as top predictors, whose coexistence reduced overall and severe flares by ~25 fold and ~50 fold, respectively. This combination reduced damage (IRR: 0.31; 0.08 to 0.84) without inducing flares (IRR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.18 to 1.16) compared with GC non-withdrawers.

Conclusion

Low or absent disease activity, slow tapering and hydroxychloroquine use minimise the risk of flares, facilitating GC discontinuation — a major goal in SLE.

### Effects of metformin on disease flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: post hoc analyses from two randomised trials [^114yA4nU]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To confirm that metformin prevents flares in patients with SLE with low disease activity, we performed a post hoc analysis combining our previous two randomised trials.

Methods

Post hoc analyses were performed on data from the open-labelled proof-of-concept trial (n = 113, ChiCTR-TRC-12002419) and placebo-controlled 'Met Lupus' trial (n = 140, NCT02741960) comparing the efficacy of metformin versus placebo/nil add-on to standard therapy in patients with SLE with low disease activity (SELENA-SLEDAI ≤ 4). The primary endpoint was defined by the SELENA-SLEDAI Flare Index at 12-month follow-up. A subgroup analysis was performed.

Results

Overall, 201 eligible patients were included, with 99 allocated to metformin group and 102 allocated to the placebo/nil group. By 12 months of follow-up, 21 patients (21.2%) flared in the metformin group, as compared with 36 (35.3%) in the placebo/nil group (p = 0.027, risk ratio = 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.96). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with negative anti-dsDNA antibody and normal complement at baseline, and a disease duration < 5 years with concomitant use of hydroxychloroquine had a better response to metformin.

Conclusion

Post hoc pooled analyses suggested that metformin reduced subsequent disease flares in patients with SLE with low disease activity, especially for serologically quiescent patients.

### Mycophenolate mofetil and new-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomized clinical trial [^116iFrft]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody has been reported to have a close relationship with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares and participates in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis (LN) as well as causing damage to other organs. However, whether early use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) could prevent SLE flares is not clear.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of MMF plus prednisone and hydroxychloroquine sulfate compared with prednisone and hydroxychloroquine sulfate alone in patients with SLE.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This investigator-initiated, multicenter, observer-blinded randomized clinical trial enrolled 130 participants aged 18 to 65 years and was conducted in 3 hospitals across China. Treatment-naive patients with newly diagnosed SLE, a high titer of anti-dsDNA antibody, and no major organ involvement were included. The study was started September 1, 2018, and the follow-up was completed September 30, 2021. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral prednisone (0.5 mg/kg/d) and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (5 mg/kg/d) (control group) or prednisone (0.5 mg/kg/d) and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (5 mg/kg/d) plus MMF (500 mg twice daily) (MMF group) for 96 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients presenting with flares according to the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) Flare Index. The secondary outcomes included the proportion with lupus low disease activity state at week 96, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey scores before and after treatment, proportion of adverse events (AEs), and changes in SLEDAI-2000 scores and prednisone doses.

Results

Among 130 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 34.5 [12.5] years; 112 [86.2%] women), 119 (91.5%) completed the follow-up. The risk of severe flare was significantly lower in the MMF group (7 of 65 [10.8%]) vs the control group (18 of 65 [27.7%]) (relative risk [RR], 0.39 [95% CI, 0.17–0.87]; P = 0.01). Additionally, 1 of 65 patients in the MMF group (1.5%) and 9 of 65 in the control group (13.8%) manifested LN (RR, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.01–0.85]; P = 0.008). Most common serious study drug-related AEs were infections (20 of 65 [30.8%] in the control group and 22 of 65 [33.8%] in the MMF group).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this randomized clinical trial suggest that MMF may reduce the rate of severe flare and lower the incidence of LN in patients with new-onset SLE and a high titer of anti-dsDNA antibody without major organ involvement.

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarker response and efficacy of E6742: a dual antagonist of toll-like receptors 7 and 8, in a first in patient, randomised, double-blind, phase I / II study in systemic lupus erythematosus [^116Mnsme]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease characterised by systemic inflammation in various organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys and central nervous system. SLE is more common in young female adults (9:1 ratio of females to males). The reported global prevalence of SLE varies considerably, ranging from 3.2 to 517.5 per 100 000 individuals. According to the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations for the management of SLE (2023 update), it should be treated as early as possible and aiming for remission or at least low disease activity to avoid organ damage. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is currently recommended for all patients with SLE unless contraindicated, while the use of glucocorticoids has shifted from mainstay of treatment to a 'bridging therapy' limited to minimal use on the basis of detrimental effects. In patients who do not respond to HCQ (alone or in combination with glucocorticoids) or are unable to reduce glucocorticoids, addition of immunosuppressants and/or biologics should be considered. However, most of these conventional drugs cause serious side effects, leading to the anticipation of development of more targeted therapies.

### Glucocorticoids and antimalarials in systemic lupus erythematosus: an update and future directions [^11571T1n]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is highlighting the most recent evidence on the clinical efficacy and toxicity of glucocorticoids and antimalarials in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and provide recommendations on their current use.

Recent Findings

Glucocorticoid toxicity is well known. Recent data confirm the increased risk of infection and damage accrual. An observational study form Hong Kong has seen increased mortality among users of high-dose prednisone regimes. Several studies support the efficacy of medium-low doses and methyl-prednisolone pulses in lupus patients, both with and without nephritis. New data confirm the effects of antimalarials in preventing SLE activity, damage and infections, and in decreasing mortality. New screening recommendations for hydroxychloroquine maculopathy have been recently published. Combining mepacrine and hydroxychloroquine in patients with refractory cutaneous and/or articular lupus activity has proved highly effective.

Summary

Universal therapy with hydroxychloroquine should be aimed to patients with SLE without contraindications. Doses greater than 4mg/kg/day should be avoided and regular eye screening warranted to minimize the risk of macular toxicity. Every effort should be made to reduce the dose of oral glucocorticoids. In moderate-severe flares, pulse methyl-prednisolone are more effective and much less toxic than increasing the oral doses of prednisone.

HCQ and SLE flares

Among the 83 patients enrolled, we excluded 17 patients who were severely non-adherent (HCQ concentration ≤ 100 ng/mL value). Out of the remaining 66 patients, we identified 27 (40.9%) patients who had a prescribed HCQ dose of ≤ 5 mg/kg/day and 39 (59%) patients with a prescribed HCQ dose of > 5 mg/kg/day. There were no differences in patient characteristics at baseline between the two groups (table 1). Each of the 66 patients attended the scheduled follow-up visits, at least every 3 months for 24 months. We observed 11 (16%) flares that developed in mean 14.8 months of follow-up. A total of 7 of 27 (26%) patients taking an HCQ dose equal or less than 5 mg/kg had a flare (six mild/moderate flares and one severe flare). We registered only 4 of 39 (10%) flares in the other group, all mild/moderate flares, although the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.09). There was a trend (p = 0.08) for high HCQ dose being associated with a lower flare rate (12.3 events per 100 person-years, 95% CI 4.98 to 25.5) vs HCQ < 5 mg/kg/day (43.5 events per 100 person-years, 95% CI 11.8 to 111.5). However, comparing patients with and without flare, the former presented a lower mean HCQ blood levels (378.3 ± 185.5 vs 782.7 ± 646.7 ng/mL, p = 0.005). Stable therapeutic HCQ levels above 500 ng/mL (in T0 and T6) were associated with no occurrences of disease flares (mild/moderate or severe). At Cox regression analysis, HCQ blood level was a significant independent risk for flare (HR 0.996, 95% CI 0.993 to 0.999, p = 0.027). Moreover, older age at baseline was protective against flare occurrence (HR 0.93; p = 0.001; 95% CI 0.89 to 0.97), while concomitant immunosuppressant therapy showed significant positive association (HR 3.66; p = 0.002; 95% CI 1.59 to 8.43) (table 2). We also observed that longer time on remission was associated with lower flare risk even if it was not significant (p = 0.054). No other significant associations were observed.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine in incomplete lupus [^1157Fh6V]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Patients with features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who do not fulfill classification criteria can be designated as incomplete lupus (ILE). This condition includes individuals with a high risk of progression to SLE. Treatment of ILE may reduce symptoms, severity and incidence of SLE.

Methods

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was chosen as an ILE intervention for a randomized, double-blind trial to determine whether rate of accumulation of SLE features defined by the 2012 SLICC criteria could be reduced. ILE was defined as ANA positivity with 1–2 additional criteria. Patients 15–49 years old were eligible. Randomization was 1:1 HCQ to placebo. Evaluations were at 3-month intervals over 24 months. Meeting SLICC classification sooner required exit.

Results

Participants (n = 187) were randomized at 7 sites. After excluding 7 patients who met SLE classification at baseline when screening laboratory data were completed, 180 patients were analyzed: 92 on HCQ and 88 on placebo. The mean age was 33 years, 91.1% were female and 74.4% were white. SLE classification developed in 24 (13.3%); another 24 developed additional criteria but did not meet classification. The rates of acquisition of SLICC criteria and progression to SLE were similar in the two groups (P = 0.72 and P = 0.98, respectively). Development of SLE was associated with new malar rash, oral ulcers, joint tenderness or pleurisy (P < 0.04).

Conclusion

While SMILE did not show effects of HCQ on ILE progression, the results offer insights into SLE risk in the ILE population. With development of biomarkers, designing targeted prevention strategies should be feasible.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^117SMidX]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent guidelines for SLE recommend using a hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) dose less than 5.0mg/kg/day to reduce the risk of retinopathy. To determine if this dose reduction would have an impact on the clinical course of SLE, we compared flare incidence in a cohort of patients with SLE treated with two different oral HCQ dosages (≤ 5mg/kg/day or > 5mg/kg/day). As a secondary analysis, we compared HCQ blood levels between the two different oral dosages, and evaluated the frequency of non-adherence in patients with SLE treated with HCQ.

Methods

We identified a cohort of patients with SLE taking HCQ for at least 6 months and followed for 24 months. At study entry and 6 months later, a blood venous sample was taken to measure HCQ blood levels by liquid chromatography. Incidence of new SLE flares after recruitment was put in relation to daily HCQ dose and mean HCQ blood levels. Cox regression analysis served to identify factors associated with SLE flares.

Results

83 patients were enrolled. We observed 11 (16%) flares that developed in mean 14.8 months of follow-up. The difference in terms of flare rate and mean HCQ blood levels between the two oral dosages was not statistically significant. There was a trend (p = 0.08) for high HCQ dose being associated with a lower flare rate. At Cox analysis, higher HCQ blood levels and older age at baseline were protective against flare occurrence, while concomitant immunosuppressant therapy showed significant positive association. HCQ blood levels did not correlate with prescribed HCQ dose.

Conclusion

Patients with low oral HCQ dosage tend to have more flares, although the difference was not statistically significant. Higher HCQ blood levels were protective against flare occurrence. The risks and benefits must be balanced in choosing HCQ dose.

### Combination of clinical factors predicts successful glucocorticoid withdrawal in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): results from a multicentre, retrospective cohort study [^113uqutX]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this work, we analysed longitudinal data from a large multicentre SLE cohort with active disease at inclusion, to define clinical conditions associated with successful GC withdrawal. Applying standard and unbiased statistical approaches, we explored the effect — individually and in combination — of modifiable factors including disease status, residual activity across various organs/domains, use of concomitant SLE therapies and GC tapering speed. A benefit–risk analysis of the three most important predictors (LLDAS/DORIS attainment, hydroxychloroquine use and gradual GC dose reduction over > 6 months) showed that their cooccurrence offers an additive protective effect and most favourable balance between flare risk and protection against organ damage after GC discontinuation, making them putative targets for improving SLE prognosis.

Our work aligns with a meta-analysis of observational studies, which reported increased overall flares and a non-significant trend for severe flares after stopping GCs. In our cohort comprising of patients with moderate/severe disease, 68% discontinued GCs; of these, 50% relapsed within 12 months, with nearly half of the flares being severe. This accords with the reported frequency of patients with SLE experiencing a flare-free, off-GC state, which typically ranges 20%–50% across various studies, likely reflecting differences in patient characteristics and study design. These data underscore the challenge of successful GC discontinuation in SLE, highlighted by a prospective study where tapering GC to < 5 mg/day (including complete withdrawal) was achieved and maintained in only about half of patients with newly diagnosed lupus.

### Hydroxychloroquine discontinuation in systemic lupus erythematosus: a retrospective cohort study with 3-year follow-up [^114CCepa]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the incidence and factors associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares following hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) discontinuation.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective single-centre study of adult SLE patients who discontinued HCQ. Clinical and serological characteristics at baseline (time of HCQ discontinuation), were compared between patients who experienced flares (any, repeated, or severe) and those who remained flare-free during the follow-up, with a potential observation period of up to 36months. Categorical variables were analysed using Fisher's exact test; continuous variables using appropriate tests based on normality and variance.

Results

Among 42 patients included, 12 (29%), 15 (36%), and 14 (38%) experienced a flare during the first, second, and third year, respectively. Over 36months, 21 (50%) had at least one flare, 10 had a severe flare, and 8 had repeated flares. 19 patients remained flare-free. Low C3 levels at baseline were associated with any flare (p < 0.001), repeated flares (p < 0.001), and severe flares (p = 0.014) compared with those without flares. Patients with low C3 at baseline flared earlier and more frequently (log-rank p < 0.001) with hazard ratio of 10.18 (95%CI: 3.26–31.84, p < 0.001) for flaring, compared with those with normal C3. Other clinical and laboratory factors were not associated with flare prevention.

Conclusion

Half the patients who discontinued HCQ flared within two years. Low C3 levels at baseline were associated with increased risk of flares. These findings suggest that flares are common soon after HCQ discontinuation, and low C3 may help identify patients at higher risk for disease reactivation after HCQ discontinuation.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: primary care approach to diagnosis and management [^112fbMPm]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that affects many systems, including the skin, musculoskeletal, renal, neuropsychiatric, hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and reproductive systems. Family physicians should be familiar with the manifestations of lupus to aid in early diagnosis, monitoring patients with mild disease, recognizing warning signs that require referral to a rheumatologist, and helping to monitor disease activity and treatment in patients with moderate to severe disease. The American College of Rheumatology has 11 classification criteria for lupus. If a patient meets at least four criteria, lupus can be diagnosed with 95% specificity and 85% sensitivity. All patients with lupus should receive education, counseling, and support. Hydroxychloroquine is the cornerstone of treatment because it reduces disease flares and other constitutional symptoms. Low-dose glucocorticoids can be used to treat most manifestations of lupus. The use of immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents depends on the body systems affected. Patients with mild disease that does not involve major organ systems can be monitored by their family physician. Patients with increased disease activity, complications, or adverse effects from treatment should be referred to a rheumatologist. To optimize treatment, it is important that a rheumatologist coordinate closely with the patient's family physician to improve chronic care as well as preventive health services.

### Early initiation of hydroxychloroquine in cutaneous lupus erythematosus to prevent progression to systemic lupus erythematosus: a long-term follow-up study [^111jGyFa]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The progression from cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains a significant clinical challenge, with identified risk factors but no established preventative strategies.

Objectives

To evaluate whether early hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) initiation reduces the risk of CLE progressing to SLE.

Methods

A longitudinal study of 286 consecutive patients with isolated CLE (full study cohort), treated with HCQ (n = 186) or topical corticosteroids/calcineurin inhibitors (n = 100). Progression to SLE was defined using the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria.

Results

Progression to SLE occurred in 4.8% of the HCQ group and 27% of the topical corticosteroids/topical inhibitors group (P < .001). Early initiation of HCQ was associated with an 87% reduction in SLE risk over time (hazard ratio: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.06–0.27, P < .001), consistent across all CLE severity levels and both positive and negative baseline antinuclear antibody titers. Severe SLE with end-organ involvement was also significantly less frequent in the HCQ group (risk ratio: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.19–0.86, P = 0.003).

Limitations

Observational design.

Conclusions

Early HCQ treatment demonstrated protective effects against progression to SLE, supporting its use as a preferred strategy in managing CLE to prevent systemic involvement.

### Update on antimalarials and systemic lupus erythematosus [^115oBqT6]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is highlighting the most recent evidence on the clinical efficacy and toxicity of antimalarials in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Recent Findings

New data confirm the effects of antimalarials in preventing SLE activity, damage and infections and in decreasing mortality. An important reduction in use of health resources is related to continued antimalarial use. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) may prevent preeclampsia in pregnant women with SLE. HCQ ocular toxicity is infrequent and could be associated with blood levels. Gastrointestinal and skin toxicity are underrecognized and could influence adherence. Prolongation of QT interval is extremely unusual with HCQ. Doses of HCQ of 200mg/day seem to offer a good efficacy/toxicity balance. HCQ protection against herpes zoster and Pneumocystis jirovecii infection has been shown. On the contrary, HCQ prescription by doctors and adherence by patients are both under recommended standards. The recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in a significant shortage of HCQ in many countries with possible consequences in the correct treatment of lupus patients.

Summary

Recent evidence reinforces the central role of HCQ in SLE therapy. The reduction in activity, damage accrual and mortality is consistent across studies, countries and ethnical groups. On the contrary, and despite the well established beneficial effects of prolonged regular HCQ therapy, many SLE patients do never take this drug or it is eventually stopped in the setting of severe flares, pregnancy or presumed toxicity. Every effort must be made to assure the correct prescription of HCQ and not to withdraw the drug unless unequivocal signs of toxicity are present.

### The therapeutic strategies for SLE by targeting anti-dsDNA antibodies [^117DxjVh]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

The Reduction of Anti-dsDNA Antibodies

Immunosuppressive and Immunomodulatory Therapies

Conventional SLE therapies are based on the use of corticosteroids, which have both anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. In particular, corticosteroids are effective for active lupus nephritis and other lupus-related manifestations. However, their transient curative effect and undesirable adverse side effects limit their usage. Other cytotoxic immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, tacrolimus, or mycophenolate mofetil single, or a combination with corticosteroids, are utilized extensively in patients with various manifestations of SLE for long-term disease control and to minimize steroid requirements. These agents also have significant limitations and serious adverse events, including cytopenia, infections, and possible malignancy.

Hydroxychloroquine, as an immunomodulator, can modulate the immune response without increasing the risk of infection or malignancy. Hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with steroids and immunosuppressive drugs has been widely used in SLE management to improve patients' long-term survival by controlling lupus flares and accrual of organ damage. According to the 2019 updated European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines for the SLE management, hydroxychloroquine is recommended in all lupus patients unless contraindicated (level of evidence 1b, grade of recommendation A). Hydroxychloroquine exerts immunomodulatory effect by inhibiting BCR and TLR signaling and the secretion of cytokines to prevent B cell survival and autoantibody production. It can also prevent MHC class II-mediated auto-nuclear antigen presentation by inhibiting lysosomal activity. Moreover, hydroxychloroquine exerts an anti-IFN-α effect by interfering with nucleic acid sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) to inhibit stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. A prospective cohort study has revealed that hydroxychloroquine can ameliorate classical SLE manifestations, such as skin problems and joint pain by anti-inflammation and decreasing autoantibodies level.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^116P3HBs]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)/lupus nephritis (LN) — implementation, dosing, monitoring, and adjunctive-therapy practice point are detailed. Because of hemolysis risk in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, measurement of G6PD levels is preferred in men before starting hydroxychloroquine, and all patients should have a baseline retinal examination with annual eye testing, especially after 5 years of use; clinicians should be aware antimalarials may be cardiotoxic. The dosing of hydroxychloroquine is 6.5 mg/kg ideal weight or 400 mg/d and, during maintenance, should be lowered to 4 to 5 mg/kg/d. Data from multiple observational cohorts show reduced flare and organ damage accrual and a relatively low rate of drug-related adverse effects, including ocular toxicity, providing the basis for recommending its use as part of general management in SLE. Practice Point 10.2.1.1 states adjunctive therapies to manage LN and attenuate complications of the disease or its treatments should be considered for all patients.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^116HGNxD]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, there was no correlation between the prescribed HCQ dose in mg/kg and the HCQ whole blood level. This may due to individual differences in HCQ metabolism or again to patients' compliance. The lack of a correlation between HCQ dose and levels was already reported. Our data clearly indicate the need for personalised HCQ dosing approaches beyond empirical dosing recommendation through routinely HCQ blood level measurements.

In Cox regression analysis, we found that immunosuppressant therapy was associated with SLE exacerbation. Other cohort studies have reported that patients under immunosuppressive agents have higher flare risk. This could be explained as more aggressive treatment is generally required in case of more severe disease course. Moreover, we observed a protective role exerted by older age, consistent with previous evidence of longer periods of remission in elderly patients. This result may suggest that HCQ tapering may be relatively safe in seniors.

Our study is not without limitations. First of all, our population included a small sample size with mostly white patients and only one man. African descent and male patients, however, are known to have higher morbidity and mortality. Moreover, we studied patients in remission at baseline and hence a lower dose of HCQ could be used for maintenance. A bias by indication can be hypothesised, but it is difficult to quantify (are patients who maintained higher dosage more severe than patients in which physician decided to reduce the dosage?). In any case, we did not find any differences between these two groups and blood HCQ levels did not correlate with the dose prescribed in our study. Finally, there is still a lack of consensus on the HCQ level that would balance efficacy against toxicities. We defined 500 ng/mL as the minimal therapeutic level of HCQ, which was considered as the target in other studies. However, other cut-offs have been used based on interviews of the patients for non-adherenceand of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics study for efficacy.

### Pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine in paediatric lupus: data from a novel, direct-to-family clinical trial [^113Pw818]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To control disease activity and prevent poor outcomes, virtually all patients with SLE receive treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which can prevent disease flares, reduce cumulative organ damage and improve survival.HCQ is metabolised to several metabolites, the major active metabolite being desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ). Despite widespread use in children, there are virtually no population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies to guide HCQ dosing in paediatric SLE (pSLE), and children are prescribed the same weight-based dosage as adults. However, weight-based dosing may produce significantly different exposure in children compared with adults due to differences in the maturity of drug-metabolising enzymes, renal function and other physiological changes. Moreover, low systemic concentrations of HCQ are associated with increased disease activity and increased risk of disease flares in adultsand in children, underscoring the need for PK studies to ensure children obtain therapeutic HCQ and DHCQ concentrations.

In addition to the physiological changes that may alter HCQ PK in children compared with adults, non-adherence to HCQ may result in subtherapeutic concentrations and treatment failure. In real-world settings, adherence to chronic medications such as HCQ is a significant barrier to treating SLE, with up to 30%–50% of patients having chronic poor adherence and low drug concentrations. As a result, patients with inadequate exposure to HCQ may be 2.5 times more likely to have a severe lupus flare. The risk of severe flares underscores the need to evaluate HCQ adherence in children in a real-world setting.

To overcome the gap in existing PK and exposure–response data in children, we conducted a novel, direct-to-family clinical trial in pSLE using an electronic pill bottle cap to improve adherence to HCQ. As a secondary outcome of the trial, we collected plasma samples to measure HCQ concentration and biomarkers of HCQ response including inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, this analysis aimed to determine the population PK and exposure–response of HCQ and DHCQ in pSLE.

### Changing paradigms in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^113k9vKa]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

SLE poses formidable therapeutic challenges due to its heterogeneity and treatment decisions often cannot be guided by data of high quality. In this review, we attempt to provide insights regarding the treatment of SLE in everyday clinical practice, based on contemporary evidence and our own personal experience. We focus on common therapeutic issues and dilemmas arising in routine care, including monitoring for retinal toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine, handling of glucocorticoid regimens in order to minimise their adverse events, choice of immunosuppressive medications based on prevailing disease manifestations and optimal use of available biological agents (belimumab and rituximab). We also provide our view on the position of calcineurin inhibitors in the management of lupus nephritis and conclude with remarks on the future perspectives for this challenging disease.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^1172pYGU]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus guideline discussion — In this guideline, we recommend HCQ, limiting glucocorticoid exposure, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve remission or low disease activity while minimizing medication toxicity for all people with SLE. Many recommendations are conditional and do not specify one particular immunosuppressive agent, or even one class of agent, and the guideline strongly emphasizes the role of shared decision-making between patients and clinicians. Routine assessment of medication adherence is suggested.

### Effect of hydroxychloroquine on the survival of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: data from LUMINA, a multiethnic US cohort (LUMINA L) [^117CM4RS]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hydroxychloroquine prevents disease flares and damage accrual and facilitates the response to mycophenolate mofetil in those with renal involvement. A study was undertaken to determine whether hydroxychloroquine also exerts a protective effect on survival.

Methods

Patients with SLE from the multiethnic LUMINA (LUpus in MInorities: NAture vs nurture) cohort were studied. A case-control study was performed within the context of this cohort in which deceased patients (cases) were matched for disease duration (within 6 months) with alive patients (controls) in a proportion of 3:1. Survival was the outcome of interest. Propensity scores were derived by logistic regression to adjust for confounding by indication as patients with SLE with milder disease manifestations are more likely to be prescribed hydroxychloroquine. A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the risk of death and hydroxychloroquine use with and without the propensity score as the adjustment variable.

Results

There were 608 patients, of whom 61 had died (cases). Hydroxychloroquine had a protective effect on survival (OR 0.128 (95% CI 0.054 to 0.301 for hydroxychloroquine alone and OR 0.319 (95% CI 0.118 to 0.864) after adding the propensity score). As expected, the propensity score itself was also protective.

Conclusions

Hydroxychloroquine, which overall is well tolerated by patients with SLE, has a protective effect on survival which is evident even after taking into consideration the factors associated with treatment decisions. This information is of importance to all clinicians involved in the care of patients with SLE.

### Predictors of persistent disease activity and long quiescence in systemic lupus erythematosus: results from the hopkins lupus cohort [^113wB2UQ]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study identified prognostic factors of persistent activity and long quiescence in the Hopkins Lupus Cohort. This is the first study to predict persistent patterns of disease activity based on assessment of M-SLEDAI on at least three time points per year. Clinically relevant information regarding the role of treatment, ethnicity, education and disease activity at baseline on the development of discrete disease activity patterns is derived from the analysis.

The most striking finding of this study is that the use of hydroxychloroquine ever during early disease course is significantly and independently associated with a lower risk of expressing persistent activity early in the course of SLE. This association approached statistical significance (p = 0.06) even when hydroxychloroquine was applied in the univariate analysis as a treatment option received on the longer part of the aforementioned time period (≥ 75% of visits in three consecutive years following baseline). It is undoubtedly difficult to evaluate the role of treatment on disease activity patterns because of reverse causality; disease course influences treatment decisions and vice versa. Persistent activity may lead to more aggressive therapy, and, likewise, lack of disease activity may result in cutting down treatment. This can explain the significantly lower percentage of pLQ patients receiving prednisone (≥ 75% of visits; 30.5%, p < 0.001). This is not the case, however, with hydroxychloroquine, as it is regarded as a basic therapeutic factor in SLE and is recommended to patients with SLE irrespectively of disease activity. The role of hydroxychloroquine as an immunomodulator with benefits in specific disease manifestations such as cutaneous disease, nephritis and thrombosis but also in the prevention of SLE and reduction of flares has been confirmed in a number of studies and recently reviewed. Our data confirm that hydroxychloroquine contributes to a favourable disease course in an early stage by reducing persistent activity measured by a validate disease instrument.

### Clinical significance of monitoring hydroxychloroquine levels in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115sg8d3]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite the pivotal role that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plays in treating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), less than 50% of patients take HCQ as prescribed. Measurement of HCQ blood levels can help clinicians distinguish nonadherence versus lack of efficacy of HCQ. Our objective was to systematically review publications and perform a meta-analysis to examine the correlation between HCQ levels and 1) nonadherence and 2) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores, in SLE.

Methods

A comprehensive search was performed. We included observational and interventional studies that measured HCQ levels and assessed adherence or SLEDAI scores in adults with SLE. Forest plots compared pooled estimates of correlations between HCQ levels and reported nonadherence or SLEDAI scores.

Results

Among 604 studies screened, 17 were reviewed. We found 3-times higher odds of reported nonadherence in patients with low HCQ levels (odds ratio 2.95 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.63, 5.35], P < 0.001). The mean SLEDAI score was 3.14 points higher in groups with below-threshold HCQ levels on a priori analysis (δ = 3.14 [95% CI -0.05, 6.23], P = 0.053), and 1.4 points higher in groups with HCQ levels of < 500 ng/ml (δ = 1.42 [95% CI 0.07, 2.76], P = 0.039). Among 1,223 patients, those with HCQ levels ≥ 750 ng/ml had a 58% lower risk of active disease, and their SLEDAI score was 3.2 points lower.

Conclusion

We found a strong association between low HCQ levels and reported nonadherence. Our results suggest that HCQ levels of ≥ 750 ng/ml might be a potential therapeutic target.

### Therapeutic hydroxychloroquine blood levels are associated with fewer hospitalizations and possible reduction of health disparities in lupus [^116jzFU1]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

However, nonadherence is complex, and often, multiple factors drive nonadherence and rates of acute care for patients with lupus. For example, a prior robust RCT noted no reduction in SLE flares after adapting HCQ dose by HCQ blood level over a seven‐month follow‐up (cite PLUS). This highlights that a multifaceted approach might be necessary to address nonadherence and to reduce rates of requiring acute care, although HCQ level monitoring may bridge some outcome disparities in patients with lupus. To develop such a multifaceted approach, it is critical to understand patients' perspectives on facilitators and barriers to adherence. For example, drug level monitoring and how to approach and address low HCQ blood levels in clinics using shared decision‐making could aid optimal HCQ reception. Therefore, a mixed‐methods study, including an RCT and a qualitative study, is needed to guide effective use of HCQ level monitoring in diverse clinical settings.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^112LvQHU]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Forest plot showing associations between baseline characteristics and each secondary outcome among patients: A, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) tapering; B, HCQ discontinuation; and C, HCQ maintenance. Baseline medication use represents whether patients were taking the drug at time zero. Variables are adjusted concomitantly for all others. Omitted lines indicate that no event occurred among exposed patients. Dx = diagnosis; SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus; SLEDAI‐2K = Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000.

The results of sensitivity analyses where we reassigned the date that the patients tapered/stopped HCQ from the first study visit where the reduction/stop was originally recorded to a date 6 months prior (i.e. half‐way between study visits) were consistent with the primary analyses (see Supplementary Table 1, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at), as were the results leaving patients without hospitalization information out from the analysis (see Supplementary Table 2).

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^114bDZfK]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In both tapering and discontinuation cohorts, we observed a negative association between a baseline SLEDAI‐2K score of ≥ 4 and the specific outcome related to "increase in SLEDAI‐2K score". This finding may represent a ceiling effect of the SLEDAI‐2K assessment tool, which prevented the detection of a worsening in disease activity in patients with a baseline SLEDAI‐2K score of ≥ 4, and/or a regression toward the mean, where more active patients with SLE may get better over time, and less active patients may get worse.

Non‐White patients were more likely than White patients to have poor outcomes in all 3 cohorts. This finding was especially true in Black patients discontinuing HCQ, Asian patients tapering HCQ, and First Nations patients remaining on HCQ. Non‐White patients, especially Black and First Nations patients, not only may have more severe SLE due to innate disease characteristics, but may also face barriers to optimal health outcomes, including access to care issues (even in the context of Canada's comprehensive health care system, which does not cover the cost of out‐of‐hospital medications for all individuals) and poor medication adherence. In general, non‐White patients with SLE may have poorer outcomes due to sociocultural and psychosocial issues, including a higher risk for flares. As mentioned before, patients possibly discontinued the drug against physician advice; those patients may also have been nonadherent with other medications and physician advice, which could explain the findings of higher flare risk with Black patients who discontinued HCQ.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^1172ZHCB]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge important potential limitations in the current study. First, due to its exploratory nature, we did not adjust our analyses for multiple comparisons. Therefore, subsequent research with preplanned hypotheses should be conducted to confirm the observed associations. Second, data on HCQ use before the beginning of the study were not available, and the variable "time on HCQ" was calculated using the study entry date, which may underestimate the real time of exposure. We estimate that the real duration of HCQ may be approximately 2 years less than SLE duration, since patients usually start HCQ therapy 2 years after SLE diagnosis. Third, we do not know for sure the reasons for reducing the dose or discontinuing HCQ. Therefore, drawing conclusions about effectiveness of HCQ by comparing the 3 cohorts is not possible, although patients remaining on HCQ had a significantly lower outcome rate than those tapering or discontinuing HCQ. In addition, although the identified demographic and baseline factors are warning signs of patients who might not do well on a taper/discontinuation independently of the reason, the reason for tapering/stopping HCQ may influence later flare risk and/or the reason for subsequent therapy augmentation. As mentioned before, HCQ tapering may have occurred because the patient was doing well (stable disease), or because the physician was following the 2016 AAO recommendations. HCQ discontinuation, on the other hand, may be due to retinal toxicity or the patient's choice (nonadherence), besides the cases where patients were in prolonged disease remission.

### Low-dose belimumab for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus at low disease activity: protocol for a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^115YCNZK]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods and analysis

Study design

This multicentre, China-based, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will be carried out at four centres in Shanghai, China. The study is aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of low-dose belimumab in patients with lupus with low disease activity for prevention of disease flares. We hypothesise that there will be a reduced flare rate in low-dose belimumab arm compared with placebo arm within 52 weeks. Considering that the belimumab is 120 mg per vial, and the average body weight of Asian population is around 60 kg, thus a fix dose of 120 mg belimumab, that is, approximately 2 mg/kg is administrated in this study. Belimumab and placebo will be given intravenously until week 48. The observation period is 52 weeks.

The trial began recruitment in March 2021.

Study population

Patients with SLE aged 18 years or older, fulfilled the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics criteriaand manifested low disease activity, defined as Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment–Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI)score ≤ 6 at the time of enrolment, no British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)A score and at most one BILAG B score, will be included. All candidates receive a stable treatment of no more than 20 mg per day prednisone, hydroxychloroquine or immunosuppressive agents for more than 30 days. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in box 1.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Data sources

Our study combined data from 5 clinical SLE cohorts in Canada (McGill University Health Centre [MUHC] in Montreal, CHU de Québec–Université Laval in Quebec City, Dalhousie University in Halifax, University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, and the Southern Alberta Registry for Lupus Erythematosus at the University of Calgary). The cohorts enrolled unselected patients age ≥ 18 years who met American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE at the time that they presented to each center (including both incident and prevalent cases). The enrollment and follow‐up period spanned January 1999 to January 2019.

Data on demographic, medication, and clinical variables were collected in a standardized manner at enrollment as well as annually and were submitted to the coordinating center at the MUHC for data harmonization. Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional review boards at all participating sites.

### Interventions for cutaneous disease in systemic lupus erythematosus [^112Sxet4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Cutaneous disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is common. Many interventions are used to treat SLE with varying efficacy, risks, and benefits.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for cutaneous disease in SLE.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Wiley Interscience Online Library, and Biblioteca Virtual em Saude (Virtual Health Library). We updated our search in September 2020, but these results have not yet been fully incorporated.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for cutaneous disease in SLE compared with placebo, another intervention, no treatment, or different doses of the same intervention. We did not evaluate trials of cutaneous lupus in people without a diagnosis of SLE.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete and partial clinical response. Secondary outcomes included reduction (or change) in number of clinical flares; and severe and minor adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

Sixty-one RCTs, involving 11,232 participants, reported 43 different interventions. Trials predominantly included women from outpatient clinics; the mean age range of participants was 20 to 40 years. Twenty-five studies reported baseline severity, and 22 studies included participants with moderate to severe cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE); duration of CLE was not well reported. Studies were conducted mainly in multi-centre settings. Most often treatment duration was 12 months. Risk of bias was highest for the domain of reporting bias, followed by performance/detection bias. We identified too few studies for meta-analysis for most comparisons. We limited this abstract to main comparisons (all administered orally) and outcomes. We did not identify clinical trials of other commonly used treatments, such as topical corticosteroids, that reported complete or partial clinical response or numbers of clinical flares. Complete clinical response Studies comparing oral hydroxychloroquine against placebo did not report complete clinical response. Chloroquine may increase complete clinical response at 12 months' follow-up compared with placebo (absence of skin lesions) (risk ratio (RR) 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 2.61; 1 study, 24 participants; low-quality evidence). There may be little to no difference between methotrexate and chloroquine in complete clinical response (skin rash resolution) at 6 months' follow-up (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.50; 1 study, 25 participants; low-quality evidence). Methotrexate may be superior to placebo with regard to complete clinical response (absence of malar/discoid rash) at 6 months' follow-up (RR 3.57, 95% CI 1.63 to 7.84; 1 study, 41 participants; low-quality evidence). At 12 months' follow-up, there may be little to no difference between azathioprine and ciclosporin in complete clinical response (malar rash resolution) (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.52; 1 study, 89 participants; low-quality evidence). Partial clinical response Partial clinical response was reported for only one key comparison: hydroxychloroquine may increase partial clinical response at 12 months compared to placebo, but the 95% CI indicates that hydroxychloroquine may make no difference or may decrease response (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.41 to 120.16; 20 pregnant participants, 1 trial; low-quality evidence). Clinical flares Clinical flares were reported for only two key comparisons: hydroxychloroquine is probably superior to placebo at 6 months' follow-up for reducing clinical flares (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89; 1 study, 47 participants; moderate-quality evidence). At 12 months' follow-up, there may be no difference between methotrexate and placebo, but the 95% CI indicates there may be more or fewer flares with methotrexate (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.83; 1 study, 86 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events Data for adverse events were limited and were inconsistently reported, but hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and methotrexate have well-documented adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, liver problems, and retinopathy for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and teratogenicity during pregnancy for methotrexate.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence supports the commonly-used treatment hydroxychloroquine, and there is also evidence supporting chloroquine and methotrexate for treating cutaneous disease in SLE. Evidence is limited due to the small number of studies reporting key outcomes. Evidence for most key outcomes was low or moderate quality, meaning findings should be interpreted with caution. Head-to-head intervention trials designed to detect differences in efficacy between treatments for specific CLE subtypes are needed. Thirteen further trials are awaiting classification and have not yet been incorporated in this review; they may alter the review conclusions.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^117Qnvym]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis — adjunctive management and risk context: Practice Point 10.2.1.1 states that adjunctive therapies to manage lupus nephritis (LN) and attenuate complications of the disease or its treatments should be considered for all patients, as outlined in Figure 3. Data from multiple observational cohort studies show various benefits of hydroxychloroquine treatment in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including reduced flare and organ damage accrual with a relatively low rate of drug-related adverse effects such as ocular toxicity, and despite relatively low-certainty evidence this balance provides the basis for recommending its use as part of general management in SLE. Patients with SLE and LN show increased mortality versus age- and sex-matched controls, with infections, cardiovascular complications, and chronic kidney disease (especially kidney failure) as major causes of death, and early deaths related to infections or lupus activity while later deaths relate to cardiovascular, malignant complications, or kidney failure.

Results

Treatments with disease modification potential: year 1 outcomes

To demonstrate disease modification potential, outcomes at year 1 required fulfilment of one or more of the following criteria: (1) a significant reduction in disease activity (measured using a validated tool — for example, SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), or British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG), or a composite index, such as the SLE Responder Index-4); (2) significant reduction in severe flare using a validated tool (ie, Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-SLEDAI Flare Index (SFI) or BILAG); and (3) a reduction in use of glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressants (table 1). The reduction in glucocorticoid use required a taper to ≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone-equivalent, as per the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) SLE treatment recommendations (NB: updated 2023 recommendations, which suggest a taper to ≤ 5 mg/day, became available after these criteria were proposed) and the Lupus Low Disease Activity State definition.

Table 1
Application of the proposed matrix for non-renal disease activity and organ damage disease modification criteria

Glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine, cyclophosphamide, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus, abatacept, belimumab, anifrolumaband rituximabmet year 1 criterion 1 of a reduction in disease activity (table 1). Of these, belimumaband anifrolumabmet all three criteria for disease modification potential at year 1, and rituximab also showed a reduction in the number of severe SFI criteria at 6 months versus baseline after the first course, thereby meeting two of the criteria at year 1. Glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, methotrexate, MMF, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, abatacept and rituximab had inconclusive evidence for other year 1 criteria (for a full list of publications examined, please see online supplemental tables 1–5). Glucocorticoid and hydroxychloroquine studies involved comparisons of reduced dose versus higher dose, or withdrawal versus maintenance, which are challenging to match directly with the criteria for disease modification potential. Glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine were therefore classified as inconclusive for criterion 2 at year 1.

### Combination of clinical factors predicts successful glucocorticoid withdrawal in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): results from a multicentre, retrospective cohort study [^115PHuC2]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

We identified a combination of clinical criteria — LLDAS/DORIS attainment, hydroxychloroquine use and gradual GC dose reduction over > 6 months — associated with the lowest flare incidence on GC withdrawal, while also minimising damage accrual. This is line with findings from the Toronto Lupus Clinicand the Asia-Pacific Lupus Collaborationdemonstrating that, in patients with clinically inactive SLE, successful GC withdrawal (based on slow prednisone tapering) may also prevent damage. We highlight the importance of a coordinated care plan based on: (1) treat-to-target approach, aiming for remission or low disease activity using conventional and/or biological agents as needed, use of hydroxychloroquine as an 'anchor' drug and (3) regular monitoring and tapering of GC. Prospective studies should verify the effectiveness of combining these criteria in maximising flare-free and damage-free prognosis in patients with SLE who taper and discontinue GCs.

Limitations of our study include its observational nature, although data were collected prospectively. Despite other comparable characteristics, patients who did not discontinue GCs had a higher frequency of serological activity at inclusion compared with those who withdrew, which may have introduced some unmeasured confounding or bias. While the follow-up period was extended to the end of 2022, the use of belimumab was still limited, and newer biologics like anifrolumab were unavailable. Moreover, we did not evaluate factors related to flares such as medication adherence (including monitoring blood hydroxychloroquine levels). Last, the predominance of moderate/severe disease, white race and low prevalence of certain manifestations, such as nephritis, may limit the generalisability of our results.

In conclusion, withdrawing GCs in patients with SLE poses a risk of relapse, highlighting the importance of vigilant clinical monitoring. Nevertheless, this hazard can be lowered in patients who achieve remission or low disease activity, use hydroxychloroquine and follow a gradual GC dose-reduction plan. A strategy incorporating these factors may enable successful tapering and withdrawal, pending confirmation in future studies. Patients with arthritis or mucocutaneous involvement are especially prone to flares and may benefit from such risk-mitigation measures, as well as the early use of novel biologic agents with disease-modifying potential. These findings might be helpful to guide future updates of SLE management recommendations.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^114CAafM]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Non-adherence by HCQ blood levels

Poor therapeutic adherence, reflected by at least one HCQ concentration ≤ 100 ng/mL value, was found in 17 (20%) patients. The proportion of non-adherent patients by drug level was 23% (10 of 42) in patients with a prescribed HCQ dose of ≤ 5 mg/kg/day and 17% (7 of 41) in patients with a prescribed HCQ dose of > 5 mg/kg/day. Non-adherent patients differed from the other patients only for age at SLE diagnosis (20 ± 8.5 vs 27 ± 11.3 p = 0.01) and concomitant immunosuppressant therapy (13 of 17 vs 10 of 66; p < 0.0001). Patients labelled as non-adherent at study entry showed at T6 a significant higher HCQ blood concentration than baseline (median 0 ng/mL (range 0–99.4 ng/mL) vs median 515 ng/mL (range 0–1682 ng/mL); p < 0.0001). Since our results could be influenced by the lowest non-therapeutic HCQ levels found in non-adherent patients, we excluded such patients from the analysis. Of the 66 patients enrolled, 34 (42%) patients had mean HCQ value in therapeutic range, 31 (37%) were considered partially adherent and patients who had levels greater than 2000 ng/mL considered in supratherapeutic range.

Demographic, clinical and laboratory features of patients

All the remaining 66 patients were Caucasian, mostly female (99%), with a mean age of 42 (± 11.2) years and a mean SLE duration of 15.7 (± 9.02) years. The entire population had a median SLEDAI of 2 (range 0–4) and a median SLICC of 0 (range 0–2). The median time of remission was 2 (1–11) years. Previous renal involvement has been observed in 31 (47%). Glucocorticoid therapy was taken by 33 (50%) patients, while 17 (26%) of them were on immunosuppressants. No one has taken oral or intravenous cyclophosphamide. The median HCQ treatment duration was 5 (0–32) years with median HCQ levels of 512.6 ng/mL (range 104.4–3105.6). Demographic, clinical and therapeutic features of the patients enrolled are illustrated in table 1.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^115rRyxc]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) — antimalarial therapy is directed as follows: Recommendation 10.2.1.1 states, "We recommend that patients with SLE, including those with lupus nephritis (LN), be treated with hydroxychloroquine or an equivalent antimalarial unless contraindicated (1C)". Hydroxychloroquine use in pregnancy "has been associated with a decrease in lupus activity and a satisfactory safety profile in both the mother and the fetus". Evidence from a 24‑week RCT reported a higher incidence of SLE flares after stopping hydroxychloroquine, with "a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.50 (95% CI: 1.08–5.58)", and "Two observational studies reported an association between hydroxychloroquine treatment and reduced mortality in patients with LN, but the certainty of evidence for this outcome is very low". Safety screening notes that "Assessment of G6PD levels should be performed in men, especially those of African, Asian, and Middle Eastern origin, before starting hydroxychloroquine". For ocular monitoring, guidelines "do not recommend baseline examination prior to initiating treatment", and "yearly monitoring should begin after 1 year of therapy in patients with additional risk factors (concomitant tamoxifen use; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2; dose of hydroxychloroquine > 5 mg/kg/d; use of chloroquine) or after 5 years of therapy otherwise". Retinopathy risk is quantified as "affecting 0.5% after 6 years of treatment, increasing to 7.5% in long-term users in general, and could be > 20% when treatment duration is over 20 years". Dosing guidance states, "The recommended starting dose of hydroxychloroquine is around 5 mg/kg/d (≤ 2.3 mg/kg/d for chloroquine). Doses of 2–3 mg/kg/d may not achieve adequate blood levels", and "a blood hydroxychloroquine level above 0.6 mg/l may be associated with a lower risk of LN flare". Renal adjustment is specified: "In patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the dose of hydroxychloroquine should be reduced by ≥ 25%". Resource considerations note that hydroxychloroquine "can be an expensive drug in some countries", and in low‑resource settings chloroquine may be considered, "but the increased risk of toxicity of the latter should be noted".

### Combination of clinical factors predicts successful glucocorticoid withdrawal in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): results from a multicentre, retrospective cohort study [^114nJr9v]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 4
Incidence of adverse outcomes in patients with SLE who discontinued GCs, while meeting or not the flare-protective clinical conditions, compared with those with continuous GC use. Poisson-derived estimates of incidence rates for organ damage accrual (A), total flares (B) and severe flares (C) in patients with SLE with continuous use of GCs and counterparts who discontinued GC and either met the specified flare-protective clinical conditions (attainment of DORIS or LLDAS at the time of GC withdrawal, use of hydroxychloroquine for at least 50% of follow-up time, gradual tapering of GC from a prednisone-equivalent of 7.5 mg/day to complete withdrawal over a period of more than 6 months) or not. IRRs have been calculated using GC non-withdrawers as reference. DORIS, definition of remission; GC, glucocorticoid; IRRs, Incidence rate ratios; LLDAS, Lupus Low Disease Activity State; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus.

Furthermore, we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) for preventing or inducing, respectively, adverse outcomes following GC discontinuation. Using the group that continued GC as a reference, GC withdrawal under flare-protective criteria had a NNT of 9.3 to prevent a 1-unit SDI increase, while withdrawal without such criteria had a NNT of 12.5. For severe flares, GC withdrawal under flare-protective criteria had a NNT of 13.4 to prevent one, whereas withdrawal without such criteria had a NNH of 12 to induce one. Collectively, patients with SLE who, prior to GC discontinuation, achieve LLDAS or DORIS, use hydroxychloroquine, and have gradually tapered GCs, exhibit the most favourable balance of mitigated risk for flaring and minimised organ damage on GC withdrawal.

Patients who fulfilled ≥ 4 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE and had been treated with HCQ for > 6 months were studied. Blood was assayed for HCQ levels by tandem mass spectrometry. Patients were serially assessed for disease activity, using the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA) version of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and flares (SELENA flares instrument). Comparison of the mean summated SLEDAI scores over time and rates of flares in groups with different HCQ levels was performed by the Kruskal-Wallis test.

Results

A total of 276 SLE patients were studied (93% women, mean ± SD age 41.0 ± 13.8 years). The proportion of patients with HCQ levels < 10 (total noncompliance), 10–500 (subtherapeutic), and > 500 ng/ml (therapeutic) was 11%, 77%, and 12%, respectively. HCQ levels correlated significantly with the prescribed dose but not with body weight or renal function. The prescribed HCQ dose also correlated significantly with baseline SLEDAI scores, indicating that higher doses were used for more active manifestations. After a mean ± SD observation period of 32.5 ± 5.5 months, the mean summated SLEDAI score and the incidence of SLE flares was not statistically different among patients with different baseline HCQ levels. In a subgroup of 73 patients with serologic and clinical remission and having therapeutic HCQ levels, a trend of lower disease activity and fewer incidences of flares was observed.

Conclusion

Noncompliance and subtherapeutic serum HCQ levels were seen frequently in these SLE patients, which was partly due to the low prescribed dose. In patients in remission, higher HCQ concentrations were associated with a trend showing fewer flares over time.

### Combination of clinical factors predicts successful glucocorticoid withdrawal in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): results from a multicentre, retrospective cohort study [^115WggBQ]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Effect of coadministered treatments on the risk for overall and severe flares after GC withdrawal in patients with SLE. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall (left panel) and severe (right panel) flare-free probabilities across subgroups of patients who were treated with various agents for at least 50% of the follow-up period (starting from the time of GC discontinuation until the occurrence of a flare, or last follow-up if no flare occurred). (A) Antimalarial use was associated with a significantly decreased risk of both overall and severe flares. (B, C) The use of mycophenolate and azathioprine was associated with a significantly reduced risk of overall flares. (D) A GC tapering and withdrawal speed greater than 6 months was protective against the risk for severe flares (blue line indicates patients from GC ≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone-equivalent up to withdrawal greater than 6 months). P values were obtained from the corresponding log-rank test. GC, glucocorticoid; HCQ, hydroxychloroquine; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus.

The rate of GC tapering, especially at doses below 10 mg/day prednisone-equivalent, until complete withdrawal, may impact the risk of flares in patients with SLE. To address this, we associated the time spent from the dose of 7.5 mg/day (the GC criterion in the LLDAS definition) until complete withdrawal with the subsequent risk of flare. Standardised log-rank statistic identified 6 months' duration as the critical cut-off below which the risk of flares changes significantly (online supplemental figure S4). A tapering duration of more than 6 months prior to GC withdrawal protected against severe flares (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.90; p = 0.015) compared with faster tapering (≤ 6 months) (figure 2). This effect was not altered according to the concomitant use of immunosuppressives during the 6 month period before or after GC discontinuation (online supplemental figure S5). We also examined the impact of the duration and cumulative dosage of GC prior to withdrawal (online supplemental table S4), and the use of intravenous methylprednisolone (pulse) ≥ 500 mg (administered within 3 months prior to withdrawal) (online supplemental table S6) but found no significant association with subsequent flare risk.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^114CZcrr]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Although our study was originally motivated by the desire to better understand personalized therapy in SLE, our findings take on new importance in the current setting, where physicians and patients may face shortages of HCQ, due to interest in this drug as a potential therapy for COVID‐19. Although current evidence shows that HCQ is not effective for COVID‐19, patients in many countries, including the US, Brazil, and India, are still using HCQ to prevent or treat the infection. In addition, HCQ shortages may occur in other circumstances, such as the prolonged manufacturing shortage faced by the US in 2015. Moreover, stopping HCQ by choice is not that rare; studies have shown that over 30% of patients with SLE discontinue HCQ by choice.

In this clinical cohort of patients with SLE exposed to HCQ, we observed that multiple demographic and baseline clinical factors are associated with poor outcomes, such as an increase in disease activity and a need for therapy augmentation, after HCQ taper/discontinuation. Tapering HCQ in Asian patients with SLE or when the patient is still on prednisone or with a SLEDAI‐2K score of ≥ 4 may result in poorer outcomes. Discontinuing HCQ may be associated with poorer outcomes in Black patients with SLE, and patients age ≤ 25 years at SLE diagnosis. None of these factors were associated with the outcome among those maintaining HCQ, although First Nations patients and baseline immunosuppressive use were.

### Effect of hydroxychloroquine on pregnancy outcome in patients with SLE: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1134XGEg]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an antimalarial drug employed in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Prior studies reported inconsistent results regarding the association between HCQ use during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of HCQ on pregnancy-related outcomes in women with SLE.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search for studies associating pregnancy outcomes with HCQ use in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang database and VIP from inception to 22 September 2022. Random or fixed effect models were used to estimate the pooled effect based on I 2 measurement of heterogeneity.

Results

Twenty-one studies were included, encompassing 929 and 1031 patients in HCQ and non-HCQ groups, respectively. We found that HCQ use was significantly associated with reduced risks of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores (second trimester: mean difference (MD) -1.80, 95% CI -2.46 to -1.13; third trimester: MD -2.30, 95% CI -3.31 to -1.29), flare (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.97), preterm birth (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.72), intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.72), gestational hypertension (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.42), pre-eclampsia (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.72). In contrast, a positive correlation was observed between full-term birth and HCQ use (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.52 to 2.65). However, the result for disease flare exhibited high heterogeneity (p = 0.01, I² = 59%). In addition, publication bias was detected in the meta-analysis of full-term birth using the Egger's test.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis offers a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between disease activity, pregnancy-related outcomes and HCQ use, providing supportive evidence for the therapeutic effectiveness of HCQ in pregnant women with SLE.

### Belimumab and antimalarials combined against renal flares in patients treated for extra-renal systemic lupus erythematosus: results from 4 phase III clinical trials [^114gzuM9]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a heterogeneous systemic autoimmune disease that can affect various tissues. Up to 60% of patients with SLE develop kidney involvement during their disease course, and LN constitutes one of the most serious manifestations, remaining today a substantial cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), dialysis and mortality. Prompt and adequate treatment of LN as well as prevention of renal flares are therefore key components of disease management towards improved outcomes in SLE patients. The treatment armamentarium for LN includes antimalarial agents (AMA), glucocorticoids, synthetic immunosuppressants, calcineurin inhibitors, and, more recently, monoclonal antibodies such as belimumab.

The 2019 EULAR recommendations for the management of SLE and the 2019 EULAR/European Renal Association–European Dialysis and Transplantation Association (ERA–EDTA) recommendations for the management of LN advocate for long-term use of hydroxychloroquine in all patients with LN unless contraindicated. However, as commented upon in the systematic literature review performed to inform these recommendations, studies addressing the effect of AMA on preventing renal flares are scarce and conflicting. Concerning biological agents, the 2019 EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommendations suggest considering belimumab as an add-on to standard therapy, and rituximab in refractory disease.

Belimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the B-cell activating factor (BAFF; also known as B lymphocyte stimulator, BLyS). Belimumab has been approved as an add-on therapy for adult patients with active, autoantibody positive SLE, as well as for the treatment of active LN, after demonstrating efficacy in several phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Secondary analyses of the BLISS-LN trial — that comprised 446 patients with active, biopsy-proven LN — showed that i.v. belimumab was associated with a 55% reduced risk of renal flares compared with placebo. However, the effect of belimumab on preventing renal flares is less clear in patients treated for active extra-renal SLE, with one investigation reporting a numerical but not statistically significant benefit from belimumab, presumably due to power limitations. Furthermore, different case series and cohort studies have reported cases of de novo LN in patients treated with belimumab for reasons other than nephritis, which suggests that belimumab may not provide sufficient protection against renal involvement in some patients, e.g. those who are prone to or at high risk for LN.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^114cP8Kn]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Among 1,389 individuals receiving care in the participating lupus clinics between January 1999 and January 2019, 1,344 (96.8%) were exposed to HCQ (Figure 1). We identified 398 patients (1,740 person‐years) who reduced the HCQ dose, and 395 (2,120 person‐years) who discontinued HCQ. Among those who maintained HCQ therapy (n = 629), 395 patients (792 person‐years) were successfully matched to patients tapering or discontinuing HCQ therapy on previous disease duration and time on HCQ. Overall, a total of 240 patients were lost to follow‐up, 62 withdrew consent, and 35 died during the follow‐up. All these patients were censored at the corresponding times.

Figure 1
Cohort selection. SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus.

The baseline characteristics of each of the 3 cohorts of patients with SLE are shown in Table 1. As expected, approximately 90% of the participants were female, and most were White. The primary composite outcome occurred in 261 of the 398 patients who tapered HCQ (35.7 events per 100 person‐years [95% CI 31.6–40.3]), in 226 of the 395 patients who discontinued HCQ (29.0 per 100 person‐years [95% CI 25.5–33.0]), and in 97 of the 395 patients who remained on HCQ (16.1 events per 100 person‐years [95% CI 13.2–19.6]).

### Treatment trends of systemic lupus erythematosus from 2007 to 2023 in the USA [^113rYHfX]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease characterised by inflammation and immune-mediated damage to any organ system or tissue. The incidence and prevalence have risen during the past decades, reaching 6.44 per 100 000 population and 97.4 per 100 000 population, respectively.SLE manifestations can lead to permanent organ damage and loss of function and among the goals of treatment for patients with SLE are the control of the disease manifestations, and the minimisation of damage secondary to medications and their side effects.

Among the current guidelines, there is agreement that all patients with SLE should use antimalarials, as well as glucocorticoids at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration. If a persistent high dose of glucocorticoids is needed, other immunosuppressants should be introduced as steroid-sparing agents. In general, given the body of evidence about the benefits of antimalarials prolonging life expectancy, decreasing risks of flares and damageand the described safety profile of long-term use of glucocorticoids, these recommendations could be considered 'good practice', and have been incorporated as a measure of quality of care in SLE by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). However, no contemporary clinical practice guidelines for SLE are issued by the ACR. Moreover, the treatment recommendations for patients with SLE have incorporated new strategies with combinations of immunosuppressants for severe or refractory cases. It is unknown if these recommendations in treatment have been incorporated in the USA.

Through a nationally representative SLE cohort, we aimed to characterise the pharmacological treatment patterns of patients with SLE.

### Clinical impact of hydroxychloroquine dose adjustment according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines in systemic lupus erythematosus [^113rCEck]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study suggests that the adjustment of HCQ daily dose to ≤ 5 mg/kg/day of actual body weight does not have a significant impact on the short-term and mid-term outcomes of patients with SLE. Nevertheless, further studies including a larger number of patients and longer follow-up are necessary to reach further conclusions.

### Preventing organ damage in systemic lupus erythematosus: the impact of early biological treatment [^112iz2Rz]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One of the most important aims in the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is to avoid or delay the accumulation of organ damage. The first five years after diagnosis are crucial for prognosis.

Areas Covered

This manuscript reviews available data on organ damage accrual in SLE and early therapeutic intervention as a possible strategy to prevent its long-term accrual.

Expert Opinion

Organ damage can be minimized by controlling disease activity and risk of flares, reducing the dose of glucocorticoids, and ensuring a proper therapeutic intervention with an early introduction of the right therapies. The current standard treatment cannot provide clinical remission in all patients with SLE. Therefore, there is a clinical need for introducing new therapeutic strategies able to achieve the main therapeutic objectives. The addition of biologic and other therapeutic agents to the standard of care is effective for controlling disease activity and for preventing severe flares, enabling a reduced use of glucocorticoids, and presumably reducing organ damage progression. Considering its efficacy and safety, early inclusion of biologic agents in the first lines of the treatment algorithm, at least in certain patients, could be considered as an innovative treatment approach to decrease disease burden in SLE patients.

The majority of patients with SLE in the USA have been prescribed hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Given more recent guidelines, the availability of only one strength (200 mg tablets) may limit the flexibility and ability to accurately dose patients with lupus. The Lupus Foundation of America undertook a survey to assess the current landscape of HCQ tolerability and adherence.

### Recent findings about antimalarials in cutaneous lupus erythematosus: what dermatologists should know [^115Lb1Fv]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Antimalarials (AMs), particularly hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ), are the cornerstone of the treatment for both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). HCQ and CQ are recommended as first-line oral agents in all CLE guidelines. Initially thought to have potential therapeutic effects against COVID-19, HCQ has drawn significant attention in recent years, highlighting concerns over its potential toxicity among patients and physicians. This review aims to consolidate current evidence on the efficacy of AMs in CLE. Our focus will be on optimizing therapeutic strategies, such as switching from HCQ to CQ, adding quinacrine to either HCQ or CQ, or adjusting HCQ dose based on blood concentration. Additionally, we will explore the potential for HCQ dose reduction or discontinuation in cases of CLE or SLE remission. Our review will focus on the existing evidence regarding adverse events linked to AM usage, with a specific emphasis on severe events and those of particular interest to dermatologists. Last, we will discuss the optimal HCQ dose and the balance between preventing CLE or SLE flares and minimizing toxicity.

### New therapeutic strategies in systemic lupus erythematosus management [^111VhtuQ]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

The current treatment approach for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as outlined in the recommendations by international medical associations including EULAR and the ACR, is mostly eminence-based rather than evidence-based. However, knowledge on SLE is growing quickly, and such new advances need to be translated into clinical practice. Questions remain regarding the choice and timing of drug administration and tapering until withdrawal, which both can affect the balance between the control of disease activity and damage to organs triggered by long-standing and/or disproportionate immunosuppression. Currently, the treating physicians of patients with SLE are required to weigh the present with the future situation of their patients in an optimized balance between therapeutic harm and benefit. In this Review, the available therapeutic strategies and main challenges in the approach to SLE treatment are discussed. Remission and low disease activity are desirable therapeutic goals. Although the drug armamentarium for SLE has not expanded much in the past few decades, there are nonetheless opportunities to make better choices and explore combination therapies; such opportunities offer the potential of a personalized medicine strategy.

### Hydroxychloroquine dose and the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus flares… [^1154sACr]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine prevents systemic lupus erythematosus flares and is recommended for all patients with SLE. 1 However, its long-term toxicity includes retinopathy, particularly at doses greater than 5 mg/kg per day. 2 This dose-dependent risk led to 2016 ophthalmology guidelines3 and subsequent rheumatology recommendations1 to avoid prescribing hydroxychloroquine doses greater than 5 mg/kg per day. We assessed the association of this dose threshold on lupus flares. We used conditional logistic regression analysis, matched within a patient, to assess the association of hydroxychloroquine dose over the prior 6 months with the risk of lupus flares, adjusting for glucocorticoid use, immunosuppressant use, and disease activity prior to each period. We repeated the analysis limited to moderate or severe flares, with mild flares included as control periods.

We conducted subgroup analyses by SLE duration, history of lupus nephritis, and baseline SLEDAI score. To characterize the dose-response trend for the risk of lupus flares, we used restricted cubic splines to generate a smoothed dose odds ratio curve. We used SAS version 9.
4. Statistical significance was set at a 2-sided P <.
05. The mean baseline clinical SLEDAI score was 3. 5; 25 had lupus nephritis, 72 used glucocorticoids, and 80 used oral immunosuppressants. The corresponding AORs were similar across subgroups but only reached significance for patients with baseline SLEDAI scores of 4 or less. The smoothed dose OR curve indicated an apparent threshold near 5 mg/kg per day of hydroxychloroquine for an increased risk of flares.

In this case-crossover study within a contemporary SLE cohort, hydroxychloroquine dosing of 5 mg/kg per day or less, in accordance with current ophthalmology and rheumatology guidelines, was associated with a higher risk of lupus flares, including moderate or severe flares. Furthermore, the dose trend analysis also suggested an apparent threshold near 5 mg/kg per day.

### Candidate drug replacements for quinacrine in cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^112YwwDS]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with SLE are often treated with hydroxychloroquine in an uninterrupted fashion long-term in part to mitigate the life-threatening comorbidities of SLE. However, in patients with CLE who respond to hydroxychloroquine, it is sometimes withdrawn after 6–12 months of therapy to be restarted at the time of the next flare of skin disease activity. In this setting, the time periods between episodes of skin disease activity can be months to years. Thus, patients with CLE typically may have lower total cumulative doses of hydroxychloroquine compared with patients with SLE over the same time frame, thus mitigating the risk of antimalarial retinopathy.

Thus, it might be argued that in patients with CLE whose skin disease activity has not responded after an appropriate period of time to hydroxychloroquine 5 mg/kg/day, it may be appropriate to increase the daily dose to 6.5 mg/kg/day, especially if HCQ blood levels are low.

### Combination of clinical factors predicts successful glucocorticoid withdrawal in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): results from a multicentre, retrospective cohort study [^1174sEQi]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

The combination of target attainment, hydroxychloroquine use and slow tapering results in the lowest flare risk after GC withdrawal

Our analysis revealed a number of clinical parameters that modified the risk of flares following GC withdrawal in SLE patients. To mitigate the possible risk of overfitting and prioritise the significance of these predictors, we utilised machine learning-assisted methods with random survival forests. Disease state at the time of GC withdrawal and hydroxychloroquine use emerged as the most important risk factors for overall and severe flares, followed by GC tapering speed, mycophenolate and azathioprine use and, finally, IV GC pulses (≥ 500 mg) (online supplemental figure S7). In multivariable-adjusted Cox regression, the use of hydroxychloroquine, attainment of DORIS remission or LLDAS (excluding DORIS) at the time of withdrawal, and GC tapering duration greater than 6 months retained a significant, independent relationship with flares (table 4). Combined, these factors resulted in approximately 25-fold and 50-fold decreases in overall and severe flare risk, respectively, compared with patients who did not meet any of these criteria (figure 3).

Remission is characterized as "Symptoms and signs of disease activity are significantly reduced or absent for an extended time. Specific definitions vary". An example low level disease activity definition (LLDAS) includes "SLEDAI-2K score ≤ 4 (with no activity in major organ systems or new/worsening symptoms), prednisone ≤ 7.5 mg/d, PGA ≤ 1, stable antimalarials, immunosuppressives, biologics".

### Association between severe nonadherence to hydroxychloroquine and systemic lupus erythematosus flares, damage, and mortality in 660 patients from the SLICC inception cohort [^112YwFdT]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study has several strengths, including the large cohort size and the multicenter design. Data were collected longitudinally, and very few were missing. The high number of events (disease flares or damage) provided sufficient statistical power to show associations. We also measured HCQ serum levels centrally and demonstrated that serum bank samples can be used when whole blood is not available, as previously suggested.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that severe nonadherence to HCQ is associated with unfavorable outcomes among patients with SLE, including flares, SLE damage, and death. As severe nonadherence is often unknown by the physician and because no predictive clinical or biological factors have been identified, our results underline the benefits of systematically testing to detect severe nonadherence and identify the patients at risk. Once uncovered, dedicating more resources and more time to these patients, and implementing specific strategies for them may help prevent SLE flares and damage and thus improve their long‐term prognosis.

### The early protective effect of hydroxychloroquine on the risk of cumulative damage in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^113eoW9q]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prevents early damage in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

We updated an existing systematic review of literature on clinical effects of HCQ in patients with SLE. We conducted a nested case-control study embedded in an inception cohort of patients with SLE. Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Damage Index (SDI) at 3 years was considered as our primary outcome. Patients with SDI > 0 at 3 years were considered cases and patients with SDI = 0 were controls. Cases and controls were first compared by univariate analysis. Then conditional logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders were done to study the effect of HCQ on damage accrual.

Results

Included in the analysis were 481 patients who had 3 or more years of followup. Out of this cohort, we could match 151 cases with 151 controls. Univariate analysis identified age, the use of any immunosuppressive drugs, HCQ, and cumulative dose of steroids as significant covariates associated with damage accrual. In multivariate analysis, the use of HCQ remained significantly associated with less damage (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.132–0.867), while age (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.027–1.078) and a variable combining SLE activity and steroid dose (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.306–2.295) were associated with damage at 3 years.

Conclusion

We demonstrated that HCQ use was associated with less damage at 3 years after diagnosis of SLE when attention was given and adjustment done for disease activity and steroid dose, duration of disease, and calendar year of diagnosis.
