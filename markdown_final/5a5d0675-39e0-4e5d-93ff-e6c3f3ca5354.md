## Question

Does a patient need LTBI treatment if the QuantiFERON test is positive but the X-ray is normal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with a positive QuantiFERON-TB (IGRA) and a normal chest X-ray needs treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a positive QuantiFERON actually means and what it does not mean. Then, I should verify how a normal chest radiograph fits into excluding active TB. Next, I need to confirm how LTBI is defined in contemporary guidelines. After that, I will assess who should be treated based on risk of progression, and when treatment may reasonably be deferred. Finally, I will outline a practical clinical algorithm, consider special scenarios and safety, and then synthesize a clear answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the significance of a positive QuantiFERON result. A positive IGRA indicates infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but it does not distinguish LTBI from active TB disease and cannot tell recent from remote infection, so I must not equate a positive result with active TB or assume no disease solely based on IGRA status [^116mwske] [^11483xEJ] [^114qb9YL].

> Next, I should review the role of a normal chest X-ray. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: a normal CXR is consistent with LTBI and helps exclude radiographic evidence of active pulmonary TB, but early active disease or extrapulmonary TB can present with a normal chest X-ray, so symptom screening and clinical context remain essential; if symptoms or risk are concerning, sputum testing is warranted despite a normal CXR [^114iqCuP] [^111XhvVT] [^114u5Nfz] [^1112jjn6].

> Now, I will clarify the diagnostic construct. With a positive IGRA, no symptoms or signs of TB, and a normal CXR, the working diagnosis is LTBI, defined as a persistent immune response to M. tuberculosis antigens without clinically manifest active TB; I should confirm that this modern definition aligns with ATS/CDC conceptual updates before proceeding [^112C1wrL] [^115FvKPB].

> I need to determine who should be treated, and here is where risk stratification matters. Wait, I initially found older summaries implying that all persons with LTBI should be treated, regardless of age, but that broad approach has been refined; current USPSTF guidance recommends screening and downstream treatment for populations at increased risk, not universal screening or universal treatment, and WHO prioritizes preventive therapy for groups at high risk of progression, such as those with HIV, recent close contacts, those starting anti-TNF or other potent immunosuppression, dialysis patients, transplant candidates, silicosis, and certain recent immigrants from high-burden settings; for patients starting higher-risk immunomodulators, product labeling often advises initiating LTBI preventive therapy before immunosuppression, which I should verify in each case [^113imv8J] [^112GLSMg] [^113qfKJb] [^115kAJjj] [^notfound] [^111ibrxd].

> Let me consider when treatment may reasonably be deferred. I should double-check the baseline risk: in immunocompetent, otherwise low-risk adults with remote infection, lifetime progression risk is often cited around 5–10%, and importantly, current IGRAs have limited positive predictive value for progression, so the absolute benefit of therapy in truly low-risk settings can be modest; cost-effectiveness analyses further support focusing testing and treatment on higher-prevalence or higher-risk groups, which argues for shared decision-making when risk is low [^114mnVks] [^113imv8J] [^111nGF7S] [^116PHYq2].

> I will now examine the practical clinical algorithm, step by step. Let me first confirm the IGRA result quality and consider repeating only if indeterminate or discordant with low pretest probability; then, I need to exclude active TB with a careful symptom review and CXR, and if clinical suspicion persists, obtain sputum studies despite a normal radiograph; once active disease is excluded, assess progression risk factors to decide on preventive therapy; if treatment is indicated, preferred WHO-endorsed LTBI regimens include 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin, or 6–9 months of daily isoniazid, with regimen choice tailored to drug–drug interactions, comorbidities, and patient preferences; I should monitor for hepatotoxicity and adherence during therapy and document counseling if treatment is deferred [^117PZEfw] [^113qfKJb] [^113tS7CL].

> But wait, what about special scenarios that can complicate interpretation and decisions. In BCG-vaccinated individuals, IGRA is preferred over TST for specificity; discordant results between TST and IGRA occur, and when risk is substantial, decisions typically prioritize the more specific IGRA; immunocompromised hosts can have false-negative tests, so I need to integrate exposure history and clinical context; serial IGRA variability can cause borderline conversions and reversions, so I should be cautious about acting on small quantitative changes; finally, extrapulmonary TB with concurrent occult pulmonary involvement can be missed on CXR, so sputum testing is prudent if systemic symptoms or high-risk features are present even when the film is normal [^114qb9YL] [^111dKzd3] [^115UntWL] [^117SPT35] [^114u5Nfz].

> I should confirm safety considerations before initiating LTBI therapy. Treating unrecognized active TB with a single or two-drug LTBI regimen risks undertreatment, so rigorous exclusion of active disease is mandatory; reassuringly, in large LTBI cohorts, active TB discovered after starting LTBI therapy was rare and not associated with acquired rifampin resistance, but that does not replace the need for careful pre-treatment evaluation and follow-up for evolving symptoms during therapy [^112FUU3u] [^114iqCuP].

> Pulling this together, my synthesis is as follows. A positive QuantiFERON with a normal chest X-ray, in the absence of TB symptoms and other clinical or microbiologic evidence of disease, supports a diagnosis of LTBI; treatment is recommended when the patient has risk factors for progression or belongs to a group for whom guidelines prioritize preventive therapy, while in low-risk individuals, deferring therapy after shared decision-making can be reasonable; the normal CXR does not eliminate the need for treatment, it enables it by helping exclude active pulmonary disease before starting an LTBI regimen [^113imv8J] [^112C1wrL] [^117PZEfw].

---

In general, patients with a positive QuantiFERON test and a normal chest X-ray should receive LTBI treatment if they are at **increased risk of progression to active TB**, such as those with HIV, immunosuppression, recent exposure, or planned immunosuppressive therapy [^113imv8J] [^113qfKJb]. LTBI treatment is **not routinely recommended for low-risk individuals** without risk factors, but clinical judgment and patient preference should guide decisions [^113wjkit]. Always exclude active TB with symptom review and, if indicated, sputum testing before starting LTBI therapy [^111XhvVT] [^114u5Nfz].

---

## Clinical significance of a positive quantiferon test with normal chest x-ray

A positive QuantiFERON test with a normal chest X-ray **indicates LTBI**, reflecting infection with M. tuberculosis without radiographic evidence of active disease [^115FvKPB]. LTBI is asymptomatic and noninfectious; about 5–10% of immunocompetent individuals will progress to active TB over their lifetime, most often within the first 2 years after infection [^116yuRV4] [^114mnVks].

---

## Risk factors for progression from LTBI to active TB

The decision to treat LTBI **depends on the risk of progression** to active TB. Key risk factors include [^113qfKJb]:

- **HIV infection**: Strongly increases progression risk [^116W53mD].

- **Immunosuppression**: Includes corticosteroids, biologics (e.g. anti-TNF), chemotherapy, or organ transplantation [^112LjwLh].

- **Recent exposure**: Close contact with active TB cases [^117PdHD8].

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, silicosis [^113qfKJb].

- **Age**: Children under 5 years [^116fSZ7B].

- **Recent conversion**: Recent IGRA or TST conversion [^117SPT35].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations for LTBI treatment

### WHO guidelines (2020)

The WHO recommends **LTBI treatment** for individuals with a positive IGRA or TST who are at increased risk of progression, including [^113qfKJb]:

- **HIV-positive individuals**: Strong recommendation.

- **Immunosuppressed patients**: Including those initiating anti-TNF therapy, dialysis, organ or hematological transplant candidates, or with silicosis [^113qfKJb] [^112LjwLh].

- **Close contacts**: Of active TB cases [^113qfKJb].

Recommended **regimens** include:

- **Isoniazid**: 6 or 9 months.

- **Isoniazid plus rifapentine**: Weekly for 3 months.

- **Isoniazid plus rifampin**: Daily for 3 months [^117PZEfw].

---

### USPSTF guidelines (2023)

The USPSTF recommends LTBI screening and treatment for asymptomatic adults at **increased risk**, including [^113imv8J]:

- **Born in or former residents**: Of countries with high TB prevalence [^112GLSMg].

- **High-risk congregate settings**: Homeless shelters, correctional facilities [^11483xEJ].

- **Immunosuppressed individuals**: Including HIV-positive patients [^11483xEJ].

---

## Clinical scenarios where LTBI treatment is recommended

LTBI treatment is **recommended** in the following scenarios [^113qfKJb] [^113imv8J]:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| HIV-positive individuals | Strongly recommended |
| Immunosuppressed patients (e.g. anti-TNF therapy, organ transplant, dialysis) | Strongly recommended |
| Close contacts of active TB cases | Strongly recommended |
| Recent converters (IGRA or TST) | Recommended |
| Children under 5 years | Recommended |

---

## Clinical scenarios where LTBI treatment may not be necessary

LTBI treatment **may not be necessary** in select situations, such as low-risk individuals without progression risk factors, those who have previously completed adequate LTBI therapy or curative treatment for active TB, and patients with severe contraindications to LTBI regimens (e.g. severe liver disease) [^113wjkit] [^111nGF7S].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of LTBI treatment

### Benefits

LTBI therapy **reduces progression to active TB**, providing individual protection and reducing transmission at the population level [^11483xEJ]. In high-risk populations, these benefits are cost-effective [^111nGF7S].

---

### Risks

Potential harms include adverse effects (e.g. **hepatotoxicity**, **hypersensitivity**) and challenges with adherence to longer regimens [^115ftJng] [^11483xEJ]. False-positive test results can lead to overtreatment [^116mwske].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Patients receiving LTBI treatment **should be monitored for adverse effects**, particularly hepatotoxicity, and for adherence [^115ftJng]. Ongoing assessment for symptoms or signs of progression to active TB is necessary [^111XhvVT]. Regular clinical follow-up and patient education are essential for successful outcomes [^11483xEJ].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Patients with a positive QuantiFERON test and a normal chest X-ray have LTBI. Treatment is **recommended for those at increased risk of progression** — including HIV-positive individuals, immunosuppressed patients, close contacts of active TB cases, recent converters, and children under 5 years [^113imv8J]. For low-risk individuals, treatment may not be necessary; clinical judgment and patient preference should guide decisions [^112GLSMg]. Always exclude active TB before starting LTBI therapy [^111XhvVT].

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113imv8J]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

In the US, tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease, including active tuberculosis, which may be infectious, and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), which is asymptomatic and not infectious but can later progress to active disease. The precise prevalence rate of LTBI in the US is difficult to determine; however, estimated prevalence is about 5.0%, or up to 13 million persons. Incidence of tuberculosis varies by geography and living accommodations, suggesting an association with social determinants of health.

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on LTBI screening and treatment in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, as well as the accuracy of LTBI screening tests. The population of focus is asymptomatic adults 18 years or older at increased risk for tuberculosis.

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit in preventing active tuberculosis disease by screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for tuberculosis infection. The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk (B recommendation).

### Serial Quantiferon-TB GOLD test results in 279 patients with psoriasis receiving biologic therapy [^1148A8W5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

The risk of active tuberculosis is still a concern in patients receiving biologics. To determine the risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) reactivation by Quantiferon-TB Gold (QFT) assay in psoriatic patients treated with biologics over an 11-year follow-up period, chest radiography alterations were also examined. This retrospective study included 279 patients with plaque-type psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, or nail psoriasis who were treated with biologics and had results for two or more LTBI tests. The QFT outcomes were defined according to both the baseline and the follow-up QFT results: seroconversion was changed from negative to positive, seroreversion from positive to negative, persistently seronegative as invariably negative, persistently seropositive as invariably positive, and any other result was accepted as indeterminate. Demographic features, as well as the presence and type of any chest X-ray abnormality, were noted during follow-up.

Of 279 baseline QFT tests, the majority were negative (n = 193; 69%), with fewer positive results (n = 86; 31%). Ten (5.2%) of the 193 initially negative patients converted from negative to positive QFT status after starting biologic therapy (P < 0.001) during the 11-year follow-up. Although these 10 patients exhibited seroconversion from negative to positive, only one patient was diagnosed with active TB. There was no statistically significant difference among biologics regarding the risk of QFT seroconversion (P = 0.09). This study showed that 5.2% of patients exhibited seroconversion. Annual QFT testing remains a necessary and mandatory tool to prevent further TB reactivation in psoriasis patients taking biologics.

### Meta-analysis: New tests for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: Areas of uncertainty and recommendations for research [^116mwske]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, the tuberculin skin test was the only test for detecting latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, but two ex vivo interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are now commercially licensed.

- **Purpose**: To estimate the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of IGRAs (commercial or research versions of QuantiFERON [QFT] and Elispot) for diagnosing latent TB infection in healthy and immune-suppressed persons.

- **Data sources**: The authors searched MEDLINE and reviewed citations of all original articles and reviews for studies published in English.

- **Study selection**: Studies had evaluated IGRAs using Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens (RD1 antigens) and overnight (16- to 24-hour) incubation times. Reference standards had to be clearly defined without knowledge of test results.

- **Data extraction and quality assessment**: Specific criteria for quality assessment were developed for sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.

- **Data synthesis**: When newly diagnosed active TB was used as a surrogate for latent TB infection, the sensitivity of all tests was suboptimal, although it was higher with Elispot. No test distinguishes active TB from latent TB. The sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test and IGRAs was similar in persons who were categorized into clinical gradients of exposure. Pooled specificity was 97.7% (95% CI, 96% to 99%) and 92.5% (CI, 86% to 99%) for QFT and for Elispot, respectively. Both assays were more specific than the tuberculin skin test in samples vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin. Elispot was more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test in three studies.

### What is the outcome of targeted tuberculosis screening based on universal genotyping and location [^11112s12]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Identifying and treating persons with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) at high risk for developing TB is part of the TB elimination strategy. There are no specific criteria, other than medical risks, to designate groups as high risk for developing TB. We hypothesized that, if location-based screenings were done in communities where persons with genotypically clustered Mycobacterium tuberculosis resided, then persons with LTBI from recent transmission and with undiagnosed TB could be identified.

- **Methods**: Location-based TB screenings were done in partnership with multiple community-based organizations using resources previously used for other types of screening.

- **Main results**: Location-based screenings identified one person with TB for every 83 screened, and one person with LTBI for every five screened. The yield of this targeted screening program for discovering persons with TB and LTBI exceeded what would be expected from nontargeted screening in a county with a TB incidence of 5.7 per 100,000 population.

- **Conclusions**: Genotyping combined with geographic information systems analysis can potentially be used to define high-risk status and to define areas for location-based TB screenings.

### Incidence of active tuberculosis in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection in rural China: Follow-up results of a population-based, multicentre, prospective cohort study [^116yuRV4]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

The management of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is a new priority action for the WHO End Tuberculosis (TB) Strategy. However, national guidelines on latent tuberculosis infection testing and treatment have not yet been developed in China. Here, we present the results from the 2-year follow-up of a study that aimed to track the development of active disease in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection, identify priority populations for latent infection management, and explore the most suitable latent infection diagnostic approach.

- **Methods**: A population-based multicentre prospective study was conducted in four sites in rural China, between 2013 and 2015. The baseline survey in 2013 measured the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) and tuberculin skin test (TST) in eligible participants. During the follow-up phase between 2014 and 2015, we assessed individuals who had tuberculosis infection at baseline (QFT positivity or TST tuberculin reaction size [induration] of ≥ 10 mm) for the development of active disease through active case finding. Eligible participants included in the follow-up survey had a birth date before June 1, 2008 (5 years or older in 2013), and continuous residence at the study site for 6 months or longer in the past year. Participants with active tuberculosis at the baseline survey were excluded.

- **Findings**: Between Sept 1, 2013, and Aug 31, 2015, 7505 eligible participants (aged 5 years or older) were included in tuberculosis infection test-positive cohorts (4455 were QFT positive, 6404 had TST).

### Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in HIV infected persons [^116W53mD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at an increased risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB). It is known that the treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI), also referred to as TB preventive therapy or chemoprophylaxis, helps to prevent progression to active disease in HIV-negative populations. However, the extent and magnitude of protection, if any, associated with preventive therapy in those infected with HIV should be quantified. This present study is an update of the original review.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of TB preventive therapy in reducing the risk of active tuberculosis and death in HIV-infected persons.

- **Search strategy**: This review was updated using the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, AIDSTRIALS, AIDSearch, NLM Gateway, and AIDSDRUGS (publication date from 01 July 2002 to 04 April 2008). We also scanned reference lists of articles and contacted authors and other researchers in the field in an attempt to identify additional studies that may be eligible for inclusion in this review.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials in which HIV-positive individuals were randomly allocated to TB preventive therapy or placebo, or to alternative TB preventive therapy regimens. Participants could be tuberculin skin test positive or negative but without active tuberculosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three reviewers independently applied the study selection criteria, assessed study quality, and extracted data. Effects were assessed using relative risk for di.

### Latent tuberculosis: Two centuries of confusion [^112C1wrL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Since 1971, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) has regularly issued TB treatment guidelines. In 1994, these guidelines issued recommendations for the treatment of TB disease and TB infection, with no mention of the word "latent". In 1999, the ATS issued for the first time a separate guideline that specifically addressed "latent tuberculosis infection". Not only did the terminology for TB infection change to LTBI, but the terminology for its treatment also changed — from "preventive treatment" to "treatment of LTBI". The recommended treatment for LTBI (isoniazid monotherapy) remained unchanged from that for its namesake (TB infection) in 1994. The 1999 guidelines offered neither an explanation for the new name nor a definition. Rather, the definition was in a separate document published contemporaneously that contained guidelines for the diagnosis of TB. Here, LTBI was defined as "a positive reaction to the tuberculin skin test (TST), negative bacteriologic studies (if done), and no clinical, bacteriologic or radiologic evidence of active tuberculosis". In 2017, the updated guidelines modified the LTBI definition to "a state of persistent immune response to stimulation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens with no evidence of clinically manifest active TB".

The influential role of the ATS guidelines is reflected by endorsements from key organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

### Discordant QuantiFERON-TB GOLD test results among US healthcare workers with increased risk of latent tuberculosis infection: a problem or solution [^111dKzd3]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2008). Low credibility.

In late 2006, our hospital implemented the use of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) assay, a whole-blood interferon-gamma release assay, for the detection of tuberculosis infection. All newly hired healthcare workers (HCWs) with positive Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) results were routinely tested with the QFT-G assay to take advantage of its higher specificity. We then undertook a quality assurance review to evaluate the QFT-G test results in HCWs with multiple risk factors for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).

The clinical records for TST-positive HCWs tested with the QFT-G assay were reviewed. HCWs with two or more risk factors commonly associated with LTBI were classified as "increased risk" (IR). IR HCWs who had negative QFT-G test results underwent repeat QFT-G testing and were offered testing with a different interferon-gamma release assay (T-SPOT.TB) and with extended T cell stimulation assays.

Of 143 TST-positive HCWs tested with the QFT-G assay, 26 (18%) had positive results, 115 (81%) had negative results, and 2 (1%) had indeterminate results. Among the 82 IR HCWs, 23 (28%) had positive QFT-G test results, and 57 (70%) had negative results. Of the 57 IR HCWs with negative results, 43 underwent repeat QFT-G testing: 41 had negative results again, and 2 had positive results. These 43 HCWs were also offered additional testing with the T-SPOT.TB diagnostic, and 36 consented: 31 out of 36 tested negative, and 5 out of 36 tested positive. Extended assays using the antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10 confirmed the positive results detected by the overnight assays.

### Comparison of QuantiFERON-TB GOLD In-Tube Test and Tuberculin Skin Test for Identification of Latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection in Healthcare Staff and Association Between Positive Test Results and Known Risk Factors for Infection [^115UntWL]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to compare a whole-blood interferon-gamma release assay (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test, hereafter "QFT-in tube test") with a tuberculin skin test (TST) to determine which test more accurately identified latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in healthcare staff.

- **Methods**: A total of 481 hospital staff members were recruited from 5 hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. They provided information about demographic variables and tuberculosis (TB) risk factors, such as birth or travel in a country with a high prevalence of TB, working in an occupation likely to involve contact with M. tuberculosis or individuals with TB, or being a household contact of an individual with a proven case of pulmonary TB. The QFT-in tube test and the TST were administered in accordance with standardized protocols. Concordance between the test results and positive risk factors was analyzed using the kappa statistic, the McNemar test, and logistic regression.

- **Results**: A total of 358 participants had both a TST result and a QFT-in tube test result available for comparison. There were fewer positive QFT-in tube test results than positive TST results (6.7% vs. 33.0%; p < 0.001). Agreement between the tests was poor (71%; kappa = 0.16). A positive QFT-in tube test result was associated with birth in a country with a high prevalence of TB, the number of years an individual had lived in a country with a high prevalence of TB (the effect of each additional year, treated as a continuous variable), and high-risk occupational contact. A positive TST result was associated with older age, receipt of…

### Latent tuberculosis infection in rural China: Baseline results of a population-based, multicentre, prospective cohort study [^1151wdDA]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Prophylactic treatment of individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is an essential component of tuberculosis control in some settings. In China, the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection and preventive interventions against this disease have not been systematically studied. We aimed to assess the prevalence of latent tuberculosis and its associated risk factors in rural populations in China.

- **Methods**: Between July 1, and Sept 30, 2013, we undertook a baseline survey of a population-based, multicentre, prospective cohort study of registered residents (≥ 5 years old) at four study sites in rural China. Eligible participants were identified by door-to-door survey with a household sampling design. We screened participants for active tuberculosis and history of tuberculosis, then used a tuberculin skin test and an interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON [QFT]) to test for latent infection. We used odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess variables associated with positivity of QFT and tuberculin skin tests.

- **Findings**: A total of 21,022 (90%) of 23,483 eligible participants completed a baseline survey. Age-standardised and sex-standardised rates of skin-test positivity (≥ 10 mm) ranged from 15% to 42%, and QFT positivity rates ranged from 13% to 20%. Rates of positivity for the tuberculin skin test and the QFT test were low in study participants younger than 20 years and gradually increased with age (p for trend < 0.0001). Rates of latent tuberculosis infection were higher for men than women (p < 0.0001). Overall agreement between the tuberculin skin test and the QFT test was observed…

### New diagnostics to infer risk in tuberculosis: Is the term "latent tuberculosis infection" obsolete [^115sUjiE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Importantly, it was challenging to apply the broad concept and diagnosis definition of LTBI to the study subjects with "remote" or persistent QFT(+) reactivity and those with "recent" QFT(+) reactivity. In this regard, we suggest changing the term "LTBI" to "TB infection reactivity", which can be applied to both postinfection immune reactivity and different stages of asymptomatic TB infection.

- **Assessment of risk**: The categories of low, high, or indeterminate risk can be added to the term "TB infection reactivity" to provide an assessment or interpretation of TB progression risk for both the available tests and the newly developed host-related TB diagnostics in the absence of a gold standard test to directly measure host bacillary burden in asymptomatic Mtb infections.
- **Terminology usefulness**: This proposed terminology will enable a more individualized and risk-based diagnosis for the optimal management of the different stages of asymptomatic Mtb infection, including low-risk TB infection, high-risk or incipient TB infection, and posttreatment immune reactivity, and differentiation from subclinical TB and clinical TB.

### Cost-effectiveness of the NICE guidelines for screening for latent tuberculosis infection: the QuantiFERON-TB GOLD IGRA alone is more cost-effective for immigrants from high burden countries [^116PHYq2]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) guidelines for new entrant tuberculosis (TB) screening recommend chest x-ray (CXR) for immigrants from countries with a TB incidence greater than 40/100,000, and a tuberculin skin test (TST) for people with normal CXR from very high TB prevalence countries. A revised screening policy using first-line QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) in high-risk immigrants was piloted in 2007. Initially, TST was offered to immigrants from countries with a TB incidence of 200–339/100,000, and QFT to those from countries with an incidence greater than 340/100,000. When increased resources became available, all immigrants from countries with a TB incidence greater than 200/100,000 received QFT. Those with positive QFT results were invited for CXR.

A total of 1336 immigrants were invited for screening, with a 32% attendance rate. Of the 280 patients who received QFT, 38% tested positive, with less than 2% yielding indeterminate results. Using the NICE approach, the cost of screening these 280 immigrants was £13,346.75 (£47.67 per immigrant), identifying 83 cases of latent TB infection (LTBI). In contrast, using first-line QFT followed by CXR, the cost was £9,781.82 (£34.94 per immigrant), identifying 105 cases of LTBI. The cost to identify one case of LTBI following NICE guidelines was £160.81, whereas using the present protocol it was £93.16. For immigrants from high-risk countries, QFT blood testing followed by CXR is feasible for TB screening, more cost-effective than using the NICE guideline, and identifies more cases of LTBI.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for extrapulmonary tuberculosis, specifically the screening for latent tuberculosis, the WHO 2020 guidelines recommend not systematically testing for latent tuberculosis infection in patients with diabetes, persons engaged in the harmful use of alcohol, tobacco users, and underweight individuals unless they belong to other risk groups mentioned above.

### A systematic review of cost-utility analyses of screening methods in latent tuberculosis infection in high-risk populations [^116xCvbN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The database searches, website searches, and conference hand-searches were conducted between 09/12/2020 and 22/12/2020. The searches identified 7,380 records. Following deduplication, 3,675 records were assessed for relevance. There were 3,512 records excluded based on the abstract alone, with 163 full-text documents assessed for eligibility for inclusion. On full-text review, there were 32 studies in 33 publications that met the inclusion criteria and were extracted and quality assessed. There were no disagreements between reviewers at any stage, so no third reviewer was required. A full PRISMA diagram, including reasons for exclusion at the full-text stage, is provided in Figure 1.

- **Figure 1**: Study selection PRISMA diagram

A summary of the populations covered by studies is shown in Table 1, noting that studies could report findings for more than one population. All included studies were in high-income countries. The characteristics of included studies are summarized in Table 2.

- **Table 1**: Included studies by population of interest
- **Table 2**: Included studies

In all studies, a decision tree was employed to determine LTBI test and treatment outcomes. Six studies subsequently employed a discrete event simulation model to estimate long-term TB development, while the remainder used a Markov model (or model of unspecified type) for long-term outcomes. The conclusions of studies by modeling approach did not differ substantially. The perspective in all cases was from a third-party payer, although this was often described in more detail in the individual studies.

### The meta-analysis for ideal cytokines to distinguish the latent and active TB infection [^112zr83R]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

One-fourth of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), but 90% of them have asymptomatic latent infections, showing no symptoms yet testing positive in the IFN-γ release assay. There is a lack of an ideal strategy to distinguish between active tuberculosis (TB) and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Some scientists have focused on a set of cytokines as biomarkers, in addition to interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), to differentiate active TB and LTBI; however, there is considerable variance in the results. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the overall discriminative ability of potential immune molecules to distinguish active TB from LTBI.

- **Methods**: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies assessing the diagnostic roles of cytokines in distinguishing active TB and LTBI, published up to August 2018. The quality of the enrolled studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). The pooled diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of each cytokine were calculated using Meta-DiSc software. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to summarize the overall diagnostic performance of each biomarker.

- **Results**: Fourteen studies with 982 subjects met the inclusion criteria, comprising 526 active TB and 456 LTBI patients. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for discriminating between active TB and LTBI were analyzed for IL-2 (0.87, 0.61, and 0.9093), IP-10 (0.77, 0.73, and 0.8609), IL-5 (0.64, 0.75, and 0.8533), IL-13 (0.75, 0.71, and 0.8491), and IFN-γ (0.67, 0.75, and 0.8031).

### Optimizing the design of latent tuberculosis treatment trials: Insights from mathematical modeling [^115DdCWR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Noninferiority trials of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) are challenging because of imperfect LTBI diagnostic tests. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of different enrollment strategies on study outcomes for a noninferiority trial of LTBI treatment.

Methods included mathematically simulating a two-arm randomized clinical trial of LTBI in which the experimental therapy was 50% efficacious and the control was 80% efficacious, with an absolute 0.75% noninferiority margin. Five enrollment strategies were assessed:

- **Enroll based on no LTBI diagnostic test**
- **Enroll based on a positive tuberculin skin test (TST)**
- **Enroll based on a positive IFN-γ release assay (IGRA)**
- **Enroll based on either a positive TST or IGRA**
- **Enroll regardless of test result**: Assuming 70% had negative TSTs, 20% positive TSTs, and 10% unknown results.

- **Measurements and main results**: Under most LTBI prevalence assumptions, enrolling based on a positive IGRA was least likely to result in falsely declaring noninferiority of the experimental regimen. Enrolling based on no test or regardless of test result led to falsely declaring noninferiority unless LTBI prevalence in the underlying population was higher than 45%. Enrolling based on a mix of TST and IGRA substantially reduced the likelihood of falsely declaring noninferiority over enrolling based on TST alone, even if as many as 70% of participants were enrolled based on positive TST. Noninferiority trials of LTBI should enroll based on the most specific diagnostic tests available (i.e. IGRAs) to avoid misinterpretation of results.

### Latent tuberculosis: Two centuries of confusion [^115FvKPB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

It is on this historical backdrop that, at the tail end of the 20th century, latent TB acquired yet another new definition. This 21st-century definition of latent TB has circled back to the host. However, in contrast to the 19th-century postmortem pathological diagnosis, it is now an antemortem immunological diagnosis. This new LTBI diagnosis requires a pertinent positive — TB immunoreactivity — and a pertinent negative — the absence of clinical manifestations. Each of these presents diagnostic quandaries.

The TB immunoreactivity tests (TST and, more recently, IFN-γ release assays, or IGRAs) are neither 100% specific nor sensitive. A positive TST/IGRA cannot distinguish present infection from present disease, nor can it distinguish present from past infection. Several lines of evidence suggest that the majority of individuals thought to have LTBI have actually cleared their TB infection. Conversely, a negative TST/IGRA test is observed in 10–40% of HIV-negative individuals with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB, and an even higher percentage of patients with miliary TB. Moreover, a new concept has emerged that recognizes people who have epidemiologic evidence of exposure without demonstrable T-cell–mediated immune responses to mycobacterial antigens, and such individuals would test negative. For these "resisters", there is evidence through alternative assays that infection has occurred despite the subject being.

### Chest roentgenography is complementary to interferon-gamma release assay in latent tuberculosis infection screening of rheumatic patients [^1112jjn6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In addition to IGRAs, chest radiography (CXR) is included in the Taiwan latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) risk management plan for biologics. Guidelines regarding the use of chest radiography in screening for LTBI have mixed recommendations. Some suggest a chest radiograph following a positive IGRA, while others recommend chest radiography regardless of the result of the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) or tuberculin skin test (TST). A universally accepted standard of care on this issue has not yet been established.

Furthermore, studies on the correlation between CXR and IGRA reveal different results in different populations, such as TB-exposed individuals or healthcare workers. Studies on rheumatic patients are limited. Additionally, the burden of LTBI estimated by CXR in conjunction with IGRA is unclear in areas of intermediate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) risk. Although healed but untreated fibrotic lesions in CXR are associated with a risk for progression to active TB, the overall impact remains uncertain.

Therefore, we conducted this retrospective study to investigate the CXR findings in LTBI screening. We explored CXR and IGRA correlations and reported the results of isoniazid prophylaxis.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^11483xEJ]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) can progress to active tuberculosis disease, causing morbidity and mortality. The objective of this research is to review the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and treating LTBI in adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).

Data sources included PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through December 3, 2021; references; experts; and literature surveillance through January 20, 2023. The study selection process focused on English-language studies of LTBI screening, LTBI treatment, or accuracy of the tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). Studies related to public health surveillance or disease management were excluded.

Data extraction and synthesis involved dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality, alongside qualitative synthesis of findings. Meta-analyses were conducted when a sufficient number of similar studies were available.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Screening test accuracy, development of active tuberculosis disease, transmission, quality of life, mortality, and harms.

Results indicated a total of 113 publications included (112 studies; N = 69,009). No studies directly evaluated the benefits and harms of screening. Pooled estimates for sensitivity of the TST were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74–0.87) at the 5-mm induration threshold, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76–0.87) at the 10-mm threshold, and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.46–0.74) at the 15-mm threshold. Pooled estimates for sensitivity of IGRA tests ranged from 0.81 (95% CI, 0.79–0.84) to 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87–0.92).

### Use in routine clinical practice of two commercial blood tests for diagnosis of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A prospective study [^114qb9YL]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

Two commercial blood assays for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection — T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold — have been separately compared with the tuberculin skin test. Our aim was to compare the efficacy of all three tests in the same population sample.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective study in 393 consecutively enrolled patients who were tested simultaneously with T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold due to suspected latent or active tuberculosis. A total of 318 patients also had results available for a tuberculin skin test.

- **Findings**: Overall agreement with the skin test was similar (T-SPOT.TB kappa = 0.508, QuantiFERON-TB Gold kappa = 0.460), but fewer BCG-vaccinated individuals were identified as positive by the two blood assays than by the tuberculin skin test (p = 0.003 for T-SPOT.TB and p < 0.0001 for QuantiFERON-TB Gold). Indeterminate results were significantly more frequent with QuantiFERON-TB Gold (11%, 43 of 383) than with T-SPOT.TB (3%, 12 of 383; p < 0.0001) and were associated with immunosuppressive treatments for both tests. Age younger than 5 years was significantly associated with indeterminate results with QuantiFERON-TB Gold (p = 0.003), but not with T-SPOT.TB. Overall, T-SPOT.TB produced significantly more positive results (38%, n = 144, vs 26%, n = 100, with QuantiFERON-TB Gold; p < 0.0001), and close contacts of patients with active tuberculosis were more likely to be positive with T-SPOT.TB than with QuantiFERON-TB Gold (p = 0.0010).

- **Interpretation**: T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold have higher specificity than the tuberculin skin test. Rates of indeterminate results were notably different between the tests.

### Evaluating latent tuberculosis infection diagnostics using latent class analysis [^114L6nAw]. Thorax (2018). Low credibility.

The lack of a gold standard for latent TB infection has precluded direct measurement of the test characteristics of the tuberculin skin test and interferon-γ release assays (QuantiFERON Gold In-Tube and T-SPOT.TB).

- **Objective**: We estimated test sensitivity/specificity and latent TB infection prevalence in a prospective, US-based cohort of 10,740 participants at high risk for latent infection.

- **Methods**: Bayesian latent class analysis was employed to estimate test sensitivity/specificity and latent TB infection prevalence among subgroups categorized by age, foreign birth outside the United States, and HIV infection.

- **Results**: Latent TB infection prevalence varied from 4.0% among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged less than 5 years to 34.0% among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged 5 years or older. Test sensitivity ranged from 45.8% for the T-SPOT.TB among foreign-born, HIV-seropositive persons aged 5 years or older to 80.7% for the tuberculin skin test among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged 5 years or older. The skin test was less specific than either interferon-γ release assay, particularly among foreign-born populations; for example, the skin test had 70.0% specificity among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged 5 years or older compared to 98.5% and 99.3% specificity for the QuantiFERON and T-SPOT.TB, respectively. The tuberculin skin test's positive predictive value ranged from 10.0% among foreign-born children aged less than 5 years to 69.2% among foreign-born, HIV-seropositive persons aged 5 years or older. The positive predictive values of the QuantiFERON (41.4%) and T-SPOT.TB (77.5%) were also low among US-born, HIV-seropositive individuals.

### A cross-sectional study of patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis and normal chest radiographs - what characteristics were associated with sputum culture positivity [^114u5Nfz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Recognizing pulmonary involvement in tuberculosis (TB) patients is necessary to prevent TB transmission. We describe the frequency and characteristics of patients with extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), normal chest radiographs, and positive sputum culture.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data of patients aged 15 years and older with EPTB reported to the California TB registry between 2011 and 2017. These patients had cultured sputum and normal chest radiographs. Generalized linear modeling was used to estimate prevalence ratios associated with positive sputum culture. Demographic, behavioral, clinical characteristics, and testing were compared for patients with positive and negative sputum cultures.

- **Results**: Of 1,635 patients with EPTB and normal chest radiographs, 937 (57%) underwent sputum culture testing, and 127 (13%) had positive results for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Patients with positive results were more likely to be male, experience homelessness, use substances, have HIV, and have more than one disease site. Among 85 patients with HIV co-infection, 54% had positive culture results compared to 9.5% among 852 patients without HIV co-infection. Patients with EPTB in more than one site were also more likely to have a positive sputum culture.

- **Conclusions**: Culturing sputum from patients with EPTB identified pulmonary cases not detected by chest radiograph, particularly among patients with HIV or more than one disease site.

### Inclusion of latent tuberculosis infection as a separate entity into the international classification of diseases [^112zfyQN]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

The 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), proposed by the WHO, is currently in the consultation phase. Similar to previous versions of the ICD, this revised version does not contain a code for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). This is in contrast with the inclusion of numerous codes for various manifestations of active tuberculosis (TB). The inclusion of a separate code for LTBI into ICD-11 is critically important for epidemiological, clinical, and research purposes.

On behalf of the Paediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials group, we encourage colleagues worldwide who are caring for TB patients or are involved in TB research to join us in supporting the case for a long overdue ICD code for LTBI.

### Optimal testing choice and diagnostic strategies for latent tuberculosis infection among US-born people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [^1136d4Wi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Increased risk of progression from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to tuberculosis (TB) disease among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; PLWH) prioritizes them for LTBI testing and treatment. Studies comparing the performance of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) and the tuberculin skin test (TST) among PLWH are lacking.

- **Methods**: We used Bayesian latent class analysis to estimate the prevalence of LTBI and diagnostic characteristics of the TST, QuantiFERON Gold In-Tube (QFT), and T.SPOT-TB (TSPOT) among a prospective, multicenter cohort of US-born PLWH aged ≥ 5 years with valid results for all three LTBI tests using standard US cutoffs (≥ 5 mm TST, ≥ 0.35 IU/mL QFT, ≥ 8 spots TSPOT). We also explored the performance of varying LTBI test cutoffs.

- **Results**: Among 1510 PLWH (median CD4+ count 532 cells/mm³), estimated LTBI prevalence was 4.7%. TSPOT was significantly more specific (99.7%) and had a significantly higher positive predictive value (90.0%, PPV) than QFT (96.5% specificity, 50.7% PPV) and TST (96.8% specificity, 45.4% PPV). QFT was significantly more sensitive (72.2%) than TST (54.2%) and TSPOT (51.9%); negative predictive value of all tests was high (TST 97.7%, QFT 98.6%, TSPOT 97.6%). Even at the highest cutoffs evaluated (15 mm TST, ≥ 1.00 IU/mL QFT, ≥ 8 spots TSPOT), TST and QFT specificity was significantly lower than TSPOT.

- **Conclusions**: LTBI prevalence among this cohort of US-born PLWH was low compared to non-US born persons. TSPOT's higher PPV may make it preferable for testing US-born PLWH at low risk for TB exposure.

### Quantiferon-TB GOLD Plus performance in children: A narrative review [^116fSZ7B]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). High credibility.

The principal role of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), both in adult and pediatric settings, is to identify individuals who are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and at risk of progression to tuberculosis (TB) disease, who may therefore benefit from TB preventive treatment (TPT). Children with a positive IGRA or tuberculin skin test (TST) are more likely to progress to TB disease within two years than those with negative results. The second role of IGRAs is to aid in the diagnosis of children with TB disease. This can be challenging due to difficulty in obtaining sputum samples, the paucibacillary nature of Mtb in specimens, and a lack of disease-specific symptoms.

The QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) was developed to improve Mtb test sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy compared to the previous generation, QuantiFERON-TB Gold in Tube (QFT-GIT) assay. As well as detecting CD4+ T-cell responses to Mtb, the QFT-Plus detects CD8+ responses, which could increase assay sensitivity, especially in young children. However, since the introduction of QFT-Plus in children, no reviews have specifically evaluated its performance in the pediatric population. Therefore, in this narrative review, we identified and summarized recent studies evaluating the performance of the QFT-Plus IGRA as a test for Mtb infection and TB disease in children. The performance of this test in adults was reviewed previously.

### Simple estimates for local prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection, United States, 2011–2015 [^111KWMSB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately 25% of the world's population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is an asymptomatic equilibrium between the immune response of the host and the infectious process. Although not infectious, LTBI can be activated years later as infectious tuberculosis (TB), which is why diagnosing and treating LTBI in high-risk populations is a key component of the World Health Organization End TB Strategy.

Most countries have established systems for surveillance of active TB. Public health interventions to control TB include timely detection and treatment of active cases and prompt investigations of persons with recent contact with someone who has infectious TB. However, few jurisdictions have estimates of local LTBI prevalence. Having such estimates could help direct TB prevention efforts for persons with the highest risk for infection, highest risk for progression to TB, and greatest benefit from treatment to prevent progression. We describe a simple method that uses genotyping results from active TB cases to derive a population estimate of untreated LTBI prevalence for any jurisdiction.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^114iqCuP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

In the guidelines on tuberculosis screening developed by WHO and partners, systematic screening for tuberculosis disease is defined as "the systematic identification of people with presumed tuberculosis disease, in a predetermined target group, using tests, examinations, or other procedures which can be applied rapidly" [WHO 2013]. Screening tests sort out apparently well people who probably have a disease from people who probably do not and are not intended to be diagnostic [Wilson 1968]. People with positive or suspicious findings must be referred for diagnosis and necessary treatment. Screening is offered systematically to predetermined groups, and not only in response to a specific request or complaint by an individual seeking care [Lönnroth 2013; WHO 2013]. While it often refers to screening outside of health facilities, it can be offered to those who seek health care (with or without signs and symptoms compatible with tuberculosis) and those who do not.

The two main goals of systematic screening for tuberculosis disease are (1) better health outcomes for people with tuberculosis, through earlier detection and treatment; and (2) more effective reduction of tuberculosis transmission and incidence through shortening the average duration of tuberculosis infectiousness [Burke 2021; Lönnroth 2013; WHO 2013].

This review focused on symptom and chest radiography (CXR) screening. For symptom screening, individuals are questioned about the presence of one or more symptoms considered suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis, which are respiratory symptoms.

### Beyond latent and active tuberculosis: a scoping review of conceptual frameworks [^111Vb2Xs]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

While tuberculosis (TB) continued to be largely managed in sanatoria, microbiological, radiological, and other diagnostic tools to assess the state of the disease were becoming increasingly available. The need for a standardized approach to disease classification was recognized to aid statistical comparisons and clinical communication. It was particularly important to have a consistent approach to classifying the condition of the patient at entry into the sanatoria, reflecting prognosis, and the condition during follow-up and at discharge, reflecting the degree of cure or healing and likelihood of relapse.

Soon after the inception of the National Tuberculosis Association in 1904, a Committee on Clinical Nomenclature was formed. Discussions, surveys, and consensus-building over a decade led to the development of the first Diagnostic Standards and Classification of Tuberculosis in 1917. The classification of pulmonary TB in adults consisted of three clearly defined dimensions: (i) the extent of pulmonary lesions initially categorized as incipient, moderately advanced, and far advanced; (ii) symptoms categorized as slight/none and moderate; and (iii) clinical/treatment status, initially categorized as suspicious case, definite case, and arrested/apparently arrested case. Over subsequent iterations, details were added; clinical status became more nuanced, bacteriology was increasingly emphasized, and there were changes to terminology. However, the broad classification approach remained similar, with a focus on stratification by disease extent and clinical status.

### Update on the treatment of tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection [^115ftJng]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) has emerged as a global public health epidemic. Despite decreasing numbers of cases in the United States since 1992, TB remains a serious public health problem among certain patient populations and is highly prevalent in many urban areas. The responsibility for prescribing an appropriate drug regimen and ensuring treatment completion is assigned to the public health program or clinician, not to the patient.

The initial prescribed regimen for the treatment of TB usually consists of four drugs: isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. The minimum length for the treatment of drug-susceptible TB with a rifampin-based regimen is 6 to 9 months. Providing medications directly to the patient and observing them swallow the anti-TB drugs, termed directly observed therapy, is recommended for all patients diagnosed with TB. This approach can help ensure higher completion rates, prevent the emergence of drug-resistant TB, and enhance TB control.

There has been renewed interest in treating those with latent TB infection as a TB-control strategy in the United States for eliminating the large reservoir of individuals at risk for progression to TB. The two broad categories of persons who should be tested for latent TB infection are:

- **Recently infected individuals**: Such as contacts to infectious TB cases.
- **Persons at increased risk of progression to TB disease**: Following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus infection and selected medical conditions; recent immigrants to the United States.

### Cibinqo [^115kAJjj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prior to initiating treatment with CIBINQO, several tests and evaluations are recommended:

- **Tuberculosis (TB) infection evaluation**: CIBINQO should not be initiated in patients with active TB. For those with latent TB or at high risk, preventive therapy for latent TB should begin before CIBINQO initiation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Viral hepatitis screening**: According to clinical guidelines, CIBINQO is not recommended for patients with active hepatitis B or C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: CIBINQO should not be initiated in patients with a platelet count < 150,000/mm³, an absolute lymphocyte count < 500/mm³, an absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm³, or a hemoglobin value < 8 g/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Complete necessary immunizations, including herpes zoster vaccinations, in accordance with immunization guidelines prior to CIBINQO initiation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

The recommended dosage of CIBINQO is 100 mg once daily. If an adequate response is not achieved, consider increasing the dosage to 200 mg once daily. If there is still no adequate response, discontinue CIBINQO. Use the lowest efficacious dose to maintain response. CIBINQO can be administered with or without topical corticosteroids. If a dose is missed, administer it as soon as possible unless it is close to the next scheduled dose.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^117PdHD8]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

Tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease in the United States. An effective strategy for reducing the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of active disease is the identification and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to prevent progression to active disease.

- **Objective**: To issue a US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for LTBI.

- **Evidence review**: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for LTBI in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, including evidence dating from the inception of searched databases.

- **Findings**: The USPSTF found adequate evidence that accurate screening tests for LTBI are available, treatment of LTBI provides a moderate health benefit in preventing progression to active disease, and the harms of screening and treatment are small. The USPSTF has moderate certainty that screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for infection provides a moderate net benefit.

- **Conclusions and recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk. (B recommendation)

### Is passive diagnosis enough? The impact of subclinical disease on diagnostic strategies for tuberculosis [^116f5988]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is characterized by a subclinical phase where symptoms are absent or not considered abnormal, a prediagnostic phase where symptoms are noticed but diagnosis is not pursued, and a clinical phase where care is actively sought. Diagnostic capacity during these phases is limited.

The objective of this study was to estimate the population-level impact of TB case-finding strategies in the presence of subclinical and prediagnostic disease.

A mathematical epidemic model of TB was created and calibrated to global incidence. Three prototypical diagnostic interventions were introduced:

- **Increased sensitivity of diagnosis in the clinical phase by 20%** ("passive"):
	- This is aimed at improving detection rates during the clinical phase.

- **Early diagnosis during the prediagnostic phase at a rate of 10% per year** ("enhanced"):
	- This focuses on early detection before the clinical phase.

- **Population-based diagnosis of 5% of undiagnosed prevalent cases per year** ("active"):
	- This strategy targets undiagnosed cases within the population.

If the subclinical phase was ignored, as in most models, the passive strategy was projected to reduce TB incidence by 18% (90% uncertainty range [UR], 11–32%) by year 10, compared with 23% (90% UR, 14–35%) for the enhanced strategy and 18% (90% UR, 11–28%) for the active strategy. After incorporating a subclinical phase into the model, consistent with population-based prevalence surveys, the active strategy still reduced 10-year TB incidence by 16% (90% UR, 11–28%), but the passive and enhanced strategies' impact was attenuated to 11% (90% UR, 8–25%) and 6% (90% UR, 4–13%), respectively. The degree of attenuation depended strongly on the transmission rate during the subclinical phase.

Subclinical disease may limit the impact of these diagnostic strategies on TB incidence reduction.

### Treatment failure in tuberculosis [^113sjpuK]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The treatment of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection with 3 months of rifampicin/isoniazid plays a crucial role in preventive TB programs. The effectiveness of treating latent TB infection can be evaluated only through rates of subsequent breakdown, yet outcome data for this combination of rifampicin/isoniazid are scarce. This study aimed to estimate the failure rate following treatment for latent TB infection. A questionnaire survey was conducted among all parents of children under 16 years who completed treatment for latent TB infection at Leicester Royal Infirmary (Leicester, UK) from 1997 to 2003.

Cases of treatment failure were identified by reviewing all re-referrals to the clinic, identifying children who developed TB while on treatment, and via postal questionnaires to all patients discharged. Of the 400 eligible children, 344 (86%) responded. Three children with latent TB infection subsequently developed TB disease over the period. Among these three patients, one exhibited chest radiograph signs at the end of treatment, and two presented with symptoms within two years of completing treatment. Overall, the mean treatment failure rate was 0.87% (95% confidence interval 0.3–2.5), equating to 2.2 cases per 1,000 patient-years. In conclusion, rates of tuberculosis breakdown after treatment for latent tuberculosis infection with 3 months of rifampicin/isoniazid remain acceptably low.

### Optimization and interpretation of serial QuantiFERON testing to measure acquisition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^117SPT35]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conversion from a negative to positive QuantiFERON-TB test is indicative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, which predisposes individuals to tuberculosis disease. Interpretation of serial tests is confounded by immunological and technical variability.

- **Objectives**: To improve the consistency of serial QuantiFERON-TB testing algorithms and provide a data-driven definition of conversion.

- **Methods**: Sources of QuantiFERON-TB variability were assessed, and optimal procedures were identified. Distributions of IFN-γ response levels were analyzed in healthy adolescents, Mtb-unexposed control subjects, and patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.

- **Measurements and main results**: Individuals with no known Mtb exposure had IFN-γ values less than 0.2 IU/ml. Among individuals with IFN-γ values less than 0.2 IU/ml, 0.2–0.34 IU/ml, 0.35–0.7 IU/ml, and greater than 0.7 IU/ml, tuberculin skin test positivity results were 15%, 53%, 66%, and 91% (P < 0.005), respectively. Together, these findings suggest that values less than 0.2 IU/ml were true negatives. In short-term serial testing, "uncertain" conversions, with at least one value within the uncertainty zone (0.2–0.7 IU/ml), were partly explained by technical assay variability. Individuals who had a change in QuantiFERON-TB IFN-γ values from less than 0.2 to greater than 0.7 IU/ml had 10-fold higher tuberculosis incidence rates than those who maintained values less than 0.2 IU/ml over 2 years (P = 0.0003). By contrast, "uncertain" converters were not at higher risk than nonconverters (P = 0.229).

### Effect of isoniazid therapy for latent TB infection on QuantiFERON-TB GOLD In-Tube responses in adults with positive tuberculin skin test results in a high TB incidence area: a controlled study [^1161xUUX]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

T-cell interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are used in the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and could be useful biomarkers of response to treatment of latent TB infection for clinical trials, infection control units, and TB programs.

- **Methods**: This investigation was a prospective, controlled substudy of IGRA responses in 82 healthy South African adults with HIV seronegative and positive tuberculin skin test results. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment with 6 months of daily isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) or observation before Bacillus Calmette-Guérin revaccination in a clinical trial. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay was used to measure interferon-γ (IFN-γ) response to mycobacterial antigens at baseline and after IPT or observation.

- **Results**: IFN-γ levels declined between baseline and the end of IPT (signed rank test P ≤ .0001) and between baseline and a similar period of observation without IPT (signed rank test P = 0.03). The rate of decrease in IFN-γ responses over time did not differ between the groups (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test P = 0.31). QFT-GIT test results in two subjects (5%) in the IPT group and two subjects (5%) in the observation group reverted from positive to negative during follow-up. No significant difference was found between the groups with respect to baseline positivity or the proportion of patients whose tests reverted to negative.

- **Conclusions**: IPT had no effect on changes in QFT-GIT readouts during short-term follow-up of adults with positive tuberculin skin tests in a high TB incidence setting. QFT-GIT is unlikely to be a reliable indicator in this context.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^111XhvVT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Systematic screening in high-burden settings is recommended as a strategy for the early detection of pulmonary tuberculosis disease. This approach can reduce mortality, morbidity, and transmission while improving equity in access to care. Questioning for symptoms and chest radiography (CXR) have historically been the most widely available tools for screening tuberculosis. The accuracy of these tools is crucial for designing effective tuberculosis screening programs. Combined with the accuracy of confirmatory diagnostic tests, they determine the yield of a screening program and the burden on individuals and the health service.

- **Objectives**: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of asking about one or more tuberculosis symptoms or symptom combinations, CXR, and combinations of these as screening tools for detecting bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status. Additionally, to investigate sources of heterogeneity, especially concerning regional, epidemiological, and demographic characteristics of the study populations.

- **Search methods**: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and HTA (Health Technology Assessment) databases using pre-specified search terms and consulted experts for unpublished reports for the period 1992 to 2018. The search was conducted on 10 December 2018 and repeated on 2 July 2021.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were eligible if participants were screened for tuberculosis disease using symptom-based approaches and CXR.

### Clinical characteristics of active tuberculosis diagnosed after starting treatment for latent tuberculosis infection [^112FUU3u]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Although rare, subclinical tuberculosis disease can be missed during evaluations for latent tuberculosis infection and can manifest with symptoms during latent tuberculosis treatment. Among over 8,000 patients treated for latent tuberculosis, we found no evidence of acquired drug resistance, underscoring the safety of rifampin monotherapy for latent tuberculosis.

### Time for a change? Updated guidelines using interferon gamma release assays for detection of latent tuberculosis infection in the office setting [^112SqSxk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alfa inhibitors and other systemic medications increases the risk of reactivating a latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Therefore, screening for latent TB infection is important in dermatology patients eligible for treatment with these medications. Although the tuberculin skin test (TST) has its limitations, it has been the standard choice for the diagnosis of latent TB infection. Since the development of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs), the role of the TST has been re-evaluated, and IGRAs have increasingly been incorporated into national guidelines.

- **Applications of IGRAs**: Although there are situations when either test may be performed, in individuals who have received a BCG vaccination and in those who are unlikely to return for a TST reading, IGRAs may be particularly helpful in distinguishing patients at risk for TB.
- **Summary of guidelines**: This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of both the TST and the IGRA and presents a summary of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010 guidelines for using IGRAs.

### Systematic review, meta-analysis, and cost-effectiveness of treatment of latent tuberculosis to reduce progression to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^115t36P8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence-based recommendations for treating persons with presumed latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) after contact with infectious multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) are lacking because published data consist of small observational studies. Tuberculosis incidence in persons treated for latent MDR-TB infection is unknown.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review of studies published between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 2014 to analyze TB incidence, treatment completion and discontinuation, and cost-effectiveness. Contacts with LTBI were considered effectively treated if they were on one or more medications to which their MDR-TB strain was likely susceptible. We selected studies that compared treatment versus nontreatment outcomes and performed a meta-analysis to estimate the relative risk of TB incidence and its 95% confidence interval.

- **Results**: We abstracted data from 21 articles that met inclusion criteria. Six articles presented outcomes for contacts who were treated compared with those not treated for MDR-LTBI; 10 presented outcomes only for treated contacts, and five presented outcomes only for untreated contacts. The estimated MDR-TB incidence reduction was 90% (9%-99%) using data from five comparison studies. We also found high treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse effects in persons taking pyrazinamide-containing regimens. Cost-effectiveness was greatest using a fluoroquinolone/ethambutol combination regimen.

- **Conclusions**: Few studies met inclusion criteria; therefore, results should be cautiously interpreted. We found a reduced risk of TB incidence with treatment.

### Recent advances in testing for latent TB [^114FyxKQ]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

After more than a century of relying on skin testing for the diagnosis of latent TB infection, clinicians now have access to blood-based diagnostics in the form of interferon γ release assays (IGRAs). These tests are generally associated with higher sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of latent TB infection. This article reviews the indications for testing and treatment of latent TB infection in the overall context of a TB control program and describes how IGRAs might be used in specific clinical settings and populations, including people having close contact with an active case of TB, the foreign-born, and health-care workers.

### Identification and management of latent tuberculosis infection [^113tS7CL]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a condition in which a person is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis but does not currently have active tuberculosis disease. An estimated 10 to 15 million persons in the United States have LTBI. Because 5 to 10 percent of persons with LTBI are at risk of progressing to active disease, identification and treatment of LTBI are essential for the elimination of tuberculosis.

Screening is recommended for high-risk persons, including immigrants; residents and employees of congregate living facilities; and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Targeted tuberculin skin testing remains the most acceptable method of LTBI screening. New tests are being developed, the most promising of which are in vitro interferon-gamma release assays.

All screened persons found to have LTBI should be offered treatment, regardless of age. Before initiating treatment, active tuberculosis must be ruled out by patient history, physical examination, and chest radiography. The treatment of choice for LTBI is isoniazid for nine months. Hepatotoxicity is the most severe adverse effect. Isoniazid should be discontinued if transaminase levels are greater than three times the upper limit of normal in symptomatic patients or five times the upper limit of normal in asymptomatic patients.

### How should I interpret an interferon gamma release assay result for tuberculosis infection [^114rYSDH]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are the first new diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) since the century-old tuberculin skin test (TST). They are cell-mediated immune-based blood tests that have revolutionized LTBI diagnosis and are increasingly recommended by national guidelines.

- **Objectives**: With the rapid expansion of the IGRA evidence base in recent years, the limitations of IGRA and uncertainties in the clinical interpretation of IGRA results have increasingly come into focus. In LTBI diagnosis, these include the prognostic power of IGRAs relative to TST for quantifying the risk of progression to active disease, false-negative rates in immunocompromised patients, the clinical meaning of IGRA reversion, and the significance of the size of the IGRA response. Furthermore, the role of IGRAs in the diagnostic work-up of active TB is unclear, and there is little evidence supporting the use of the tests in anti-TB treatment monitoring.

- **Methodological approach**: Ongoing large prospective longitudinal clinical endpoint cohort studies of active and latent TB will tackle some of the uncertainties regarding IGRAs. Here, we discuss clinical practice and guidance in light of the uncertainties, based on existing evidence.

- **Conclusions and impact**: Planned clinical research will fill the gaps in the evidence base, narrowing the areas of uncertainty and informing future policy. Translational research into next-generation IGRAs and new T cell-based diagnostic platforms will likely overcome the limitations of IGRAs in the near future.

### A systematic review of cost-utility analyses of screening methods in latent tuberculosis infection in high-risk populations [^111nGF7S]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that testing and treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) should be undertaken in high-risk groups using either interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) or a tuberculin skin test (TST). As IGRAs are more expensive than TST, an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of IGRAs can guide decision-makers on the most appropriate choice of test for different high-risk populations. This review aimed to provide the most up-to-date evidence on the cost-effectiveness of LTBI testing in high-risk groups, specifically reporting the costs per QALY of different testing strategies.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search of databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and NHS-EED, was undertaken from 2011 up to March 2021. Studies were screened and extracted by two independent reviewers. The study quality was assessed using the Bias in Economic Evaluation Checklist (ECOBIAS). A narrative synthesis of the included studies was undertaken.

- **Results**: Thirty-two studies reported in thirty-three documents were included in this review. The quality of included studies was generally high, although there was a weakness across all studies in referencing sources correctly and/or justifying choices of parameter values or assumptions where parameter values were not available. Inclusions of IGRAs in testing strategies were consistently found across studies to be cost-effective, but this result was sensitive to underlying LTBI prevalence rates.

- **Conclusion**: While some concerns remain about uncertainty in parameter values used across studies, the evidence suggests that IGRAs can be a cost-effective component of LTBI testing strategies in high-risk populations when accounting for specific prevalence rates.

### Guidelines on interferon-γ release assays for tuberculosis infection: concordance, discordance or confusion [^112hKrFk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection and preventive therapy is important for TB control, especially in high-risk populations. Since the advent of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), many studies have evaluated their role in diagnosing active and latent TB. With the growing evidence base, many guidelines now include IGRAs. We surveyed the literature and contacted experts to identify 33 guidelines and position papers from 25 countries and two supranational organizations.

The results show considerable diversity in the recommendations on IGRAs, with four approaches commonly proposed:

- **Two-step approach**: Tuberculin skin test (TST) first, followed by IGRA either when the TST is negative (to increase sensitivity, mainly in immunocompromised individuals) or when the TST is positive (to increase specificity, mainly in Bacillus Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated individuals).
- **Either TST or IGRA**: But not both.
- **IGRA and TST together**: To increase sensitivity.
- **IGRA only**: Replacing the TST.

Overall, the use of IGRAs is increasingly recommended. However, most of the guidelines do not use objective, transparent methods to grade evidence and recommendations, and do not disclose conflicts of interest. Future IGRA guidelines must aim to be transparent, evidence-based, periodically updated, and free of financial conflicts and industry involvement.

### Dual skin testing for latent tuberculosis infection: a decision analysis [^112i9xHL]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Recent data indicate that 10- to 14-mm Mycobacterium tuberculosis purified protein derivative (PPD) reactions are often due to prior infections with nontuberculous mycobacteria. Therefore, using a 10-mm cutpoint to define latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) results in false-positive diagnoses and unnecessary treatment for LTBI. A second skin test, Mycobacterium avium sensitin (MAS), has been shown to accurately identify false-positive PPD results.

- **Objective**: To compare the costs and accuracy of a single skin-test strategy (SST) with PPD alone with a dual skin-test strategy (DST) where 10- to 14-mm PPD results are also tested with MAS.

- **Methods**: A decision analytic model was developed to evaluate the two strategies. The model accounted for the costs of skin testing, the costs of LTBI treatment, the costs of undetected LTBI, and the sensitivity and specificity of each strategy.

- **Results**: We estimated that DST saved US dollars 3 per subject tested compared to SST. Savings were due to a reduction in false-positive PPD results and consequent reduction in unnecessary treatment for LTBI of > 60%. The DST strategy was associated with a minimal increase in undetected LTBI (6% vs 7%). Results were stable for a broad range of parameter values.

- **Conclusions**: DST is a promising approach to improving the specificity of LTBI testing when a 10-mm PPD cutpoint is used and would reduce costs and unnecessary drug treatment.

### Beyond latent and active tuberculosis: a scoping review of conceptual frameworks [^112mARyu]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Developing diagnostics that can differentiate between states is essential for a novel framework to be clinically meaningful. Tests that can discriminate between States 0, I, II, and III, identified in our review — namely, clearance of infection, presence of viable bacilli, containment of infection, and breakdown of immune control — have critical clinical and public health significance. Similarly, approaches towards treatment that are based on a binary paradigm will need to be adapted, including potentially novel regimens or varying durations of existing regimens.

Outcomes of vaccinology studies may require reconsideration with a clearer understanding of which states are being targeted and prevented through vaccine administration. While the First International Symposium on New Concepts in Early TB Disease aimed to develop consensus around a novel framework with consistent definitions and terminologies, it is important that this framework is regularly updated with advancements in our understanding of the disease process. This may potentially include states for post-TB lung disease that were not part of this review.

### Chest roentgenography is complementary to interferon-gamma release assay in latent tuberculosis infection screening of rheumatic patients [^114fpfDC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who received their first latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) screening as candidates for biologics or users between January 2013 and April 2014 in a tertiary-care hospital were included in this retrospective study. All patients received a chest X-ray (CXR) along with a tuberculosis interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) test (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, Cellestis, Australia). This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (IRB-105066-E). Medical records of all patients were reviewed until one year after the screening, identifying any history of previous Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection and close contact with patients with MTB.

According to the Taiwan Rheumatology Association recommendations, candidates for biologic therapy should receive initial IGRA and CXR screening, and users should receive yearly IGRA screening with CXR every six months. A nine-month regimen of daily isoniazid 300 mg therapy (9H) is recommended for LTBI chemoprevention. Patients with LTBI are defined as those with a positive IGRA but without CXR or other evidence of active MTB. If IGRA tests are negative or indeterminate, LTBI diagnosis depends on clinical conditions and CXR findings. If patients with LTBI are unwilling to take or intolerant to isoniazid, they can receive CXR follow-up every three months by tuberculosis specialists or pulmonologists.

Two pulmonologists reviewed the CXR taken within three months of the IGRA screening. Apical pleural thickening, interstitial granuloma calcification, thin-wall cysts, pericardial calcifications, and fibrotic lesions seen as irregular.

### Detection of interleukin-2 is not useful for distinguishing between latent and active tuberculosis in clinical practice: a prospective cohort study [^115jUW9d]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of interleukin-2 (IL-2) as a biomarker for distinguishing between latent and active tuberculosis (TB) in a clinical setting. Previous reports suggested its potential when quantified in the supernatants of QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-tube (QFT) after 72 hours of incubation. However, its validity had not been tested in an appropriate clinical cohort.

This multicentre study involved 161 consecutive adult patients undergoing evaluation for active TB at eight TB Units in Spain. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-2 were assessed in the supernatant of QFT after 16–24 hours and 72 hours of incubation. The accuracy of IL-2 for indicating latent TB infection (LTBI) was assessed using receiving operating characteristic curves.

The results revealed that 28 participants were not infected, 43 had LTBI, 69 had TB, and 21 were not classifiable. Median (interquartile range) IL-2 concentrations after 72 hours of incubation were 0.0 pg/mL (0.0–0.0) in uninfected individuals, 261.0 pg/mL (81.0–853.0) in LTBI individuals, 166.5 pg/mL (33.5–551.5) in patients with extrapulmonary TB, 95.0 pg/mL (26.0–283.0) in patients with smear-negative pulmonary TB, and 38.5 pg/mL (7.5–178.0) in patients with smear-positive pulmonary TB (p < 0.0001). The area under the curve of the receiving operating characteristic curve (95% CI) of IL-2 after 72 hours of incubation for the diagnosis of LTBI was 0.63 (0.53–0.74) when all TB cases were considered as a single group, ranging from 0.59 (0.47–0.71) to 0.72 (0.58–0.85) when only extrapulmonary and smear-positive pulmonary TB cases respectively were considered.

In conclusion, the quantification of IL-2 in the supernatant after incubation did not prove useful for distinguishing between latent and active TB in clinical practice.

### Chest roentgenography is complementary to interferon-gamma release assay in latent tuberculosis infection screening of rheumatic patients [^113C5srW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Isoniazid prophylaxis after LTBI screening**: Taiwan recommendations for LTBI screening and prophylaxis suggest that patients with positive IGRA tests receive isoniazid prophylaxis following a comprehensive evaluation of clinical conditions and excluding active MTB. Those with negative IGRA but CXR findings of possible MTB sequelae might receive prophylactic treatment or cautious follow-up by a tuberculosis specialist or pulmonologist.

	- Six among 46 patients with positive IGRA did not receive prophylaxis, including two postponing TNFi therapy after evaluation, two followed by pulmonologists instead of isoniazid prophylaxis, and two with previous complete MTB treatment. The other 40 patients underwent isoniazid prophylaxis.

	- IGRA-non-positive patients with old TB-suggestive CXR comprised 13.4% (32/238) of all our rheumatic patients. They were asymptomatic, and none received chemoprophylaxis.

### New diagnostics to infer risk in tuberculosis: Is the term "latent tuberculosis infection" obsolete [^114mnVks]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis and estimation of risk in latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) remain a major clinical and global health challenge. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection reflects a continuum between LTBI and active tuberculosis (TB). LTBI is the most common form of Mtb infection, affecting one-quarter of the world's population and killing approximately 2,000,000 people every year. Immunocompetent individuals with LTBI have a 5–10% risk of developing active TB during their lifetime, most commonly within the first two years after exposure. Treatment of LTBI is effective in reducing the risk of developing subsequent active TB disease, but identifying patients most at risk of developing active TB and ensuring successful LTBI treatment remain significant challenges.

Available laboratory tests for the detection of LTBI have serious diagnostic limitations, including a poor predictive value (< 5%) for identifying subjects with LTBI who will actually develop active TB. Tuberculin skin testing and IFN-γ release assays can detect cell-mediated immune reactivity in Mtb infection. However, none of these tests can differentiate LTBI from active TB, nor can they distinguish between those who achieve subsequent bacterial clearance and/or effective infection containment from others who have silent and persistent infections at high risk to develop TB. Therefore, improvements in TB diagnostics are urgently needed to improve both the sensitivity and specificity of Mtb infection detection and to more accurately determine the risk of progression or reactivation into active TB.
