When one uses a time-series design to evaluate a program, fluctuation in the outcome slope can be accounted for by various alternative hypotheses. According to Campbell and Stanley, the most probable alternative is that

Answer Choices:
A. a simultaneous event produced the fluctuation
B. participants dropped out of the group, reducing the size of the sample
C. aging effects were unduly influential
D. test — retest reliability is inadequate

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which alternative explanation for a change in slope in a time-series program evaluation is considered most probable according to Campbell and Stanley. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core threats to internal validity in quasi-experimental time-series designs. Then, I should verify which of the listed options maps most directly to those threats. Next, I will consider the relative plausibility of each alternative in the context of typical program evaluations. Finally, I will confirm the answer and briefly justify why the other options are less likely or less specific to time-series threats.

> Let me first confirm the design context and the key validity threats. In interrupted time-series designs, we infer causality from a change in slope or level coinciding with an intervention; however, rival explanations such as history, maturation, instrumentation, regression, attrition, and testing can mimic intervention effects, so identifying the most probable threat matters for inference [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine Option A, "a simultaneous event produced the fluctuation". Wait, let me verify the mapping to classic threats: this aligns with the history threat, where an external event concurrent with the intervention could plausibly alter the outcome trajectory, and Campbell and Stanley emphasize history as a pervasive rival explanation in quasi-experiments, especially when the outcome is sensitive to contextual events or policy changes [^notfound].

> Next, I should review Option B, "participants dropped out". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: attrition is a valid concern in longitudinal studies, but in time-series designs the unit of analysis is typically an aggregate series rather than individual participants, so systematic dropout is less likely to explain a population-level slope change unless the sampling frame itself is disrupted; still, I need to ensure I'm not overstating this, because differential attrition can bias estimates in some longitudinal designs, even if it's not the primary time-series threat here [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option C, "aging effects". Let me think about this carefully: maturation is a recognized threat, but in most program evaluations the observation window is too short for aging per se to drive noticeable slope changes; moreover, maturation is a within-individual process, whereas time-series often track population aggregates where aging is constant across periods, making sudden slope shifts less plausibly due to aging alone in short horizons [^notfound].

> Next, I should review Option D, "test–retest reliability". Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this might map to instrumentation, but that's not quite right; instrumentation refers to changes in measurement procedures or instruments over time, not the psychometric reliability of a test. Poor reliability would inflate noise and reduce power, but it wouldn't systematically produce a slope change aligned with an intervention point, so this is not the most probable rival explanation for a slope fluctuation in a time-series evaluation [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the relative plausibility. History (a simultaneous event) is the most probable alternative because external events frequently coincide with program implementation and can plausibly alter population-level outcomes, whereas attrition is less likely to explain aggregate slope changes, aging is too slow to account for short-window shifts, and test–retest reliability issues would tend to obscure rather than create a coherent slope change at the intervention point [^notfound].

> Final answer: A. A simultaneous event produced the fluctuation.

---

The most probable alternative explanation for a fluctuation in outcome slope in a time-series design, according to Campbell and Stanley, is **a simultaneous event** (Option A) — also known as a history effect — occurring at the same time as the intervention, which can confound attribution of the change to the program. This is a core threat to internal validity in quasi-experimental designs, especially when no control group is present [^notfound]. The other options (attrition, maturation, and test–retest reliability) are less likely to explain a sudden slope change in aggregate time-series data.

---

## Alternative explanations for fluctuation in outcome slope

Campbell and Stanley identify several **alternative explanations** for observed changes in time-series designs:

- **History effects**: Simultaneous external events occurring concurrently with the intervention, potentially causing the observed change [^notfound].
- **Maturation**: Natural changes over time (e.g. aging, learning) that could influence outcomes [^notfound].
- **Testing**: Repeated measurement itself may affect behavior or outcomes [^notfound].
- **Instrumentation**: Changes in measurement tools or procedures over time [^notfound].
- **Attrition**: Selective dropout or loss of participants, potentially biasing results [^1b76d5f6].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

### Option A: a simultaneous event produced the fluctuation

This corresponds to a **history effect**, a primary threat to internal validity in time-series designs. External events (e.g. policy changes, economic shifts, natural disasters) can coincide with the intervention, making it difficult to isolate the program's effect. Campbell and Stanley emphasize history as a key rival explanation when no control group is present [^notfound].

---

### Option B: participants dropped out of the group, reducing the size of the sample

This reflects **attrition**, which is more concerning in individual-level longitudinal studies than in aggregate time-series designs. While attrition can bias results, it is less likely to explain a sudden slope change in population-level data unless dropout is systematically related to the outcome and occurs at the intervention point [^1b76d5f6].

---

### Option C: aging effects were unduly influential

This reflects **maturation**, which refers to natural changes over time (e.g. aging, learning). Maturation is a gradual process and is less likely to cause a sudden fluctuation in slope coinciding with the intervention unless the observation period is very long or the population is rapidly changing [^notfound].

---

### Option D: test — retest reliability is inadequate

This reflects **testing effects**, where repeated measurement influences behavior. Testing effects are more relevant in individual-level studies with repeated measures and are less likely to explain a sudden aggregate slope change in time-series data [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and answer

The most probable alternative explanation, according to Campbell and Stanley, is **Option A: a simultaneous event produced the fluctuation** (history effect). This is because external events can coincide with the intervention, confounding attribution of the observed change to the program. The other options are less likely to explain a sudden slope change in aggregate time-series data.

---

The correct answer is **A. a simultaneous event produced the fluctuation**.

Points show the estimated effect sizes for study drop-outs. Panel 2 a shows participants who declined to continue at T1 (N = 484 participants) relative to participants who opted to continue (N = 102 participants). Separate effect sizes are shown for Leavers (N = 169 participants who were continuers, N = 23 participants who were drop-outs) and Remainers (N = 315 participants who were continuers, N = 79 participants who were drop-outs) for effects that were moderated by group. Panel 2 b shows participants who completed the interaction (N = 120 participants) relative to those who failed to respond or show among those who opted to continue at T1 (N = 262 participants).

The analyses indicated that younger people and those less willing to compromise with the outgroup were more likely to drop out at the later stages. There were no significant differences between Leavers and Remainers.

Main analyses: intervention effects

Leaver-Remainer differences on study variables at T1 for the intervention sample are reported in the Supplementary Results 3.

Comparison of intervention and control interaction ratings

There were no significant effects of condition or group, nor were there significant interactions between group and condition for positive and negative state affect following the interaction, experienced quality of the interaction, equality-based respect during the interaction, or perceived similarity to the interaction partner. Overall, this suggests that the control and intervention conditions did not differ statistically significantly from one another in the experienced quality and that any experimental effects can therefore not be attributed to the experience of a positive interaction per se. Detailed results are reported in the Supplementary Results 4.

### A personalized multi-interventional approach focusing on customized nutrition, progressive fitness, and lifestyle modification resulted in the reduction of HbA1c, fasting blood sugar and weight in type 2 diabetes: a retrospective study [^1e96528d]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 150 patients were enrolled and adhered to SDRP for 90 days. The participants were categorized into age buckets. Among 150 participants, 17% were in the age group of 20–35 years (yr), 49% were between 36 and 50 yr, 26% were between 51 and 65 yr, and 8% were between 66 and 80 yr. The average age of the participants was 50 years.

HaemoglobinA1c (HbA1c) level

The mean HbA1c level of the study group at baseline was 9.0 ± 1.5%. After 90 days into the intervention, it was reduced to 7.1 ± 1.3% with a mean HbA1c drop of 1.9 ± 1.5%. In SDRP, participants in the age group between 20 and 35 yr showed a drop of 2.5% in the HbA1c level from baseline, which is the highest drop compared to the rest of the age groups. Further, a lesser reduction of HbA1c level was shown in other age groups such as 1.8% in 36–50 yr, 1.5% in 51–65 yr and 1.9% in 66–80 yr (Fig. 1 a). On the other hand, the control group had a mean HbA1c level of 7.13 ± 0.5% at the baseline and saw a slight increase to 7.18 ± 0.3% after 90 days of the study (Fig. 1 b).

Discussion

Intergroup contact is viewed as one of the most promising interventions to reduce affective polarization, and its main tenets underpin many initiatives to bridge political divides. Experimental work aiming to establish contact's causal effects on intergroup affect and cognition in the political domain, and to determine what form contact between political opponents should take to be effective, is only beginning to emerge –. Our research makes several contributions to scholarship and practice on this issue. We developed a one-off intervention with a theoretical basis in the literature on intergroup contact – and dialogue –, and the work on intergroup understanding –. We demonstrate that this intervention can be applied in an online context and evaluate its effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial with repeated measurement, using a strong control group to isolate the effects of intergroup contact from the effects of experiencing a positive interaction per se. Our design allowed us to evaluate both selective drop-out of participants as well as the causal effects of the intervention in the short- and longer-term. It thus addresses weaknesses of existing studies on the effects of contact, which lacked randomization, included confounding variables, or relied on no-treatment controls. We do this in a context of affective polarization (Brexit in the UK) that has received relatively little research attention.

Our findings have implications for both future research and interventions that aim to reduce affective polarization. First, we found that drop-out from our study was systematic, such that participants who were more strongly committed to their group and have more negative orientations toward the political outgroup were less willing to participate in the interaction. On the one hand, this might undermine the wider generalizability of our findings. Given that those who are ideologically most extreme tend to benefit the most from contact with outgroup members, it is possible that the current study underestimates the effects of contact. On the other hand, estimating treatment effects among those who voluntarily choose to participate provides more realistic effect sizes for applications in the "real world", as those most strongly invested in their group memberships are less likely to conform to requests to engage respectfully with the outgroup.

Tests for selective attrition

We compared participants who at the end of the T1 survey indicated that they would like to continue with the study (i.e. to participate in the interaction; N = 484) with participants who indicated that they would not like to participate further (N = 102) in terms of demographic and attitudinal variables (see Supplementary Results 2). We detected selective attrition for a range of variables. Remainers were more likely to drop out than Leavers, as were older compared to younger people, and participants who reported less prior outgroup contact and lower contact quality. Those who decided to leave the study were also more strongly identified with their group, rated the outgroup as less intelligent, made more unfavourable attributions about the outgroups' views, reported higher levels of contempt and negative emotions, and lower levels of warmth, perspective taking, and empathic concern. Compared to continuers, drop-outs were also significantly less willing to compromise and more likely to engage in collective action on behalf of their group. There were three significant differences in predictors of drop-out between Remainers and Leavers: While Leavers who thought the outgroup viewed them as less intelligent were more likely to continue with the study, the opposite was true for Remainers. Brexit beliefs also favoured dropouts for Remainers but not Leavers. Moreover, negative meta-emotions favoured drop-out for Remainers but not for Leavers. Overall, these findings indicate that those with higher levels of attachment to their group and more negative outgroup orientations were more likely to drop out (see Fig. 2a). We also compared participants who declared at T1 that they would like to participate but failed to respond or show (N = 262) with participants who participated in the interaction (N = 120; see Fig. 2b).

ACOEM methodology — Dropout rate rating outlines criteria for study quality based on participant attrition: Rating is "0" if there is no mention of drop-outs or it cannot be inferred from the data presented. Rating is "0.5" if the drop-out issue is briefly addressed and the description suggests that there were few drop-outs, but a complete assessment is not possible; rating is 0.5 if here are 2/3, 3/4, 3/5, 4/5 etc. groups with dropout rates at a rate of less than 20% but other groups are greater than 20%. Rating is "1.0" if there are specific data and the drop-out rate is under 20%; if there is a follow up study to the original study and the dropout rate is over 20% due to unforeseen circumstances such as a high mortality rate from, for example, traumatic brain injury, the scoring should be a 0.5.

### Reporting of stepped wedge cluster randomised trials: extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement with explanation and elaboration [^b1e27238]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Item 13b: Participant attrition

Standard CONSORT item — For each group, losses and exclusions after randomisation, together with reasons.

CONSORT cluster extension — For each group, losses and exclusions for both clusters and individual cluster members.

Extension for SW-CRTs — For each treatment condition or allocated sequence, losses and exclusions for both clusters and participants with reasons.

Example (Flowchart by treatment condition and sequence, cross-sectional design) — Supplementary materials, figure S2.

Explanation — Information on the number of clusters and participants who were assessed for eligibility and outcomes along with the number of losses and exclusions (ie, withdrawals) allows the reader to assess the risk of differential inclusion and attrition.

Any flowchart should allow the reader to examine the nature of any differential inclusion and attrition by allocated sequence, treatment condition, and over time (see example). Because there are many different types of SW-CRTs there is unlikely to be one flowchart that will be applicable for all SW-CRTs. How the flowchart is constructed will depend on how many sequences and clusters there are, whether participants contribute repeated measures, and whether participants can join and leave the study. This information could be presented by allocated sequence but might also be presented by treatment conditions.

Including periods in the flowchart is important to allow for assessment of differential participation over time. When different participants are sampled in each period, each participant will, in theory, be exposed to either the intervention or control condition. In this case, summarising the number of participants by treatment condition is possible. Where the same participant contributes multiple measurements, each participant may provide measurements under both intervention and control conditions. In this case, summarising the number of participants by allocated sequence, along with the average number of measurements contributed by each participant, is more appropriate.

Reporting the number of clusters and participants approached, eligible, and included along with the reasons for non-participation is important to allow an assessment of study generalisability, and perhaps even more importantly, of biases due to differential participation between treatment conditions (or sequences). For example, in a parallel CRT without blinding of participants to treatment condition at the time of recruitment, a higher rate of consent among those recruited to the intervention condition can indicate recruitment bias. Information on reasons as to why participants or clusters are not included allows a reader to assess the appropriateness of exclusions.

### Effectiveness of genetic feedback on alcohol metabolism to reduce alcohol consumption in young adults: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^41f3b1bb]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Additionally, despite the lack of a special intervention, the AUDIT-C score decreased from baseline to 6 months in the control group. The participants in the control group were asked to read and study the same traditional educational materials for university students as the intervention group. Generally, visualizing personal health data motivates users to increase or maintain their activities. In addition, the Hawthorne effect on alcohol-use behavior may have occurred in this study. Accordingly, participating in this study may have contributed to the reduction in alcohol consumption among young adults, regardless of whether genetic testing information was fed back to the participants.

In this study, we provide a new approach to reducing alcohol consumption among excessive drinkers, which is not only an academic contribution but also beneficial to public health. Considering the current situation in which individual differences in health literacy exist, with those with low health literacy in childhood maintaining the health literacy at low levels in later life, SBI may be effective in the workplace and among other adult age groups. It is desirable to expand the target population in the future.

This study had some limitations. First, 21 participants (21.0%) in the intervention group and 28 (29.2%) in the control group were lost to follow-up during the study period. However, a previously reported intervention reducing alcohol consumption for college students confirmed that approximately 40% participants drop out at 6 months, indicating that the compliance rate of our study was relatively high. In addition, the number of participants who completed the current study up to the 6-month point was similar to that reported in a previous study. Hence, our sample size, excluding the dropouts, may be valid for the investigation of our research questions and might not have a significant impact on the data interpretation and conclusions of this study. Nevertheless, the possibility that some participants dropped out owing to unchanged or increased alcohol consumption cannot be denied. Thus, we may have under- or over-estimated the effects of SBI on alcohol-use behavior.

### An intervention targeting fundamental values among caregivers at residential facilities: effects of a cluster-randomized controlled trial on residents' self-reported empowerment, person-centered climate and life satisfaction [^9a15a688]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Methodological limitations

The number of available participants in the intervention group was 156 and in the control group 144. Even, if we set out not to include units specialized for persons with dementia only 70 of 156 residents in the intervention group and 69 of 144 in the control group met the inclusion criterion, and of these only 43 in the intervention group and 37 in the control group participated in both data collection at baseline and follow-up. That less than half of the available participants could be asked to participate in the study was mainly due to the fact that they were diagnosed with dementia, despite this not living in a unit specialized for persons with dementia, or had reduced cognitive ability, with difficulties understanding the questions. This entails a limitation in external validity, as the results cannot be generalized to all residents living in the residential facilities as these include residents with cognitive impairment. Despite this limitation, it is important to examine the perspectives of residents whose cognitive ability is intact, as there is a lack of research in this area. Another limitation is that there were significant differences between the intervention and control groups at baseline and there were some drop-outs in both groups which are threats to internal validity, i.e. sample differences between the groups that could also cause the observed effect. We used complete/available case analyses (also called a partial intention-to-treat analysis, all participants with complete data were analysed in the groups to which they were randomized) which may result in biased estimates. Another approach would have been to imputate values for the drop-outs. Reasons for drop-outs in both groups were deceased (7 intervention group; 6 control group), reduced cognitive ability (3 intervention group; 4 control group) and reduced general conditions (2 intervention group; 5 control group).

### A personalized multi-interventional approach focusing on customized nutrition, progressive fitness, and lifestyle modification resulted in the reduction of HbA1c, fasting blood sugar and weight in type 2 diabetes: a retrospective study [^e0ae9c00]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Fasting blood sugar (FBS) level

The study group had a mean FBS level of 178.3 ± 57.1 mg/dL at baseline. After 90 days into the intervention, it was reduced to 116.1 ± 24.4 mg/dL with a mean FBS drop of 62.2 ± 51.8 mg/dL. In SDRP, the highest reduction in FBS level was 65 mg/dL and this was seen in the age group of 36–50 yr. Rest of the other age groups showed similar reduction in FBS, and the observed drop was 61 mg/dL in 20–35 yr, 60 mg/dL in 51–65 yr and 53.5 mg/dL in 66–80 yr and (Fig. 2 a). The control group, on the other hand, had a mean FBS level of 142.5 ± 48.1 mg/dL at baseline and decreased to 141.1 ± 44.8 mg/dL post 90 days, which is an insignificant drop of 1.42 ± 25.3 mg/dL (Fig. 2 b).

### Effect of provision of non-alcoholic beverages on alcohol consumption: a randomized controlled study [^c2f3c7db]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of alcohol-flavored beverages not containing alcohol (hereinafter referred to as non-alcoholic beverages) is recommended to reduce alcohol consumption. However, it is unclear if this reduces excessive drinking.

Objective

To verify whether non-alcoholic beverages impact the alcohol consumption of excessive drinkers.

Study Design

Single-center, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study.

Methods

Participants aged 20 years or older who were not diagnosed with alcoholism, who drank at least four times a week, and whose alcohol consumption on those days was at least 40 g in males and 20 g in females, were recruited. Participants were randomized into the intervention or control group by simple randomization using a random number table. In the intervention group, free non-alcoholic beverages were provided once every 4 weeks for 12 weeks (three times in total), and thereafter, the number of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages consumed were recorded for up to 20 weeks. The consumption of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages was calculated based on a drinking diary submitted with the previous 4 weeks of data. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in total alcohol consumption during past 4 weeks at week 12. The participants were not blinded to group allocations.

Results

Fifty-four participants (43.9%) were allocated to the intervention group and 69 (56.1%) to the control group. None of the participants in the intervention group dropped out, compared to two (1.6%) in the control group. The change in alcohol consumption was-320.8 g (standard deviation [SD], 283.6) in the intervention group and-76.9 g (SD, 272.6) in the control group at Week 12, indicating a significant difference (p < 0.001). Even at Week 20 (8 weeks after the completion of the intervention), the change was-276.9 g (SD, 39.1) in the intervention group, which was significantly greater than-126.1 g (SD, 41.3) in the control group (p < 0.001). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the change in non-alcoholic beverage consumption and alcohol consumption at Week 12 was significantly negative only in the intervention group (ρ = -0.500, p < 0.001). There were no reports of adverse events during the study.

Conclusions

Providing non-alcoholic beverages significantly reduced alcohol consumption, an effect that persisted for 8 weeks after the intervention.

### Peer education group intervention to reduce psychological insulin resistance: a pilot mixed-method study in a Chinese population [^60cf7120]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

To Assess Acceptability and Feasibility of the Intervention

To assess acceptability by participants, attendance and qualitative information on the experience of being in the group were collected. Participants were interviewed in person until data saturation, following preliminary analysis of quantitative data. In this study, a small number of patients started insulin after the group. To include these experiences, they were all invited for interview. Otherwise, patients who had attended the group near the end of the trial were preferred because they were more likely to remember the intervention. This semi-structured interview allowed us (1) to understand the experience of the patients attending the group and (2) to explain the results of the quantitative data. The interview was conducted by a research assistant trained by the principal investigator. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in accordance with the interview guide (Table 1).

Table 1
Semi-structured interview for participants

Sample Size

A pilot study involving one patient group was conducted. At a power of 85% and type I error at 5%, 50 participants were needed for total C-ITAS score to drop by more than 6 points. Previous studies showed that a drop of 3–8 points of the ITAS score among DM patients was associated with subsequent willingness to start on insulin.

### Oral fumaric acid esters for psoriasis: abridged cochrane systematic review including GRADE assessments [^0776cc78]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 4
Comparison: fumaric acid esters (s) vs. methotrexate. Outcome: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score at follow‐up. confidence interval.

No significant difference was noted between the two groups in the numbers of participants who attained PASI 50 (RR 0·71, 95% CI 0·41–1·22; very low‐quality evidence), PASI 75 (RR 0·80, 95% CI 0·28–2·29; very low‐quality evidence) and PASI 90 (RR 0·48, 95% CI 0·05–4·98; very low‐quality evidence). However, the maximum dose of methotrexate used in this study (15 mg per week) may have been suboptimal, as higher doses can be prescribed in routine clinical practice. Also, the time of assessment at 12 weeks might have been too early to evaluate true efficacy. Although the study reported no significant difference in the number of participants attaining PASI 75 and PASI 90 at week 16, it must be noted that the dose of methotrexate was reduced gradually from week 12, which may have reduced the effect size.

The dropout rate due to adverse effects in both groups was not significantly different (RR 0·19, 95% CI 0·02–1·53; very low‐quality evidence) (Fig. 5). Four participants (16%) in the methotrexate group dropped out because of elevated liver enzymes; another patient dropped out due to recurrent angina unrelated to treatment. Raised liver enzymes were reported to be transient, and normalized 4–8 weeks after treatment discontinuation. Only one participant in the FAE group (4%) discontinued treatment, due to diarrhoea.

Overall, the number of participants experiencing nuisance adverse effects was not significantly different between the two groups (RR 0·89, 95% CI 0·77–1·03; very low‐quality evidence). However, more participants experienced flushing in the FAE group (13 vs. two) (RR 6·50, 95% CI 1·62–26·09).

### The higher benefit of lecanemab in males compared to females in CLARITY AD is probably due to a real sex effect [^4d7828c1]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

A drug effect was simultaneously injected as a 27% reduction in the linear slope of drug‐treated synthetic participants' CDRSBΔbl trajectories compared to the placebo participants. The slope for the placebo group is equal to the β (i.e. the coefficient) of the " term in the Equation 1 model fit to our female‐only simulation cohort. In this way, our female‐only trial simulation model encodes a female‐specific rate of cognitive decline for the placebo group, and thus a female‐specific decline rate for the drug group. We also encoded 20% participant dropout by the trial's final observation, as was assumed in the real CLARITY AD sample size calculation.

This overall procedure generates a simulated trial constrained by the CLARITY AD parameters specified in its analysis plan, as described in the main results paper. The process was repeated 10,000 times to simulate 10,000 female‐only trials matching the CLARITY AD design parameters. Each simulation had the same cohort‐level trend but a different sampling of participant‐level trajectories, thus accounting for randomization and inter‐participant heterogeneity in cognitive decline within and across simulations. Next, we extracted the drug versus placebo CDRSBΔbl linear slope difference (i.e. the observed drug effect size) from each simulation using the Equation 1 model, but here it contained an additional interaction term of trial group (drug = 1, placebo = 0) with. The estimated coefficient of this new term represents the observed drug effect size in the simulated trial. While a standalone trial group term was included in CLARITY AD's primary analysis model, we do not include that term here because our simulated drug effect is encoded only as a slope‐reducing effect, that is, a cognitive decline rate–reducing effect as reported in CLARITY AD's primary analysis. We do not encode any other offset in effect between trial groups. Overall, this methodology is conceptually analogous to simultaneously running 10,000 identically designed female‐only trials in the real world.

### Guidance for protocol content and reporting of factorial randomised trials: explanation and elaboration of the CONSORT 2010 and SPIRIT 2013 extensions [^2cd1afa6]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Explanation

The sample size calculation should be guided by the main trial objectives, and thus will differ depending on whether the aim is to evaluate multiple interventions in a single trial, or to detect an interaction.

Interactions affect the required sample size. A statement relating to the assumptions regarding the presence or absence of interaction in the calculation will assist readers in understanding how the calculation was performed, and whether it is appropriate for the trial objectives.

For 2-in-1 factorial trials, a sample size calculation is typically performed for each main comparison using the same approach as for a two-arm parallel group trial (ie, using the same desired level of power, significance level, etc); however, the required number of participants per group is then multiplied by the number of levels within the comparison to obtain the overall sample size, rather than by the number of treatment groups in the trial (eg, in a 2×2 trial, this number is multiplied by two levels, and not by four treatment groups).

Then, once the sample size has been calculated for each main comparison, the largest of these is chosen if they differ across comparisons. A difference might occur if different interventions are expected to produce different treatment effects, if different primary outcomes are used for each factor, or if the number of levels differs between factors.

Sample size calculations based on a binary primary outcome might require special consideration to account for the assumed effect of each other intervention on the event rate in the control arm. For example, in a 2×2 factorial design, assume that (1) the event rate in the double control group is 40%; and that (2) both treatments reduce the absolute event rate by 5 percentage points, or an equivalent relative reduction of 12.5%. For the comparison between all A and all not A, the assumed event rate in the all-not-A group is thus 37.5%, because half of these participants also receive treatment B. This difference from the event rate in the double control group might require a reduction or increase in sample size, depending on whether the same absolute or relative effect is to be detected.

### Kinesiology taping reduces the pain of finger osteoarthritis: a pilot single-blinded two-group parallel randomized trial [^ace0c664]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Quick-DASH scores were not affected by taping (Table 1). For the intervention group, there was no significant change in the Quick-DASH general scores (p = 0.6) or work module scores (p = 0.4). Similarly, for the control group, there was no significant change in quick-DASH general scores (p = 0.1) or work module scores (p = 0.9).

Taping did not affect the range of motion in any finger joint (Table 2). At baseline, taping did not change the total aROM for the sample overall (95% CI of change –63, 19°) or per group (p = 0.4). No issues were reported by seven patients. Negative feedback was provided by three participants, and one participant dropped out, which are described below:
Two 72-year-old participants, one male (placebo group) and one female (intervention group) stated that they "perceived no benefit". The male reported a "flare of OA in week three", which he attributed to the tape.
54-year-old female working in catering (intervention group) – "occasionally had to remove the tape as it felt uncomfortable". This was qualified with a verbal explanation that sometimes it felt too tight, particularly when bending the finger.
52-year-old health care worker (randomized to the intervention group) – this participant dropped out after randomization and provided no outcome data. She was telephoned once recruitment had concluded to enquire about her experience, and she reported that once she had seen the tape applied and tried it at home; she felt that it was incompatible with her occupation as a health care professional.

### An intervention targeting fundamental values among caregivers at residential facilities: effects of a cluster-randomized controlled trial on residents' self-reported empowerment, person-centered climate and life satisfaction [^91bd35e8]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Participants

The number of residents living in the units was 156 in the intervention group and 144 in the control group. Inclusion criteria for residents were being able to complete a questionnaire by oneself or with assistance from the first author or a research assistant, hereafter labeled assessor, and having resided for more than 2 weeks at the facility. Exclusion criteria for residents were diagnosed dementia and/or reduced cognitive ability, with difficulties understanding the questions. The registered nurses at the residential facilities reported to the first author the number of residents with diagnosed dementia and the number of residents with, as they estimated, reduced cognitive ability. The first author or the assessor asked all residents who met the inclusion criteria if they would like to participate. In the intervention group 55 of the 70 (79%) residents who met the inclusion criteria agreed to participate, and in the control group, 52 of the 69 (75%) residents who met the inclusion criteria agreed to participate. During the study 12 of the 55 (22%) residents in the intervention group and 15 of the 52 (29%) residents in the control group dropped out. The most frequent reason for dropping out was that the resident was deceased. The number of residents who completed the questionnaire at baseline and follow-up was 43 (78%) in the intervention group and 37 (71%) in the control group; see Fig. 1.

Written information regarding informed consent from the residents, information about the study, the questionnaire and the response alternatives were written in a large font to facilitate reading. Nevertheless all residents needed assistance with reading the questionnaire, and therefore received help from the first author or the assessor. The questions and the response alternatives were then read out loud for the residents. The response alternatives were written on a separate card in a large font to further facilitate reading. All of the residents chose to perform the data collection in their apartments at the facility. Prior to the questionnaire, the residents received information from the first author or the assessor. The information explained the aim of the study, that participation was voluntary, that they could withdraw from the study at any time and that the data would be treated confidentially. The residents also signed an informed consent form.

### Physical therapy for urinary incontinence in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or low bone density: a randomized controlled trial [^3299590a]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of 12 weekly physical therapy sessions for urinary incontinence (UI) compared with a control intervention, for reducing the number of UI episodes measured with the 7-day bladder diary, at 3 months and 1 year postrandomization.

Methods

A single parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted at one outpatient public health center, in postmenopausal women aged 55 years and over with osteoporosis or low bone density and UI. Women were randomized to physical therapy (PT) for UI or osteoporosis education. The primary outcome measure was number of leakage episodes on the 7-day bladder diary, assessed at baseline, after treatment and at 1 year. The secondary outcome measures included the pad test and disease-specific quality of life and self-efficacy questionnaires assessed at the same timepoints.

Results

Forty-eight women participated (24 per group). Two participants dropped out of each group and one participant was deceased before 3-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken. At 3 months and 1 year, there was a statistically significant difference in the number of leakage episodes on the 7-day bladder diary (3 mo: P = 0.04; 1 y: P = 0.01) in favor of the PT group. The effect size was 0.34 at 1 year. There were no harms reported.

Conclusions

After a 12-week course of PT once per week for UI, PT group participants had a 75% reduction in weekly median number of leakage episodes, whereas the control group's condition had no improvement. At 1 year, the PT group participants maintained this improvement, whereas the control group's incontinence worsened.

### A randomized controlled trial of a senior centre group programme for increasing social support and preventing depression in elderly people living at home in Norway [^cf0aec18]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

During this part of the recruitment process, a number of potential candidates dropped because of a lack of interest. The reasons given for this disinterest were bad health and a heavy burden of care. This was essentially as expected, although the number of dropouts was larger than anticipated and implied that the number of participants in the trial would be lower than planned. To avert a loss of statistical power beyond what had to initially be accepted for practical reasons, we carried out a second recruitment from the 2387 completed questionnaires, in which we expanded the inclusion criterion based on the HSCL-10 scale to the range from 1.20–3.90. This meant that we included candidates who were not depressed at all, although we also included candidates who were more depressed than in the first recruitment. Those who had answered less than seven out of 10 questions on HSCL-10 were excluded. An additional 214 persons were found eligible in this second round, yielding a total of 415 eligible persons. Persons in the second round were contacted and interviewed in their homes in the same way as the first 201 persons.

Figure 2 illustrate the process of going from the eligibility sample (415) to the randomized sample (138) and is explained in the following. The flow diagram (Figure 2) used is according to updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomized trials.

In total, 277 of the 415 eligible persons dropped out, leaving 138 subjects for randomization in the trial, which was performed by stratifying many in the sample by geographical area and gender. Seventy-seven (55%) were allocated to the intervention group and 61 (45%) to the control group. A larger lot was drawn to the intervention group than to the control group because of an expected loss of participants.

The first group (those recruited on the basis of the initial HSCL criterion) started the intervention in January 2007, four weeks after baseline interviews with the outcome measures described below. Follow-up interviews took place in November/December of the same year.

The additional second group started the intervention in April 2007, four weeks after baseline interviews, with the follow-up interviews conducted in April/March 2008.

The control group was free to continue daily activities as they chose, and they were offered the same group activities as the intervention group after one year. They were not subjects of further follow-up studies after the intervention had ended.

### Cluster randomised trial of a complex interprofessional intervention (interprof ACT) to reduce hospital admission of nursing home residents [^e4df155a]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Sample size

Assuming a hospitalisation rate of ∼50% per year, an absolute reduction from 50 to 35% was considered a relevant intervention effect. A total sample size of 340 NHRs yields a power of 80% at a two-sided significance level of 5%. Expecting 20% dropouts resulted in a total sample size of 425. Assuming an average cluster size of 20 NHRs per NH and an intra-cluster correlation (ICC) of 0.021 results in a design effect of 1.4, requiring a total sample size of 600 NHRs (30 clusters, 15 clusters per group). Non-recruiting clusters were replaced. Anticipating that four clusters would probably drop out, we randomised a total of 34 clusters. Since there was some uncertainty regarding the hospitalisation rates in NHs (reported rates vary between 31 and 63%), ICC and dropouts, a blinded sample size review was conducted half way through the recruitment.

Statistical methods

All analyses were conducted using SAS v9.4 based on the intention-to-treat population. The primary outcome was analysed using a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) with logit function and fixed effects for intervention and important prognostic factors and random effects for clusters. Random effects were included to account for possible ICCs. Fixed (predefined) prognostic factors were study group (intervention vs. control), sex, age at baseline, nursing level and nursing facility size. The secondary outcomes (total number of hospitalisations, total number of days in hospital) were evaluated with negative binomial regression, which implicitly included gamma random effects accounting for heterogeneity between residents (over dispersion). To analyse mortality and adverse events, the same model was chosen as for the primary outcome. Quality of life was evaluated using a hierarchical model with random effects for the clusters. Use of other medical services and the DSS were analysed descriptively. As an alternative to the mixed models to account for the correlation induced by clusters, the models were fitted using generalised estimating equations (GEEs) as a sensitivity analysis.

### Impact of medication therapy management (MTM) service model on multi-morbidity (MMD) patients with hypertension: a pilot RCT [^665bc58c]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Objectives

This study aimed to explore the impact of a 12-month pharmacist-based MTM service mode on MMD patients with hypertension.

Participants

One hundred twenty patients with hypertension who were hospitalized in Taizhou People's Hospital, Taizhou, China, from September to December 2019, were selected as participants. This study was a randomized controlled trial, which was divided into intervention group and control group using a computer-generated random sequence. Further, the participants were subjected to detailed interviews and rigorous evaluations.

The patients' systolic blood pressure was taken as the observation index. If the intervention group reduced their systolic blood pressure by 5.86 mmHg more than the control group did, then the drug was considered to have application value. According to a literature review and preliminary experimental results, the standard deviation of systolic blood pressure reduction in the control group andintervention group was 10.70 mmHg and 8.11 mmHg, respectively. Moreover, according to the 1:1 parallel control design, the unilateral test was set as unilateral α = 0.025, and the degree of assurance was 80%. Using PASS 15 software, the sample size of the control group and the intervention group was calculated to be 43 cases, and a total of at least 86 cases were included in this study. Considering the possible shedding rate and the period of our study, 60 cases in each group was determined as the sample to be included in this study. At the end of the study, 9 participants in the intervention group and 10 in the control group were lost to follow-up. Participants who were lost to follow-up were eliminated from the study. Finally, 51 participants in the intervention group and 50 in the control group completed the follow-up for 12 months, with complete data collected for analysis. The overall drop-out rate was 15.8%. Drop-out rates were 16.7% and 15.0% among control and intervention group participants, respectively. No statistical association was observed between group assignment and study drop-outs, as shown in the additional file 1.

### The presence of cutibacterium acnes on the skin of the shoulder after the use of benzoyl peroxide: a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized trial [^d8d4308c]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypothesis and Background

We hypothesized that benzoyl peroxide (BPO) would reduce the presence of Cutibacterium acnes on the skin of the shoulder by 50% compared with placebo. Infections after shoulder surgery are most commonly caused by C acnes. Current prophylactic methods do not effectively reduce the bacterial load of this bacterium. However, it seems that BPO may reduce C acnes on the skin of the shoulder. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of BPO on the presence of C acnes on the shoulder skin.

Methods

A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed including healthy participants aged between 40 and 80 years. Thirty participants with C acnes on the shoulder skin according to baseline skin swabs were randomized into the BPO or placebo group. After gel application 5 times, skin swabs were taken to determine the presence of C acnes.

Results

Forty-two participants were screened for the presence of C acnes to include 30 participants with the bacterium. Participants with C acnes at baseline were 7.4 years younger than participants without C acnes (P = 0.015). One participant in the placebo group dropped out before application because of fear of adverse events. After application, C acnes remained present in 3 of 15 participants (20.0%) in the BPO group and in 10 of 14 participants (71.4%) in the placebo group, resulting in a 51.4% reduction in the presence of C acnes.

Conclusion

Applying BPO 5 times on the shoulder skin effectively reduces C acnes. Consequently, BPO may reduce the risk of postoperative infections.

### Evaluation of a socio-cultural intervention to reduce unprotected sex for HIV among African American / black women [^6eaab528]. AIDS and Behavior (2015). Low credibility.

African American/Black (Black) women suffer disproportionately to other women from HIV. An HIV prevention intervention combining two previous evidenced-based intervention programs; "Coping with Work and Family Stress" and "Hip Hop 2 Prevent Substance Abuse and HIV", was evaluated in a diverse sample of Black women (n = 205). Study participants at ten recruitment sites were assigned non-randomly to either the intervention or comparison group and then surveyed at baseline, immediate posttest, and 6-month follow-up. General Estimating Equation modeling revealed that participants in the comparison group reported less unprotected sex at immediate post-test and the intervention group less unprotected sex at 6-month follow-up. Despite the initial drop in reported unprotected sex in the comparison group, this study suggests that an HIV risk reduction intervention tailored to address Black women's socio-cultural stress and enhance their coping may reduce their unprotected sex at 6-months.

### Open-label placebo treatment in chronic low back pain: a randomized controlled trial [^d810d5d7]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

3. Results

We enrolled participants from November 2013 and December 2015. Figure 1 shows details. A total of 239 people completed telephone and/or e-mail screening, 118 of whom were not eligible or refused to participate, leaving 121 people who attended the enrolment visit. During this visit, 24 people were deemed ineligible or refused to participate. We randomized the remaining 97 participants to OLP or TAU. Seven participants in each group (OLP/TAU) were later found to be ineligible (opioid use 4/3, inability to take medications orally 2/1, changed medications 1/2, pain related to trauma 0/1) and were excluded from the analysis, leaving a sample of 83 participants. Three participants in the OLP group and 4 in the TAU group discontinued at midpoint. We replaced missing data from dropouts using the last observation carried forward method. At baseline, the 2 groups were well balanced with regard to demographics, medication, usual pain, maximum pain, disability, and bothersomeness of the pain (Table 1). Despite proper randomization, the TAU group reported lower baseline minimum pain scores than the OLP group (difference on the 10-point scale 1.25, 95% confidence interval: 0.41–2.10). There were no other significant differences between the 2 groups at baseline. Our data analysis plan included the use of analysis of covariance, which adjusts for baseline differences between individuals and thus provides a statistical control for group differences when randomization does not succeed in producing completely balanced groups on baseline measures.

### One drop improves productivity for workers with type 2 diabetes: one drop for workers with type 2 diabetes [^7def7ed6]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations and Future Directions

Although this study employed an experimental design using validated instruments to measure productivity outcomes (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment scale), as is the case with all studies, there are limitations to acknowledge. The information gathered from study participants was self-reported, which may reduce the validity because intentions of questions could not be clarified when needed and inconsistent responses were not probed for a more accurate representation of the participant's intention. In addition, the self-reported nature of data collection opens the possibility of recall bias in the responses; however, the survey asked participants to reflect on the past week, which is a short-enough time frame to mitigate this bias. Furthermore, the survey did not collect information regarding the variety of job types and industries the participants work in. This prevents a more nuanced contextualization to our results and understanding of how these results might differ by industry.

This study was the first to use an RCT design to experimentally evaluate productivity changes in adults with diabetes from using a digital solution. Furthermore, this study design is the criterion standard for limiting bias and confounding. It is an important first step in studying an mHealth app's impact on variables outside of clinical health outcomes with respect to diabetes, specifically, studying implications for an individual's work productivity. Future research should explore and replicate these findings in a real-world setting to increase the generalizability of the mHealth-productivity effects and with larger study populations.

Health-related productivity declines at work, such as absenteeism and presenteeism, affect both the individual and the organization carrying the burden of lost productivity. Absenteeism and presenteeism are low base rate phenomena and must therefore be studied specifically among those who experience it. Furthermore, productivity research is needed to examine the effect of mHealth programs on productivity in relation to other illnesses beyond diabetes. The potential for mHealth programs to impact not only the health outcomes of the individual but also other aspects of their life also needs to be further elucidated; the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, has wide-ranging effects not fully understood. Recent research shows that the pandemic has impacted health-related productivity of workers across nearly every industry. Probst and colleaguesexplored the impact of the workplace environment on employee attitudes and subsequent presenteeism. In conjunction with the present study, this highlights an avenue for future research to explore how mHealth apps could benefit workplace and health outcomes with consideration for chronic health conditions.

### Does practice make perfect? Prospectively comparing effects of 2 amounts of practice on tourniquet use performance [^b2064d4d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although a lifesaving skill, currently, there is no consensus for the required amount of practice in tourniquet use. We compared the effect of 2 amounts of practice on performance of tourniquet use by nonmedical personnel.

Methods

Israeli military recruits without previous medical training underwent their standard tactical first aid course, and their initial performance in use of the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT; Composite Resources, Rock Hill, SC) was assessed. The educational intervention was to allocate the participants into a monthly tourniquet practice program: either a single-application practice (SAP) group or a triple-application practice (TAP) group. Each group practiced according to its program. After 3 months, the participants' tourniquet use performance was reassessed. Assessments were conducted using the HapMed Leg Tourniquet Trainer (CHI Systems, Fort Washington, PA), a mannequin which measures time and pressure.

Results

A total of 151 participants dropped out, leaving 87 in the TAP group and 69 in the SAP group. On initial assessment, the TAP group and the SAP group performed similarly. Both groups improved their performance from the initial to the final assessment. The TAP group improved more than the SAP group in mean application time (faster by 18 vs 8 seconds, respectively; P = 0.023) and in reducing the proportion of participants who were unable to apply any pressure to the mannequin (less by 18% vs 8%, respectively; P = 0.009).

Conclusion

Three applications per monthly practice session were superior to one. This is the first prospective validation of a tourniquet practice program based on objective measurements.

### A randomized controlled trial of a senior centre group programme for increasing social support and preventing depression in elderly people living at home in Norway [^a8a50fa6]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Of those allocated for intervention, 36 persons changed their minds about participating. They all cited too much stress or illness in their lives to carry through with the programme and completely withdrew from the study. Of those constituting the dropouts, one person died and some had great memory problems, which meant that they were not available for further interviews. In addition, four persons were lost to follow-up because of bad health and removal, which meant that a total of 40 persons dropped out (Figure 2).

Seven persons came to the group sessions 14 times or less and discontinued their participation, although group did not differ significantly from the others with respect to baseline characteristics.

Of those allocated for intervention, 37 (48%) took part in the follow-up, with the corresponding number of controls at 55 (90%). The total number of participants who completed the study was 92, which was much lower than what was initially hoped for (which was 80 for each group).

Ideally, analyses of interventions should be conducted on the basis of intention-to-treat. However, no data collection could be carried out with the 40 participants who were lost after the allocation and during follow up, due to their health status and withdrawal from the study. Their reasons for withdrawal were not questioned, and it would have been unethical to pressure them. The seven persons who did come to the group sessions 14 times or less (discontinued participation) were all followed up and interviewed at 12 months, and were included in the main analysis.

Characteristics of the study sample in the intervention and control groups at baseline are shown in Table 1:

### The paradoxical effect of repeated body checking on subjective uncertainty [^30c1e539]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Body checking is considered a behavioral expression of the core psychopathology of eating disorders (EDs), namely, overvaluation of body weight and shape. Compulsive checking is motivated by a desire to increase a sense of certainty regarding feared outcomes. Paradoxically, studies showed that repeated checking acts to reduce certainty, forming a vicious cycle. No previous study examined whether the same principle applies for body checking. This study filled this gap by examining the causal effect of repeated body checking on memory certainty regarding checked body parts.

Method

In a laboratory-based study, 77 female participants without an ED checked the size and shape of six body parts. Their objective memory regarding which body part was last checked, and subjective certainty about this memory were assessed. Then, one group of participants continued to engage in repeated body checking, and another group repeatedly checked a neutral object. Finally, all participants completed the six body parts checking procedure again, and their objective memory and memory certainty were re-assessed.

Results

In both checking groups, objective memory regarding the last body part checked was unaffected by the type of checking performed. Importantly, certainty about memory dropped considerably only among those in the repeated body-checking group.

Discussion

The findings provide the first empirical evidence of a paradoxical effect demonstrating that repeated body checking reduces certainty about checked body parts. The study implies that repeated body checking reduces the quality of information obtained through checking and, as such, could potentially motivate further checking.

### Co-designed films to reduce care burden in India: the moving pictures pilot trial [^525ec8ba]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.6 Sample size and missing data

Based on a similar study, our a priori sample size calculation indicated that 36 (18 per group) participants were required to detect a moderate effect size of 0.4 for the ZBI primary outcome at a 5% significance level (two‐tailed) with 80% power. Attrition – a significant risk in digital trials– was assumed at 60% based on the findings from Baruah et al.'sdigital dementia care trial in India. Thus, 90 participants were originally required. However, lower‐than‐expected attrition meant recruitment concluded at 50 participants in the trial's seventh month. To reduce missing data, the free Google Forms platformwas used to collect data. The platform had an auto‐save feature to minimize data loss due to fluctuating internet or technical glitches and mandated participants complete all required fields before proceeding to subsequent sections.

2.7 Statistical analysis

We reported outcomes on the primary feasibility outcomes (see above) and described demographic characteristics of the baseline sample using standard summary statistics, including frequency and percentage. The CONSORT flow diagram describes participant recruitment and follow‐up (Figure 1). For the primary outcome analysis, intention‐to‐treat assessments were conducted using mixed‐effects linear regression models. Random effects were incorporated to account for repeated measures from individual carers. Time points (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months) and group (intervention/control) were treated as categorical variables and included as fixed effects in the model. All models were further adjusted for baseline values to account for regression to the mean.

Additionally, the models were adjusted stepwise for language, which was utilized as a factor in the block randomization process, as well as for socioeconomic status (SES), to control for potential confounding variables. The interaction between group and time was examined to assess whether the groups differed at various time points. Group mean estimates, within‐group changes, and between‐group differences (i.e. intervention effects) were derived from marginal means and pairwise comparisons of marginal means. Secondary outcomes were also analyzed using the same approach.

Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata statistical software release 18.0 (Stata, College Station, TX, USA). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM or mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) unless otherwise stated.

### Strategies to improve retention in randomised trials [^1b76d5f6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Loss to follow-up from randomised trials can introduce bias and reduce study power, affecting the generalisability, validity and reliability of results. Many strategies are used to reduce loss to follow-up and improve retention but few have been formally evaluated.

Objectives

To quantify the effect of strategies to improve retention on the proportion of participants retained in randomised trials and to investigate if the effect varied by trial strategy and trial setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, DARE, CINAHL, Campbell Collaboration's Social, Psychological, Educational and Criminological Trials Register, and ERIC. We handsearched conference proceedings and publication reference lists for eligible retention trials. We also surveyed all UK Clinical Trials Units to identify further studies.

Selection Criteria

We included eligible retention trials of randomised or quasi-randomised evaluations of strategies to increase retention that were embedded in 'host' randomised trials from all disease areas and healthcare settings. We excluded studies aiming to increase treatment compliance.

Data Collection and Analysis

We contacted authors to supplement or confirm data that we had extracted. For retention trials, we recorded data on the method of randomisation, type of strategy evaluated, comparator, primary outcome, planned sample size, numbers randomised and numbers retained. We used risk ratios (RR) to evaluate the effectiveness of the addition of strategies to improve retention. We assessed heterogeneity between trials using the Chi(2) and I(2) statistics. For main trials that hosted retention trials, we extracted data on disease area, intervention, population, healthcare setting, sequence generation and allocation concealment.

Main Results

We identified 38 eligible retention trials. Included trials evaluated six broad types of strategies to improve retention. These were incentives, communication strategies, new questionnaire format, participant case management, behavioural and methodological interventions. For 34 of the included trials, retention was response to postal and electronic questionnaires with or without medical test kits. For four trials, retention was the number of participants remaining in the trial. Included trials were conducted across a spectrum of disease areas, countries, healthcare and community settings. Strategies that improved trial retention were addition of monetary incentives compared with no incentive for return of trial-related postal questionnaires (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28, P value < 0.0001), addition of an offer of monetary incentive compared with no offer for return of electronic questionnaires (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.38, P value < 0.00001) and an offer of a GBP20 voucher compared with GBP10 for return of postal questionnaires and biomedical test kits (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.22, P value < 0.005). The evidence that shorter questionnaires are better than longer questionnaires was unclear (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08, P value = 0.07) and the evidence for questionnaires relevant to the disease/condition was also unclear (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14). Although each was based on the results of a single trial, recorded delivery of questionnaires seemed to be more effective than telephone reminders (RR 2.08; 95% CI 1.11 to 3.87, P value = 0.02) and a 'package' of postal communication strategies with reminder letters appeared to be better than standard procedures (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.67, P value < 0.0001). An open trial design also appeared more effective than a blind trial design for return of questionnaires in one fracture prevention trial (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63, P value = 0.0003). There was no good evidence that the addition of a non-monetary incentive, an offer of a non-monetary incentive, 'enhanced' letters, letters delivered by priority post, additional reminders, or questionnaire question order either increased or decreased trial questionnaire response/retention. There was also no evidence that a telephone survey was either more or less effective than a monetary incentive and a questionnaire. As our analyses are based on single trials, the effect on questionnaire response of using offers of charity donations, sending reminders to trial sites and when a questionnaire is sent, may need further evaluation. Case management and behavioural strategies used for trial retention may also warrant further evaluation.

Authors' Conclusions

Most of the retention trials that we identified evaluated questionnaire response. There were few evaluations of ways to improve participants returning to trial sites for trial follow-up. Monetary incentives and offers of monetary incentives increased postal and electronic questionnaire response. Some other strategies evaluated in single trials looked promising but need further evaluation. Application of the findings of this review would depend on trial setting, population, disease area, data collection and follow-up procedures.

### Efficacy of topical vibratory stimulation for reducing pain during trigger point injection to the gastrocnemius: a randomized controlled trial [^366665e7]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of topical vibratory stimulation for reducing pain during trigger point injection (TPI).

Design

Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Setting

Tertiary care university hospital.

Participants

A total of 136 participants were randomly recruited from among patients with myofascial pain syndrome who were scheduled for TPI. Of these, 65 were excluded because they met the exclusion criteria, and 11 because they refused to participate. Finally, 60 participants were enrolled. No participants dropped out of the study.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to the vibration group or control group. TPI was performed with 0.5% lidocaine using a 25-gauge needle. A vibrator was applied to the popliteal fossa for 3 to 5 seconds prior to and during TPI to the gastrocnemius; 100-Hz vibration was turned on for the vibration group and turned off for the control group.

Main Outcome Measures

Pain intensity during TPI was assessed using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) as a primary outcome, and participant satisfaction and preference for repeated use were measured using 5-point Likert scales as a secondary outcome. These parameters were evaluated immediately after TPI. The primary outcome was evaluated using analysis of covariance and secondary outcome using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Results

VAS scores for pain during TPI were significantly lower in the vibration group (30.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] 22.65–39.26) compared with the control group (47.58; 95% CI, 38.80–56.52; F = 7.74; P < .01). The mean difference in VAS scores between the 2 groups was 17.27 (95% CI, 5.24–29.30). Participant satisfaction and preference for repeated use were significantly higher in the vibration group than in the control group (P < .05). No participant showed any side effects.

Conclusion

Topical vibratory stimulation significantly decreased pain during TPI of the gastrocnemius.

### Reporting of stepped wedge cluster randomised trials: extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement with explanation and elaboration [^6d03a7a2]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Item 10b: Inclusion of participants

Standard CONSORT item — Not included in original CONSORT statement.

CONSORT cluster extension — Mechanism by which individual participants were included in clusters for the purposes of the trial (such as complete enumeration, random sampling).

Extension for SW-CRTs — Mechanism by which individual participants were included in clusters for the purposes of the trial (such as complete enumeration or random sampling; continuous recruitment or ascertainment; or recruitment at a fixed point in time), including who recruited or identified participants.

Example 1 (Complete enumeration with continuous ascertainment) — "The study included all patients admitted to 16 acute adult wards of one general hospital over a 32-week period".

Example 2 (Random sampling) — "Data collection for the evaluation study will focus on adults aged 18 years and over. The study will use a repeated cross-sectional design, in which a random sample of people within each cluster will be surveyed at each stage. A complete list of all households in each of the 128 study villages will be obtained using the Postcode… The order in which households are approached to participate in the survey at each stage will be randomly generated… One adult per household will be randomly selected".

Example 3 (Continuous recruitment) — "Then, the leaders of the nursing homes are responsible for the recruitment of the units and the residents according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. Here, all eligible participants of the participating units are invited to participate. Before the recruitment procedure will commence, each leader of the nursing homes will attend a kick-off meeting held by a senior investigator about the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the planned recruitment strategy. For the participants who drop out of the trial, we are planning to monitor the reasons (eg, death or moving) and perform a sensitivity analysis at the end of the trial to determine whether they differ according to certain characteristics (eg, the prevalence of the challenging behavior or gender). Residents who are newly admitted to clusters during follow up will also be included in the study… "

### Exercise training during pregnancy reduces circulating insulin levels in overweight / obese women postpartum: secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial (the ETIP trial) [^fc1dace4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Study strength and limitations

The ETIP trial had a randomised, controlled study design. The exercise program was described in detail and should be easy to reproduce. Previous research has found supervised exercise to be important for adherence to the exercise protocol, for motivation, and for the safety of the participant, and to be more effective than general guidance. We measured weight objectively at study entry and at postpartum, and we only included sedentary overweight/obese women in the trial. We measured skinfold thickness and body composition in addition to weight, and provided information on potential confounding factors such as lactation and GWG. Our intervention included the exercise program only, and no diet. Thus, we could assess the effect of exercise alone in contrast to previous trials with mixed interventions.

The main limitation was a small study sample. We did not recruit as many participants as originally planned and experienced additional drop-outs during the intervention period. This affected the power of the study and decreased the possibility of detecting true effects of the intervention. The proportion of drop-outs was, however, equally distributed between groups, and we had only two drop-outs in each group after delivery. In addition, only 50% of women in the exercise program adhered to the protocol. We report exercise intensity only by the rate of perceived exertion in this trial, due to the lack of a precise estimate of maximum heart rate for each participant. Since pregnancy can influence the heart rate during exercise, we chose not to include data on heart rate during exercise. We prolonged the time limit for inclusion in the trial from gestational week 16 to 18, which reduced the mean number of weeks of exercise before delivery, and thus the effect of the intervention. Our change in inclusion criteria BMI from ≥ 30 to ≥ 28 kg/m², may have reduced the homogeneity of the trial population, but only five women in the postpartum analysis had a pre-pregnancy BMI below 30 kg/m².

The current trial did not provide any information on diet and possible changes in eating habits in the groups. The control group underwent comprehensive health assessments during pregnancy and after delivery and this may have motivated also the women in the control group to undertake lifestyle changes.

Generalisability

The participants were recruited from Google advertisement and through an information letter to all pregnant women in Trondheim. There is a risk for over-representation of highly motivated women in the trial. This may influence the external validity (generalizability) of the trial, but not the internal validity (comparisons between groups).

### Exercise interveNtion outdoor proJect in the cOmmunitY-results from the ENJOY program for independence in dementia: a feasibility pilot randomised controlled trial [^a5a036bf]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical methods

Sample size estimation and justification

As this was a feasibility study, we aimed to recruit 12 participants for each group. This was based on the available number of residents at Leith Park residential aged-care facility, with an estimation that approximately 37–40 residents living with dementia were at the facility at the time of study design. A targeted total number of 24 participants (20 participants completing the study allowing for ~ 15% drop out rate) seemed feasible to allow completion of the trial over the 24-week period. Our previous trial had 11% drop out from the exercise intervention group. The targeted number would also be sufficient to provide preliminary results about the feasibility and safety of the exercise. The sample size was not powered to detect significant changes in the secondary measures. Non parametric test was used to compare the differences in the proportion of fallers (falls not related to the exercise program) between the groups at baseline and at the 24-weeks follow up.

Statistical analysis

The data for the feasibility and safety components of the study were analysed as follows (mean, standard deviation and proportion): proportion of participants approached to participate and commenced the program, percentage of participants who completed the intervention, overall percentage of sessions attended, number of participants who dropped out, number of falls that occurred during the exercise sessions, frequency of muscle/joint pain during or after the exercise sessions, and number of serious adverse events requiring medical attention. Modifications made to the exercise program were also recorded.

To determine trends of effectiveness, repeated measures ANOVA with factors of intervention (Seniors Exercise Park program, control) and time (pre-post intervention and follow-up) were used for the secondary outcomes (cognitive, physical function, quality of life and social measures) to assess the changes within and between groups over time (pre/post). Effect size, Partial Eta Squared, from SPSS for the group by time interaction was used and reported to determine effect size as follows:values greater than 0.14 were considered a large and significant effect size whereas 0.01 and 0.06 were considered small and medium effect size, respectively.

### Effect of meeting centres support program on feelings of competence of family carers and delay of institutionalization of people with dementia [^1a4f8ba8]. Aging & Mental Health (2004). Low credibility.

The study tested the hypotheses that integrated support, in which patients and carers are both supported by one professional staff member, will be more effective in reducing the feelings of (over)burden of carers and in positively influencing some potential determinants of experienced burden than non-integrated support, such as psychogeriatric day-care. A quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test control group design was applied with matched groups and measurements at baseline and after seven months. Fifty-five of the eighty dyads (31% dropped out) of persons with mild-to-moderate dementia and their carers who presented for four community meeting centres and three day-care centres in nursing homes over an 18 month period, were included in the study. The carers in the Meeting Centres Support (MCS) Program participated in an integrated family support program together with the persons with dementia, while the carers in the control group only received respite through psychogeriatric day-care. Standardized questionnaires were applied to measure some indicators of burden experienced by the carers (feelings of stress, life dissatisfaction, psychological and psychosomatic complaints), as well as some potential determinants of experienced burden (feeling of competence, coping strategies, experienced support and loneliness). Furthermore, as an indicator of feelings of (over)burden of the carer, the time between start of participation in one of the programs and institutionalization in a nursing home was calculated. After seven months the carers in the MCS group (n = 36), compared to the carers in regular psychogeriatric day-care (n = 19), showed a moderate positive effect on the feeling of competence (effect size 0.45). No effect was found on feelings of stress, dissatisfaction or psychological and psychosomatic complaints. However, as compared to the control group in regular day-care, the persons with dementia in the MCS Program participated for a longer period of time before they were placed in a nursing home. The MCS Program proved more effective than psychogeriatric day-care in influencing the feeling of competence of the carers, and seems to lead to an increased delay of nursing home placement of the person with dementia, as compared to regular day-care. Because of the small sample and limited power of the study, and the possible influence of the selection of carers on the study outcome, further research into the value of meeting centres for carers of people with dementia is recommended.

### Effect of a coaching intervention to enhance physical activity and prevent falls in community-dwelling people aged 60 + years: a cluster randomised controlled trial [^df7370d1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Sample size

Based on our sample size calculation to detect between-group differences for our co-primary outcomes,30 clusters per arm (a total of 60 clusters) and an average of 10 participants per cluster (n = 600) were required for physical activity (between-group difference = 10%, two-sided α = 0.05, power = 0.90, mean = 23 counts/min, SD = 120, dropout rate = 20%, intracluster correlation (ICC) = 0.01)(27) and falls (lower rate of falls in intervention group = 30% (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.67), two-sided α = 0.05, power = 0.80, months to account for loss to follow-up = 11). We assumed overdispersion in the negative binomial regression model to be 0.65 based on a previous trial, a control group rate of falls of 0.06/person/month over the follow-up period, as this was the rate in a study of a similar population, a design effect of 1.09 with an ICC of 0.01and withdrawal of six clusters. This sample size was also sufficient to detect between-group differences in the order of 10–15% for the secondary outcome measures.

Data analysis

We followed a predefined statistical plan. We assessed intervention effects by means of generalised estimating equations (GEE) models using an exchangeable correlation structure to account for correlation between individuals within the clusters and estimated SE using cluster robust. The number of falls/person-year was analysed using negative binomial regression models to estimate the difference in rates between the groups after 1 year (primary outcome). For the continuously scored primary (device-measured physical activity) and secondary outcome measures, Gaussian GEE regression adjusted for baseline values was used to assess the effect of group allocation. Log-binomial GEE regression was used to compare groups on dichotomous outcome measures (proportion of fallers, proportion meeting physical activity cut-off points). We used an intention-to-treat approach.

Planned subgroup analysis

Planned subgroup analyses assessed differential effects of the intervention by baseline physical activity levels and history of falls. We dichotomised the physical activity levels into two categories: low physical activity (< 7000 daily steps) and high physical activity (≥ 7000 daily steps). We also categorised the history of falls into no falls, one fall, and two or more falls in the past year.

### Effects of aerobic dance on systolic blood pressure in stage one hypertensive adults in Uganda [^0ed31179]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Discussions

The study investigated whether an aerobic dance programme reduced the SBP of stage one hypertensive adults. The study found that after a 12-week aerobic dance programme, the experimental group's SBP significantly dropped. The outcomes also demonstrated that the control group's SBP barely changed after the 12 weeks, remaining rather constant. The SBP of the male and female experimental group participants revealed significant changes in this study. However, the female group's SBP dropped more than the male group's. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that after a 12-week aerobic dance programme, the male control group participants' SBP slightly rose compared with the female participants' SBP.

According to the study's findings, after a 12-week aerobic dance programme, the experimental group's subjects' SBP considerably decreased. Similar to the current study's findings, other research (Maruf et al and Kazeminia et al) also found that aerobic exercise interventions significantly lowered the experimental group's SBP. Researchers Gunjal et al examined how aerobic interval training affected hypertensive patients' BP. After a 12-week intervention, their findings indicated a significant drop in SBP. Similarly, Daimo et al looked into how males with hypertension's BP were affected by aerobic exercise. They discovered that aerobic exercise significantly lowered SBP. The present study's outcomes align with those of Navan, who examined the impact of aerobic exercise on cardiovascular risk-taking factors in 20 hypertensive males over 8 weeks, with three sessions per week lasting 45 min each. His results showed that the intervention group's SBP had significantly decreased.

### Augmented feedback supports skill transfer and reduces high-risk injury landing mechanics: a double-blind, randomized controlled laboratory study [^d87cbfd0]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is a current need to produce a simple, yet effective method for screening and targeting possible deficiencies related to increased anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk.

Hypothesis

Frontal plane knee angle (FPKA) during a drop vertical jump will decrease upon implementing augmented feedback into a standardized sport training program.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

Thirty-seven female participants (mean ± SD: age, 14.7 ± 1.5 years; height, 160.9 ± 6.8 cm; weight, 54.5 ± 7.2 kg) were trained over 8 weeks. During each session, each participant received standardized training consisting of strength training, plyometrics, and conditioning. They were also videotaped running on a treadmill at a standardized speed and performing a repeated tuck jump for 10 seconds. Study participants were randomized into 2 groups and received augmented feedback on either their jumping (AF) or sprinting (CTRL) form. Average (mean of 3 trials) and most extreme (trial with greatest knee abduction) FPKA were calculated from 2-dimensional video captured during performance of the drop vertical jump.

Results

After testing, a main effect of time was noted, with the AF group reducing their FPKA average by 37.9% over the 3 trials while the CTRL group demonstrated a 26.7% reduction average across the 3 trials (P < .05). Conversely, in the most extreme drop vertical jump trial, a significant time-by-group interaction was noted (P < .05). The AF group reduced their most extreme FPKA by 6.9° (pretest, 18.4° ± 12.3°; posttest, 11.4° ± 10.1°) on their right leg and 6.5° (pretest, 16.3° ± 14.5°; posttest, 9.8° ± 10.7°) on their left leg, which represented a 37.7% and 40.1% reduction in FPKA, respectively. In the CTRL group, no similar changes were noted in the right (pretest, 16.9° ± 14.3°; posttest, 14.0° ± 12.3°) or left leg (pretest, 9.8° ± 11.1°; posttest, 7.2° ± 9.2°) after training.

Conclusion

Providing athletes with augmented feedback on deficits identified by the tuck jump assessment has a positive effect on their biomechanics during a different drop vertical jump task that is related to increased ACL injury risk. The ability of the augmented feedback to support the transfer of skills and injury risk factor reductions across different tasks provides exciting new evidence related to how neuromuscular training may ultimately cross over into retained biomechanics that reduce ACL injuries during sport.

Clinical Relevance

The tuck jump assessment's ease of use makes it a timely and economically favorable method to support ACL prevention strategies in young girls.

### Oral sodium bicarbonate in people on haemodialysis: a randomised controlled trial [^0efcd179]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Adverse events and mortality tend to cluster around dialysis sessions, potentially due to the impact of the saw-toothed profile of uraemic toxins such as potassium, peaking pre-dialysis and rapidly dropping during dialysis. Acidosis could be contributing to this harm by exacerbating a rise in potassium. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of oral bicarbonate treatment on reducing inter-dialytic potassium gain as well as other clinical consequences of preserving muscle mass and function and reducing intradialytic arrhythmia risk in people on haemodialysis.

Methods

Open-label randomised controlled trial in a single-centre (London, UK). Forty-three clinically stable adults on haemodialysis were recruited, with a 6month average pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate level < 22mmol/l and potassium > 4mmol/l. Thirty-three participants completed the study. Oral sodium bicarbonate tablets titrated up to a maximum of 3g bd (6g total) in intervention group for 12weeks versus no treatment in the control group. Outcomes compared intervention versus non-intervention phases in the treated group and equivalent time points in the control group: pre- and post-dialysis serum potassium; nutritional assessments: muscle mass and handgrip strength and electrocardiograms (ECGs) pre and post dialysis.

Results

Participants took an average of 3.7 ± 0.5g sodium bicarbonate a day. In the intervention group, inter-dialytic potassium gain was reduced from 1.90 ± 0.60 to 1.69 ± 0.49mmol/l (p = 0.032) and pre-dialysis potassium was reduced from 4.96 ± 0.62 to 4.79 ± 0.49mmol/l without dietary change. Pre-dialysis bicarbonate increased from 18.15 ± 1.35 to 20.27 ± 1.88mmol/l, however with an increase in blood pressure. Nutritionally, lean tissue mass was reduced in the controls suggesting less catabolism in the intervention group. There was no change in ECGs. Limitations are small sample size and unblinded study design lacking a placebo, with several participants failing to achieve the target of 22mmol/l serum bicarbonate levels due mainly to tablet burden.

Conclusion

Oral sodium bicarbonate reduced bicarbonate loss and potassium gain in the inter-dialytic period, and may also preserve lean tissue mass.

Trial Registration

The study was registered prospectively on 06/08/2015 with EU Clinical Trials Register EudraCT number 2015-001439-20.

### Fly control to prevent diarrhoea in children [^4ab24f6d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)

We assessed the methods used, if any, for each included study to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We assessed the methods as at low, high, or unclear risk of bias for participants; and low, high, or unclear risk of bias for personnel.

Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)

We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcome. We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as at low, high, or unclear risk of bias.

Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature, and handling of incomplete outcome data)

We described the completeness of data for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the study authors, we would have re‐included missing data if we had undertaken any analyses. We assessed methods as at low risk of bias (for example, no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups); high risk of bias (for example, numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; 'as treated' analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation); or unclear risk of bias.

### Reducing utilization by uninsured frequent users of the emergency department: combining case management and drop-in group medical appointments [^4e8ddae0]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with complex behavioral health and medical problems can have a disproportionate impact on emergency departments.

Methods

We identified a cohort of 255 low-income, uninsured patients who had used inpatient or emergency department services more than 6 times in the previous 12 months. Between July 2010 and June 2011 we enrolled 36 of these high-risk patients to participate in a twice-weekly drop-in group medical appointment staffed by an interdisciplinary team of a family physician, behavioral health professional, and nurse case manager. The team provided 705 patient visits in a group setting (a total of 108 group sessions) and 652 case manager phone calls. The average number of clients per drop-in group medical appointment was 6.5.

Results

Emergency department use dropped from a rate of 0.58 per patient per month to 0.23 (P < .001), and hospital charges dropped from $1167 per patient per month to $230 (P < .001). Employment status increased from 4 to 14 among the 36 patients enrolled. Total annualized cost of the program was $66,000.

Conclusions

Team-based drop-in group medical appointments coupled with case management seem to be a cost-effective model to reduce emergency department visits by some patients with complex behavioral health and medical needs.

### Weight change among people randomized to minimal intervention control groups in weight loss trials [^3168f428]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Our analysis has several strengths and limitations. The studies we reviewed all suffered loss to follow‐up and presented their results using a variety of methods of imputation or using complete cases only. By standardizing the way statistics were presented, we removed spurious variation due to this. There are two main assumptions that underlie methods to deal with missing data, which are that data are missing at random or they are missing non‐randomly, most probably because people with a "bad" outcome are less willing to attend for follow‐up. Analyzing only those with follow‐up data or multiple imputation assumes data are missing at random. It would have been possible to use either approach here although, for multiple imputation, this would have had to be done at the study level. Multiple imputation at the study level is unlikely to have changed the results because the characteristics of participants in the studies were largely similar 14. Normally, multiple imputation is done at the individual level but this requires access to the full data from the trial. It is conceivable that multiple imputation at the individual level could be more conservative than BOCF, but a study that used several methods of imputing for missing weight data in trials of interventions for weight loss found no great differences between complete case data only and multiple imputation for missing data 47. In this review, we imputed missing data assuming they were not missing at random using BOCF. In the context of a review, this can only move the weight change towards the null, whether it showed mean weight increase or mean weight decrease. Mean weight loss at 12 months was observed in the control group in 90% of studies.

### Screening and brief intervention for obesity in primary care: a parallel, two-arm, randomised trial [^31d7e4cf]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Results

Between June 4, 2013, and Dec 23, 2014, we screened 8403 patients. Of these individuals, 2728 (32%) had a BMI defined as obese with raised body fat percentage and were offered enrolment: 2256 (83%) individuals agreed to participate, of whom 1882 (83%) of these were eligible and enrolled. Researchers excluded 259 (11%) individuals, the main reason being that the patient was already taking action on weight, and physicians excluded 122 (5%) individuals, but mostly did not record the reason. 940 participants were assigned to the support (active) intervention and 942 to the advice (control) intervention. One individual (< 1%) assigned to the active intervention and three (< 1%) individuals assigned to the control intervention received the intervention that was not assigned because of physician error, but were analysed as allocated (figure). We weighed 1419 (75%) of participants at the 12 month follow-up.

Overall, the mean age of participants was 56·0 years (SD 16·1), 1076 (57·2%) of 1882 were women, and 96 (5%) individuals were from minority ethnic groups. Mean weight was 104·6 kg (SD 15·7) for men and 92·5 kg (15·3) for women, with a mean BMI of 34·9 kg/m² (4·8). Characteristics were balanced between treatment groups (table 1). We found no large differences between the characteristics of people who declined participation or were ineligible and those included, except that women were slightly less likely to be willing to participate (282 [17%] women vs 168 [16%] men were unwilling to participate).

Weight loss at 12 months, the primary outcome, was 2·43 kg (SD 6·49) for the support group and 1·04 kg (5·50) for the advice group, giving a difference of 1·43 kg (95% CI 0·89–1·97, p < 0·0001). Mean self-reported weight loss at 3 months was 2·91 kg (5·16) for support and 1·18 kg (3·81) for advice, giving a difference of 1·76 kg (1·35–2·17, p < 0·0001).

### Efficacy of a web-based intervention with and without guidance for employees with risky drinking: results of a three-arm randomized controlled trial [^d54ec10b]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Participants

A total of 434 participants (178 males/256 females) were randomly allocated to the three study arms (Fig. 1). This was lower than the initially intended sample size 33. Recruitment in this trial was difficult compared to earlier studies on web‐based health interventions conducted by our research group, since this phase took substantially longer than expected. Due to a limited funding period, we had to stop recruitment after 17 months. In the guided intervention group, two participants withdrew from study participation and called for deletion of their datasets, which was a necessary option requested from the ethics committee. Thus, the final study sample consisted of 432 participants with an average age of 47 (Table 1). The majority of participants were employed full time, with an average working experience of 23 years.

Missing data

Data on sociodemographic and outcome variables were available for the entire sample at T1. In total, 339 participants (78.4%) attended the post‐assessment (T2), while 270 (62.5%) came to the six‐month follow‐up (T3) (Fig. 1). The three groups differed with regard to missing data on primary and secondary outcomes at T2 (P = 0.032), but not at T3 (P = 0.092). Missing of outcome data appeared only in terms of wave non‐response and Little's overall test of randomness indicated that missing occurred completely at random (P = 0.817); as such, multiple imputations of the missing data could be conducted 48.

### Examining the effectiveness of a video-based parent-child program on executive functions for children 5 to 6 years old: a randomized controlled trial [^4e26d632]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Participants were selected for inclusion in final analyses based on a range of attendance and intervention fidelity factors. Within the intervention group, a total of 21 (21.00%) families were excluded from the analysis due to low attendance of the intervention (i.e. attended nine or fewer sessions from the 12 scheduled sessions; n = 4), poor observer‐report fidelity to intervention implementation (i.e. passed nine or fewer sessions; n = 7, see further fidelity measures information below), both low attendance during the intervention and poor observer‐report intervention fidelity (n = 6), and families withdrawing from the study (n = 4), resulting in a post‐test sample size of 79. Among the 79 children in the intervention group, 74 participated with their mothers, while five children participated with their fathers. Each child had a consistent parent throughout the intervention. In the control group, 15 (13.76%) families withdrew from the study, leaving a post‐test sample size of 94. The participant flowchart is depicted in Figure 1.

FIGURE 1
Participant flowchart.

Attrition analyses were performed to examine potential bias between those who included (n = 173) and excluded (n = 36) from the final analyses. No significant differences were found between the two groups in most demographic variables, that is, child age, child gender, and family status (p s > .05), except for the monthly household income (χ²(5, n = 181) = 11.979, p = .024; see Table 2). Also, at baseline (pre‐test), there were no significant differences in the scores of the individual EF tasks between the included and excluded groups (p s > .05).

TABLE 2
Baseline demographic characteristics.

The final analytic sample comprised 173 (83%) children (n i = 79, n c = 94; 52.9% girls; M age = 68.86 months, SD = 6.39). A priori power analysis for the repeated measures ANOVA within‐between interaction indicated that a minimum sample size of 60 was necessary to achieve a power of 90% (β = .90; α = .05) with a small to medium effect size (Cohen's d = .35; Carr et al; Faul et al; Koydemir et al.). Therefore, our sample size was deemed sufficient.

### Effectiveness of letters to patients with or without cochrane blogshots on 10-year cardiovascular risk change among women in menopausal transition: 6-month three-arm randomized controlled trial [^61fd39c7]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sample size

As there were no previous studies on this topic, we hypothesized that in the intervention group at the end of the trial, the mean CVD risk would be 6.0 and 8.0 in the control group, with a standard deviation of 3. With a study strength of 0.8 and alpha level of 0.01 (to take multiple comparisons into account), we used an online sample size calculator, to estimate that we would need at least 53 participants per group (159 in total). To compensate for potential dropouts, we aimed to recruit 70 participants per trial arm.

Randomization and blinding

Trial groups were formed by a random assignment, so that each respondent had one probability of falling into one of the three research groups (1:1:1) and each group of participants was exposed to only one of the study interventions. The generation of the random sequence was performed by a statistician who was not involved in the conduct of the trial, using. Only the main investigator was aware of the allocation of participants into the study groups, and the participants, the family medicine doctors, or the statistician were not aware of the allocation of participants to trial arms. The family medicine doctors made physical exams and took all measurements of each eligible participant. The main investigator prepared all letters, sealed them in opaque envelopes, and sent them to the addresses collected from the medical records of the participants.

### Personalised gait retraining for medial compartment knee osteoarthritis: a randomised controlled trial [^47671e1e]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Retraining individuals with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis to walk with a patient-specific change in their foot angle (ie, toe-in or toe-out angle) can reduce excessive joint loading related to disease progression. This study investigated the clinical, biomechanical, and structural efficacy of personalised foot progression angle modifications compared with sham treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate medial compartment knee osteoarthritis.

Methods

In this single-center, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, we recruited individuals with symptomatic medial compartment knee osteoarthritis at the Human Performance Laboratory and Lucas Center for Imaging at Stanford University, CA, USA, using online and print media. Eligible participants (aged ≥ 18 years) were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer to an intervention or sham group. During six walking retraining visits to a university gait laboratory, all participants received real-time biofeedback instructing them to walk consistently with a personalised target foot progression angle. The intervention group's target was the 5° or 10° change in foot progression angle that maximally reduced their knee loading, and the sham group's target was their natural foot progression angle. Participants and staff involved in data analysis were masked to group allocation; staff performing the gait analysis visits were not. Primary outcomes were 1-year changes in medial knee pain (numeric rating scale) and medial knee loading (knee adduction moment peak). Secondary outcomes were 1-year changes in cartilage microstructure estimated from MRI (T 1ρ and T 2 relaxation times). We evaluated safety by monitoring the number and type of adverse events. Intention-to-treat linear regression analyses, comprising all randomly assigned participants, were conducted. People with lived experience of knee osteoarthritis were involved in the design and conduct of this study. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02767570, and is closed to enrollment.

Findings

Between Aug 1, 2016, and June 25, 2019, 1582 individuals were screened for eligibility. 107 participants completed an initial gait analysis and 68 were randomly assigned to either the intervention (n = 34) or the sham (n = 34) group. 41 (60%) of 68 participants were female, 27 (40%) were male, and 54 (79%) were White; mean age was 64·4 years (SD 7·6). After 1 year, participants in the intervention group had greater reductions in medial knee pain (between-group difference -1·2, 95% CI -1·9 to -0·5; p = 0·0013) and knee adduction moment peak (between-group difference -0·26% bodyweight×height, 95% CI -0·39 to -0·13; p = 0·0001) than participants in the sham group. The MRI-estimated change in cartilage microstructure (T 1ρ) in the medial compartment was less in the intervention group than the sham group (between-group difference -3·74 ms, 95% CI -6·42 to -1·05). There were no significant between-group differences in T 2. There were no severe adverse events; however, two (6%) of 34 participants in the intervention group and one (3%) of 34 participants in the sham group dropped out of the study due to increased knee pain.

Interpretation

Personalised foot angle modifications improve pain, reduce knee loading, and might slow osteoarthritis progression, making them a promising non-surgical treatment option for some individuals with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis.

### Improving the feasibility of glaucoma clinical trials using trend-based visual field progression endpoints [^d0cb9dda]. Ophthalmology: Glaucoma (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There have been concerns that short-term clinical trials for evaluating new treatments in glaucoma would require prohibitively large sample sizes when using visual field endpoints, given that glaucoma is often a slowly progressive disease. This study sought to determine the required sample size for such trials using event-based analyses, and whether it can be reduced using trend-based analyses.

Design

Longitudinal, observational study.

Participants

321 eyes of 240 glaucoma participants followed under routine clinical care using 242 visual field for an average of 10 years.

Methods

Sample size requirements were derived using computer simulations that reconstructed "real-world" visual fields by combining estimates of point-wise variability according to different threshold levels and rates of change obtained from the clinical glaucoma cohort. A clinical trial lasting 2 years with testing every 3 months was simulated, assuming that the new treatment halted visual field change in various percentages of participants (or "responders"). Treatment efficacy was evaluated by: (a) Difference in incidence of point-wise event-based progression (similar to the commercially available Guided Progression Analysis), and (b) Difference in rate of visual field mean deviation (MD) change between groups using linear mixed models (LMMs).

Main Outcome Measures

Sample size to detect a statistically significance difference between groups.

Results

Between-group trend-based analyses using LMMs reduced sample size requirements by 85–90% across the range of new treatment effects when compared to the conventional point-wise event-based analysis. To detect the effect of a new treatment that halted progression in 30% of the participants under routine clinical care (equal to a 30% reduction in average rate of MD change) with 90% power, for example, 1924 participants would be required per group using event-based analysis, but only 277 participants per group if LMMs were used.

Conclusions

The feasibility of future glaucoma clinical trials can be substantially improved by evaluating differences in the rate of visual field change between groups.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the evidence-based use of integrative therapies during and after breast cancer treatment [^456d8ae3]. CA (2017). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer stress management (B grade) for anxiety — Stress management is recommended to reduce anxiety in patients during breast cancer treatment (grade B), and long-term stress-management group programs appear to be better than self-administered home programs. The recommendation is based on 4 RCTs completed between 2008 and 2013 that tested stress-management interventions versus usual care with anxiety improvement as the primary outcome. Study populations included only patients who had breast cancer in 2 of the 4 trials and heterogeneous cancer samples including a breast cancer subset in the other 2 trials. Across the continuum of care, enrollment occurred before surgery, during chemotherapy, and after cancer treatment. Sample sizes ranged from 85 to 286 participants. Of the 4 trials, 2 showed statistically significant improvement versus control, one trial showed similar improvement in both groups with no statistically significant differences, and the fourth trial found no improvement. Evidence also supports effects on mental health outcomes, including anxiety, across 22 studies that included 6 breast cancer–only studies, and the review found positive effects for mental health outcomes, including anxiety.

### Strategies to improve recruitment to randomised trials [^d960dc34]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recruiting participants to trials can be extremely difficult. Identifying strategies that improve trial recruitment would benefit both trialists and health research.

Objectives

To quantify the effects of strategies for improving recruitment of participants to randomised trials. A secondary objective is to assess the evidence for the effect of the research setting (e.g. primary care versus secondary care) on recruitment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Methodology Review Group Specialised Register (CMR) in the Cochrane Library (July 2012, searched 11 February 2015); MEDLINE and MEDLINE In Process (OVID) (1946 to 10 February 2015); Embase (OVID) (1996 to 2015 Week 06); Science Citation Index & Social Science Citation Index (ISI) (2009 to 11 February 2015) and ERIC (EBSCO) (2009 to 11 February 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of methods to increase recruitment to randomised trials. This includes non-healthcare studies and studies recruiting to hypothetical trials. We excluded studies aiming to increase response rates to questionnaires or trial retention and those evaluating incentives and disincentives for clinicians to recruit participants.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on: the method evaluated; country in which the study was carried out; nature of the population; nature of the study setting; nature of the study to be recruited into; randomisation or quasi-randomisation method; and numbers and proportions in each intervention group. We used a risk difference to estimate the absolute improvement and the 95% confidence interval (CI) to describe the effect in individual trials. We assessed heterogeneity between trial results. We used GRADE to judge the certainty we had in the evidence coming from each comparison.

Main Results

We identified 68 eligible trials (24 new to this update) with more than 74,000 participants. There were 63 studies involving interventions aimed directly at trial participants, while five evaluated interventions aimed at people recruiting participants. All studies were in health care. We found 72 comparisons, but just three are supported by high-certainty evidence according to GRADE.1. Open trials rather than blinded, placebo trials. The absolute improvement was 10% (95% CI 7% to 13%).2. Telephone reminders to people who do not respond to a postal invitation. The absolute improvement was 6% (95% CI 3% to 9%). This result applies to trials that have low underlying recruitment. We are less certain for trials that start out with moderately good recruitment (i.e. over 10%).3. Using a particular, bespoke, user-testing approach to develop participant information leaflets. This method involved spending a lot of time working with the target population for recruitment to decide on the content, format and appearance of the participant information leaflet. This made little or no difference to recruitment: absolute improvement was 1% (95% CI -1% to 3%). We had moderate-certainty evidence for eight other comparisons; our confidence was reduced for most of these because the results came from a single study. Three of the methods were changes to trial management, three were changes to how potential participants received information, one was aimed at recruiters, and the last was a test of financial incentives. All of these comparisons would benefit from other researchers replicating the evaluation. There were no evaluations in paediatric trials. We had much less confidence in the other 61 comparisons because the studies had design flaws, were single studies, had very uncertain results or were hypothetical (mock) trials rather than real ones.

Authors' Conclusions

The literature on interventions to improve recruitment to trials has plenty of variety but little depth. Only 3 of 72 comparisons are supported by high-certainty evidence according to GRADE: having an open trial and using telephone reminders to non-responders to postal interventions both increase recruitment; a specialised way of developing participant information leaflets had little or no effect. The methodology research community should improve the evidence base by replicating evaluations of existing strategies, rather than developing and testing new ones.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^84f9a041]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Guideline for the Treatment of Depression — evidence grading and benefits/harms assessment states that aggregate/global strength of evidence is based on two critical outcomes (response to treatment and serious adverse events) and "could be no higher than the lowest individual strength of evidence for each of the critical outcomes", leading to overall ratings that were insufficient/very low across interventions when evidence for serious harms was insufficient/very low. Quantification of benefits drew on quantitative meta-analyses for outcomes selected by the panel for interventions with at least low-quality evidence for response to treatment. Magnitude of benefits and harms/burdens was rated on "a five-point scale: (1) large/modest* benefit; (2) small benefit; (3) no effect; (4) small harm; and (5) modest*/large harm", with a later preference for the term "moderate" instead of "modest", and an approximate rule of thumb for effect sizes that "a small effect size is 0.20, medium is 0.50 and large is 0.90". Harms were differentiated from burdens as disruptions associated with treatment (e.g., time spent, homework/need to practice, cost, convenience). To address limited reporting, the panel asked APA staff to extract harms/burdens data from included studies (e.g., dropout/attrition, symptom worsening, homework), and adult and child/adolescent harms/burdens were derived only from included review articles. The panel did not consider attrition a harm unless reasons were specified or there were differential attrition rates across treatment groups.

### Effect of cognitive bias modification on early relapse among adults undergoing inpatient alcohol withdrawal treatment: a randomized clinical trial [^59176f84]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Importance

More than half of patients with alcohol use disorder who receive inpatient withdrawal treatment relapse within weeks of discharge, hampering subsequent uptake and effectiveness of psychological and pharmacologic interventions. Cognitive bias modification (CBM) improves outcomes after alcohol rehabilitation, but the efficacy of delivering CBM during withdrawal treatment has not yet been established.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that CBM would increase the likelihood of abstaining from alcohol during the 2 weeks following discharge from inpatient withdrawal treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In a randomized clinical trial, 950 patients in 4 inpatient withdrawal units in Melbourne, Australia, were screened for eligibility between June 4, 2017, and July 14, 2019, to receive CBM or sham treatment. Patients with moderate or severe alcohol use disorder aged 18 to 65 years who had no neurologic illness or traumatic brain injury were eligible. Two-week follow-up, conducted by researchers blinded to the participant's condition, was the primary end point. Both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis were conducted.

Interventions

Randomized to 4 consecutive daily sessions of CBM designed to reduce alcohol approach bias or sham training not designed to modify approach bias.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was abstinence assessed using a timeline followback interview. Participants were classified as abstinent (no alcohol use in the first 14 days following discharge) or relapsed (any alcohol use during the first 14 days following discharge or lost to follow-up).

Results

Of the 950 patients screened for eligibility, 338 did not meet inclusion criteria, 108 were discharged before being approached, and 192 refused. Of the 312 patients who consented (referred sample), 12 withdrew before being randomized. In the final population of 300 randomized patients (CBM, n = 147; sham, n = 153), 248 completed the intervention and 272 completed the follow-up. Of the 300 participants (173 [57.7%] men; mean [SD] age, 43.47 [10.43] years), 7 patients (3 controls, 4 CBM) withdrew after finding the training uncomfortable. Abstinence rates were 42.5% (95% CI, 34.3%-50.6%) in controls and 54.4% (95% CI, 46.0%-62.8%) in CBM participants, yielding an 11.9% (95% CI, 0.04%-23.8%; P = 0.04) difference in abstinence rates. In a per-protocol analysis including only those who completed 4 sessions of training and the follow-up, the difference in abstinence rate between groups was 17.0% (95% CI, 3.8%-30.2%; P = 0.008).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this clinical trial support the efficacy of CBM for treatment of alcohol use disorder. Being safe and easy to implement, requiring only a computer and joystick, and needing no specialist staff/training, CBM could be routinely offered as an adjunctive intervention during withdrawal treatment to optimize outcomes.

### Safety and efficacy of 0.01% and 0.1% low-dose atropine eye drop regimens for reduction of myopia progression in Danish children: a randomized clinical trial examining one-year effect and safety [^cf414b06]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

A rebound effect has been reported after atropine cessation which speculatively may be reduced by dose-tapering rather than complete cessation of atropine eye drops. Our study was designed to test this hypothesis by including a loading dose. We observed a slightly larger effect of 0.1% atropine than 0.01%, although with an overlap of confidence intervals, but we also saw that the loading dose group approached the lower dose group after 12 months of treatment. It will be interesting to follow the effect of the loading dose in a longer perspective.

Approximately half of participants in the 0.1% loading dose group experienced pupil-related side effects during the loading dose phase (i.e. the initial six months in this group). The LAMP study speculated that less iris pigmentation might result in an increased occurrence of pupil-related side effects. However, distance and near BCVA was normal and comparable between groups at all visits. Additionally, no participants in the 0.1% loading dose group requested the available photochromatic glasses or near-vision add, but this could be attributed to the short duration of the loading dose phase for this intervention group. Following dose reduction in the 0.1% loading dose group, pupil-size related side effects were uncommon in both intervention groups. This is likely because few participants hereafter exceeded the 3 mm photopic pupil size that has been reported to lead to side effects. When the 0.1% loading dose group switched over to 0.01%, the mesopic and photopic pupil diameter also promptly decreased, implying that pupil-related side effects can quickly be reduced by dose-tapering.

### Effect of different financial incentive structures on promoting physical activity among adults: a randomized clinical trial [^3a10d6a9]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Results

The sample of 3515 participants was distributed randomly among the control (n = 879), constant incentive (n = 879), increasing incentive (n = 881), and decreasing incentive (n = 876) conditions. In the 3 weeks before the intervention, the mean (SD) number of daily steps across all study participants was 6804.5 (3506.9). Before the intervention, each day, on average, 15 391 of 18 459 participants in the control group (83.4%), 15 317 of 18 501 in the increasing incentive condition (82.8%), 15 497 of 18396 in the decreasing incentive condition (84.2%), and 15 527 of 18 459 in the constant incentive condition (84.1%) used their pedometers. During the intervention, each day, on average, 9398 of 12 306 participants in the control group (76.4%), 9747 of 12 334 in the increasing incentive condition (79.0%), 9701 of 12 264 in the decreasing incentive condition (79.1%), and 9804 of 12 306 in the constant incentive condition (79.7%) used their pedometers. Although there were significant differences in pedometer adherence between conditions in the preintervention and intervention periods, the differences were small. To address this difference and the possibility that some participants walked without pedometers, we used an intent-to-treat approach in which we replaced missing data.

Effect of a 20-Fold Increase in Incentives

Among the 3 treatment groups combined, participants took an estimated 135.0 additional daily steps (95% CI, 41.0–228.9 steps) relative to the participants in the control group during the intervention period (P = 0.005). In the 3 weeks after the intervention, there were no significant differences.

Figure 3 shows the unadjusted differences in mean steps taken by treatment participants compared with control participants for 3 weeks before, 2 weeks during, and 3 weeks after the intervention. Treatment participants experienced an increase in physical activity midway through the intervention (when the regular Sunday earnings update email was sent), and the increase was particularly large for those in the constant incentive condition. In the more conservative sensitivity analysis in which we deleted all step count data less than 2000, we found qualitatively similar results.

### Semaglutide (Ozempic) [^aed59576]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment with OZEMPIC 0.5 mg and 1 mg once weekly for 30 weeks resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared with the insulin glargine titration implemented in this study protocol (see Table 6).

Table 6. Results at Week 30 in a Trial of OZEMPIC Compared to Insulin Glargine in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Combination with Metformin or Metformin with Sulfonylurea

aThe intent-to-treat population includes all randomized and exposed patients. At week 30 the primary HbA1cendpoint was missing for 8%, 6% and 6% of patients and during the trial rescue medication was initiated by 4%, 3% and 1% of patients randomized to OZEMPIC 0.5 mg, OZEMPIC 1 mg and insulin glargine, respectively. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation based on retrieved dropouts.
bIntent-to-treat analysis using ANCOVA adjusted for baseline value, country and stratification factors.
p < 0.0001 (2-sided) for superiority, adjusted for multiplicity.
The mean baseline body weight was 93.7 kg, 94 kg, 92.6 kg in the OZEMPIC 0.5 mg, OZEMPIC 1 mg, and insulin glargine arms, respectively. The mean changes from baseline to week 30 were -3.2 kg, -4.7 kg and 0.9 kg in the OZEMPIC 0.5 mg, OZEMPIC 1 mg, and insulin glargine arms, respectively. The difference from insulin glargine (95% CI) for OZEMPIC 0.5 mg was -4.1 kg (-4.9, -3.3) and for OZEMPIC 1 mg was -5.6 kg (-6.4, -4.8).
Combination with metformin or metformin with sulfonylurea
In a 40-week, double-blind trial (NCT03989232), 961 patients with type 2 diabetes currently treated with metformin with or without sulfonylurea treatment were randomized to OZEMPIC 2 mg or OZEMPIC 1 mg once weekly. Patients had a mean age of 58 years and 58.6% were men. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 9.5 years and the mean BMI was 34.6 kg/m2. At randomization, 53.3% of patients were treated with sulfonylurea and metformin. Overall, 88.1% were White, 4.5% were Black or African American, and 7.2% were Asian; 11.6% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Treatment with OZEMPIC 2 mg once weekly for 40 weeks resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared with OZEMPIC 1 mg (see Table 7). Patients were stratified by region (Japan/outside Japan) at randomization.

### Interventions to improve return to work in depressed people [^8e7d73c2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Work disability such as sickness absence is common in people with depression.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing work disability in employees with depressive disorders.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO until April 4th 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs of work-directed and clinical interventions for depressed people that included days of sickness absence or being off work as an outcome. We also analysed the effects on depression and work functioning.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the data and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) or risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to pool study results in studies we judged to be sufficiently similar. MAIN RESULTS: In this update, we added 23 new studies. In total, we included 45 studies with 88 study arms, involving 12,109 participants with either a major depressive disorder or a high level of depressive symptoms. Risk of bias The most common types of bias risk were detection bias (27 studies) and attrition bias (22 studies), both for the outcome of sickness absence. Work-directed interventions Work-directed interventions combined with clinical interventions A combination of a work-directed intervention and a clinical intervention probably reduces days of sickness absence within the first year of follow-up (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.12; 9 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). This translates back to 0.5 fewer (95% CI -0.7 to -0.2) sick leave days in the past two weeks or 25 fewer days during one year (95% CI -37.5 to -11.8). The intervention does not lead to fewer persons being off work beyond one year follow-up (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.09; 2 studies, high-certainty evidence). The intervention may reduce depressive symptoms (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.01; 8 studies, low-certainty evidence) and probably has a small effect on work functioning (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.06; 5 studies, moderate-certainty evidence) within the first year of follow-up. Stand alone work-directed interventions A specific work-directed intervention alone may increase the number of sickness absence days compared with work-directed care as usual (SMD 0.39, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.74; 2 studies, low-certainty evidence) but probably does not lead to more people being off work within the first year of follow-up (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11; 1 study, moderate-certainty evidence) or beyond (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 2 studies, moderate-certainty evidence). There is probably no effect on depressive symptoms (SMD -0.10, 95% -0.30 CI to 0.10; 4 studies, moderate-certainty evidence) within the first year of follow-up and there may be no effect on depressive symptoms beyond that time (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.49; 1 study, low-certainty evidence). The intervention may also not lead to better work functioning (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.90 to 0.26; 1 study, low-certainty evidence) within the first year of follow-up. Psychological interventions A psychological intervention, either face-to-face, or an E-mental health intervention, with or without professional guidance, may reduce the number of sickness absence days, compared with care as usual (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.03; 9 studies, low-certainty evidence). It may also reduce depressive symptoms (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.15, 8 studies, low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether these psychological interventions improve work ability (SMD -0.15 95% CI -0.46 to 0.57; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Psychological intervention combined with antidepressant medication Two studies compared the effect of a psychological intervention combined with antidepressants to antidepressants alone. One study combined psychodynamic therapy with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) medication and another combined telephone-administered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). We are uncertain if this intervention reduces the number of sickness absence days (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.99 to 0.24; 2 studies, very low-certainty evidence) but found that there may be no effect on depressive symptoms (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.12; 2 studies, low-certainty evidence). Antidepressant medication only Three studies compared the effectiveness of SSRI to selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medication on reducing sickness absence and yielded highly inconsistent results. Improved care Overall, interventions to improve care did not lead to fewer days of sickness absence, compared to care as usual (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.06; 7 studies, moderate-certainty evidence). However, in studies with a low risk of bias, the intervention probably leads to fewer days of sickness absence in the first year of follow-up (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.05; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Improved care probably leads to fewer depressive symptoms (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.07; 7 studies, moderate-certainty evidence) but may possibly lead to a decrease in work-functioning (SMD 0.5, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). Exercise Supervised strength exercise may reduce sickness absence, compared to relaxation (SMD -1.11; 95% CI -1.68 to -0.54; one study, low-certainty evidence). However, aerobic exercise probably is not more effective than relaxation or stretching (SMD -0.06; 95% CI -0.36 to 0.24; 2 studies, moderate-certainty evidence). Both studies found no differences between the two conditions in depressive symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

A combination of a work-directed intervention and a clinical intervention probably reduces the number of sickness absence days, but at the end of one year or longer follow-up, this does not lead to more people in the intervention group being at work. The intervention may also reduce depressive symptoms and probably increases work functioning more than care as usual. Specific work-directed interventions may not be more effective than usual work-directed care alone. Psychological interventions may reduce the number of sickness absence days, compared with care as usual. Interventions to improve clinical care probably lead to lower sickness absence and lower levels of depression, compared with care as usual. There was no evidence of a difference in effect on sickness absence of one antidepressant medication compared to another. Further research is needed to assess which combination of work-directed and clinical interventions works best.

### Strategies to improve recruitment to randomised controlled trials [^05ca1fc7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recruiting participants to trials can be extremely difficult. Identifying strategies that improve trial recruitment would benefit both trialists and health research.

Objectives

To quantify the effects of strategies to improve recruitment of participants to randomised controlled trials.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Methodology Review Group Specialised Register - CMR (The Cochrane Library (online) Issue 1 2008) (searched 20 February 2008); MEDLINE, Ovid (1950 to date of search) (searched 06 May 2008); EMBASE, Ovid (1980 to date of search) (searched 16 May 2008); ERIC, CSA (1966 to date of search) (searched 19 March 2008); Science Citation Index Expanded, ISI Web of Science (1975 to date of search) (searched 19 March 2008); Social Sciences Citation Index, ISI Web of Science (1975 to date of search) (searched 19 March 2008); and National Research Register (online) (Issue 3 2007) (searched 03 September 2007); C2-SPECTR (searched 09 April 2008). We also searched PubMed (25 March 2008) to retrieve "related articles" for 15 studies included in a previous version of this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of methods to increase recruitment to randomised controlled trials. This includes non-healthcare studies and studies recruiting to hypothetical trials. Studies aiming to increase response rates to questionnaires or trial retention, or which evaluated incentives and disincentives for clinicians to recruit patients were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted on the method evaluated; country in which the study was carried out; nature of the population; nature of the study setting; nature of the study to be recruited into; randomisation or quasi-randomisation method; and numbers and proportions in each intervention group. We used risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals to describe the effects in individual trials, and assessed heterogeneity of these ratios between trials.

Main Results

We identified 27 eligible trials with more than 26,604 participants. There were 24 studies involving interventions aimed directly at trial participants, while three evaluated interventions aimed at people recruiting participants. All studies were in health care. Some interventions were effective in increasing recruitment: telephone reminders to non-respondents (RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.37 to 5.18), use of opt-out, rather than opt-in, procedures for contacting potential trial participants (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.84) and open designs where participants know which treatment they are receiving in the trial (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.34). However, some of these strategies have disadvantages, which may limit their widespread use. For example, opt-out procedures are controversial and open designs are by definition unblinded. The effects of many other recruitment strategies are unclear; examples include the use of video to provide trial information to potential participants and modifying the training of recruiters. Many studies looked at recruitment to hypothetical trials and it is unclear how applicable these results are to real trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Trialists can increase recruitment to their trials by using the strategies shown to be effective in this review: telephone reminders; use of opt-out, rather than opt-in; procedures for contacting potential trial participants and open designs. Some strategies (e.g. open trial designs) need to be considered carefully before use because they also have disadvantages. For example, opt-out procedures are controversial and open designs are by definition unblinded.

### Biologics for asthma and allergic skin diseases in children [^cc69f403]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Mepolizumab — randomized trials in severe asthma: In the DREAM trial enrolling 621 participants, the rate of clinically significant exacerbations was 2.40 per participant per year in the placebo group, 1.24 per participant per year in the low-dose mepolizumab group [75 mg, intravenous (IV)], 1.46 in the medium-dose group [250 mg, IV], and 1.15 in the high-dose group [750 mg, IV], and although children aged 12 to 17 years were eligible, demographics suggest that no pediatric participants were enrolled. In the MENSA study enrolling 576 participants aged 12 to 82 years (only 25 in age range 12–17 years), exacerbations were reduced by 47% with IV mepolizumab and 53% with subcutaneous injections, with reductions in exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization of 32% (IV) and 61% (subcutaneous), and an increase in FEV1 with improvements in markers of asthma control. In SIRIUS (enrolling 135 participants, 16–74 years of age), steroids were reduced by 50% from baseline in the treatment group with no reduction in the placebo group, exacerbations in the mepolizumab group were reduced by 32%, the mean age in both arms was 50 years, and both SIRIUS and MENSA revealed no significant safety concerns with mepolizumab.

### The effect of intervening hospitalizations on the benefit of structured physical activity in promoting independent mobility among community-living older persons: secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^ada983c2]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For both outcomes, time-to-event analyses were completed using Cox proportional hazards models. The independent variables included the presence/absence of an intervening hospitalization during the six months between MMD assessments as a time-varying covariate, study group, and their interaction. Contrast statements estimated the HR of each outcome by hospitalization status separately for the two study groups, as well as the treatment effect separately for participants who were hospitalized versus not hospitalized. Outcome rates were estimated using repeated measures Poisson regression models and generalized estimating equation methods. These models were fit using time-varying hospitalization status, study group, treatment by hospitalization interaction, and the two design variables (gender and clinical site).

For the onset of MMD, number of hospitalizations and number of days hospitalized prior to MMD within an assessment interval were evaluated as two alternate exposures. Number of days hospitalized was considered as a continuous variable, and HRs are presented for 0, 3 (median), and 10 days hospitalized. Recovery from MMD was evaluated among the subset of participants who developed incident MMD and had a subsequent MMD assessment. To reduce potential bias due to imbalances in baseline covariates or in attrition across study groups among participants with MMD, two additional models were run. The first used inverse probability weights to account for significant predictors of incident MMD, whereas the second used inverse probability weights to account for significant predictors of subsequent attrition (i.e. withdrawal/missed follow-up).

To determine whether the results differed significantly according to the severity of functional limitations, an interaction term denoting baseline SPPB subgroup (< 8: moderate to severe versus 8–9: less severe) was added to the final models. Because short-stay hospitalizations are less likely to be deleterious, the final models were re-run after omitting admissions of < 2 days. All analyses were done using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A Type I error rate of 0.05 and two-tailed alternative hypotheses were assumed for all comparisons.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^824f2c71]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma — SMART in milder asthma and in children aged 4 to 11 years — was assessed in post hoc analyses showing that among 1239 participants aged 12 years and older with milder asthma (daily maintenance ICS dose equal to 400 μg or less budesonide equivalent), SMART reduced exacerbations overall, but in those with the mildest asthma at enrollment (rescue SABA use of ≤ 1 inhalation/d) benefit was marginal and statistically nonsignificant; in a pediatric analysis of 224 children aged 4 to 11 years on medium to high ICS doses (200–500 μg daily), SMART used budesonide-formoterol 80/4.5 μg once daily with up to seven additional rescue puffs (total daily dose of 36 μg formoterol) versus budesonide 320 μg daily with SABA, yielding a 57% drop in the RR for a composite exacerbation measure, significantly fewer nighttime awakenings, lower daily ICS dose (average 123 vs 320 μg), and improved growth rates (adjusted mean difference of 1 cm compared with fixed-dose budesonide).

### The rehabilitation enhancing aging through connected health prehabilitation trial [^27c29bca]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the proof of concept of an innovative model of physical therapy Rehabilitation Enhancing Aging through Connected Health (REACH) and evaluated its feasibility and effect on physical function and health care utilization.

Design

Quasi-experimental 12-month clinical trial.

Setting

Two outpatient rehabilitation centers.

Participants

Community-dwelling older primary care patients with a treatment arm undergoing the intervention (n = 75; mean age = 77 ± 5.9y; 54% women) and propensity matched controls derived from a longitudinal cohort study (n = 430; mean age = 71 ± 7.0y; 68% women) using identical recruitment criteria (N = 505).

Intervention

Combined outpatient and home PT augmented with a commercially available app and computer tablet.

Measurements

Primary outcomes included a feasibility questionnaire, exercise adherence, self-reported function, and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary outcomes included the rates of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations.

Results

Among REACH participants, we observed a 9% dropout rate. After accounting for dropouts, with propensity matching, n = 68 treatments and n = 100 controls were analyzed. Over the 12-month study duration, 85% of participants adhered to the exercise program an average of 2 times a week and evaluated the treatment experience favorably. In comparison to controls, after 1 year of treatment and within multivariable regression models, REACH participants did not manifest a significant difference in patient reported function (group x time effect 1.67 units, P = 0.10) but did manifest significant differences in SPPB (group x time effect 0.69 units, P = 0.03) and gait speed (group x time effect .08m/s, P = 0.02). In comparison to controls, after 1 year, the rate of ED visits (group x time treatment rate = 0.27, P < .004) were significantly reduced, but a significant reduction in hospitalizations was not observed.

Conclusion

The REACH intervention is feasible and has proof of concept in preventing functional decline and favorably affecting health care utilization. Evaluation on a larger scale is warranted.

### Screening and brief intervention for obesity in primary care: a parallel, two-arm, randomised trial [^7fceca15]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Obesity is a common cause of non-communicable disease. Guidelines recommend that physicians screen and offer brief advice to motivate weight loss through referral to behavioural weight loss programmes. However, physicians rarely intervene and no trials have been done on the subject. We did this trial to establish whether physician brief intervention is acceptable and effective for reducing bodyweight in patients with obesity.

Methods

In this parallel, two-arm, randomised trial, patients who consulted 137 primary care physicians in England were screened for obesity. Individuals could be enrolled if they were aged at least 18 years, had a body-mass index of at least 30 kg/m² (or at least 25 kg/m² if of Asian ethnicity), and had a raised body fat percentage. At the end of the consultation, the physician randomly assigned participants (1:1) to one of two 30 s interventions. Randomisation was done via preprepared randomisation cards labelled with a code representing the allocation, which were placed in opaque sealed envelopes and given to physicians to open at the time of treatment assignment. In the active intervention, the physician offered referral to a weight management group (12 sessions of 1 h each, once per week) and, if the referral was accepted, the physician ensured the patient made an appointment and offered follow-up. In the control intervention, the physician advised the patient that their health would benefit from weight loss. The primary outcome was weight change at 12 months in the intention-to-treat population, which was assessed blinded to treatment allocation. We also assessed asked patients' about their feelings on discussing their weight when they have visited their general practitioner for other reasons. Given the nature of the intervention, we did not anticipate any adverse events in the usual sense, so safety outcomes were not assessed. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN26563137.

Findings

Between June 4, 2013, and Dec 23, 2014, we screened 8403 patients, of whom 2728 (32%) were obese. Of these obese patients, 2256 (83%) agreed to participate and 1882 were eligible, enrolled, and included in the intention-to-treat analysis, with 940 individuals in the support group and 942 individuals in the advice group. 722 (77%) individuals assigned to the support intervention agreed to attend the weight management group and 379 (40%) of these individuals attended, compared with 82 (9%) participants who were allocated the advice intervention. In the entire study population, mean weight change at 12 months was 2·43 kg with the support intervention and 1·04 kg with the advice intervention, giving an adjusted difference of 1·43 kg (95% CI 0·89–1·97). The reactions of the patients to the general practitioners' brief interventions did not differ significantly between the study groups in terms of appropriateness (adjusted odds ratio 0·89, 95% CI 0·75–1·07, p = 0·21) or helpfulness (1·05, 0·89–1·26, p = 0·54); overall, four (< 1%) patients thought their intervention was inappropriate and unhelpful and 1530 (81%) patients thought it was appropriate and helpful.

Interpretation

A behaviourally-informed, very brief, physician-delivered opportunistic intervention is acceptable to patients and an effective way to reduce population mean weight.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the evidence-based use of integrative therapies during and after breast cancer treatment [^44da5e6e]. CA (2017). Medium credibility.

Music therapy (grade B) for anxiety/stress reduction in breast cancer care: Passive music therapy is recommended to reduce anxiety during radiation therapy, chemotherapy sessions, and postsurgery (grade B) based on results from 5 RCTs; study participants included patients with breast cancer who were undergoing mastectomy, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy, and the sample sizes of these studies ranged from 30 to 170 participants; passive music therapy was found to decrease anxiety scores in the intervention group, including reducing sedation requirements during radiation therapy; in contrast, in a trial using active music therapy, active music therapy did not result in decreases in anxiety; a meta-analysis found a clinically and statistically significant mean difference (P < .01) in the anxiety scores of patients who received music therapy compared with the control group; passive music therapy is noninvasive, does not interfere with a patient's privacy, has no reported deleterious effects, does not require costly, technologically advanced equipment, and can be implemented in a variety of locations, and can be safely and effectively implemented in clinical settings for patients with breast cancer to help reduce short-term anxiety associated with receiving medical care for their cancer.

### Engaging the oldest old in research: lessons from the newcastle 85 + study [^eeadfdc4]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Retention of study participants: interim withdrawals

As part of our 'Withdraw from study protocol' participants were informed that they could withdraw at any time from all or part of the research. In addition they were told that they could suspend research activity for a period of time should they wish to do so, with the researcher contacting the participant or consultee after this period of time to review the situation. Withdrawal rates between baseline and phase 2 (18 month post baseline), show 88 out of 854 participants' (10%) had withdrawn with approval for continued use of data and materials and a further 2 participants (0.2%) had withdrawn and requested that all data be destroyed. The commonest reasons for withdrawal were deterioration in health ((24 (29%), with 17 of these individuals subsequently being reported as deceased) and fatigue (14 (17%)). This is similar to previous studies which found that attrition of older people from research for reasons other than death is only related to a small number of factors. Attrition due to death of participants within this same time frame was 135 (16%).

Benefits and risks for participants and researchers

We were careful in planning the study to consider and explain any potential benefits to older people of research participation. These included altruistic reasons, i.e. for the greater good and to help others; such reasons tend to predominate in studies involving both older adults and people with existing long term conditions. In addition, participants often appreciated the social opportunities provided by the interviewer visits. In the Newcastle 85+ Study, participants often made comments such as "I am just glad I can be of help", "I look forward to your visit" and "I enjoy the company".

Researchers have a responsibility to ensure that engagement continues in an appropriate manner. It is necessary to remember that the research relationship is based upon trust and this should not be misrepresented in order to coerce an older person to participate or remain in research. The process of cessation of the study needs to be carefully thought through, so as not to leave the older person feeling bereaved or used in any way; the study information booklet needs to state clearly the level of participant involvement. It is also necessary to plan the provision of ongoing communication about the study, in the form of face-to-face and written feedback, together with Christmas cards as a means of keeping in touch and thank you letters and certificates after participants have completed assessments.

### Effectiveness of a group psychological intervention to reduce psychosocial distress in adolescents in Pakistan: a single-blind, cluster randomised controlled trial [^56308ed5]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

Emotional problems in adolescents living in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain largely unaddressed; key reasons include a scarcity of trained mental health professionals and unavailability of evidence-based, scalable psychological interventions. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a non-specialist-delivered, group psychological intervention to reduce psychosocial distress in school-going adolescents in Pakistan.

Methods

In a two-arm, single-blind, cluster randomised controlled trial, eligible public school clusters from a rural subdistrict of Gujar Khan, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, were randomised (1:1, stratified by sex) using permuted block randomisation into intervention (n = 20) and wait-list control (n = 20) groups. Adolescents aged 13–15 years who provided informed assent and caregivers' consent were screened for psychosocial distress using the youth-reported Pediatric Symptoms Checklist (PSC; total psychosocial distress scores from 0 to 70), and those scoring 28 or more and their caregivers were enrolled into the trial. Adolescents in the intervention group received seven weekly group sessions and their caregivers received three biweekly group sessions in school settings from trained non-specialists. The primary outcome was change from baseline in the total PSC scores at 3 months post-intervention. The trial was registered prospectively with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry, ISRCTN17755448.

Findings

From the 40 school clusters that were included, 282 adolescents in the intervention group and 284 adolescents in the wait-list control group were enrolled between Nov 2 and Nov 30, 2021. At 3 months, adolescents in the intervention group had significantly lower mean total score on the PSC compared with adolescents in the control group (mean difference in change from baseline 3·48 [95% CI 1·66–5·29], p = 0·0002, effect size 0·38 [95% CI 0·18–0·57]; adjusted mean difference 3·26 (95% CI 1·46–5·06], p = 0·0004, effect size 0·35 (0·16–0·55). No adverse events were reported in either group.

Interpretation

The group psychological intervention most likely represents a feasible and effective option for adolescents with psychosocial distress in school settings.

### Screening and brief intervention for obesity in primary care: a parallel, two-arm, randomised trial [^1df2d837]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

A brief, 30 s, opportunistic intervention delivered by trained primary care physicians together with a supportive system meant that roughly 40% of patients attended the weight management group offered and 54% of the patients assigned to the active intervention took effective action to manage their weight compared with 11% of the control participants. Consequently, participants who received advice and support lost 1·43 kg more than did those who received advice. Only four (< 1%) people thought the opportunistic interventions were inappropriate and unhelpful and most participants thought the opposite, with no difference in response between treatment groups.

Previous studies on this topic have been cross-sectional, so the major strength of this study is its prospective randomised design. Importantly, most eligible people participated in the trial and there were no substantial differences in the demographic profile of those recruited and those who declined. However, the routine recruitment of participants and our desire to make the intervention from the physician truly opportunistic limited the information that we could collect at baseline; we did not obtain data on participants' ratings of desire, intention, or confidence to achieve weight loss. The absence of these data limits our ability to examine whether either intervention increased participants' motivation to lose weight, although we excluded people who were already taking action to manage their weight, suggesting that we recruited people with low motivation to lose weight. Follow-up is difficult in weight loss trials, with typical 1 year follow-up of 63%. In this trial, in which the population were not seeking help to lose weight, follow-up was particularly difficult, but we managed to measure the weights of 1419 (75%) participants at 12 months; imputation with various methods and completer analysis did not change the findings. The study participants were recruited from southern England and the only large conurbation that we recruited from was Bristol. Consequently, most participants were of white ethnicity. Although a range of people from different socioeconomic circumstances were included, the study population was slightly more affluent on average than the population of England as a whole. Whether the results can be generalised to other groups depends on whether the response to the physician's intervention differs by socioeconomic or ethnic group and whether the response to the weight loss programme varies. Existing evidencesuggests that no differences in response seem to exist by socioeconomic or ethnic groups. The results might therefore be applicable to similar populations where physicians are able to refer patients to an effective weight management programme provided at no cost to the patient, as is the case in the UK, Australia, or Germany. In health-care systems in which free treatment is not available, arranging a referral at the patient's own cost might possibly also be effective, although not everyone will be able to afford the weekly fee (about £5 in the UK).

### Assumptions of expected benefits in randomized phase III trials evaluating systemic treatments for cancer [^a4ba632e]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In designing phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs), the expected magnitude of the benefit of the experimental therapy (δ) determines the number of patients required and the number of person-years of follow-up. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate how reliably δ approximates the observed benefit (B) in RCTs that evaluated cancer treatment.

Methods

RCTs evaluating systemic therapy in adult cancer patients published in 10 journals from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009, were identified. Data were extracted from each publication independently by two investigators. The related-samples Sign test was used to determine whether the median difference between δ and B was statistically significant in different study subsets and was two-sided.

Results

A total of 253 RCTs met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. Regardless of whether benefit was defined as proportional change (median difference between δ and B = -13.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -21.0% to -8.0%), absolute change (median difference between δ and B = -8.0%, 95% CI = -9.9% to -5.1%), or median increase in a time-to-event endpoint (median difference between δ and B = -1.4 months, 95% CI = -2.1 to -0.8 months), δ was consistently and statistically significantly larger than B (P < .001, for each, respectively). This relationship between δ and B was independent of year of publication, industry funding, management by cooperative trial groups, type of control arm, type of experimental arm, disease site, adjuvant treatment, or treatment for advanced disease, and likely contributed to the high proportion of negative RCTs (158 [62.5%] of 253 studies).

Conclusions

Investigators consistently make overly optimistic assumptions regarding treatment benefits when designing RCTs. Attempts to reduce the number of negative RCTs should focus on more realistic estimations of δ. Increased use of interim analyses, certain adaptive trial designs, and better biological characterization of patients are potential ways of mitigating this problem.

### Low-intensity online intervention for mental distress among help-seeking young people in hong kong: a randomized clinical trial [^fa974dac]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Mental health issues among young people are increasingly concerning. Conventional psychological interventions face challenges, including limited staffing, time commitment, and low completion rates.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of a low-intensity online intervention on young people in Hong Kong experiencing moderate or greater mental distress.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial was conducted from May 12, 2022, to September 22, 2023, in Hong Kong. Participants (aged 12–30 years) were recruited from a community project, self-reported moderate to severe distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale score ≥ 5), and were randomized 1:1 to receive the low-intensity online intervention or self-help tips (waitlist group).

Intervention

The low-intensity online intervention group received 4 weekly 1-on-1 online sessions on stress management, sleep, or problem-solving delivered by trained psychological well-being practitioners. The waitlist group received weekly mental health tips via text messaging.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were changes in Kessler Psychological Distress Scale scores and depression and anxiety subscale scores of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes included general stress, overall negative emotions, quality of life, sleep quality, resilience, and self-efficacy. The primary outcome analysis was based on intention to treat with the last observation carried forward approach. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using per-protocol and multiple imputation methods.

Results

Of 332 screened participants, 120 (mean [SD] age, 22.4 [3.4] years; 87 [72.5%] female) were randomized. From baseline to 4 weeks, the low-intensity online intervention group and the control group both saw reductions in scores for depression (mean [SD] difference, 6.0 [7.7] and 4.8 [7.9]; P = 0.17; ηp² = 0.02), anxiety (mean [SD] difference, 6.0 [7.7] and 3.5 [7.7]; P = 0.07; ηp² = 0.03), and psychological distress (mean [SD] difference, 3.8 [3.8] and 2.9 [3.8]; P = 0.24; ηp² = 0.01), but none of these differences were statistically significant. However, the intervention group showed greater reductions in general stress (mean [SD] difference, 7.5 [7.2] vs 4.4 [7.2]; P = 0.02; ηp² = 0.05), negative emotion (mean [SD] difference, 20.3 [19.2] vs 12.7 [19.2]; P = 0.03; ηp² = 0.04), and increased resilience (mean [SD] difference, 0.5 [0.6] vs 0.2 [0.6]; P = 0.01; ηp² = 0.05) compared with the waitlist group. Younger participants and those with lower initial distress experienced greater improvements. The findings were supported by the per-protocol analysis but not by multiple imputation analysis.

Conclusions and Relevance

A low-intensity online intervention did not significantly improve distress, depressive, or anxiety symptoms but showed some potential in reducing general stress and negative emotions and improving resilience. These findings are encouraging but not definitive, and caution is needed due to missing data. These data suggest that a low-intensity online intervention may offer a scalable option for youth mental health.

### Screening and brief intervention for obesity in primary care: a parallel, two-arm, randomised trial [^caf77bcc]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a common cause of non-communicable disease. Guidelines recommend that physicians screen and offer brief advice to motivate weight loss through referral to behavioural weight loss programmes. However, physicians rarely intervene and no trials have been done on the subject. We did this trial to establish whether physician brief intervention is acceptable and effective for reducing bodyweight in patients with obesity.

Methods

In this parallel, two-arm, randomised trial, patients who consulted 137 primary care physicians in England were screened for obesity. Individuals could be enrolled if they were aged at least 18 years, had a body-mass index of at least 30 kg/m 2 (or at least 25 kg/m 2 if of Asian ethnicity), and had a raised body fat percentage. At the end of the consultation, the physician randomly assigned participants (1:1) to one of two 30 s interventions. Randomisation was done via preprepared randomisation cards labelled with a code representing the allocation, which were placed in opaque sealed envelopes and given to physicians to open at the time of treatment assignment. In the active intervention, the physician offered referral to a weight management group (12 sessions of 1 h each, once per week) and, if the referral was accepted, the physician ensured the patient made an appointment and offered follow-up. In the control intervention, the physician advised the patient that their health would benefit from weight loss. The primary outcome was weight change at 12 months in the intention-to-treat population, which was assessed blinded to treatment allocation. We also assessed asked patients' about their feelings on discussing their weight when they have visited their general practitioner for other reasons. Given the nature of the intervention, we did not anticipate any adverse events in the usual sense, so safety outcomes were not assessed. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN26563137.

Findings

Between June 4, 2013, and Dec 23, 2014, we screened 8403 patients, of whom 2728 (32%) were obese. Of these obese patients, 2256 (83%) agreed to participate and 1882 were eligible, enrolled, and included in the intention-to-treat analysis, with 940 individuals in the support group and 942 individuals in the advice group. 722 (77%) individuals assigned to the support intervention agreed to attend the weight management group and 379 (40%) of these individuals attended, compared with 82 (9%) participants who were allocated the advice intervention. In the entire study population, mean weight change at 12 months was 2·43 kg with the support intervention and 1·04 kg with the advice intervention, giving an adjusted difference of 1·43 kg (95% CI 0·89–1·97). The reactions of the patients to the general practitioners' brief interventions did not differ significantly between the study groups in terms of appropriateness (adjusted odds ratio 0·89, 95% CI 0·75–1·07, p = 0·21) or helpfulness (1·05, 0·89–1·26, p = 0·54); overall, four (< 1%) patients thought their intervention was inappropriate and unhelpful and 1530 (81%) patients thought it was appropriate and helpful.

Interpretation

A behaviourally-informed, very brief, physician-delivered opportunistic intervention is acceptable to patients and an effective way to reduce population mean weight.

### Cognitive-motor multitasking in older adults: a randomized controlled study on the effects of individual differences on training success [^fa7604ab]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Our main statistical analyses evaluate whether the three training programs have differential effects on MT performance, in dependence on participants' initial cognitive functioning and motor fitness. We calculate linear mixed-effect models. Dependent variables are MT performance in the walking and driving test. The independent variables Training Group (cognitive, motor, simultaneous cognitive-motor) and Time (pre, post), Initial Cognitive Functioning and Initial Motor Fitness (continuous variables) as well as potential confounds such as age, gender or education are added as fixed effects.

We expect significant three-way interactions between Training Group, Time and Initial Cognitive Functioning (H1), such that the interaction effect of Initial Cognitive Functioning and Time on MT performance is larger (i.e. more negative slope) in the cognitive training group than in the motor and simultaneous cognitive-motor training group. Similarly, we assume a significant three-way interaction between Training Group, Time and Initial Motor Fitness (H2), such that the interaction effect of Initial Motor Fitness and Time on MT performance is larger (i.e. more negative slope) in the motor training group compared to the cognitive or cognitive-motor training group. Lastly, we further expect a significant four-way interaction between Training Group, Time, Initial Cognitive Functioning and Initial Motor Fitness (H3). Here we assume that the triple interaction of Initial Cognitive Functioning, Initial Motor Fitness and Time on MT performance is larger (i.e. more positive slope) in the cognitive-motor training group than in the cognitive or motor training group.

All statistical analyses are performed using SPSS for Windows (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY) and R.

Sample size estimate / power calculations

To approximate the required sample size to test our hypotheses, a statistical power analysis was performed a priori with G*Power 3.0. The following parameters were entered: f² = .085 (i.e. a small to medium-sized effect,), alpha = .05, 1-beta = .80, number of tested predictors = 2 (for each hypothesis, based on dummy coded variables). The estimated required sample size was N = 118 to provide a sufficient power to detect a small to moderate effect. To account for a typical attrition rate of 20% for comparable training studies, we plan to recruit a total of N = 150 participants with training group sizes of n = 50 participants each.

### Tobacco cessation interventions for young people [^94b8e83c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Teenage smoking prevalence is around 15% in developing countries (with wide variation from country to country), and around 26% in the UK and USA. Although most tobacco control programmes for adolescents are based around prevention of uptake, there are also a number of initiatives to help those who want to quit. Since those who do not smoke before the age of 20 are significantly less likely to start as adults, there is a strong case for programmes for young people that address both prevention and treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of strategies that help young people to stop smoking tobacco.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsyclNFO, ERIC, CINAHL, and the bibliographies of identified trials. We also searched the 'grey' literature (unpublished materials), and contacted authors and experts in the field where necessary.

Selection Criteria

Types of studies: Randomized controlled trials, cluster-randomized controlled trials and controlled trials.

Types Of Participants

Young people, aged less than 20, who are regular tobacco smokers. Types of interventions: The interventions ranged from simple ones such as pharmacotherapy, targeting individual young people, through complex programmes targeting people or organizations associated with young people (for example, their families or schools), or the community in which young people live. We included cessation programmes but excluded programmes primarily aimed at prevention of uptake. Types of outcome measures: The primary outcome was smoking status at six months follow up, among those who smoked at baseline. We report the definition of cessation used in each trial (e.g. seven- or thirty-day point prevalence abstinence, or sustained or prolonged abstinence), and we preferred biochemically verified cessation when that measure was available.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently assessed the eligibility of candidate trials identified by the searches, and extracted data from them. We categorized included trials as being at low, medium or high risk of bias, based on concealment of allocation, blinding (where applicable) and the handling of attrition and losses to follow up. We conducted limited meta-analyses of some of the trials, provided that it was appropriate to group them and provided that there was minimal heterogeneity between them. We estimated pooled odds ratios using the Mantel-Haenszel method, based on the quit rates at longest follow up for trials with at least six months follow up from the start of the intervention.

Main Results

We found 15 trials, covering 3605 young people, which met our inclusion criteria (seven cluster-randomized controlled trials, six randomized controlled trials and two controlled trials). Three trials used or tested the transtheoretical model (stages of change) approach, two tested pharmacological aids to quitting (nicotine replacement and bupropion), and the remaining trials used various psycho-social interventions, such as motivational enhancement or behavioural management. The trials evaluating TTM interventions achieved moderate long-term success, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) at one year of 1.70 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 2.33) persisting at two-year follow up with an OR of 1.38 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.92). Neither of the pharmacological intervention trials achieved statistically significant results (data not pooled), but both were small-scale, with low power to detect an effect. The three interventions (5 trials) which used cognitive behavioural therapy interventions did not individually achieve statistically significant results, although when the three Not on Tobacco trials were pooled the OR 1.87; (95% CI 1.00 to 3.50) suggested some measure of effectiveness. Although the three trials that incorporated motivational interviewing as a component of the intervention achieved a pooled OR of 2.05 (95% CI 1.10 to 3.80), the impossibility of isolating the effect of the motivational interviewing in these trials meant that we could not draw meaningful inferences from that analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

Complex approaches show promise, with some persistence of abstinence (30 days point prevalence abstinence at six months), especially those incorporating elements sensitive to stage of change. There were few trials with evidence about pharmacological interventions (nicotine replacement and bupropion), and none demonstrated effectiveness for adolescent smokers. Psycho-social interventions have not so far demonstrated effectiveness, although pooled results for the Not on Tobacco trials suggest that that this approach may yet prove to be effective; however, their definition of cessation (one or more smoke-free days) may not adequately account for the episodic nature of much adolescent smoking. There is a need for well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled trials for this population of smokers, with a minimum of six months follow up and rigorous definitions of cessation (sustained and biochemically verified). Attrition and losses to follow up are particularly problematic in trials for young smokers, and need to be kept to a minimum, so that management and interpretation of missing data need not compromise the findings.

### Reporting of stepped wedge cluster randomised trials: extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement with explanation and elaboration [^905ca873]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Example 3 (Intention-to-treat analysis) — "For the "intention-to-treat" analysis an indicator of whether an observation occurred pre- or post-randomisation was included in the regression model. To allow for delays in implementation a separate "per protocol" analysis was performed with the observations now placed into one of the three categories: "pre-randomisation", "post-randomisation but pre-implementation" and "post-implementation… "

Explanation — The statistical methodology should be clearly reported to allow replication. Where possible, it can be helpful to provide a reference to the statistical methodology used. In a SW-CRT, clusters are randomised to sequentially initiate the intervention. Observations collected under the control condition are therefore, on average, from an earlier calendar time than observations collected under the intervention condition. Changes external to the trial may create underlying secular trends. Likewise, participants, if repeatedly measured over the duration of the study, may get sicker or recover over time. This means that time is a potential confounder. Analysis of a SW-CRT should adjust for time effects irrespective of their statistical significance; failure to do so risks biasing the estimate of the intervention effect, which could lead to declaring an intervention effective when it is ineffective or ineffective when it is effective. It is therefore essential to report if and how time effects were allowed for. If time is measured continuously, time can be modelled parametrically; if time is measured discretely then time can be modelled categorically. Furthermore, SW-CRTs typically include only a small number of clusters and so prespecification of important prognostic factors to use in a fully adjusted analysis (in mitigation of the likelihood of imbalance due to sampling variation) might be undertaken; and small sample corrections should be incorporated where appropriate.

In a parallel CRT, randomisation at the level of the cluster needs to be allowed for at the analysis stage (unless cluster level data are being analysed). In a SW-CRT, as clusters (and possibly individuals) are repeatedly measured over time, there may be some reduction in the strength of correlation between measurements within the same cluster over time. Failure to appropriately model the correlation structure can lead to incorrect estimation of the precision of treatment effects. It is therefore important to clearly describe the correlation structure used in the analysis.

The analysis should also describe how deviations from the randomisation schedule were accommodated (example 3). A more detailed consideration of this point is given under item 16 (numbers analysed).

### Safety and efficacy of switching from dorzolamide 1.0% / timolol maleate 0.5% eye drops to brinzolamide 1.0% / timolol maleate 0.5% eye drops [^e41ebcfb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

In our study, no patients used DTFC drops concomitantly with an analog. We observed no changes in IOP that resulted from switching to a prostaglandin analog plus BTFC drops (n = 18 cases). These results differed from those reported by Lanzl and Raber. However, IOP decreased or increased by ≥ 2 mmHg in 55.2% of subjects. Therefore, we conclude that changes in IOP vary between patients.

Our observed efficacy in reducing IOP was not significantly different from a previous report comparing dorzolamide 2.0%/timolol fixed-combination drops with BTFC drops. However, this previous study reported that participants withdrew from the study because of adverse reactions, including discomfort, discharge, and dizziness. In our study, 14.3% and 40% of participants reported stinging and blurred vision, respectively. This was not significantly different than that reported in a previous study (stinging in 42%, blurred vision in 55%). Moreover, we observed no severe adverse reactions, which is in agreement with past reports. Also in agreement with past reports, less stinging was reported in the BTFC group than in the DTFC group. We believe that less stinging occurred because of pH differences between medications (dorzolamide/timolol pH = 5.6, brinzolamide/timolol pH = 7.2). The frequency of blurred vision in the DTFC group was not significantly different from that observed in the BTFC group. This is in agreement with one previous study, but two other studies, found that BTFC drops caused blurred vision more often than DTFC drops. BTFC drops are a liquid suspension, which is known to cause blurred vision. In a previous study, 79.2% of patients preferred BTFC drops over DTFC drops. Likewise, Lanzl and Raberreported that patients preferred BTFC drop (82.0%) significantly more often than they preferred DTFC drops (8.8%). We found that 33.3% of our participants preferred using DTFC drops and that 27.3% of our participants preferred using BTFC drops. The reason cited for preferring DTFC was less vision blurring. Participants preferred BTFC drops because they caused less stinging. Consequently, we considered the importance of sensation in determining patient preference.

### Face-to-face interventions for informing or educating parents about early childhood vaccination [^f61d8b92]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Unit of analysis issues

The two cluster‐RCTs used intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to adjust their sample sizes to account for clustering, and conducted appropriate analysis, but did not report their effective sample sizes. Therefore, we recalculated effective sample sizes based on information reported in each study, and divided the reported sample size by the design effect (Higgins 2011). In Jackson 2011, the authors used longitudinal analysis because they felt that the participant and cluster numbers were too small to use multilevel modelling. Saitoh 2017 used a hierarchical linear mixed‐effects model to account for repeated measures, by adjusting for interactions between groups, time, and groups x time (as fixed‐effect) and participants (as random‐effects).

We calculated the design effect (DE), using the ICC reported in each study (0.05) and the number of clusters in each study. For each reported outcome, we divided the original sample size by the DE to establish the effective sample size (Higgins 2011; McKenzie 2016). For the dichotomous outcome of vaccination status, we also divided the number of events occurring in each group by the DE. We reported the adjusted sample sizes in all meta‐analyses, and reduced the weightings given to these studies.

Saitoh 2017 reported a DE of 1.95, based on an average cluster size of 20. There were 100 participants in the intervention group and 88 in the control group, which we adjusted to 51 (intervention) and 45 (control) for all outcomes.

Jackson 2011 reported a DE of 1.5, based on an average cluster size of 11. There were 68 in the intervention group and 67 in the control group, which we adjusted to 45 (intervention) and 45 (control) for all outcomes.

Dealing with missing data

Where necessary, we contacted study authors for missing outcome data, missing study‐level participant characteristics, or missing summary data. We had intended to impute missing summary data where possible, and report any assumptions in the results tables. We investigated the effect of our choice of any imputed data, including ICCs, on the pooled effect estimate through sensitivity analyses.

The efficacy of VUITY dosed twice daily for the treatment of presbyopia was also demonstrated in a 14-Day, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled study, namely VIRGO (NCT04983589). A total of 230 participants aged 40 to 55 years old with presbyopia were randomized (114 to VUITY group) and participants were instructed to administer one drop of VUITY or vehicle twice daily in each eye, with each dose administered 6 hours apart.

In this study, the proportion of participants gaining 3 lines or more in mesopic, high contrast, binocular distance corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA), without losing more than 1 line (5 letters) of corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) with the same refractive correction was statistically significantly greater in the VUITY group compared to the vehicle group at Day 14, Hour 9 (3 hours after the second dose) (see Table 2).

Figure 3 presents the proportion of participants who gained 3-lines or more in mesopic DCNVA at Day 14.

### Doctor referral of overweight people to low energy total diet replacement treatment (DROPLET): pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^d95ec8f0]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

We determined a difference of 4 kg weight loss between groups to be clinically relevant. Using data on standard deviation from published studies and assuming 90% power with a two sided significance of 5%, and 20% loss to follow-up, we needed a sample of 270 people. Accounting for multiple testing of secondary outcomes, this gave 90% power to detect a standardised difference of 0.56 with 5% significance for the secondary outcomes.

We followed a statistical analysis plan approved by the independent trial steering committee before database lock. An independent trial statistician used PROC MIXED in SAS Version 9.4 to analyse the primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes using an intention to treat analysis. We used linear mixed effects models with an unstructured correlation matrix for repeated measures and adjusted for baseline stratification variables, with practice set as a random effect. For binary outcomes, we used analogous logistic models. Before analysis of outcomes, we assessed the association between baseline variables and loss to follow-up at 12 months. Age and sex were associated with loss to follow-up and so were included as covariates as planned.

We assessed the sensitivity of the results to missing data using different imputation methods; baseline and last observation carried forward, completers only, multiple imputation, and a pattern mixture model assuming different degrees of missing not at random. To assess whether treatment effects differed by age, sex, BMI, socioeconomic status (based on participant's postcode) and practice, we performed prespecified exploratory subgroup analyses. Following our statistical plan, we did not compare change in quality of life using inferential statistics.

Patient and public involvement

Our extensive public involvement activities have shown that a large proportion of people are interested to know whether weight loss interventions are effective, and they welcome this kind of research. In a previous trial involving opportunistic offers of support for weight loss, patients overwhelmingly reported that this was appropriate and helpful. Members of the public who have expressed an interest in our research were invited to comment on the design of the study and the patient-facing materials before ethical submission. Two lay people were members of the trial steering committee. Participants in the trial were offered the opportunity to hear the results of the study upon completion, and a lay summary and infographic have been provided.

### Results from a randomized controlled trial of zonisamide in the treatment of alcohol use disorder [^23f33d4c]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

There is preliminary evidence that the anticonvulsant medication Zonisamide (ZON) may be an effective, well-tolerated treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, further evaluation of its efficacy for treating patients with AUD is needed, and much remains unknown about ZON's therapeutic mechanisms. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ZON in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. Eighty-one adults (ages 21–65) diagnosed with AUD were randomly assigned to receive either ZON (at a target dose of 400 mg/d) or a pill placebo over 12 weeks, followed by a two-week taper. All participants also received a computerized alcohol reduction program, Take Control (TC). Primary drinking outcomes were average daily drinks, percentage drinking days, and percentage heavy drinking days. Further, we evaluated changes in AUD clinical severity and performance on neuropsychological measures. For both groups, drinking outcomes generally decreased, as did AUD clinical severity, though group differences were not statistically significant. Neuropsychological testing performance was similar for both groups at baseline; however, at post-treatment, participants in the ZON group demonstrated poorer working memory and lower performance on verbal fluency tests compared to the placebo group, and these differences were statistically significant with moderate-large effect sizes. One serious adverse event was reported among individuals receiving ZON. Study findings indicate that ZON combined with TC does not demonstrate superior effectiveness for reducing average daily drinks in this clinical sample with principal AUD compared to placebo and TC, and treatment with ZON may be associated with reduced neurocognitive performance over time.

### Effects of repeated testing in a longitudinal age-homogeneous study of cognitive aging [^641eeaaf]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Estimates of gains related to repeated test exposure (retest effects) and within-person cognitive changes are confounded in most longitudinal studies because of the nonindependent time structures underlying both processes. Recently developed statistical approaches rely on between-person age differences to estimate effects of repeated testing. This study, however, demonstrates how retest effects can be evaluated at the group level in an age-homogeneous population-based study by use of a sampling-based design approach in which level and change of cognitive performance of previous participants, measured at ages 70, 75, 79, 81, 85, 88, 90, 92, 95, 97, and 99 years, were compared with performances of survivors of a representative sample identified and drawn from the same original population cohort but invited for the first time at age 85 with subsequent measurements at ages 88, 90, 92, 95, 97, and 99. The comparisons revealed a trend toward retest effects on two out of five cognitive measurements. The study demonstrates how a design-based approach can provide valuable insights into continuous learning processes embedded in population average aging trajectories that are not confounded with cohort and mortality-related selective attrition.

### Strategies to assess the effect of continuous positive airway pressure on long-term clinically important outcomes among patients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^4497c108]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patient-centered trial design — Table 3 recommends incorporating patients into trial design and governance; refining using an adaptive Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design with modification during the trial to focus on "treatment responders"; considering simplified measurements to define OSA on the basis of home testing such as oxygen desaturation index (ODI); developing and implementing predictors to include participants at higher risk for adverse outcomes; limiting exclusion criteria to include more representative patients and promote generalizability; incorporating patient choice and integrating trials within existing clinical pathways and trusted providers; providing behavioral interventions to support continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use and creating mechanisms for peer support; exploring active controls and comparative effectiveness with non-CPAP alternatives for treatment of sleepiness and other symptoms; reducing participant burden through fewer surveys/interventions, virtual trial visits, and collecting outcomes from electronic health records (EHRs); and long-term engagement by informing participants of trial results, conducting participant appreciation events, and engaging patient advocacy organizations in dissemination efforts.

### Engaging the oldest old in research: lessons from the newcastle 85 + study [^f3ddfea7]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Those aged 85 and over, the oldest old, are now the fastest growing sector of the population. Information on their health is essential to inform future planning; however, there is a paucity of up-to-date information on the oldest old, who are often excluded from research. The aim of the Newcastle 85+ Study is to investigate the health of a cohort of 85-year-olds from a biological, medical and psychosocial perspective. This paper describes the methods employed for the successful recruitment, retention and evaluation of this cohort.

Methods

Participants were all individuals born in 1921 and registered with a participating general practice in Newcastle and North Tyneside, UK. Involvement comprised detailed health assessments, by a nurse, in their usual place of residence and/or review of their general practice medical records.

Results

Of the 1453 individuals eligible to participate, 72% (n = 1042) were recruited; 59% (n = 851) consented to both health assessment and review of general practice records. Key factors for successful involvement included protected time to engage with family and other key gatekeepers, minimising participant burden, through for example home based assessment, and flexibility of approach. Cognitive impairment is a significant issue; due consideration should be given to the ethical and legal issues of capacity and consent. Interim withdrawal rates at phase 2 (18 month post baseline), show 88 out of 854 participants (10%) had withdrawn with approval for continued use of data and materials and a further 2 participants (0.2%) had withdrawn and requested that all data be destroyed. Attrition due to death of participants within this same time frame was 135 (16%).

Conclusion

Our recruitment rates were good and compared favourably with other similar UK and international longitudinal studies of the oldest old. The challenges of and successful strategies for involving, recruiting and retaining the oldest old in research, including those in institutions, are described to facilitate adequate representation of this growing population in future research into ageing.

A total of 207 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled (HbA1c between 7% and 10.5%) by diet and exercise participated in a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, 24-week, placebo-controlled trial (NCT02715258; referred to as Trial 1) to evaluate the efficacy of BRENZAVVY monotherapy. Patients were either treatment naïve or had discontinued a single oral antihyperglycemic treatment ≥ 6 weeks prior to entering a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period. Upon completion of the run-in period they were randomized (1:2) to placebo or BRENZAVVY 20 mg administered orally once daily. The mean age of the population was 55 years and 4% of the patients were older than 75 years of age. Forty-eight percent (48%) were male and 74% were White, 10% were Asian, 15% were Black and 1% were other races. Fifty-two percent (52%) were Hispanic/Latino.

At week 24, treatment with BRENZAVVY provided a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo (see Table 5).

SE: Standard Error; CI: Confidence Interval; FPG: Fasting plasma glucose

Statistically significant (multiplicity adjusted one-sided p-value < 0.025)

Intention to treat population. ANCOVA was used to analyze data using imputed values by return to baseline analysis for missing data at week 24 (9% and 7% for bexagliflozin and placebo, respectively). The ANCOVA model included treatment, country, background anti-diabetes treatment status (treatment naïve or not) and the baseline HbA1c value as a covariate.

### Carbon cost of pragmatic randomised controlled trials: retrospective analysis of sample of trials [^894ac369]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Meaning of study

The government is committed to drastically reducing CO 2 emissions, and all sectors must contribute to this reduction. Clinical research contributes to the NHS's carbon footprint, and the research community should be aware of the CO 2 emissions generated by their trials. This research shows that most CO 2 emissions from randomised controlled trials are generated in areas in which steps could be taken to reduce them. When aiming to minimise CO 2 emissions, trialists and funders should focus particular attention on the emissions generated by participants' travel and travel by the trial team, which can be reduced with simple changes. The number of visits by participants that are required for a trial should be kept to a minimum. Careful consideration of each visit and its purpose may show that the trial could be completed with fewer visits or that several visits could be combined. Alternative methods that do not require face to face encounters, such as telephone interviews, may be available for some assessments of participants. Some of the trials in our study have shown that simple steps can reduce the amount of travelling staff do during the trial and therefore lower CO 2 emissions. For example, some trials held meetings by teleconference to reduce travel; in one study, meetings were held in a location that was within walking distance for people attending. Technologies such as teleconferencing or videoconferencing could be used more and have the potential to reduce the carbon output from trials. This research will feed into NIHR guidelines that will expand on these recommendations and advise researchers on how to reduce CO 2 emissions from their trials and other research.

Unanswered questions and further research

In our analysis, we were unable to separate excess CO 2 emissions from those that occur during routine care. Further work is needed to explore the additional CO 2 emissions generated by randomised controlled trials over and above those generated by routine care. Our analysis included a range of randomised controlled trials, but we did not explore the effect of different research designs on CO 2 output, so further research is needed to explore the CO 2 emissions from other study designs. This study has developed methods to calculate the CO 2 emissions associated with trials. These methods could be expanded on and developed into a tool for use by researchers and funders to allow the carbon cost of a trial to be considered at the planning stage.
