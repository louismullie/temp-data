## Question

Causes of esophageal perforation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of esophageal perforation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching etiologic framework and how different sources categorize causes. Then, I should verify the relative frequencies of iatrogenic, spontaneous, traumatic, foreign body, malignant, and other causes. Next, I will examine specific iatrogenic mechanisms and their risks, followed by spontaneous perforation (Boerhaave syndrome) and its pathophysiology. After that, I should review traumatic, foreign body, and malignancy-related perforations, and finally consider special contexts like eosinophilic esophagitis and caustic ingestion, before summarizing key modifiers such as location, delay, and patient factors that influence outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the framework. Contemporary reviews and guidelines consistently classify esophageal perforation into iatrogenic, spontaneous (barogenic/Boerhaave), traumatic, foreign body, malignant, and miscellaneous causes, with iatrogenic etiologies predominating in modern series, followed by spontaneous rupture and trauma-related injuries [^d3157761] [^9275aed8] [^95d31cd2].

> I will now examine iatrogenic causes, since they are the leading category. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and mechanisms. Multiple series and guidelines attribute roughly 59–70% of perforations to iatrogenic injury, most often during endoscopic procedures such as diagnostic EGD, dilation of strictures, variceal banding or sclerotherapy, EMR, POEM, and stent placement; risks are higher with therapeutic interventions than with diagnostic EGD alone, and dilation carries a measurable perforation risk that varies with stricture complexity and operator experience [^d3157761] [^9275aed8] [^b880b4c6] [^7ac2ae71]. Hold on, I should double-check the specific rates: diagnostic EGD perforation is extremely rare (about 0.004% in large datasets), whereas dilation ranges from about 0.09% to 0.79% depending on the series and technique, and EMR or POEM carry procedure-specific risks in the low single digits, which aligns with endoscopy society guidance [^3f23fcc3] [^b880b4c6] [^7ac2ae71].

> Next, I should review spontaneous perforation, i.e. Boerhaave syndrome. Let me think about the pathophysiology and epidemiology. Boerhaave syndrome results from a sudden rise in intraluminal esophageal pressure during forceful vomiting, cough, or Valsalva, with failure of the upper esophageal sphincter to relax, typically producing a longitudinal tear on the left posterolateral wall of the distal thoracic esophagus; it accounts for roughly 15% of perforations and carries high mortality if diagnosis is delayed [^d3157761] [^41a3fd8d]. I should confirm the mortality signal: contemporary series and meta-analyses report mortality around 15–42%, reinforcing the need for early recognition and definitive management within 24 hours when feasible [^ef009ba9] [^b37cb13b].

> Let me consider traumatic perforations. I need to ensure I distinguish penetrating from blunt mechanisms. Penetrating trauma (gunshot, stab wounds) can directly injure the esophagus, whereas blunt trauma may cause indirect rupture via shear or compression; overall, trauma accounts for a minority of cases, often with delayed diagnosis and high morbidity, particularly for thoracic injuries [^d3157761] [^2074e0d9]. But wait, what if the injury is cervical rather than thoracic? Cervical esophageal perforations from trauma are somewhat more amenable to conservative management when contained, though surgical repair remains indicated for free perforation or sepsis, and guidelines emphasize early surgical consultation and tailored operative approaches [^97ff4421] [^805b6f52].

> I should confirm the role of foreign body ingestion. Foreign bodies, especially sharp objects or those with irregular edges (bones, dentures, pins, blister packs), can lacerate or impale the esophageal wall, leading to perforation; risk escalates with delayed removal and impaction at anatomic narrowings such as the cricopharynx or aortic arch [^d3157761] [^13b13e3e]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical implications: retained foreign bodies beyond 24 hours increase complication risk, and case reports document catastrophic sequelae including aortoesophageal fistula and intracranial abscesses, underscoring the need for urgent endoscopic extraction when feasible [^7d72192d] [^10612ab7].

> Next, I should review malignancy-related perforations. Esophageal cancer can erode through the wall spontaneously or after chemoradiation, and perforation may also occur during endoscopic therapy of malignant strictures; these injuries often involve extensive contamination and poor tissue quality, complicating repair and worsening prognosis [^d3157761] [^95d31cd2]. Let me reconsider the management implication: in many such cases, definitive surgical resection or exclusion may be required rather than primary repair, and multidisciplinary planning is essential given high morbidity [^notfound].

> I will now examine special contexts, starting with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). EoE is a recognized cause of spontaneous perforation, typically in the setting of food bolus impaction or fibrostenotic disease; risk factors include prolonged untreated EoE, focal strictures, and prior food impaction, with perforation risk estimated around 2% in cohorts and often managed conservatively if contained [^b7ddafe5] [^c32aa863]. Wait, let me verify guideline direction: BSG/BSPGHAN recommends contrast-enhanced CT to assess extravasation and favors conservative management with multidisciplinary input when leakage is limited, which aligns with the observed outcomes in EoE perforations [^c32aa863] [^6b2e50b8].

> I should also consider caustic ingestion. Strong acids or alkalis can cause transmural necrosis and perforation within hours to days; clinical severity does not reliably correlate with oral cavity findings, so a high index of suspicion and early endoscopy are warranted to guide management and timing of intervention [^d3157761] [^2834b2a5]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: many caustic injuries are managed conservatively with steroids and serial endoscopy, but perforation mandates surgical consultation and often operative management depending on extent and contamination [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the relative contributions to ensure internal consistency. Across contemporary series and guidelines, iatrogenic causes predominate at roughly 59–70%, spontaneous Boerhaave syndrome accounts for about 15%, trauma-related injuries are less common but clinically significant, foreign body ingestion contributes a meaningful minority, and malignancy-related perforations are notable in oncologic cohorts; miscellaneous causes include infectious ulcers, pill esophagitis, and postoperative leaks, though these are comparatively rare [^d3157761] [^9275aed8] [^95d31cd2]. I should double-check that these proportions align with large cohorts: yes, national and multicenter data consistently show iatrogenic predominance with spontaneous and traumatic etiologies following behind, supporting this distribution [^df0e4e35] [^651cc15e].

> Finally, I need to ensure I highlight modifiers that change risk and outcomes. Location matters: cervical perforations are more often contained and amenable to conservative care, whereas thoracic perforations carry higher mortality due to mediastinal contamination; delay beyond 24 hours markedly increases morbidity and mortality across etiologies; and patient factors such as age, comorbidities, and sepsis severity further worsen outcomes, which is reflected in severity scores and outcome studies [^1e8a6b6c] [^7515d71b] [^d3157761]. Hold on, I should verify that these modifiers are supported by guidelines: WSES explicitly incorporates timing, containment, sepsis, and access to expertise into recommendations for nonoperative versus operative management, reinforcing their clinical relevance [^f707e4bf] [^70da3524].

Esophageal perforation has a **multifactorial etiology**, with **iatrogenic causes predominating** (about 60–70%) due to endoscopic procedures, dilations, and surgery [^d3157761] [^9275aed8]. Spontaneous perforation (**Boerhaave syndrome**) accounts for ~15% and is linked to forceful vomiting or Valsalva [^d3157761] [^41a3fd8d]. Other causes include foreign body ingestion, trauma, malignancy, and caustic ingestion; **risk rises with delayed diagnosis** and pre-existing esophageal disease [^d3157761] [^1e8a6b6c]. Early recognition and tailored management are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^3f6b2cf7] [^82381b45].

---

## Iatrogenic causes

Iatrogenic injury is the **most common cause**, comprising 60–70% of cases [^d3157761] [^9275aed8]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Endoscopic procedures**: Diagnostic and therapeutic EGD, dilation, variceal ligation, sclerotherapy, EMR, and stent placement carry perforation risks [^d3157761] [^7ac2ae71].

- **Surgical interventions**: Thoracic, cervical, or abdominal surgeries can injure the esophagus [^d3157761] [^9275aed8].

- **Nasogastric tube insertion**: Particularly in the cervical esophagus [^99af159b] [^1eacd5a1].

---

## Spontaneous perforation (Boerhaave syndrome)

Spontaneous perforation accounts for ~15% of cases and results from a sudden increase in intraluminal pressure during forceful vomiting, coughing, or Valsalva, causing a **transmural tear** — classically in the distal left posterolateral wall [^d3157761] [^41a3fd8d]. It is associated with high mortality if diagnosis is delayed [^ef009ba9] [^b37cb13b].

---

## Foreign body ingestion

Foreign body ingestion causes ~12% of perforations, with higher risk in children and older adults; **sharp objects** (bones, dentures, pins) and batteries can lodge and erode through the wall [^d3157761] [^13b13e3e]. Delayed removal increases complication risk [^7d72192d].

---

## Trauma

Trauma accounts for ~9% of cases and includes blunt or penetrating injury; the **cervical esophagus is particularly vulnerable** to penetrating trauma [^d3157761] [^2074e0d9]. Delayed diagnosis is common and worsens outcomes [^a72d64da].

---

## Malignancy

Esophageal cancer can cause perforation via tumor invasion, necrosis, or treatment-related injury (chemoradiation); **perforation risk is higher** with advanced disease and after therapy [^d3157761] [^e8685561].

---

## Caustic ingestion

Caustic ingestion (strong acids or alkalis) can cause **rapid transmural necrosis and perforation**, often within hours, and carries high morbidity and mortality [^d3157761] [^2834b2a5].

---

## Risk factors and predisposing conditions

Several factors increase perforation risk:

- **Pre-existing esophageal disease**: Strictures, malignancy, eosinophilic esophagitis, and motility disorders [^d3157761] [^7ac2ae71].

- **Delayed diagnosis**: > 24 hours increases morbidity and mortality [^1e8a6b6c] [^3f6b2cf7].

- **Patient factors**: Age, comorbidities, and immunocompromise [^df0e4e35] [^1e8a6b6c].

## Summary of causes and frequencies

| **Cause** | **Frequency (%)** |
|-|-|
| Iatrogenic | 60–70 |
| Spontaneous (Boerhaave) | ~15 |
| Foreign body | ~12 |
| Trauma | ~9 |
| Malignancy | Variable |
| Caustic ingestion | Rare |

---

Esophageal perforation arises from diverse causes, with **iatrogenic injury most common** and spontaneous rupture, foreign body ingestion, trauma, malignancy, and caustic ingestion also contributing. Early recognition, rapid imaging, and multidisciplinary management are critical to outcomes [^3362a56f] [^82381b45].

### Evolving options in the management of esophageal perforation [^14f8742f]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Esophageal perforation remains a devastating event that is difficult to diagnose and manage. The majority of injuries are iatrogenic and the increasing use of endoscopic procedures can be expected to lead to an even higher incidence of esophageal perforation in coming years. Accurate diagnosis and effective treatment depend on early recognition of clinical features and accurate interpretation of diagnostic imaging. Outcome is determined by the cause and location of the injury, the presence of concomitant esophageal disease, and the interval between perforation and initiation of therapy. The overall mortality associated with esophageal perforation can approach 20%, and delay in treatment of more than 24 hours after perforation can result in a doubling of mortality. Surgical primary repair, with or without reinforcement, is the most successful treatment option in the management of esophageal perforation and reduces mortality by 50% to 70% compared with other interventional therapies.

### Esophageal perforation: surgical, endoscopic and medical management strategies [^5f9b9b0e]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this article is to review current therapeutic strategies and outcomes in the management of esophageal perforation. The relative rarity and unpredictability of esophageal perforation has precluded a randomized or multiinstitutional study of this condition. Practice standards are based primarily on retrospective reviews and expert opinions.

Recent Findings

The last decade has observed a shift from an aggressive early operative intervention to a judicious, nonoperative management of esophageal perforation in selected patients. Encouraging outcomes for nonoperative management published in recent literature result from advancements in esophageal stent technology, imaging sciences, and critical care.

Summary

Perforation of the esophagus, regardless of the cause, remains a major life-threatening event. Early recognition and aggressive care by a clinical team with experience in a variety of treatment modalities is increasingly important in achieving optimal outcomes in this difficult problem. Recently, encouraging results have been published utilizing esophageal stents and diligent nonoperative care in patients with esophageal perforation. The guiding principles in the treatment of this challenging condition remain early diagnosis, appropriate resuscitation, sepsis control, nutritional support, and re-establishment of esophageal continuity. Herein, we review the recent reports on the surgical, medical, and endoscopic treatment of esophageal perforation.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: esophageal perforation [^82381b45]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Esophageal perforation is a rare but serious condition associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This article highlights the pearls and pitfalls of esophageal perforation, including diagnosis, initial resuscitation, and management in the emergency department based on current evidence.

Discussion

Esophageal perforation occurs with injury to the layers of the esophagus, resulting in mediastinal contamination and sepsis. While aspects of the history and physical examination may prompt consideration of the diagnosis, the lack of classic signs and symptoms cannot be used to rule out esophageal perforation. Chest radiograph often exhibits indirect findings suggestive of esophageal perforation, but these are rarely diagnostic. Advanced imaging is necessary to make the diagnosis, evaluate the severity of the injury, and guide appropriate management. Management focuses on hemodynamic stabilization with intravenous fluids and vasopressors if needed, gastric decompression, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and a thoughtful approach to airway management. Proton pump inhibitors and antifungals may be used as adjunctive therapies. Current available evidence for various treatment options (conservative, endoscopic, and surgical interventions) for esophageal perforation and resulting patient outcomes are limited. A multidisciplinary team approach with input from thoracic surgery, interventional radiology, gastroenterology, and critical care is recommended, with admission to the intensive care setting.

Conclusions

An understanding of esophageal perforation can assist emergency physicians in diagnosing and managing this deadly disease.

### Surgical versus endoscopic management of esophageal perforation [^29ec2fbb]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The management of esophageal perforation is a topic of debate, as there now are viable surgical and endoscopic options. Historically, surgical management had been considered the standard of care for these perforations, but such surgical management can be associated with considerable morbidity. In this report, we explore contemporary options for the care of patients with esophageal perforations.

Recent Findings

Innovations in endoscopic therapies, including self-expanding metal and plastic stents, over-the-scope clips, vacuum therapy, and endoscopic suturing have expanded treatment options for esophageal perforations. These approaches are particularly beneficial for selected patients with early, contained perforations, offering reduced morbidity and shorter hospital stays. However, surgical intervention remains essential in cases of extensive contamination, necrosis, or delayed diagnosis. A growing body of evidence supports a patient-specific approach, integrating both traditional and emerging interventions.

Summary

The management of esophageal perforation is evolving with the increasing use of minimally invasive endoscopic techniques. However, surgical repair remains the definitive treatment in patients with hemodynamic instability or extensive contamination. Timely intervention is critical, as delayed diagnosis significantly increases morbidity and mortality. A tailored approach, incorporating patient-specific factors and nature of the disease, ensures optimal outcomes.

### Esophageal perforation [^f9255d93]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Esophageal perforation is uncommon but carries a high morbidity and mortality, particularly if the injury is not detected early before the onset of systemic signs of sepsis. The fact that it is an uncommon problem and it produces symptoms that can mimic other serious thoracic conditions, such as myocardial infarction, contributes to the delay in diagnosis. Patients at risk for iatrogenic perforations (esophageal malignancy) frequently have comorbidities that increase their perioperative morbidity and mortality. The optimal treatment of esophageal perforation varies with respect to the time of presentation, the extent of the perforation, and the underlying esophageal pathologic conditions.

### CT features of esophageal emergencies [^84d15d4e]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Esophageal emergencies-primarily, perforation and conditions with the potential to progress to perforation-result in significant morbidity and mortality if they are not recognized and treated promptly. The spectrum of esophageal emergencies includes esophagitis, foreign body impaction, and traumatic esophageal injury. Because there is considerable variability in the clinical manifestations of emergent esophageal conditions, computed tomography (CT) may play both primary and complementary roles in their diagnosis and evaluation. An awareness of the CT findings associated with the spectrum of acute esophageal disease facilitates the accurate and prompt diagnosis of esophageal emergencies and thereby contributes to a more successful outcome.

### Long-term considerations in the treatment of eosinophilic… -AAP… [^747bd737]. AAP (2023). Medium credibility.

Long term use of PPIs and an elimination diet with insufficient nutrients is correlated with lower bone mass density in children with EoE. Adrenal insufficiency can occur in children with the use of swallowed topical steroids.
- One systematic review showed that 16% of pooled patients with EoE were identified as having adrenal insufficiency secondary to swallowed topical steroids.
- The risk of adrenal insufficiency for short-term topical corticosteroids is negligible.
- The risk of adrenal insufficiency in children with EoE who are taking topical corticosteroids for atopic conditions or inhaled steroids for asthma is increased because of a cumulative dose. Monitoring Control of EoE Given the progressive nature of fibrosis in the esophagus of patients with EoE and the negative effects of remodeling of the esophagus on quality of life, monitoring for active EoE is necessary.
- EoE is the most common cause of esophageal perforation, usually occurring spontaneously at the time of food bolus impaction. Monitoring of patients with EoE can be performed by using multiple complementary methods, including:

- Tracking clinical severity by using validated instruments during follow-up visits Periodic endoscopy and biopsy or other less invasive sampling when appropriate.
- Dietary restrictions can sometimes be costly and more difficult to implement, particularly when controlling food exposures outside of the home.
- If a parent is opposed to long-term steroid use in their child, then this opinion must be considered when recommending a treatment plan.
- The risks and benefits of each type of treatment — medical and dietary — should be fully explained and understood by the family, prior to initiation.
- Swallowed topical steroids are effective in minimizing inflammation and reducing stricture formation; however, children with other atopic diseases may have a higher burden of absorbed steroids. Monitoring for side effects of these cumulative exposures becomes more critical in these cases. Each family has unique considerations and concerns. Treatment failure should always include a discussion of adherence in a nonjudgmental fashion. If a treatment is too onerous to implement within a family, this is not a failure of the family but a recognition of the difficulties of the treatment option in the particular family setting.

### Endoscopic management of esophageal perforations: a multi-center study [^651cc15e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Esophageal perforation (EP) is a full-thickness tear of the mucosal and muscular layers of the esophagus. It is a relatively uncommon medical emergency with an incidence of 3.1/1000000 a year. Although its causes are multifactorial, the leading cause worldwide is iatrogenic, which often occurs during endoscopic procedures. Other relatively less common causes include spontaneous rupture, ingestion of foreign bodies, trauma, and malignancy. Chest pain is considered the cardinal symptom of EP; however, the clinical presentation varies depending on the underlying cause, location, and duration of rupture.

Prompt management of EP is crucial, as the main predictor of complications and survival in those cases is the interval of time from the esophageal injury to its diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, the initial diagnosis in patients with EPs is incorrect in 50% of cases, and the time interval to diagnosis is longer than 24 h in two-thirds of the cases. There are several possible therapeutic strategies, ranging from medical treatment to the most aggressive, esophagectomy. Somewhere between these two extremes, one finds the mini-invasive techniques, including interventional endoscopy. Available endoscopic management options are clips, esophageal stents, and endoscopic suturing. Although stent placement is the most widely described option, determining the suitable endoscopic closure technique relies on evaluating specific parameters like the defect's location, size, and margins.

The debate over the most effective approach to managing EPs persists. Existing evidence guiding the management of EPs relies heavily on retrospective studies from single institutions and a few nationwide studies. The absence of randomized studies underscores the need for a thorough understanding of the factors that influence the success of conservative and endoscopic management. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the outcomes of different EP non-operative management approaches and identify predictors of successful repair.

### Esophageal perforation as a complication of esophagogastroduodenoscopy [^cfc73f74]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Fifty years ago, esophageal perforation was common after rigid upper endoscopy. The arrival of flexible endoscopic instruments and refinement in technique have decreased its incidence; however, esophageal perforation remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality. This complication merits a high index of clinical suspicion to prevent sequelae of mediastinitis and fulminant sepsis. Although the risk of perforation with esophagogastroduodenoscopy alone is only 0.03%, this risk can increase to 17% with therapeutic interventions in the setting of underlying esophageal and systemic diseases. A wide spectrum of management options exist, ranging from conservative treatment to surgical intervention. Prompt recognition and management, within 24 hours of perforation, is critical for favorable outcomes.

### Early diagnosis is associated with improved clinical outcomes in benign esophageal perforation: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^a0fad48a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Esophageal perforation is characterized by transmural disruption of the esophagus that could lead to contamination of the surrounding tissue. The majority of underlying causes consists of iatrogenic esophageal perforations (IEP) and spontaneous esophageal perforations, also known as Boerhaave's syndrome (BS). The incidence of IEP is rising due to the increase in invasive endoscopic esophageal interventions in clinical practice.

Initial management of esophageal perforation generally consists of either surgical or endoscopic treatment (including drainage) combined with fasting, enteral tube feeding and intravenous antibiotics. Patients with either IEP or BS are usually managed with similar therapeutic strategies. Nonetheless, optimal treatment selection for individual patients with esophageal perforation remains a challenge in current practice and is largely based on expert opinion as supportive high-level confidence evidence from comparative studies is generally lacking. Despite a reduction in mortality rates during the past decades, esophageal perforation continues to be associated with severe adverse clinical outcome. A pooled meta-analysis published in 2013 showed a mortality rate of 12%, while a nation-wide population-based study in England reported a 35% overall mortality rate in patients diagnosed with predominantly BS between 2010 and 2012. The latter study also identified older age, type of therapeutic management (i.e. endoscopy) and lower patient volume per hospital as risk factors for a worse outcome in patients with esophageal perforation. Furthermore, BS was associated with a higher overall mortality rate when compared with IEP. This may be related to the higher risk of diagnostic delay as a result of the out-of-hospital setting in which BS often occurs.

When exploring the nature of clinical presentation, numerous case series have investigated whether time between onset and diagnosis is associated with clinical outcomes in patients with esophageal perforation. As a result, authors of some studies have suggested that diagnosis within 24 h, the so-called 'golden 24 h-rule', is associated with improved outcome in patients with any type of esophageal perforation. However, given the design, heterogeneity in types of perforation and relatively small sample size of these studies, no convincing evidence for an association between time of diagnosis of esophageal perforation and clinical outcome has been found.

In an effort to pool results from published case series, we performed an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA). This study design allows to combine raw patient data from case series and to stratify outcomes by type of perforation, while correcting for confounders in a multivariable analysis. Our aim was to assess whether time of diagnosis (TOD) was associated with clinical outcomes in patients with IEP and BS.

### Esophageal emergencies: things that will wake you from a sound sleep [^951bc589]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Esophageal emergencies are a common problem facing practicing gastroenterologists and it is important to know what therapies are indicated for different situations. Patients ingesting caustic agents should be monitored intensively for signs of perforation and ultimately for signs of stricture development. Foreign bodies impacted in the esophagus should be removed promptly to prevent perforation. Although esophageal perforations are generally managed surgically, conservative management of localized perforations has become more common especially with improved antibiotics and the use of nonsurgical interventional drainage techniques. In either elected course the gastroenterologist should work closely with the surgical team.

### Oesophageal injuries: position paper, WSES, 2013 [^2d5979d0]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Oesophageal perforation is a potentially life-threatening clinical situation with a high morbidity and a mortality. The clinical symptoms and signs are non-specific. The relative paucity of experience at any given center makes the diagnosis difficult and often delayed. There are no randomized studies, no class I evidence for diagnostic and management precepts. However, multiple series reported in the literature allow some strong recommendations.

Regarding specific circumstances for eosinophilic esophagitis, more specifically with respect to patients with esophageal perforation, BSG/BSPGHAN 2022 guidelines recommend to offer conservative management with multidisciplinary input from gastroenterology, surgery, and radiology specialists in patients with EoE perforation if there is limited extravasation.

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^9f82e49a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The current recommendations rely on extensive review of the literature and expert opinion. Because of the low incidence of esophageal injuries, high-quality evidence is lacking and the majority of publications in the literature are case reports, case series, or literature reviews. Despite these limitations, the value of the consensus conference in Bertinoro was to gather a panel of recognized experts who discussed point by point all the major issues related to esophageal injuries (Table 2). We recommend a high degree of suspicion in clinical situations that might be associated with or secondarily lead to esophageal perforation; starting appropriate treatment within 24 h can be lifesaving under these circumstances. Both CT and endoscopy are reliable diagnostic tools and their use should be tailored to the patient condition. Definitive management of esophageal emergencies should be undertaken in specialized centers in which multispecialty (esophageal surgeons, interventional radiologists, endoscopists, intensive care unit specialists) expertise is available round the clock.

### Management of iatrogenic cervical esophageal perforations: a narrative review [^99af159b]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Esophageal perforations are difficult to diagnose and have a high mortality rate. Cervical esophageal perforations (CEPs) are the second most common anatomic type of esophageal perforations and are most often due to iatrogenic injury. They are often managed more conservatively than thoracic perforations. The current literature on CEPs is mostly observational, with a paucity of prospective controlled studies. In addition, there is scarce literature focusing specifically on iatrogenic CEPs (iCEPs) as an entity of their own.

Observations

The existing studies on esophageal perforations address treatment by anatomic location and by cause, but few focus specifically on iCEPs. The cricopharynx is the most common site for injury in diagnostic endoscopy. The standard treatment is generally conservative management with drainage unless the perforation is greater than 2 cm, the diagnosis is delayed, or the patient shows signs of sepsis, which would prompt surgical intervention, most commonly in the form of primary repair via open or endoscopic approach. An open approach has been the mainstay of therapy; however, use of endoscopic clips, stents, and suturing is increasingly on the rise. Guideline recommendations on the optimal therapeutic approach for iCEPs are lacking. The most consistent recommendation in the literature is immediate and individualized treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

The management of iCEPs is controversial. There is a need for additional prospective studies comparing treatment options for iCEPs to establish a gold standard treatment and to assess for the expanding role of endoscopic interventions.

### Current treatment and outcome of esophageal perforations in adults: systematic review and meta-analysis of 75 studies [^1e8a6b6c]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The current prognosis of esophageal perforation and the efficacy of available treatment methods are not well defined.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of esophageal perforations published from January 2000 to April 2012 and subjected a proportion of the retrieved data to a meta-analysis. Meta-regression was performed to determine predictors of mortality immediately after esophageal perforation.

Results

Analysis of 75 studies resulted in a pooled mortality of 11.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.7–14.3: 75 studies with 2,971 patients] with a mean hospital stay of 32.9 days (95% CI 16.9–48.9: 28 studies with 1,233 patients). Cervical perforations had a pooled mortality of 5.9%, thoracic perforations 10.9%, and intraabdominal perforations 13.2%. Mortality after esophageal perforation secondary to foreign bodies was 2.1%, iatrogenic perforation 13.2%, and spontaneous perforation 14.8%. Treatment started within 24 h after the event resulted in a mortality rate of 7.4% compared with 20.3% in patients treated later (risk ratio 2.279, 95% CI 1.632–3.182). Primary repair was associated with a pooled mortality of 9.5%, esophagectomy 13.8%, T-tube or any other tube repair 20.0%, and stent-grafting 7.3%.

Conclusions

Results of recent studies indicate that mortality after esophageal perforation is high despite any definitive surgical or conservative strategy. Stent-grafting is associated with somewhat lower mortality rates, but studies may be biased by patient selection and limited experience.

### Endoscopic management of esophageal perforations: a multi-center study [^e6b1e989]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Esophageal perforation (EP) is a rare but life-threatening condition with an incidence of approximately 3.1 per million annually. While iatrogenic injury during endoscopy is the leading cause, other etiologies include spontaneous rupture, trauma, and malignancy. EP can present with nonspecific symptoms, most commonly chest pain or dysphagia, and diagnostic delays are associated with worse outcomes. Multiple non-operative strategies exist, including primary closure, stenting (bypass), combination therapy, and conservative management. However, data guiding the optimal approach remain limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of different non-operative management strategies for EP and identify predictors of successful repair.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed adult patients with EP across three Mayo Clinic sites between 2007 and 2023. Patients were categorized into four groups based on treatment modality. Demographics, clinical features, imaging, endoscopic intervention, and outcomes were recorded. The primary outcome was clinical success, defined as avoidance of surgical intervention. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of success.

Results

A total of 72 patients were included (mean age 63.7 years, 65.3% male). The most common cause was iatrogenic injury (58.3%), and the distal esophagus was the most frequent site (67.6%). Non-operative success was 100% in the primary closure and combination groups, and 42.9% in the conservative group (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, non-conservative therapy significantly predicted success (aOR 22.4, 95% CI [1.2–407.4], p = 0.036).

Conclusion

Primary closure and combination endoscopic approaches offer superior outcomes in managing EP. Early intervention with appropriate modality selection is critical to avoid surgical escalation and improve prognosis.

### Endoscopic management of esophageal perforations: a multi-center study [^491191bb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study underscores the effectiveness of various non-operative management strategies for esophageal perforations. We showed that treatment modality is a significant predictor of success, particularly highlighting the superior outcomes associated with primary closure and combination techniques. Future prospective studies are essential to validate these results and to develop standardized treatment protocols that can further enhance patient care. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of the factors influencing outcomes in esophageal perforation management could lead to improved survival rates and quality of life for affected patients.

Esophageal perforations

Esophageal perforation (EP) covers a large range of conditions characterized by the transmural disruption of the esophagus. Spontaneous esophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome) is most often due to an abrupt increase in the esophageal pressure following a vomiting effort in the absence of relaxation of the superior esophageal sphincter. It accounts for 15% of esophageal perforations; the tear is usually located on the left border of the lower third of the thoracic esophagus and the wall defect is large (3–8 cm). The large majority (60%) of esophageal perforations are iatrogenic and occur during diagnostic and therapeutic (esophageal dilation, varices ligation, sclerotherapy, etc.) endoscopic procedures. Other rare causes include operative and external trauma, malignancy, foreign bodies, and caustic ingestion. Forceful retching or vomiting causing perforation has erroneously come to be known as spontaneous esophageal perforation; as it is not spontaneous it may be better to use other terms such as barogenic rupture or Boerhaave syndrome.

The common denominator of all these heterogeneous conditions is the contamination of surrounding spaces with digestive contents and the evolution to severe sepsis and death in the absence of timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Mortality of esophageal perforation ranges between 10% and 20% and the delay in treatment is the most important survival predictor.

### Prognostic factors of esophageal perforation and rupture leading to mortality: a retrospective study [^059c5787]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although esophageal perforation and rupture (EPR) occurs rarely, it is a life-threatening condition that leads to mortality if not treated appropriately. EPR has various causes, especially traumatic and non-traumatic factors. EPR caused by trauma is divided into penetrating injury and blunt trauma. EPR due to penetrating injury is mainly due to gunshot wounds or penetration of foreign bodies, and occurs in < 1% of the total EPR cases. In the case of non-traumatic EPR, the cause is divided into iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic. Iatrogenic causes often occur after endoscopic intervention and are the most common causes. Spontaneous esophageal perforation, also known as Boerhaave syndrome, is reported in 15% of all EPR cases. If EPR is not managed properly, it can lead to localized infections such as mediastinitis, pneumonia, empyema, as well as systemic infections that can lead to mortality. Management of EPR depends on the cause, location, and size of the EPR, and the presence of accompanying symptoms. Spontaneous esophageal perforation is managed by primary repair of the damaged site or insertion of a self-expanded stent. In the case of EPR without pleural effusion or with a small size, nonsurgical management can be applied. The recent advances in management, total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, and intensive care unit management have led to nonsurgical management of EPR. Despite the recent accumulation of treatment experience and advances in medical technology, the results of EPR treatment have not met expectations, with mortality rates still reaching 4–20%, although other studies have shown slightly different results. Owing to the anatomical structure of the esophagus, unlike other gastrointestinal tract organs in the abdominal cavity, the resistance to distortion is relatively low, which is likely to cause damage due to distortion by mass effect. EPR can lead to severe infective conditions such as empyema, pneumonia, and mediastinitis by gastric content or food from oral intake, which increases mortality. This study was aimed at identifying factors that affect the high mortality of EPR and improving the treatment of EPR.

### Surgical management of instrumental perforation of the esophagus… [^a9011bb8]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

PERFORATION of the esophagus from instrumentation is a tragic accident and an urgent surgical emergency. Unless promptly and properly treated, it is usually fatal. Proper treatment consists of the immediate establishment of wide and free drainage to the site of perforation in addition to adequate antibiotic and supportive therapy and other less important measures. This has been emphasized by Hoover, 1 Touroff2 and others. Although this discussion is concerned with perforation caused by instrumentation, it would seem desirable to include a classification of all causes. A. Instrinsic causes 1. Tumors arising in the oesophagus
2. Esophagitis Nonspecific, tuberculous, syphilitic 3. Spontaneous perforations Ruptures from violent vomiting
4. Ulceration Peptic, Curling's 3. B. Extrinsic causes 1. Instrumentation Endoscopy, dilation
2. Swallowed foreign bodies Bones, dentures, pins 3. Penetrating wounds Stab, bullet
4. Penetration of extrinsic neoplasms 5.

### Efficacy and safety of esophageal stenting for esophageal perforation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e8685561]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Esophageal perforation is a severe, life-threatening condition that is most commonly associated with iatrogenic causes, such as surgery or endoscopic procedures, while spontaneous perforations also occasionally occur. Boerhaave syndrome is a spontaneous longitudinal esophageal wall tear due to high intra-abdominal pressure combined with low intra-thoracic pressure, as in retching, trauma, seizures and defecation. This tear usually occurs above the diaphragmatic esophageal hiatus, most commonly on the left side. Rarely, malignancy can lead to esophageal perforation, often secondary to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Law et al reported spontaneous rupture as the main cause of perforation, with one-third of cases related to malignant etiologies receiving chemotherapy.

Esophageal stenting has been used to treat patients with esophageal perforation to good effect, especially patients who are poor candidates for surgery. However, esophagectomy or primary surgical repair for esophageal perforation are still performed in many institutions, despite their high mortality and morbidity. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esophageal stent placement to manage esophageal perforation.

### A multistep approach for managing a complex esophageal perforation [^0d8416bb]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Esophageal perforation in adults is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The optimal treatment approach remains a subject of debate. The primary etiologies of esophageal perforation in adults include iatrogenic causes, trauma, spontaneous events, and foreign body ingestion. Both morbidity and mortality rates are closely linked to delays in diagnosis and the timely initiation of appropriate treatment. Although esophageal clips, stent placement, and suturing are commonly considered as initial therapeutic options for managing esophageal perforations, their effectiveness may be limited, particularly in cases of large perforations that are unsuitable for clipping or insufficiently addressed by stent placement. The X-Tack Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, Tex, USA) is a suture-based device designed for through-the-scope applications that is specifically approved for the approximation of mucosal defects, with case reports and series demonstrating promising outcomes (Fig. 1).

### Causes and outcomes of esophageal perforation in eosinophilic esophagitis [^b7ddafe5]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Goals

To characterize patients who suffer perforation in the context of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and to identify predictors of perforation.

Background

Esophageal perforation is a serious complication of EoE.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the University of North Carolina EoE clinicopathologic database from 2001 to 2014. Subjects were included if they had an incident diagnosis of EoE and met consensus guidelines, including nonresponse to a PPI trial. Patients with EoE who had suffered perforation at any point during their course were identified, and compared with EoE cases without perforation. Multiple logistic regression was performed to determine predictors of perforation.

Results

Out of 511 subjects with EoE, 10 (2.0%) had experienced an esophageal perforation. Although those who perforated tended to have a longer duration of symptoms before diagnosis (11.4 vs. 7.0 y, P = 0.13), a history of food impaction (odds ratio, 14.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.7–129.2) and the presence of a focal stricture (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–19.7) were the only factors independently associated with perforation. Most perforations (80%) occurred after a prolonged food bolus impaction, and only half of individuals (5/10) carried a diagnosis of EoE at the time of perforation; none occurred after dilation. Six patients (60%) were treated with nonoperative management, and 4 (40%) required surgical repair.

Conclusions

Esophageal perforation is a rare but serious complication of eosinophilic esophagitis, occurring in ∼2% of cases. Most episodes are due to food bolus impaction or strictures, suggesting that patients with fibrostenotic disease due to longer duration of symptoms are at increased risk.

Surgical emergency

Esophageal perforation

Esophageal perforation (EP) is a rare but morbid entity associated with a mortality rate of 20–40%, with higher mortality seen with delayed presentation. Symptoms are nonspecific depending on the location of the perforation and patients may present with dysphagia, neck pain or crepitus, chest pain, or epigastric pain. The most common cause of EP is iatrogenic from endoscopic instrumentation or thoracic surgery, and accounts for 59% of cases. Other etiologies include spontaneous perforation, corrosive or sharp foreign body ingestion, trauma, and malignancy (Table 2). Management is variable and takes into account the severity and location of the perforation as well as sepsis status and damage to surrounding structures. Surgical consultation is always merited and the preferred approach is surgical primary repair (Fig 1). However, distinction of a contained perforation such as a thoracic EP contained without drainage into the pleural space is important as the treatment for small contained perforations can be non-surgical and patients may benefit from stent placement or medical management, avoiding invasive surgery.

Iatrogenic and idiopathic esophageal perforation

In patients presenting with acute chest pain after a recent history of instrumentation such as simple endoscopy, esophageal stricture dilation, anterior cervical discectomy, or various cardiac procedures such as transesophageal echocardiography or radiofrequency catheter ablation, careful evaluation should be made for the diagnosis of EP. CT findings may be subtle and can include small locules of periesophageal and mediastinal air or fluid, left pleural effusion, or focal wall thickening (Fig. 2 a, b). Similar findings can also be seen in spontaneous esophageal perforation such as Boerhaave syndrome, which is induced from a sudden increase in intraluminal pressure from acts such as forceful vomiting, cough, or Valsalva maneuver (Fig. 2 c, d). Spontaneous perforation classically results in a longitudinal tear along the posterior wall of the abdominal esophagus, whereas the hypopharynx is the most commonly affected site in iatrogenic perforation. In a patient with suspected EP who is otherwise clinically stable, contrast esophagography with water-soluble contrast can be performed first to evaluate for extraluminal contrast material, but if negative, should be followed by barium esophagography due to the higher sensitivity of barium in the detection of EP. In the authors' experience, an EP is best visualized with the patient in the left posterior oblique position.

### What is new in esophageal injury (infection, drug-induced, caustic, stricture, perforation)? [^284bb20e]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We will focus separately on infectious, drug-induced and caustic injury of the esophagus and their possible complications such as stricture and perforation. RECENT FINDINGS: There has been a decrease in opportunistic esophageal infection in HIV-positive patients, in particular candidiasis, which remains an important cause of inpatient charges, length of stay and total hospital costs, and new antifungal therapy are currently explored. As far as drug-induced esophageal injury is concerned, more than 1000 cases of all cases due to nearly 100 different medications have been described during the last 10 years. However, the estimated case frequency is probably much higher and the related literature is of low quality, as cases are reported selectively and stimulated by clustering of cases, newly implicated pills or unusual complications. Finally, in the field of caustic ingestion-related injury, there has been greater understanding of geographical differences in prevalence and more frequently involved substances, choice of optimal timing for endoscopy, relationship between symptoms and severity of lesions and appropriate role of steroids and other therapies, such as the topical application of mytomicin C. SUMMARY: This update covers the most relevant papers published on the three areas of interest during the last year.

### Boerhaave's syndrome: diagnosis and treatment [^41a3fd8d]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Boerhaave's syndrome, or postemetic rupture of the esophagus, represents one of several etiologies of esophageal perforation. Early diagnosis, which requires both a high index of suspicion and contrast esophagography, is essential for optimal outcome. Primary repair is often possible, although other techniques, such as esophageal exclusion or diversion, may be appropriate in certain circumstances.

Suspected or confirmed esophageal perforation — diagnosis and management: Pain is the most common symptom related to perforation, and if perforation is suspected, contrast esophagography should be performed, usually beginning with water-soluble contrast; if the site cannot be determined but suspicion remains high, a barium esophagram or computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest is indicated, and a CT scan with oral contrast is sensitive for the site of perforation and subtle findings; in selected patients, early recognition may allow nonoperative management with nasogastric suction, intravenous antibiotics, and parenteral nutrition, while surgical consultation should be obtained, and surgical management is recommended for larger perforations in which the pleural space is involved or for failure to respond to medical management.

### Non-iatrogenic esophageal injury: a retrospective analysis from the national trauma data bank [^2074e0d9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The management of iatrogenic and spontaneous perforations of the esophagus has well-established risk factors and treatment guidelines. In this setting, thoracic perforations are associated with poor outcomes because of the association with systemic sepsis and multi-organ failure. In contrast, small and well-contained cervical perforations are associated with better outcomes. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment have been shown to improve outcomes.

Despite its rarity, traumatic esophageal injury is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality burden. To date, only a few small series are available in the literature addressing management and outcomes with contrasting results. As a result, our current understanding of the optimal treatment for these injuries is unclear.

The purpose of this study was to examine a large contemporary experience with traumatic esophageal injury management, to compare cervical and thoracic injury, and to analyze risk factors associated with mortality.

### Diagnosis and management of acute esophageal necrosis [^8df17a4f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Prognosis

Prognosis is poor and largely depends on the severity of the esophageal disease and the patient's general state of health. AEN is associated with a high mortality rate of approximately 32%, and there are even cases resulting in sudden death, though the cause is likely to be the underlying critical illness rather than AEN. Mortality specific to AEN is approximately 6%.

General debilitation associated with the presence of multiple comorbidities and esophageal perforation are poor prognostic markers. Patients whose general condition is otherwise good are more likely to recover completely. However, it is important to emphasize that, although AEN is a serious life-threatening condition, appropriate treatment may result in a favorable outcome in over 60% of patients.

### Treatment of boerhaave syndrome: experience from a tertiary center [^b37cb13b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common cause of esophageal perforation is iatrogenic, accounting for up to 70% of esophageal perforation, followed by trauma, spontaneous, and foreign body. Boerhaave syndrome, a rare yet life-threatening medical emergency, is characterized as a spontaneous esophageal perforation. It is typically associated with severe straining or vomiting, where a sudden increase in intraesophageal pressure, combined with negative intrathoracic pressure (as in normal physiological state), leads to esophageal rupture. Boerhaave syndrome represents about 15% of esophageal perforations. Patients often present with non-specific symptoms, leading to a high incidence of initial misdiagnosis. Typically, the perforation leads to mediastinitis due to the contamination of the mediastinal cavity from gastric contents and food, thereby leading to sepsis and potential multiple organ failure and a high mortality rate that varies from 11% up to 50%. The primary objectives in the management of Boerhaave syndrome include prompt sealing of the perforation, mediastinal and pleural or abdominal drainage combined with antibiotics to control the sepsis, and nutritional support.

Treatment decisions should be based on the patient's clinical condition upon presentation, current comorbidities, and time of diagnosis. Primary surgical repair, with or without the use of reinforcement flaps, is considered the standard procedure, but it is mainly limited to patients presenting within the first 24 h since the onset of symptoms. Other options include surgical drainage, with a preference for minimally invasive techniques. Ultimately, esophageal resection can be considered. Non-surgical strategies vary from conservative management with antibiotics to endoscopically placed stents or clips. The use of self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) is well established in the palliative treatment of malignant esophageal stenosis and has emerged as an alternative treatment option for benign esophageal strictures. In addition, many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of partially or fully covered SEMS, in managing upper gastrointestinal leaks. This technique was therefore increasingly used over the past years in our center.

Due to the rarity of Boerhaave syndrome, there are currently no definitive management guidelines. The objective of this study is to share the experience of a tertiary (referral) hospital in managing patients with Boerhaave syndrome over a span of 13 years and to provide clinical guidance.

### Factors affecting the outcome of surgically treated non-iatrogenic traumatic cervical esophageal perforation: 28 years experience at a single center [^fb10cf72]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Perforation of the esophagus is a life-threatening condition. This is because the esophagus lacks a serosa and is surrounded by a loose areolar connective tissue, which is unable to prevent the spread of infection and inflammation. Traumatic injuries to the esophagus encompass a heterogeneous group of injuries that may be iatrogenic or non iatrogenic. The cause of injury is ingested foreign body in 12% and trauma in 9% of patients, while iatrogenic injury remains the most frequent cause of esophageal perforation (59%). Non-iatrogenic traumatic cervical esophageal perforation is a difficult clinical entity, and management requires a thoughtful and individualized approach. The low incidence of this particular problem leads to little clinical experience in surgeons. Thus, we reviewed our experience with non-iatrogenic traumatic esophageal perforation, paying particular attention to factors affecting morbidity and mortality in these patients.

### Management and outcomes of esophageal perforation: a national study of 2, 564 patients in england [^df0e4e35]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Traditionally esophageal perforation is a rare clinical emergency that confers a high rate of mortality and major morbidity. The objective of this study was to establish the annual rate and mortality from esophageal perforation and determine the effect of hospital volume on clinical outcomes.

Methods

Hospital Episode Statistics database was used for the identification of patients admitted to hospitals within England with esophageal perforation between 2001 and 2012. The influence of hospital volume and treatment approach upon clinical outcomes was analyzed using multivariable analysis to control for patient age and medical comorbidities that may influence outcome.

Results

Over the 12-year study period 2,564 patients with esophageal perforation were treated at 158 hospitals. The 30- and 90-day mortality rates were 30.0 and 38.8%, respectively. Esophageal perforation etiology was spontaneous in 81.9% and iatrogenic in 5.9% of cases. There was a significant increase in the percentage of patients managed supportively and a reduction in surgical management over time. Furthermore there were significant reductions in 30-day (36.6% to 24.9%; P < 0.001) and 90-day mortality (44.1% to 35.4%; P = 0.006) over the 12-year study period. Important patient demographics associated with 30- and 90-day mortality included age ≥ 70 years, preoperative congestive cardiac failure, ischemic heart, liver, and renal disease. High hospital volume was associated with significant reductions in 30- (odds ratio (OR) = 0.68; P = 0.001) and 90-day mortality (OR = 0.69; P = 0.001). In a subset analysis of patients undergoing endoscopic intervention, hospital volume was identified as an important factor associated with mortality.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence for the centralization of management of esophageal perforation to high volume centers with appropriate multi-disciplinary infrastructure to treat these complex patients.

### Esophageal injury and atrioesophageal fistula caused by ablation for atrial fibrillation [^bc327138]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on esophageal perforation:

- **Definition**: Esophageal perforation is a rare, potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a hole or tear in the esophageal wall.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of esophageal perforation involves increased intraluminal pressure or structural weakness in the esophagus leading to a rupture.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of esophageal perforation in Finland is estimated at 0.95 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: The risk factors for esophageal perforation are diverse and can be categorized into iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic causes. Iatrogenic causes include endoscopic procedures, surgical interventions, and certain medical treatments such as AF ablation and alendronate sodium therapy. Non-iatrogenic causes include foreign body ingestion, trauma, and certain conditions like esophageal carcinoma.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with esophageal perforation often present with severe chest or upper abdominal pain, dysphagia, and respiratory distress. Other symptoms may include fever, tachycardia, and signs of sepsis. In some cases, patients may develop subcutaneous emphysema or pneumomediastinum.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Despite optimal management, esophageal perforation is associated with a high mortality rate, ranging from 10% to 40%.

### Spectrum of oesophageal perforations and their influence on management [^3ee93a24]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Oesophageal perforations are associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. A spectrum of aetiologies and clinical presentations has resulted in a variety of operative and non-operative management strategies. This analysis focused on the impact of these strategies in a single specialist centre.

Methods

All patients with oesophageal perforation managed in a single oesophagogastric unit in the U.K. between January 2002 and December 2012 were identified. Gastric perforations and anastomotic leaks were excluded. Data were verified using an endoscopy database, electronic and paper records. Aetiology of perforation, management and outcomes were analysed.

Results

There were 101 adult patients with oesophageal perforation. Complete records were not available for five patients and they were excluded from the analysis. The median age was 69.5years. Thoracic perforations were present in 84 per cent of patients. There were 51 spontaneous perforations, 41 iatrogenic and four related to foreign bodies. Oesophageal malignancy was present in 11 patients. Forty-four patients were managed surgically, 47 without operation and five patients were considered unfit for active treatment. The in-hospital mortality rate for treated patients was 24 per cent and median length of hospital stay was 31.5days.

Conclusion

The management of oesophageal perforation requires specialist multidisciplinary input. It is best provided in an environment familiar with the range of treatment modalities. Management decisions should be guided primarily by the degree of contamination rather than the aetiology of the defect. The routine use of stents is unproven and controversial.

Esophageal perforation after dilation — rates and risk factors: The overall rate of esophageal perforation after dilation ranges from .09% to .79%. In a nationwide study of over 160,000 esophageal dilations, perforation occurred in .09% of patients; a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials including 461 patients showed a perforation rate of .7%; a National Inpatient Sample analysis identified a rate of .5%; and a single-center series of over 2000 bougie and balloon dilations reported a perforation rate of .5%. Potential risk factors for perforation include male sex and age ≥ 70 years, although the associations of both age and sex could be confounded by disease status.

### Management of esophageal perforations [^b3a3ea6d]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Esophageal perforations remain a life-threatening event requiring rapid diagnosis and treatment. Surgical repair and interventional endoscopic or conservative treatment are the common treatment methods.

Methods

From 1998 to 2006, the authors retrospectively analyzed 62 patients treated for esophageal perforation. Data were evaluated for cause of perforation, symptoms, therapeutic regimen, complications, and mortality.

Results

The causes of perforation were iatrogenic or suicidal (n = 33) or spontaneous (n = 29). In the first group, the causes were dilation of stenosis (n = 16), endoscopy (n = 7), transesophageal echography (n = 4), ingestion of acid or leach (n = 2), intubation (n = 2), ingestion of a foreign body (n = 1), and migration of a screw after osteosynthesis (n = 1). The spontaneous perforations were caused by tumors (n = 19), Boerhaave syndrome (n = 6), unknown origin (n = 3), and Barrett's ulcer (n = 1). The most frequent symptoms were dysphagia (n = 50), pain (n = 35), fever (n = 24), and vomiting (n = 18). At the time of perforation, 28 patients presented with cancer. Of these 28 patients, 18 had esophageal cancer. The treatment included surgery (n = 32), which consisted of double-layer suture (n = 26) or esophageal resection (n = 6). A total of 30 patients were treated interventionally with a stent (n = 21), clips (n = 1), or without further measures (n = 8). The patients in the surgery group presented with severe primary and postoperative general conditions including renal failure (25%), respiratory insufficiency (65.5%), and need for catecholamines (62.5%). This multiorgan involvement was found only occasionally in the conservative group. The overall hospital mortality rate was 14.5%, involving 9 patients (5 in the surgery group and 4 in the conservative group). Early treatment led to better survival than late treatment with a delay exceeding 24 h.

Conclusion

The treatment method still must be chosen on an individual basis. It appears that surgical treatment is necessary in cases of severe general conditions. The data from this study show that surgical repair and conservative treatment may be used successfully. The best outcome was obtained after immediate treatment.

Materials and methods

Search strategy

A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and the Cochrane Library was conducted from inception to June 2023. We screened all the available medical literature published in the English language between 2000 and 2023, to identify articles reporting on the use of stents in patients with spontaneous esophageal perforations and their related outcomes. Text words and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms were used, combined with Boolean operators (AND, OR). A detailed description of the complete search strategy is available in. A manual search of the reference lists from the selected articles was also performed.

Eligibility criteria

Key questions were formulated according to the PIO framework: "How effective are stents in sealing the perforation in patients with spontaneous esophageal perforations?" and "How effective are stents in preventing mortality and conversion to surgical treatment in patients with spontaneous esophageal perforations?". We included observational studies, prospective and retrospective, providing raw data on the efficacy of stents, in terms of sealing the perforation or treatment failure, in adult patients with benign spontaneous esophageal perforations. Additional inclusion criteria were: a) original studies including at least 3 patients with spontaneous esophageal perforation primarily treated with stent implantation; and b) articles published in the English language. Exclusion criteria were: a) review articles, case reports, letters to the editor and conference abstracts; b) reports where stent placement was not used as a primary treatment option, but rather as complimentary or secondary to other endoscopic modalities (clips, endosuturing, endoscopic vacuum therapy) or surgical attempts to restore the esophageal continuity; c) publications with mixed populations, where the outcomes of patients with spontaneous esophageal perforations were not reported; and d) full articles unavailable.

The search protocol, article selection and data extraction were assessed by 2 independent authors. Any areas of disagreement were resolved through a case-by-case discussion involving all authors.

### Endoscopic management of esophageal perforations: a multi-center study [^e891db87]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In recent years, conservative and endoscopic approaches have become popular for managing EPs. This retrospective study aimed to report our 17-year experience with this life-threatening condition across three sites, and compare different endoscopic methods and the conservative approach in the management of EP.

In our cohort, the mean age was 63.7 ± 15.3 years, which is notably higher than that reported in previous studies. A systematic review of 1,319 studies on acute esophageal perforations, encompassing 2,830 cases, found an average patient age of 58.4 years. Regarding gender, studies have consistently shown that this condition is more prevalent in males, and 65.3% of our sample were males. The most common etiology of esophageal perforation in our cohort was iatrogenic, accounting for 58.3% of cases. This is consistent with prior studies that identified iatrogenic factors as responsible for up to 59% of esophageal perforations. In our population, the most common site of perforation was the distal esophagus (67.6%). This finding aligns with some studies, though the predominant site of esophageal perforation remains a topic of debate.

Patients with EP can present with a variety of symptoms, making diagnosis challenging and requiring a high index of suspicion. Notably, a missed diagnosis that was first made at autopsy has been reported in 17% of cases. In our study population, the most common symptoms at diagnosis were dysphagia (27.8%) and chest pain (22.2%), both of which are nonspecific and can stem from a wide variety of conditions. Notably, the SIRS criteria were met at the time of presentation in 44.4% of our patients, which is considerably higher than the 23.3% reported in a systematic review of 898 patients with EP. Despite these challenges, we found that the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 0 days, and the median time from diagnosis to treatment was only 0.5 days. This prompt response is critical, as delays can significantly increase the risk of serious complications, including sepsis, mediastinitis, multiorgan failure, and even mortality.

### Management of thoracic esophageal perforation [^c8aa5959]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to characterize an optimal strategy in managing thoracic esophageal perforation, focusing on the differential diagnosis and treatment of patients with contained versus noncontained perforations and on the importance of the time interval between injury and repair and how that affects the outcome of a primary repair.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted. A strict definition of contained or noncontained perforation was based on a combination of esophagography, chest CT scan, and endoscopy as well as monitoring systemic symptoms. Management options for our cohort included conservative therapy, primary repair and debridement, esophagectomy, and mesh-covered stents. Patients were stratified into two groups according to the time interval after injury: ≤ 48-h group and > 48-h group.

Results

Between January 1997 and January 2013, a total of 66 consecutive patients (47 males and 19 females, mean age = 49.1 ± 16.2 years) were treated for thoracic esophageal perforation. Perforation was confirmed by esophagography in 51 patients and by endoscopy in 15 patients. Eighteen patients were assigned to the contained perforation group. All these patients were successfully cured without surgery. The noncontained group included 48 patients; its mortality rate was 7.7% (3/39) with surgery and 55.6% (5/9) with stent placement. Compared with the contained group, the noncontained group had a significantly longer length of stay (LOS) (16 ± 3.2 vs. 26.3 ± 18.7 days; p < 0.05) and a higher mortality rate (0 vs. 22.9%, p < 0.05). In the two time-interval groups, patient characteristics, including age, gender, and comorbidities, etiologic cause, length and location of the perforation, and the incidence of using tissue buttress were similar (p > 0.05). The incidence of postoperative leak was significantly higher in > 48-h group (0 in ≤ 48-h group vs. 37.5% in > 48-h group; p < 0.01). In addition, the > 48-h group had a significantly longer LOS (18.0 ± 9.1 days in ≤ 48-h group vs. 31.5 ± 18.6 days in > 48-h group; p < 0.01). The two deaths occurred in the > 48-h group (0 in ≤ 48-h group vs. 12.5% in > 48-h group; p > 0.05) due to postoperative leaks.

Conclusions

Contained or noncontained perforation should be rigorously differentiated. Then, for a contained perforation, conservative therapy coupled with repeated imaging is reasonable treatment. For a noncontained perforation, a primary repair can be safely performed within 48 h after injury. After that, a primary repair is still reasonable but is associated with an increased risk of postoperative leaks.

The esophagus traverses three body compartments (neck, thorax, and abdomen) and is surrounded at each level by vital organs. Injuries to the esophagus may be classified as foreign body ingestion, caustic ingestion, esophageal perforation, and esophageal trauma. These lesions can be life-threatening either by digestive contamination of surrounding structures in case of esophageal wall breach or concomitant damage of surrounding organs. Early diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention are the keys of successful management.

### Efficacy and safety of esophageal stenting for esophageal perforation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d93ead34]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Esophageal perforation, whether spontaneous or iatrogenic, is a severe condition traditionally managed by primary surgical repair. With advances in endoscopic techniques, esophageal stenting has emerged as a less invasive alternative, particularly beneficial for patients unsuitable for surgery. This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of esophageal stenting for managing esophageal perforation, evaluating 8 studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Our analysis revealed a mortality rate associated with stenting of approximately 6.7% (95%CI 3.6–9.8%), which is lower compared to earlier studies. Stent migration was observed in 16.2–22.3% of patients, showing a consistent issue but with variability in reported rates. Leakage after primary repair ranged from 8.8% (95%CI 3.0–14.6%) to 16.2% (95%CI 12.1–20.3%), indicating a persistent challenge across studies. The mean hospital stay varied from 5.0 days (D'Cunha) to 15.3 days (Law), a notable variability, but generally reflecting a trend towards longer stays compared to earlier studies.

### Efficacy of esophageal stents as a primary therapeutic option in spontaneous esophageal perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^ef009ba9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous esophageal perforation, also called barogenic rupture or Boerhaave syndrome, is a rare nosologic entity, but one with serious clinical implications. It happens as a result of abrupt distal esophageal pressurization with a closed upper esophageal sphincter, or distal esophageal spasm. The ensuing rupture is usually on the left side of the lower intrathoracic portion of the esophagus. If not promptly recognized and treated, it is often fatal, with contemporary series reporting a mortality rate between 15–42%. Traditional treatment includes urgent surgical intervention in the form of primary repair, T-tube placement, or resection and diversion, with best results accomplished when patients are operated early after the insult.

During the last 2 decades there has been increasing interest in the use of prostheses for restoration of gastrointestinal continuity, alongside resuscitation and drainage of the infected cavities. It is thought that deployment of these devices to cover the esophageal gap can lead to better patient outcomes, reducing traditional operative time and allowing for resuscitation to be optimized. A recent systematic review on esophageal stents in the management of patients with anastomotic leaks and benign perforations included 66 studies and reported technical and clinical success rates of 96% and 87%, respectively.

Nonetheless, the existing literature on the use of stents in esophageal perforations frequently analyzes patients as a single population, without distinguishing between largely unequal clinical entities. Spontaneous perforations hold some clinically relevant particularities, including their intrathoracic position, the magnitude of the inflammatory response, associated comorbidities, and late presentation or treatment of patients. Hence, aggressive surgical treatment is usually warranted, while the use of stents is commonly regarded as a palliative measure or a last-resort option. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the current evidence on the efficacy of esophageal stents, in terms of sealing the perforation, as well as treatment failure, in the subpopulation of patients with spontaneous perforations.

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^bd25ce6a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for traumatic esophageal injury, more specifically with respect to indications for non-surgical management, WSES 2019 guidelines recommend to offer non-surgical management for patients with esophageal perforation if they meet the criteria for non-surgical management:

- delay in management of < 24 h

- absence of symptoms and signs of sepsis

- cervical or thoracic location of the esophageal perforation

- contained perforation by surrounding tissues (intramural; minimal peri-esophageal extravasation of contrast material with intra-esophageal drainage; absence of massive pleural contamination)

- no preexistent esophageal disease

- possibility of close surveillance by expert esophageal team

- availability of surgical and radiological skills all day and all night.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for eosinophilic esophagitis, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, BSG/BSPGHAN 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- EoE is characterized by symptoms of dysphagia and/or food impaction in adult patients with esophageal histology showing a peak eosinophil count of ≥ 15 eosinophils/hpf, or ≥ 15 eosinophils/0.3 mm² or > 60 eosinophils/mm² in the absence of other causes of esophageal eosinophilia

- EoE responding clinically and histologically to a PPI is the same disease as EoE not responding to a PPI

- EoE and GERD are not mutually exclusive and can coexist in the same patient

- EoE is increasing in prevalence in both adults and children

- EoE is more common in males than females and in people of white ethnic origin compared with other ethnic groups

- having an affected first-degree relative increases the risk of EoE

- the incidence rises during adolescence and peaks in early adulthood

- there is seasonal variation in the symptoms of EoE in many patients, which seems to be associated with higher pollen counts

- food bolus obstruction and dysphagia are strongly associated with a diagnosis of EoE in adult patients

- EoE is the most common cause of spontaneous perforation of the esophagus and this can occur at any age.

### Early diagnosis is associated with improved clinical outcomes in benign esophageal perforation: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^3f6b2cf7]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

The main strength of this study is that we were able to use original source data. First, participating authors reviewed and shared their original data according to our pre-specified study definitions. We were able to set up a database with uniformly defined parameters without being restricted by divergent definitions used in the original studies. Furthermore, this systematic approach allowed obtaining additional unpublished data that were required for analysis of study endpoints.

Second, the data set allowed performing a multivariable analysis while correcting for the established confounders age and therapeutic approach. We further included potential confounders including gender, esophageal location, initial conservative treatment and type of treatment center. Accounting for therapeutic approach seems also important. For example, patients treated conservatively either may have minor esophageal injury or, conversely, were in a poor medical condition and unfit for surgical or endoscopic interventions, likely resulting in death shortly after presentation.

There are also some limitations that should be recognized when interpreting the findings of this study. First, data on TOD were missing in a considerable number of patients (30%). Second, after critical appraisal, we estimated that the included studies had a high risk of bias due to their observational design. The relative rarity and various clinical presentations of esophageal perforation in daily clinical practice likely explains the lack of published prospective and randomized controlled trials. Moreover, randomizing patients in the acute setting is challenging. Even by adjusting for important confounders, limitations in our retrospective data set did not allow to adjust for disease severity and co-morbidity of patients. We therefore recommend initiating nation-wide prospective registries that could generate high-level evidence on clinical management of esophageal perforation, preferably stratified by type of perforation. In addition, future research should focus on the multidimensional aspect of management of esophageal perforation rather than individual factors such as a particular treatment modality.

In conclusion, this IPD meta-analysis suggests that early diagnosis within 12 to 24 h after onset was associated with improved clinical outcome compared with a late diagnosis in patients with IEP and BS. Our findings confirm current opinion that these types of esophageal perforation are clinical emergencies that should be recognized as soon as possible.

### Efficacy of esophageal stents as a primary therapeutic option in spontaneous esophageal perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^1b748339]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Some relative contraindications exist to the use of esophageal stents. Large defects (> 6 cm), those traversing the gastroesophageal junction, or proximal cervical injuries are related to increased failure rates. In addition, patients with circumferential esophageal necrosis are not ideal candidates for placement of an esophageal stent and might therefore benefit from a surgical approach instead. Late presentation or treatment of esophageal perforations by any cause has long been considered to relate to inferior outcomes. Diagnostic delay of the condition for more than 24 hours has also been incorporated in the Pittsburgh Perforation Severity score, which has been validated as a predictor of complications in patients with spontaneous esophageal perforations. From our analysis, the odds for failing stent therapy were 1.8 times higher in late-presenting patients compared to patients with presentation and treatment in less than 24 h (OR 1.85, 95%CI 0.37–9.30), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.72). However, we only analyzed studies providing raw data on early and late-presenting patients and their related outcomes. Given the small sample size, it is possible that our study was underpowered to reveal a statistically significant correlation. Persson et al, in their 10-year retrospective study including 40 patients receiving stent treatment, the majority of whom suffered from spontaneous perforations, identified the time elapsed between perforation and stent placement as the only significant predictor of clinical failure. However, other authors consider stent placement in their practice, irrespective of the duration of the perforation.

A possible caveat of stent therapy is the high rates of endoscopic and surgical reinterventions reported by other authors. In our study, 39% of patients needed supplementary surgical reinterventions, because of undrained pleural effusions or empyemas. Drainage procedures varied from percutaneous chest tube insertion to thoracoscopic or open debridement, decortication and drainage. Moreover, 27% of patients needed at least a second endoscopic reintervention, usually for ongoing leakage or migration. Stent migration appears to be a common problem in benign distal perforations, possibly due to the lack of a stricture or significant stenosis. Plastic and fully covered self-expandable metal stents are also at greater risk for stent migration. This condition requires repeat endoscopy in an effort to re-establish right positioning. Depending on the unit's preferences, clipping or suturing the stent in place may be an additional step during the initial endoscopy.

### Esophageal perforation in adults: aggressive, conservative treatment lowers morbidity and mortality [^21280973]. Annals of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the outcome of aggressive conservative therapy in patients with esophageal perforation.

Summary Background Data

The treatment of esophageal perforation remains controversial with a bias toward early primary repair, resection, and/or proximal diversion. This review evaluates an alternate approach with a bias toward aggressive drainage of fluid collections and frequent CT and gastographin UGI examinations to evaluate progress.

Methods

From 1992 to 2004, 47 patients with esophageal perforation (10 proximal, 37 thoracic) were treated (18 patients early [< 24 hours], 29 late). There were 31 male and 16 females (ages 18–90 years). The etiology was iatrogenic (25), spontaneous (14), trauma (3), dissecting thoracic aneurysm (3), and 1 each following a Stretta procedure and Blakemore tube placement.

Results

Six of 10 cervical perforations underwent surgery (3 primary repair, 3 abscess drainage). Nine of 10 perforations healed at discharge. In 37 thoracic perforations, 2 underwent primary repair (1 iatrogenic, 1 spontaneous) and 4 underwent limited thoracotomy. Thirty-4 patients (4 cervical, 28 thoracic) underwent nonoperative treatment. Thirteen of the 14 patients with spontaneous perforation (thoracic) underwent initial nonoperative care. Overall mortality was 4.2% (2 of 47 patients). These deaths represent 2 of 37 thoracic perforations (5.4%). There were no deaths in the 34 patients treated nonoperatively. Esophageal healing occurred in 43 of 45 surviving patients (96%). Subsequent operations included colon interposition in 2, esophagectomy for malignancy in 3, and esophagectomy for benign stricture in 2.

Conclusions

Aggressive treatment of sepsis and control of esophageal leaks leak lowers mortality and morbidity, allow esophageal healing, and avoid major surgery in most patients.

### Foreign body esophageal perforation leading to multifocal brain abscesses: a case report [^7d72192d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Among those aged 5 years or younger, foreign bodies are the fourth most common pediatric exposure reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers. Although the majority of ingested foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract without complication, those that do not spontaneously pass can lead to a number of serious complications, such as gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation, which can be complicated by bleeding from aortoesophageal fistula, secondary mediastinitis, peritonitis, esophageal or gastrointestinal fistula formation, and abscesses.

Case Report

We present the case of a 10-month-old child who presented with new-onset focal seizure in the setting of multiple brain abscesses, ultimately found to be due to esophageal perforation from a retained, metallic esophageal foreign body. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Foreign bodies that are retained for longer than 24 h after ingestion have been associated with a higher risk of complications because they are less likely to pass spontaneously through the gastrointestinal tract. Early identification and removal of foreign bodies is necessary to prevent subsequent complications. In patients who have a subacute history of cough, gagging, vomiting, and decreased oral intake with an otherwise unknown cause, foreign-body ingestion or aspiration should be considered. In addition, central nervous system abscess and infection should be considered in patients with concerns about previous foreign body ingestion or aspiration and who are newly presenting with fever, focal neurologic changes, and irritability.

### Esophageal perforation caused by external air-blast injury [^0a462b1d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Esophageal perforation after external air-blast trauma is rarely presented in the emergency room. The diagnosis is often delayed more than 24 hours.

Methods

We review the literature and report a case of esophageal perforation caused by external air-blast injury.

Results

Including the present case, a total of 5 cases of esophageal perforation were caused by external air-blast injury in English literature. Of them, the common presentations were chest pain and dyspnea. The treatment methods varied with each case. One patient died before diagnosis of esophageal perforation and the others survived after proper surgical management.

Conclusions

Early diagnosis and proper surgical management can reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients who suffered from esophageal perforation caused by external air-blast injury.

Traumatic esophageal injuries occur less than 10% of the time in the setting of blunt or penetrating trauma. The purpose of this literature review is to provide an update on the most recent changes involving the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal injuries. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, to identify articles written in English language with the terms "non- iatrogenic", "esophageal", "trauma", "diagnosis", "management", and "prognosis". Case reports and articles involving non-traumatic esophageal perforations were excluded. Fifty pertinent articles in English language from 1947 to 2015 were selected for review. Based on the review of all articles, we designed a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm to facilitate the diagnosis and management of the traumatic esophageal injury.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic management of perforations in gastrointestinal tract: expert review [^7ac2ae71]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Esophageal perforations — etiology and higher-risk procedures include eosinophilic esophagitis and several endoscopic interventions. In a retrospective study over a 14-year period, Ruge et al reported 10 perforations (2.0%) in 511 patients with eosinophilic esophagitis; a history of food impaction (odds ratio, 14.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.7–129.2) and presence of a focal stricture (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–19.7) were identified as risk factors associated with perforation; 4 of the 10 patients underwent surgical repair. In a systematic review of eosinophilic esophagitis, there were 76 perforations in 70 patients reported in 41 articles and 9 abstracts; perforation followed pushing impacted food in 5 and esophageal dilation in 8, with 25 of the 76 patients requiring surgical intervention, an esophageal stent placed in 10, and endoscopic clips used in 2. Procedure-related risks include esophageal dilation for simple rings or peptic strictures (0.09%–2.2%), higher with pneumatic dilation for achalasia (0.4%–14%), EMR in Barrett's esophagus between 0% and 3%, and after POEM delayed barrier failure/leak between 0.2% and 1.1%.

### Spotlight on esophageal perforation: a multinational study using the Pittsburgh esophageal perforation severity scoring system [^7515d71b]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The Pittsburgh group has suggested a perforation severity score (PSS) for better decision making in the management of esophageal perforation. Our study aim was to determine whether the PSS can be used to stratify patients with esophageal perforation into distinct subgroups with differential outcomes in an independent study population.

Methods

In a retrospective study cases of esophageal perforation were collected (study-period, 1990–2014). The PSS was analyzed using logistic regression as a continuous variable and stratified into low, intermediate, and high score groups.

Results

Data for 288 patients (mean age, 59.9 years) presenting with esophageal perforation (during the period 1990–2014) were abstracted. Etiology was spontaneous (Boerhaave; n = 119), iatrogenic (instrumentation; n = 85), and traumatic perforation (n = 84). Forty-three patients had coexisting esophageal cancer. The mean PSS was 5.82, and was significantly higher in patients with fatal outcome (n = 57; 19.8%; mean PSS, 9.79 vs 4.84; P < .001). Mean PSS was also significantly higher in patients receiving operative management (n = 200; 69%; mean PSS, 6.44 vs 4.40; P < .001). Using the Pittsburgh strata, patients were assigned to low PSS (≤ 2; n = 63), intermediate PSS (3–5; n = 86), and high PSS (> 5; n = 120) groups. Perforation-related morbidity, length of stay, frequency of operative treatment, and mortality increased with increasing PSS strata. Patients with high PSS were 3.37 times more likely to have operative management compared with low PSS.

Conclusions

The Pittsburgh PSS reliably reflects the seriousness of esophageal perforation and stratifies patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups with differential morbidity and mortality outcomes.

Oesophageal perforations

Oesophageal perforation represents a rare but life-threatening condition. Overall mortality approaches 13.3% but rises significantly after 24 h from symptom onset.

Most patients present with significant distress accompanied by non-specific symptomatology which comprises sudden-onset pain, fever, dysphagia, dyspnea, hoarseness, dysphonia and subcutaneous emphysema in various combinations.

CT findings include oesophageal wall thickening, mural gas, mural defect(s), mediastinal or cervical fat stranding, free gas/contrast/fluid in the mediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, pleural effusion and foreign bodies. In cases of complicated tumours or strictures, an oesophago-respiratory fistula, lung abscess or recurrent aspiration pneumonia may develop. Lower oesophageal perforations may result in extraluminal gas that dissects inferiorly into the abdomen and can mimic gastric perforation.

The most frequent causes of oesophageal perforation are iatrogenic, followed by spontaneous rupture, foreign body ingestion, trauma, tumour and less commonly caustic ingestion, pill oesophagitis, and infectious ulcers in patients with AIDS.

Iatrogenic manipulations constitute the leading cause of oesophageal perforation (Fig. 1). The risk of oesophageal injury is highest with rigid endoscopies (0.11%), escalating up to 10–15% with the addition of treatment manipulations, such as stricture dilatation and stent placement. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) carries low perforation rates (0.03–0.3%); the oesophagus is the most common associated perforation site, affected in approximately half of perforations.

### Esophageal perforation caused by external air-blast injury [^2c45b086]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Esophageal perforation caused by air-blast injury is uncommon. An external air impact on the chest wall and upper abdomen, inducing rupture of the esophagus, is an even rare event. Only four cases of esophageal rupture caused by an external air-blast injury were found in a perusal of the English literature. The objective of this article is to report our patient and a review of the literature to establish diagnostic and treatment strategies for esophageal perforation after an external air-blast injury.

Traumatic esophageal perforation

Due to its posterior and relatively protected location, direct injury to the esophagus is rare but results in great morbidity from associated synchronous airway, aortic, or spinal injuries. In the neck, however, the cervical esophagus and upper thoracic esophagus can be particularly susceptible to penetrating trauma. Although fluoroscopy is the most sensitive study for EP, CT is often the first line of imaging in the emergent setting. Since the esophagus is usually collapsed, the role of CT is to assess for the secondary findings of EP including pneumomediastinum, posterior mediastinal hematoma, and pleural effusion (Fig. 2 e). The presence of multiple of these supporting findings in conjunction with esophageal wall thickening, extraluminal contrast material, or focal wall defect should lead to a high index of suspicion for traumatic EP. A potential pitfall for misdiagnosis of EP in the setting of trauma is the Macklin effect, which also demonstrates pneumomediastinum, but develops secondary to increased intrathoracic pressure from alveolar rupture. Air subsequently dissects along the peribronchovascular interstitial sheaths, interlobular septa, and into the mediastinum (Fig. 3). However, the Macklin effect is not associated with pleural effusion or the reactive changes associated with esophageal wall perforation.

While this mimics EP, there is a lack of inflammatory changes and hydropneumothorax commonly associated with esophageal perforation

What are the most appropriate surgical procedures?

The surgical approach depends on the location of FB impaction, patient comorbidities, and patient condition (Grade 1B). Minimally invasive techniques should be considered first-line treatment in referral centers (Grade 1C). Esophagotomy with FB extraction and primary closure should be considered in case of limited pleural/mediastinal contamination and vital edges (Grade 1C). Different surgical approaches may be used according to FB location and patient comorbidities (left cervicotomy, right/left thoracotomy, minimally invasive right/left thoracoscopy, prone thoracoscopy, laparoscopy, and laparotomy). Open or minimally invasive esophagotomy with primary repair can be used in cases of limited mediastinal contamination and vital edges of the perforation. Rescue esophagectomy with primary or delayed reconstruction should be considered in case of extensive contamination.

Corrosive ingestion

Corrosive ingestion is a rare but potentially devastating event that can result in patient death. In survivors, it is responsible for swallowing troubles, impaired quality of life, and significant burdens on health systems. The real incidence is currently unknown as the ingestion of corrosive agents is probably largely underreported around the world. In children, ingestion is mostly accidental and severe injuries are rare. Massive suicidal ingestion of strong corrosive agents occurs usually in adults suffering psychiatric disease and requires aggressive emergency management. It is commonly accepted that clinical symptoms do not correlate reliably with the extent of gastrointestinal damage; the absence of pain and of oral lesions does not rule out life-threatening gastrointestinal injuries. Appropriate management of corrosive injuries in the emergency setting affects patients' outcomes.

### The role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of dysphagia [^b4f9f26f]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Endoscopy for dysphagia — perforation after esophageal dilation is described and managed as follows: Perforation after esophageal dilation can be intraabdominal or intrathoracic at the site of the stricture. This adverse event should be suspected if a patient develops severe or persistent chest or abdominal pain, dyspnea, tachycardia, or fevers after dilation. The physical examination may reveal subcutaneous crepitus of the chest or cervical region. Although a chest radiograph may indicate a perforation, a normal study result does not exclude it, and a water-soluble contrast esophagram or contrast-enhanced computed tomogram of the chest may be necessary to confirm this adverse event. The use of large-diameter covered metal stents and expandable, retrievable plastic stents has been effective in the management of perforation after dilation of benign and malignant strictures.

Quality assessment and certainty of evidence

Methodological quality for the selected studies was evaluated by 2 independent authors, using the methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS). A list of 8 items in the case of non-comparative studies, and 12 items in comparative studies, were scored from 0–2. The cumulative score provided an overall estimate of the quality of the individual study. The certainty of the provided evidence was qualitatively evaluated, taking into consideration the risk of bias from the included studies, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness and possible publication bias.

This review was reported according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The study was registered in the Research Registry (UIN reviewregistry 1655).

Discussion

The incidence of esophageal perforation caused by blast trauma is estimated to be 0.004%-0.01%. The most commonly reported mechanism of injury is high-pressure air directed into the esophagus via the mouth. An external air-blast contusion on the anterior chest and abdomen that induces rupture of the esophagus, as showed in Table 1, is even rare. The esophagus was predominately ruptured in the lower third (3/5 patients). External blast injury is caused by an impact on the anterior chest and upper abdomen that forms a shock wave in the body. The force is then predominantly conducted to the air-containing (hollow) organs, including the stomach. Esophageal perforation can then occur from the sudden impact of the stomach gas.

The diagnosis of esophageal perforation is relatively difficult when the perforation site is located in the lower thoracic region. The most common symptoms are chest pain and dyspnea, which are not specific for esophageal rupture. Pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax are the most common findings in patients suffering from lower esophageal perforation. An esophagogram should be considered for patients suffering from external air-blast injury who presented symptoms of chest pain, dyspnea or subcutaneous emphysema.

A diagnosis of thoracic esophageal perforation delayed for more than 24 hours could result in high morbidity and mortality rates. Surgical procedures include simple drainage, primary repair, esophageal exclusion with gastrostomy or jejunostomy, and esophagectomy followed by esophageal reconstruction. Primary repair is the most common procedure for blast-induced esophageal perforation. Guth et al. performed primary repair, with gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy for early enteral nutrition support, when esophageal perforation was diagnosed within 24 hours. Although the successful primary repair of an esophageal perforation has been reported even after the diagnosis had been delayed for more than 72 hours, leakage and mediastinal infection are common after the procedure. We performed a primary repair 84 hours after the injury, which was unsuccessful, so a subsequent transhiatal esophagectomy with a retrosternal ileocolon reconstruction was performed.

### Adverse events associated with EGD and EGD-related techniques [^e3fa0459]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2022). High credibility.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for foreign body or obstruction — perforation risk — varies by site and procedural factors. Perforation risk appears highest in the esophagus, with retrospective studies reporting rates from .4% to 3.3%. Risk factors include increasing time to endoscopy; although optimal timing is not established, EGD within 24 hours of presentation should be considered when the site of the bolus is suspected to be esophageal. Additional factors are larger (≥ 3 cm) foreign body size, presence of an ingested bone, and use of an endoscopic instrument to retrieve or extract a bolus; an overtube can very rarely cause perforation at the hypopharynx, cricopharyngeus, or esophagus.

### Management of hypopharyngeal and esophageal perforations in children: three case reports and a review of the literature [^1eacd5a1]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

We report 2 cases of pediatric hypopharyngeal perforation that occurred during endoscopy and 1 case of esophageal perforation that developed during nasogastric tube insertion at a tertiary care academic medical center. These cases were identified during a retrospective chart review. All 3 patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics and nasogastric tube feedings, and none experienced further sequelae. Perforations of the hypopharynx and esophagus in children during endoscopy or insertion of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes are not uncommon. Many affected children can be managed conservatively without surgical drainage, depending on the cause and specific location of the perforation and the timing of the diagnosis. We discuss the clinical criteria for various management options, and we offer an algorithm that outlines important clinical considerations in the decision-making process. Our aim in presenting these cases is to increase awa reness of the management options for children with hypopharyngeal and esophageal perforations and to demonstrate the effectiveness of nonsurgical management in selected cases.

Methods

For the purpose of the paper, we used an etiological classification of esophageal injuries: (1) foreign body ingestion, (2) caustic ingestion, (3) esophageal perforations (iatrogenic and spontaneous), and (4) esophageal trauma. Leading specialists in the field were asked to perform a thorough MEDLINE and EMBASE search for relevant papers on each of these topics between 1985 and June 2018. They were asked to focus their search in order to provide evidence-based answers to pertinent questions with immediate practical application. Topics were presented and open to discussion at the 5th WSES congress in Bertinoro, Italy, 28th–30th June, 2018. The level of evidence for each recommendation statement was assigned by using the grading system proposed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

Eventually, evidence-based guidelines for the management of EI were developed to outline clinical recommendations.

Foreign body ingestion

In the USA, esophageal foreign body (FB) ingestion accounts for more than 100,000 cases per year. In children, accidental ingestion of coins, batteries, toys, and magnets is common. Accidental ingestions also occur in adults often in association with intoxication or in the elderly with cognitive impairment; intentional ingestion by patients with psychiatric disorders or by prisoners is not infrequent. Esophageal FB impaction depends on the size and shape of the FB. Impaction usually occurs at the level of the hypopharynx or in the upper thoracic esophagus for anatomical (cricopharyngeus, aortic arch) and physiological reasons (low pressure zone at the transition point between striated and smooth muscle fibers). Non-impaired adults and older children can typically identify foreign body ingestion and may point to a specific area of discomfort. However, children and mentally impaired adults may not give a history of foreign body ingestion. The typical clinical presentation is the acute onset of dysphagia or inability to swallow saliva. Other related clinical features are odynophagia, neck tenderness, retrosternal pain, sore throat, foreign body sensation, retching, vomiting, and drooling. Choking, stridor, and dyspnea may be present in patients with airway obstruction or aspiration. Physical examination findings include the presence of fever, cervical subcutaneous emphysema or erythema and tenderness in the event of complications.

### Life-threatening esophageal perforation due to blister pack ingestion [^10612ab7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Most ingested foreign bodies do not cause serious complications. In rare cases, elderly people with cognitive decline may unintentionally swallow a blister pack while trying to take medicine. When a blister pack is separated into individual parts, the separated parts have sharp edges that can cause serious damage if ingested. We report a case of an elderly patient who unintentionally ingested a blister pack, which led to esophageal perforation and ultimately his death.
