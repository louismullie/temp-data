when should i do hcv pcr quant while treating it

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to perform HCV RNA PCR quantification during treatment and how to structure pre-treatment, on-treatment, and post-treatment testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline pre-treatment assessment. Then, I should verify whether on-treatment monitoring is required or optional in the DAA era. Next, I will confirm the timing and purpose of the post-treatment test of cure. Finally, I need to consider special populations, assay selection, and how to interpret results and define cure, anchoring this to current AASLD/IDSA and WHO guidance.

> Let me first confirm the baseline requirement. Before starting any antiviral therapy, I need a quantitative HCV RNA to document baseline viremia and to support regimen selection and duration decisions. This is explicitly recommended by AASLD/IDSA and WHO, and it remains standard even in simplified pathways, so I should not skip it [^111QEAcp] [^113pPSc8] [^115XwgBm].

> Wait, let me verify the on-treatment monitoring question because practice varies. In the interferon era, we used week 4 and week 12 HCV RNA to define RVR and EVR and to apply stopping rules. That historical framework still informs older protocols, but with modern pangenotypic DAAs, routine on-treatment HCV RNA checks are generally not required for most patients unless there are adherence concerns, complex comorbidities, or payer requirements, so I should avoid reflex on-treatment PCR in straightforward cases [^1144bWL8] [^113aXsRo] [^113xXbrV]. Hold on, I should double-check special settings: transplant programs and some payer policies may request week 4 RNA to document adherence before dispensing additional medication, so I need to align with local pathways and payer rules while minimizing unnecessary testing [^113xXbrV] [^114WX8oH].

> I need to ensure I anchor the post-treatment timing correctly. The test of cure should be a quantitative HCV RNA obtained at least 12 weeks after completing therapy. Undetectable RNA at this timepoint defines SVR12 and virologic cure, and this is the minimum standard across AASLD/IDSA and WHO guidance, so I should not shorten this interval [^117WERaX] [^114UCUfw] [^111FkYXg]. But wait, what if I am concerned about very low-level viremia or late relapse? Some clinicians obtain an additional RNA at 24 weeks; while not mandated, it can detect rare late relapses and may be reasonable in select patients, though the absolute risk is very low in contemporary cohorts [^116kvUaq].

> Next, I should review special populations and scenarios. For persons with HIV/HCV coinfection, simplified DAA pathways still apply, and routine on-treatment RNA is not required. However, I should confirm SVR12 with RNA testing and maintain annual RNA screening if ongoing risk behaviors persist, which aligns with HIV-focused guidance [^113xXbrV]. For transplant recipients, especially those with donor-derived HCV, more intensive early RNA monitoring is appropriate given the risk of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Weekly PCR for 4 weeks after exposure is reasonable until viremia is detected and therapy initiated, reflecting transplant-specific consensus [^111RT55c] [^114WX8oH]. For children, pediatric guidance suggests quantitative RNA every 4 weeks during treatment and at 12 weeks and 12 months post-treatment. I should follow those pediatric schedules when treating adolescents and younger children [^116JPiVY].

> I will now examine assay selection because it matters for interpretation. I should use the same quantitative assay throughout the patient's course to minimize inter-assay variability, and I should prefer assays with high sensitivity, ideally a lower limit of detection around 10–15 IU/mL and a lower limit of quantification ≤ 25 IU/mL, to confidently call undetectable at SVR12 and to detect low-level viremia if present [^1144bWL8] [^114PunTa] [^114ydQNe]. Hold on, I should verify that this sensitivity threshold aligns with real-world failure distributions; recent analyses suggest that most treatment failures at SVR12 have RNA levels above 1000 IU/mL, supporting the adequacy of modern assays with LLOD ≤ 25 IU/mL for test-of-cure, though rare lower-level failures can occur [^111rYLx9].

> Let me think about how to interpret results and define cure. Undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after therapy completion equals SVR12 and is considered virologic cure; if RNA is detectable, I should distinguish reinfection from relapse by timing, risk, and, if needed, resistance testing before retreatment, and I should manage suspected treatment failure through specialist pathways rather than ad hoc adjustments [^114UCUfw] [^111S8Uz4]. I should confirm that patients with ongoing risk are counseled and tested annually for reinfection, since recurrence after SVR is most often due to new infection rather than late relapse in the DAA era [^114UCUfw].

> Putting this together, my final, practical schedule is as follows: obtain a baseline quantitative HCV RNA before starting therapy. Avoid routine on-treatment RNA checks for most patients on pangenotypic DAAs unless adherence is uncertain or payer/policy mandates. And perform a definitive test of cure with quantitative HCV RNA at 12 weeks after therapy completion, extending to 24 weeks selectively if clinical suspicion for late relapse is higher. Throughout, use the same sensitive assay and tailor intensity for special populations like transplant recipients, persons with HIV, and children [^1155Ak4A] [^113aXsRo] [^117WERaX] [^111FkYXg].

Order HCV RNA PCR quantification at **baseline** to confirm active infection and establish pretreatment viral load [^112fLM8J] [^113pPSc8]. During treatment, **routine on-treatment PCR is not required** for most DAA regimens because of high efficacy and low failure rates [^113aXsRo]; consider on-treatment testing only if adherence is uncertain, in complex cases, or if the regimen includes interferon-based therapy [^113aXsRo] [^116mKB5P]. Always perform a **test of cure at 12 weeks** after completing therapy to confirm sustained virologic response (SVR12) [^117WERaX] [^111FkYXg]. If SVR12 is not achieved, repeat HCV RNA testing and refer for specialist evaluation and retreatment planning [^114UCUfw].

---

## Baseline HCV RNA PCR quantification

Baseline HCV RNA PCR quantification is **essential** to confirm active infection and establish the pretreatment viral load [^112fLM8J] [^113pPSc8]. This baseline value informs treatment selection, duration, and serves as a reference for monitoring treatment response [^1144bWL8].

- **Timing**: Obtain baseline HCV RNA PCR quantification before initiating antiviral therapy [^111QEAcp].
- **Clinical utility**: Baseline viral load provides prognostic information regarding the likelihood of treatment response and helps guide regimen selection and duration [^1144bWL8] [^113pPSc8].

---

## On-treatment HCV RNA PCR quantification

Routine on-treatment HCV RNA PCR quantification is **generally not required** for most direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens due to their high efficacy and low failure rates [^113aXsRo]. However, in certain clinical scenarios, on-treatment monitoring may be considered:

- **Adherence concerns**: If there are concerns about patient adherence or potential drug interactions, on-treatment HCV RNA PCR quantification may be performed to assess virologic response [^114PunTa].
- **Complex clinical scenarios**: In patients with advanced liver disease, prior treatment failure, or other complicating factors, on-treatment monitoring may be considered to ensure virologic suppression [^114WX8oH].
- **Interferon-based regimens**: For interferon-based therapies, on-treatment monitoring at week 4 (rapid virologic response, RVR) and week 12 (early virologic response, EVR) is recommended to guide treatment duration and discontinuation decisions [^1144bWL8] [^113GwoDB].

---

## Post-treatment HCV RNA PCR quantification (test of cure)

Post-treatment HCV RNA PCR quantification is **critical** to confirm sustained virologic response (SVR), which indicates virologic cure [^117WERaX]. The standard timepoint for this assessment is 12 weeks after completion of therapy (SVR12) [^114UCUfw].

- **Timing**: Perform HCV RNA PCR quantification at 12 weeks after completing antiviral therapy [^117WERaX] [^111FkYXg].
- **Clinical significance**: SVR12 is defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks post-treatment and is considered virologic cure [^114UCUfw].
- **Follow-up**: If SVR12 is not achieved, repeat HCV RNA testing and refer the patient for specialist evaluation and retreatment planning [^114UCUfw].

---

## Timing of HCV RNA PCR quantification

| **Phase** | **Timing** | **Clinical indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Baseline | Before initiating therapy | Confirm active infection; establish pretreatment viral load [^112fLM8J] [^113pPSc8] |
| On-treatment | - Generally not required <br/> - Consider if adherence concerns or complex clinical scenarios | - Assess virologic response <br/> - Guide treatment decisions [^113aXsRo] |
| Post-treatment | 12 weeks after completing therapy | Confirm SVR (virologic cure) [^117WERaX] [^111FkYXg] |

---

## Clinical implications of delayed or omitted HCV RNA PCR quantification

Delayed or omitted HCV RNA PCR quantification can have **significant clinical consequences**:

- **Delayed SVR confirmation**: Postponing SVR12 testing delays confirmation of cure and may prolong anxiety or uncertainty for patients.
- **Missed virologic failure**: Failure to perform SVR12 testing may result in missed virologic failure, delaying necessary retreatment and increasing the risk of disease progression [^117Tx6ik].
- **Increased risk of transmission**: Uncertainty regarding cure status may lead to continued risk behaviors and potential transmission of HCV.

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) emphasize the **importance of baseline and post-treatment HCV RNA PCR quantification**, while allowing flexibility regarding on-treatment monitoring based on clinical judgment and patient-specific factors [^112fLM8J] [^113aXsRo].

---

HCV RNA PCR quantification is essential at baseline and at 12 weeks post-treatment to confirm SVR; routine on-treatment monitoring is **generally unnecessary** with DAAs but may be considered in select scenarios.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases have collaboratively developed evidence-based guidance regarding the diagnosis, management, and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection since 2013. A panel of clinicians and investigators with extensive infectious diseases or hepatology expertise specific to HCV infection periodically review evidence from the field and update existing recommendations or introduce new recommendations as evidence warrants. This update focuses on changes to the guidance since the previous 2020 published update, including ongoing emphasis on recommended universal screening; management recommendations for incomplete treatment adherence; expanded eligibility for simplified chronic HCV infection treatment in adults with minimal monitoring; updated treatment and retreatment recommendations for children as young as 3 years old; management and treatment recommendations in the transplantation setting; and screening, treatment, and management recommendations for unique and key populations.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^113qm2ZT]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV — Interpretation of blood tests notes that the HCV antibody test may be negative during the first 6 weeks after exposure, seroconversion may be delayed or absent in immunosuppressed individuals, and presence of HCV antibody alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; HCV RNA may be transiently negative during acute HCV infection and presence of HCV RNA alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; and ALT findings include that fluctuating ALT peaks suggest acute infection, ALT may be normal during acute HCV infection, and ALT may be elevated due to other liver insults, such as alcohol consumption. If HCV antibody is positive but HCV RNA is undetectable, repeat HCV-RNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing is recommended to identify acute reinfection. Acute infection should be suspected if there is a rise in the ALT level without an alternative cause and also when there are low (especially < 10⁴ IU/mL) or fluctuating (> 1 log10 IU/mL) HCV-RNA levels or spontaneous clearance during follow-up.

### Updated operational guidance for implementing CDC's recommendations on testing for hepatitis C virus infection [^115DX1Qv]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Current hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing guidance recommends a two-step testing sequence for diagnosis of HCV infection. Performing an HCV RNA test whenever an HCV antibody test is reactive (complete testing) is critical to achieve national HCV elimination goals. When an HCV antibody test is reactive and no HCV RNA test is performed, testing is considered incomplete. Historically, approximately one third of patients have incomplete testing. This update clarifies that all sites performing HCV screening should ensure single-visit sample collection. This approach allows for automatic HCV RNA testing when an HCV antibody test is reactive to avoid incomplete testing. Use of strategies that require multiple visits to collect HCV testing samples should be discontinued. Automatic HCV RNA testing on all HCV antibody reactive samples will increase the percentage of patients with current HCV infection who are linked to care and receive curative antiviral therapy.

Key points
- Hepatitis C can be cured in more than 95% of cases with just 8–12 weeks of well-tolerated oral-only treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents.
- Curative DAA treatment is recommended for essentially everyone with hepatitis C.
- Clinicians can mitigate risk for advanced liver disease progressing with lifestyle counseling, co-infection monitoring, and recommendations for vaccination against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Treatment options The use of ribavirin with interferon or peginterferon is no longer recommended due to poor efficacy and high rate of adverse effects with the regimen. DAA therapy is better tolerated and more effective and has a shorter duration. There are 3 types of later, next-generation DAA therapies for non-pregnant adults and children over age 3:
- Protease inhibitors
- Nucleoside analog polymerase inhibitors
- Nonstructural protein 5A inhibitors Many agents have antiviral activity against all genotypes.

Available therapies can cure more than 95% of people infected with HCV within 8–12 weeks of therapy. Learn more about oral therapy options from the University of Washington Infectious Disease Education & Assessment program. Treatment recommendations Except for pregnant patients and children under 3, clinicians should treat people with detectable HCV RNA in their blood with oral DAA therapy. There is no need to wait for potential spontaneous viral resolution. Clinicians should also:

- Conduct a full medical evaluation for chronic liver disease.
- Conduct a risk assessment and testing for HBV and HIV.
- Vaccinate against hepatitis A and hepatitis B as recommended. For more information about management of people diagnosed with acute or chronic HCV infection, see the HCV Guidance: Recommendations for Testing, Managing, and Treating Hepatitis C from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Treatment precautions DAA therapies are not approved for pregnant patients and children under 3. There are efforts underway to develop prenatal treatment options and/or infant antiviral postexposure prophylaxis to prevent perinatal transmission. Hepatitis B virus reactivation risk Some co-infected patients receiving DAA therapy for HCV infection have reported reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection. Therefore, clinicians should test all patients starting HCV DAA therapy for HBV infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following tests:

- hepatitis B surface antigen
- antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen
- total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen Clinicians should monitor people who test positive for HBsAg or for an isolated positive anti-HBc for reactivation of HBV infection while they are receiving treatment. Learn more about treating HBV/HCV co-infected patients from the AASLD and IDSA.

For more information on HBV reactivation, visit the American Gastroenterological Association. Helping patients stay well Your patient is considered cured of hepatitis C if there is no detectable HCV RNA after 12 weeks of treatment. This indicates they have had a sustained virologic response to therapy. To help your patient stay well, you should also talk to them about:

- Maintaining a healthy diet and active lifestyle.
- Avoiding excessive alcohol intake.
- Checking with a provider before taking new prescription pills, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements. You should remind patients of proper practices to avoid HCV transmission while on treatment and to avoid reinfection after successfully completing treatment, like.
- Avoiding activities that can lead to transmission, like sharing injection drug use equipment.
- Avoiding blood, tissue, and semen donation.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2023 update: AASLD-IDSA recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^114ZYqxm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

AASLD-IDSA hepatitis C guidance — acute HCV infection reiterates the recommendation that persons with confirmed acute HCV infection (HCV RNA–positive) should be treated the same as those with chronic HCV infection without awaiting possible spontaneous clearance (ie, a test-and-treat approach), noting that the incidence of acute hepatitis C in the United States increased 124% from 2013 through 2020 and that treatment of this key population is critical to both HCV prevention and elimination.

### Performance of the new aptima HCV quant Dx assay in comparison to the cobas taqMan HCV2 test for use with the high pure system in detection and quantification of hepatitis C virus RNA in plasma or serum [^116LRrgx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

These findings suggest that Aptima has a greater analytical sensitivity (LOD). Thus, although the HPS/CTM assay can be considered a reference test for quantitating HCV RNA in patients' clinical samples during DAA treatment, we question whether it truly meets the requirement of the recent guidelines (LLOQ of ≤ 25 IU/ml) for use in monitoring treatment. With an LLOQ well below 25 IU/ml (10 IU/ml), the Aptima assay offers a more adequate LLOQ. Some studies following longitudinal cohorts of patients have observed that monitoring with a more sensitive assay may be more predictive of long-term clinical outcomes and relapse.

Sensitivity, precision, and accuracy are important characteristics to consider when choosing an assay to monitor patients during treatment, since only a single measurement is used to predict whether treatment is effective (i.e. the patient has achieved SVR). We show herein that Aptima is a highly sensitive, accurate, and reproducible assay, with performance equal or superior to that of HPS/CTM. Thus, Aptima can be recommended for the quantitation of HCV RNA in clinical samples of HCV-infected patients to monitor treatment efficacy in regions where it is currently approved for that purpose.

Qualitative and quantitative HCV RNA — test selection, interpretation, and timing are described as follows: FDA‑approved qualitative and quantitative HCV RNA tests are summarized, with quantitative tests now recommended for diagnosis in patients with positive anti–HCV antibody tests; if both antibody and HCV RNA tests are positive the result indicates acute or chronic HCV infection depending on context, if antibody is positive and HCV RNA negative this indicates resolution of infection or acute hepatitis C (AHC) during low‑level viremia, if antibody is negative and HCV RNA positive possibilities include early AHC, chronic infection in an immunocompromised state, or a false‑positive RNA, and if HCV RNA is negative and remains negative when repeated in 6 months the individual does not have chronic HCV infection; HCV RNA can be detected as early as 1 to 2 weeks after exposure and before antibody tests or liver enzyme elevations.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute clinical practice update-expert review: care of patients who have achieved a sustained virologic response after antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection [^116kvUaq]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

AGA Institute Clinical Practice Update — post-SVR virologic testing and relapse evidence states that SVR should be confirmed by undetectable HCV RNA at 12 wk after completion of an all-oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen, with undetectable defined on a polymerase chain reaction assay with lower limit of detection < 12 IU/mL. In a series of 1054 patients who achieved SVR12 after paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir and dasabuvir, 5 (0.5%) had subsequent virologic failure, comprising relapse in 4 patients (3 by post-treatment week 24 and 1 by post-treatment week 48) and reinfection in 1 patient; in another study of 3004 patients receiving a sofosbuvir-containing therapy, 12 had reappearance of HCV RNA by follow-up week 24 with 5 patients (0.2%) demonstrating late relapse with the same virus. Although late relapse risk appears very low, some clinicians may think it prudent to obtain another HCV RNA assay at follow-up week 24 and/or follow-up week 48, while guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases Society of America has suggested that patients do not require another HCV RNA determination after SVR12 and can be dismissed from ongoing follow-up if they had Metavir F0–F2 fibrosis before treatment.

### A physician with a positive hepatitis C virus RNA test after a needlestick injury [^116mRn5T]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Needlestick accidents continue to be a hazard for healthcare workers. We report the development of acute hepatitis C infection in a physician after needlestick injury. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA, seroconversion and a raised plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) level were found in plasma three months after the accident. Treatment with interferon alfa and ribavirin was started. While the physician was on treatment, HCV-RNA test results from plasma taken the day treatment was started became available. HCV-RNA was undetectable by quantitative bDNA assay, undetectable by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and undetectable by transcription mediated amplification (TMA). A dilemma arose at this point: should the patient stop the treatment or continue the planned therapy? The physician decided to continue a 24-week course of treatment. Six months after the end of treatment, the physician was still HCV-RNA-negative and with a normal plasma ALAT level. The rationale of the decision to continue therapy is discussed. This information may be useful for clinicians confronted with a similar dilemma.

### The importance of HCV RNA measurement for tailoring treatment duration [^11678hFx]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2013). Low credibility.

The introduction of telaprevir and boceprevir in the treatment of chronically HCV genotype 1 infected patients has led to substantially improved sustained virologic response rates and shorter treatment duration for a growing group of patients. Management and monitoring of patients receiving protease inhibitor-based triple therapy is of major importance and has become more complicated. Close monitoring of HCV RNA levels for patients on protease inhibitor-based therapy to identify subjects who are eligible for shortening of treatment duration, are virological non-responders or are in danger of experiencing a viral breakthrough is strongly recommended. Several virological tools including qualitative and quantitative HCV RNA assays for detection and quantification of HCV RNA are commercially available. We review these methods and their implications for HCV therapy as well as current sustained virologic response definition, stopping rules and recommendations for protease inhibitor-based treatment durations.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^116kSVun]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C guidance — For HCV-negative recipients of allografts from HCV-viremic donors, prophylactic/preemptive direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy with a pangenotypic regimen is recommended, and treatment within the first week after transplantation even if HCV RNA results are not available is a reasonable alternative with a genotype-specific regimen permissible when genotype information is available. Recommended DAA options are: an 8-week course of glecaprevir (300 mg)/ pibrentasvir (120 mg) (I, B), a 12-week course of sofosbuvir (400 mg)/ velpatasvir (100 mg) (I, C), and a 12-week course of ledipasvir (90 mg)/ sofosbuvir (400 mg) for genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6 only (I, C).

### Use and interpretation of virological tests for hepatitis C [^117BJh3H]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Four virological markers of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are used clinically for management of patients with hepatitis C, namely the HCV genotype, HCV RNA, HCV core antigen, and antibody to HCV (anti-HCV). The diagnosis of acute and chronic hepatitis C is based on both anti-HCV detection using enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and HCV RNA detection using a sensitive molecular biology-based technique. Other virological tools, including HCV genotype determination and HCV RNA quantification, are now used to tailor treatment to the individual patient and to determine its efficacy. This article reviews the kinetics of HCV markers during acute and chronic HCV infection, together with current assays and their practical use in the management of HCV-infected patients.

### Monitoring response during a randomised controlled trial of escalating interferon dose for chronic hepatitis C infection: predictive value of quantitative and qualitative HCV RNA assays [^114GJVuA]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

In chronic hepatitis C infection, raising the interferon dose in initial non-responders may increase the generally poor sustained response rates. Monitoring virological response is essential in this kind of individual patient based approach. Quantitative HCV RNA assays are increasingly used for this purpose. However, their additional value as compared to strictly qualitative HCV RNA assays should be evaluated before they are implemented as a routine measurement, since these assays are more expensive and time consuming than qualitative assays.

Objectives

Goals of this study were (1) to test the hypothesis that increasing interferon dose in initial non-responders results in permanent viral clearance in more patients and (2) evaluation of the predictive value of quantitative versus qualitative HCV RNA assays before and during treatment.

Study Design

63 patients were treated in a randomised controlled trial of escalating interferon dose. In the standard treatment group patients received 6 MU alpha-2a thrice weekly for 3 months followed by 3 MU thrice weekly for 3 months. In the experimental group interferon dose was escalated at 6 weeks to 9 MU if HCV RNA was still detectable at 4 weeks. Predictors of response were analyzed at various time points before and during treatment and the predictive value of quantitative HCV RNA measurements was compared to that of qualitative HCV RNA assays.

Results

No significant difference in sustained response rate was found between the treatment groups at the end of follow-up. At baseline, the strongest independent predictor for a sustained response was a viral load level below 10(6) copies/ml and age younger than 40 years. During treatment a negative HCV RNA status at week 4 was the strongest predictor of a sustained response. Viral load levels during treatment did not independently predict a sustained response.

Conclusions

While on treatment, qualitative HCV RNA assays should be used to monitor response.

### Molecular diagnostics of hepatitis C virus infection: a systematic review [^1144bWL8]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common blood-borne pathogen that relies heavily on nucleic acid testing for confirmation of infection. Nucleic acid tests are invaluable for the diagnosis of HCV infection and provide critical prognostic information for guiding treatment and measuring the response to antiviral therapy.

Objective

To review the currently available molecular diagnostic tests for HCV, their clinical applications, and how these tests shed light on the natural history of HCV.

Evidence Acquisition

Search of MEDLINE (1966 to July 2006), article reference lists, and national meeting abstracts for the diagnosis and applications of molecular diagnostic tests for HCV. Studies were selected on the basis of clinical relevance.

Evidence Synthesis

Qualitative nucleic acid tests have low limits of detection (< 50 IU HCV RNA/mL) and are used for confirmation of HCV infection and for screening blood donations. Hepatitis C virus genotype test results provide important prognostic information related to therapeutic response and are routinely used for selecting treatment regimens. Quantitative HCV RNA testing provides prognostic information regarding likelihood of treatment response and plays an important role in monitoring the antiviral response to treatment. Sustained virological response is defined as testing negative for HCV RNA 6 months after cessation of therapy. Recent studies suggest that the rate of response to therapy is also important. For example, conversion to an HCV RNA negative test result after 4 weeks of therapy constitutes a rapid virological response and is a strong predictor of treatment success. Patients who have not had an early virological response, defined as at least a 2-log decline in HCV RNA after 12 weeks of therapy, are unlikely to respond with an additional 36 weeks of therapy, and should stop therapy.

Conclusions

A sensitive nucleic acid test should be used to confirm all cases of acute or chronic HCV infection. A genotype test and quantitative HCV RNA test should be performed on all patients prior to therapy to best assess probability of response and to aid in selection of appropriate therapeutic regimen. Monitoring HCV RNA during treatment provides important information on likelihood of sustained virological response. The same type of quantitative HCV RNA test should be used throughout a patient's treatment course.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115Kbc79]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnosis in adults and adolescents with HIV — On entry into HIV care, all patients should undergo routine HCV screening (AII). Initial testing for HCV should be performed using a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved immunoassay licensed for detection of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) in blood. For at-risk HCV-seronegative individuals, specifically MSM or persons who inject drugs, HCV antibody testing, using an FDA-approved immunoassay, is recommended annually or as indicated by clinical presentation, risk activities, or exposure (AII). Concordantly, both the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) HCV guidance and CDC PrEP guidelines also recommend HCV serologic testing at baseline and every 12 months for MSM, transgender women, and people who inject drugs. Nucleic acid testing for HCV RNA is recommended in settings where acute infection is suspected or in persons with known prior infection cleared spontaneously or after treatment (AIII). False-negative anti-HCV antibody results are possible among people with HIV but uncommon (2% to 4%), and more likely to be seen in patients with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 cell count < 200 cells/ mm3), and HCV RNA testing should be performed in those patients with risk factors or unexplained ALT elevation. Following acute HCV infection, the duration of the window period prior to seroconversion is highly variable, ranging from 2 weeks to more than 24 weeks, with antibody response in most persons detectable at 8 to 12 weeks, and high ALT levels should prompt testing for HCV RNA if serologic test results are negative or indeterminate in individuals at risk of HCV infection. Individuals who test positive for HCV antibody should undergo additional diagnostic testing by using a sensitive quantitative assay to measure plasma HCV RNA level and confirm current infection (AI), and this should preferentially be done as an automatic reflex to HCV RNA testing of the leftover serum from the blood draw for antibody testing to facilitate diagnosis. Reinfection can occur in those who clear infection, and diagnosing a new active infection will require HCV RNA testing in such individuals (AII).

DISCUSSION

In this study, the cobas 6800/8800 HCV and cobas 4800 HCV tests had detection levels that meet the requirements of current HCV treatment guidelines that recommend using a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay with an LOD ≤ 15 IU/ml (EASL) or ≤ 25 IU/ml (AASLD) for viral load monitoring. In HCV GT 4 panels, the LOD was estimated to be less than 15 IU/ml for cobas 6800/8800 HCV, but was found to be slightly above this cutoff for cobas 4800 HCV. The clinical relevance of these findings could not be explored due to a lack of GT 4 samples in our clinical set (only 1 sample was known to be GT 4). This supports the need for assay standards representing other HCV genotypes, which are known to be genetically highly variable. The WHO HCV international standard comprises only subtype a of GT 1 (HCV GT 1a) plasma.

The cobas 6800/8800 HCV and cobas 4800 HCV tests were accurate even at the lower end of the linear range (15 to 1000 IU/ml). As with the second version of the CAP/CTM v2 test, both assays provide a single value for the LOD and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). Although on-treatment HCV RNA measurement may play only a small role for outcome prediction in the era of DAAs, highly sensitive and accurate HCV RNA quantification is still required during and after antiviral therapy to document treatment adherence and successful HCV eradication.

The second version of the CAP/CTM test was developed to provide improved sensitivity and accuracy with a smaller sample input volume. The CAP/CTM v2 also contains a dual-probe design to improve genotype inclusivity, because the previous version 1 of the CAP/CTM did not always correctly quantify some genotypes and subtypes. This dual-probe design was also incorporated into the cobas 6800/8800 HCV and cobas 4800 HCV tests, which were developed to meet the requirements of medium-to-high and low-to-medium throughput laboratory facilities and to have a minimal hands-on time.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

Determining RVR At Week 4

Patients who are considered for shortened treatment duration must be tested at week 4 for RVR (i.e. no HCV RNA detectable) using a highly sensitive method (limit of detection ≤ 50 IU/mL). The week 4 value should be measured as close as possible to day 28 of therapy, i.e. between the fourth and fifth injection of peginterferon. Patients without assessment of RVR should not be considered as candidates for shortened therapy duration.

Monitoring is an important feature in the management of CHC; not only to document treatment success, but also as an indicator of compliance and adherence. Patients with RVR at week 4 should be tested again at week 12 (± 5 days). The probability that the PCR test is negative at week 4 but positive at week 12 is low; only 1 of 22 patients who experienced virological breakthrough prior to week 24 had an RVR.

Optimizing response by reducing relapse rates in patients with HCV genotype 1

A patient with virological relapse is one who achieved an end-of-treatment (EOT) response but who failed to achieve an SVR. Relapse has been reported to occur at similar rates for patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2a and -2b (18% and 19%, respectively) who were treated for 48 weeks according to the standard treatment algorithm. The IDEAL study, which investigates response to peginterferon alfa-2a and two different doses of peginterferon alfa-2b with RBV in patients with genotype 1 CHC, is also addressing this issue. Intensification of treatment is a possible approach to reduce the incidence of relapse. IDEAL is accepted as late-breaker at EASL 2008.

Hepatitis C guidance — Initiation strategy for DAA therapy in HCV-negative recipients of an allograft from an HCV-viremic donor can be prophylactic/preemptive (perioperatively without confirmation of viremia) or reactive after documentation of HCV viremia, and the goal is to start therapy as early as clinically possible to avoid acute hepatitis and other complications. Emerging data suggest that initiating prophylactic/preemptive therapy before viremia occurs reduces the likelihood of complications such as fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, and although this approach may allow a shorter duration of DAA treatment, it is not currently recommended outside a clinical trial setting. Because donor genotyping is not routinely performed, only a pangenotypic DAA regimen (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) should be used if opting for prophylactic/preemptive treatment, whereas with the reactive approach, genotyping can be used.

Initial HCV testing and follow-up — For initial screening, HCV-antibody testing with reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing is recommended (I, A), and HCV-antibody testing using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved assay (laboratory-based or point-of-care) is recommended. Among persons with a negative HCV-antibody test who were exposed to HCV within the prior 6 months, HCV-RNA or follow-up HCV-antibody testing 6 months or longer after exposure is recommended; HCV-RNA testing can also be considered for immunocompromised persons (I, C). Among persons at risk for reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance, HCV-RNA testing is recommended because a positive HCV-antibody test is expected (I, C). Persons with a positive HCV-antibody test and negative results for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction should be informed that they do not have evidence of current (active) HCV infection but are not protected from reinfection (I, A). Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiation of antiviral therapy to document the baseline level of viremia (i.e., baseline viral load) (I, A).

### Definition of rapid virologic response with a highly sensitive real-time PCR-based HCV RNA assay in peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin response-guided therapy [^113yNhz8]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Assessing hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA levels is integral to response-guided therapy. Rules for early discontinuation and determination of treatment duration were mainly established with HCV-RNA assays with a detection limit of 50IU/ml (COBAS Amplicor HCV [CA]). The currently used real-time PCR-based COBAS Ampliprep/COBAS-TaqMan HCV (CAP-CTM) test has a detection limit of approximately 10IU/ml. It is unknown whether shortening of treatment duration to 16/24 weeks in patients with rapid virological response at week 4 (RVR) and viral loads between 10 and 50IU/ml is possible.

Methods

We reanalysed stored serum from two large, multinational, randomized trials in which patients were treated with peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin (n = 962). Results of CAP-CTM with truly undetectable HCV RNA and those < 15IU/ml, which includes patients with residual viraemia (< 15), were compared with the originally obtained results using the CA assay.

Results

RVR rates were comparable for CA (< 50) and CAP-CTM (< 15) with 32% and 32% for genotype (gt) 1 and 50% and 49% for gt2/3 patients, respectively. A significantly smaller number of samples really had truly undetectable HCV RNA by the CAP-CTM assay (24% for gt1, 37% for gt2/3). However, sustained virological response rates after shortened treatment (16/24weeks) were not significantly different in patients with a RVR < 50, a RVR < 15 and RVR undetectable (82%, 83%, 83% for 24weeks gt1 and 95%, 95%, 94% for 16weeks gt2/3).

Conclusions

Shortening the treatment duration to 16/24weeks can be performed on the basis of a RVR with HCV-RNA concentrations < 15IU/ml by the CAP-CTM assay.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease — practice notes include that a simplified approach to HCV treatment can be used in treatment-naive patients with any genotype and without cirrhosis and includes standardized treatment with no on-treatment testing or in-person follow-up and limited follow-up to confirm SVR; characteristics that exclude patients from receiving simplified approach to therapy are outlined in Box 1 of the Hepatitis C Virus section. See the Hepatitis C Virus section to review a summary of drug-drug interactions between HCV therapy and ARV drugs. HCV treatment should not be withheld solely due to perceived lack of adherence to ART or untreated HIV (BIII). Effort should be made to document SVR (HCV RNA less than lower limits of quantification) at least 12 weeks after completion of therapy (AI), and patients without cirrhosis who achieve SVR do not require continued liver disease monitoring. Recommendations for treatment after DAA failure are not provided, with referral to the corresponding section in the AASLD/IDSA HCV treatment guidance.

AASLD–IDSA simplified HCV treatment — eligibility and pretreatment assessment for treatment‑naive adults without cirrhosis specify that adults with chronic hepatitis C (any genotype) who do not have cirrhosis and have not previously received hepatitis C treatment are eligible, whereas patients with prior hepatitis C treatment, cirrhosis, end‑stage renal disease (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), HIV or HBsAg positive, current pregnancy, known or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma, or prior liver transplantation are not eligible. For cirrhosis assessment, a patient is presumed to have cirrhosis if they have a FIB‑4 score > 3.25 or findings such as FibroScan stiffness > 12.5 kPa or platelet count < 150,000/mm3. Pretreatment laboratory testing includes, within 6 months of initiating treatment, a complete blood count, hepatic function panel, and calculated glomerular filtration rate; any time prior to therapy, quantitative HCV RNA, HIV antigen/antibody test, and hepatitis B surface antigen; and before initiating therapy, serum pregnancy testing and counseling about pregnancy risks for women of childbearing age.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic algorithm for current infection or reinfection — For diagnosis of current initial HCV infection, begin with HCV-antibody testing and for recurrent HCV infection, begin with HCV-RNA testing; ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing. Persons who have a reactive HCV-antibody test and a negative (not detected) HCV-RNA test should be informed that they do not have evidence of current HCV infection, with terminal pathways labeled "No Current HCV Infection" or "Additional Testing as Appropriate", whereas when infection is present the pathway labels "Current HCV Infection" and "Link to Care for Treatment or Retreatment". HCV-RNA testing is required to detect reinfection, and for persons who might have been exposed to HCV within the past 6 months or who are immunocompromised, testing for HCV RNA should be performed; repeat HCV-RNA testing if the person tested is suspected to have had HCV exposure within the past 6 months or has clinical evidence of HCV disease or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen.

Rationale and Evidence

Updated Guidance from Clinical Organizations

Recent guidance from AASLD and IDSA recommends a test-and-treat strategy for persons with acute HCV infection on initial diagnosis without awaiting spontaneous resolution. Although spontaneous clearance occurs in approximately 25% to 45% of acute infections, delays introduced by waiting for clearance might be associated with substantial anxiety on the part of the exposed HCP, might result in lost work time and risk for transmission depending on the HCP's HCV RNA level, and might increase the possibility of loss to follow-up. Furthermore, emerging data about treatment of acute HCV infection with shortened courses of all-oral, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens demonstrate potential benefit for treatment during the acute phase (,–).

Follow-Up Testing of HCV-Exposed HCP

For exposed HCP for whom follow-up testing is indicated, CDC continues to recommend early testing for HCV RNA at 3–6 weeks after exposure. HCV RNA becomes detectable on average within 1 week after exposure; most infected persons will have detectable HCV RNA within 1–2 weeks of exposure when tested with HCV RNA detection tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, CDC now recommends additional follow-up testing at 4–6 months for anti-HCV with reflex or follow-up HCV RNA if anti-HCV positive because of the possibility of intermittent periods of aviremia during acute HCV infection. This phenomenon has been reported previously among exposed persons, including those who progressed to chronic infection, primarily when using older HCV RNA tests (,–). Anti-HCV seroconversion occurs, on average, 8–11 weeks after exposure, although cases of delayed seroconversion have been documented among persons with immunosuppression (e.g. immunosuppression from human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection). Frequency of testing during the follow-up period depends on the management objectives and plan for timing of therapy if seroconversion occurs.

### Very low hepatitis C viral loads in treatment-naive persons: Do they compromise hepatitis C virus antigen testing? [^114xvYAH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigen testing is less expensive than quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction but has lower sensitivity for very low viral load (VLVL; HCV RNA ≤ 3000 IU/mL). Currently the benefits of antigen testing for screening are discussed, but data on prevalence and outcomes of persons with VLVL are scarce.

Methods

We assessed prevalence and predictors of VLVL by logistic regression in treatment-naive participants in the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study. We analyzed if the last viral load after VLVL was low, compared cirrhosis and mortality in persons with and without VLVL, and evaluated the number of samples with VLVL that were reactive by antigen testing.

Results

We included 2533 treatment-naive persons with available quantitative HCV RNA testing results. Overall, 133 persons (5.3%) had a VLVL. Age 18–40 years, female sex, and human immunodeficiency virus coinfection were associated with VLVL. Of 72 persons with a viral load available after VLVL, 14% had a VLVL and 17% had spontaneous viral clearance. The prevalence and incidence of cirrhosis and mortality were comparable in persons with and without VLVL; all 24 persons with VLVL and cirrhosis had excessive alcohol consumption or immunosuppression. Overall, 33% of samples with VLVL were reactive by antigen testing.

Conclusions

The frequency of VLVL was low. Among the persons who would probably be missed by antigen screening, some had a favorable disease course, but some had immunosuppression and liver cirrhosis. The benefit of HCV antigen testing for screening may be limited by the risk of missing patients with severe liver disease.

### Hepatic HCV RNA before and after treatment with interferon alone or combined with ribavirin [^111vSeMF]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical use of measuring hepatic hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA before and after therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C has been assessed in a number of small clinical trials. Viral clearance from the liver may be a better marker of long-term response than eradication of serum HCV RNA. The aim of this study was to evaluate quantitative hepatic HCV-RNA measurements before and after antiviral therapy. Two thousand eighty-nine chronic hepatitis C patients were enrolled in 3 published clinical trials evaluating interferon alfa-2b alone or with ribavirin either as initial therapy or for interferon relapse. Hepatic HCV-RNA quantitation was performed with a modified reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) before and 24 weeks after therapy in 951 and 1,316 patients, respectively. Pretherapy hepatic HCV-RNA concentrations correlated best with serum HCV-RNA concentrations (R = .236, P = 0.0001) and negatively correlated with alanine transaminase (ALT) values (-0.178, P = 0.0001), duration of infection (-0.09, P = 0.02), parenchymal injury (-0.135, P = 0.0001), histologic activity index (HAI) inflammatory score (-0.085, P = 0.01), Knodell fibrosis score (-0.072, P = 0.03), and body weight (-0.078, P = 0.02). In paired liver biopsy specimens (n = 534), change in hepatic HCV RNA correlated with the change in the HAI (R = .346, P = 0.0001). Of 400 sustained virologic responders (SVR), 393 (98%) had undetectable hepatic HCV RNA, whereas 7 (2%) had detectable hepatic HCV RNA; 5 have been followed and 2 have had reappearance of serum HCV RNA 12 months after therapy. In conclusion, measurement of hepatic HCV RNA before or after therapy reflects changes observed in serum HCV RNA, and correlates inversely with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, but otherwise has minimal clinical use.

### Effective management of hepatitis C molecular testing improves test use without compromising patient management [^111aUpqu]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Context

The availability of effective antiviral therapy for hepatitis C has increased the need for molecular detection and quantification of circulating hepatitis C viral particles. The limits of detection differ for the quantitative and qualitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays; furthermore, adequate patient assessment requires both detection of hepatitis C virus when it is present and quantitation of the viral load when possible. The combination of these factors promotes the simultaneous ordering of both tests with the possibility of generating redundant test information.

Objective

To reduce the number of unnecessary hepatitis C tests performed.

Methods

We established a reflexive testing protocol for quantitative and qualitative RT-PCR testing for hepatitis C.

Results

During a 3(1/2)-month interval, 170 qualitative RT-PCR hepatitis C tests were eliminated (a 59.4% reduction in the number of these tests). This reduction was achieved without a clinically significant change in turnaround time or a compromise of patient care.

Conclusions

Establishing the quantitative and qualitative RT-PCR tests in-house and adopting the reflexive testing protocol was cost-effective and did not compromise patient management or care.

The median detectable HCV RNA at SVR12 was 287,986 IU/mL (approximately 5.5 log 10) (IQR = 1,323,500 IU/mL with 25th percentile = 26,500 and 75% percentile = 1,350,000) (Figure 1). 90% of those with detectable viraemia at SV12 had a viral load greater than 1133 (95% CI 940–1390), 95% greater than 227 IU/mL (95% CI 170–276), 97% greater than 70 IU/mL (95% CI 48–86) and 99% greater than 19 IU/mL (95% CI 16–23). Five hundred seventy‐four individuals (10%) were defined as having LLV, meaning that a hypothetical assay with LLoD of 1000 IU/mL would miss approximately 10% of treatment failures in this setting.

Serological testing for hepatitis B (to include core antibody), hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) should be routinely performed prior to starting treatment. Patients with positive serology for hepatitis B should undergo viral DNA quantification and receive prophylactic antiviral therapy and hepatic B virus polymerase chain reaction (HBV PCR) monitoring, both during and after chemo-immunotherapy, as per current guidance. Referral to a hepatologist or infectious disease physician should be considered. Patients with positive serology for hepatitis C virus (HCV) require HCV RNA quantification and should be urgently referred to a hepatologist or infectious disease physician. Patients testing positive for HIV should be urgently referred for joint care from an HIV specialist at a centre of expertise. Those with well-controlled HIV (fully-suppressed viral load and CD4 count ≥ 200x10 6 /L) can be treated on the same protocols as patients who are HIV-negative.

Reproductive counselling should be offered to all age-appropriate patients in whom potentially gonadotoxic therapy is planned. Sperm cryopreservation, ovarian preservation or oocyte harvest should be discussed where relevant. Patients who may be affected by the menopause during or after treatment should be signposted to their general practitioner for counselling, and the relevant investigations and hormonal replacement after completing treatment for lymphoma.

Before starting therapy (including pre-phase treatment), a risk-based prophylaxis and monitoring plan for tumour lysis should be initiated.

Proportion of HCV genotype 2 and 3-infected patients who could be considered for shortened or extended therapy duration

In general, patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 should not be routinely treated for less than the currently recommended 24 weeks to avoid an increased risk of virologic relapse. However, patients with a low pre-treatment viral load (≤ 400 000 IU/mL) and an RVR (as determined by a highly sensitive assay) have the highest probability of achieving an SVR with 16 weeks of therapy (Fig. 4). Such a regimen may be a reasonable option for these patients, especially if tolerability of longer treatment may be a concern. The cut-off for low-viral load in patients with genotypes 2 and 3 based on the ACCELERATE data is ≤ 400 000 IU/mL. As with genotype 1, baseline viral load should be determined in two samples, taken at least 4 weeks apart.

Fig. 4
Overview of the ACCELERATE data: 16 vs 24 weeks. SVR: sustained viral response.

Shortening of treatment duration should not be considered for patients with cirrhosis, persistently normal ALT values or co-infection with HBV or immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV infection or those who have undergone liver transplantation.

There may be patient subgroups with genotype 2 or 3 infection that might benefit from extended treatment duration to reduce relapse rates. Results from the trial by Hadziyannis et al. found evidence for reduced relapse rates in genotype 2 and 3 pts with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis as well as high baseline viral load when treated for 48 weeks in comparison with 24 weeks.

However, due to insufficient data from prospective clinical trials, there is currently not enough evidence for such recommendations. It is possible that a higher, weight-based dose of RBV may balance the increased risk of relapse associated with a shorter treatment duration, but this remains to be proven. An overview of the proposed treatment strategy for patients with genotypes 2 and 3 is given in Fig. 5.

### Changes in serum levels of hepatitis C virus genotype 1b monitored by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction as a predictor of long term response to interferon-alpha treatment [^111mJtRX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to find whether there is a relationship between the changes in the amounts of hepatitis C virus (HCV) at the start of interferon treatment and the long term response to therapy.

Methods

In 20 patients with HCV genotype 1b each given 880 MU of interferon-alpha, the changes in serum HCV RNA during the first 2 wk of therapy were monitored by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Results

Real-time quantitative PCR detected HCV RNA at 10¹-10⁸ copies/ml. Serum HCV RNA decreased rapidly between 8 and 24 h after the first administration (first phase) and more slowly thereafter (second phase), with median exponential decays of 2.14 and 0.11 log10/day, respectively. Four patients had sustained virological responses, nine patients had transient responses, and seven patients had no responses. The differences in the rate of first-phase viral decline among the three groups were not significant (p = 0.34), but the differences in the rate of second-phase viral decline were significant (p = 0.0004); the median viral decline (interquartile range) in the second phase was 0.48 (0.42–0.50) log10/day in patients with sustained responses, 0.16 (0.10–0.19) log10/day in patients with transient responses, and 0.026 (0.017–0.040) log10/day in patients with no responses.

Conclusions

Changes in serum levels of HCV genotype 1b in the first 2 wk of interferon-alpha treatment, monitored by real-time quantitative PCR, can be used for prediction of the long term therapeutic response.

Measurement of HCV RNA and HCV genotyping

Quantitative detection of HCV RNA in patient sera during pre-treatment, treatment and post-treatment were performed using real-time PCR (SmartCycler II, Cepheid, USA) with an internal RNA standard derived from the 5' UTR. Genotyping of HCV was performed in pre-treatment sera as described previously. All measures suggested by Kwok and Higuchi to prevent sample contamination were strictly adhered to.

Treatment

All patients with HCV 2a-b, 3a-d, 5a, 6a or with mixed infection of these genotypes received 3 subcutaneous injections per week of 3 MU recombinant IFN-α plus ribavirin (10 mg/day/kg body weight) for a total of 24 weeks. All patients with HCV genotypes 1a-c, 4 or those with mixed infections of these genotypes received 3 subcutaneous injection per week of 3 MU recombinant IFN-α plus ribavirin administered orally (1,000 mg/day for patients ≤ 75 kg body weight or 1,200 mg/day for patients > 75 kg body weight) for 48 weeks. Informed consent (printed in local language) was obtained from each patient and the Ethics Committee of the Centre approved this study.

Patients monitoring

All patients that fulfilled the study criteria were monitored for HCV RNA and ALT during and after treatment. Efficacy of treatment was assessed with normalization of ALT and absence of serum HCV RNA measured at week 4, 8, 12 and 24 and being undetectable at the end of the treatment at 24 or 48 weeks which constituted end of treatment response and at the end of follow up at 12 or 18 months which constituted the sustained viral response for patients with genotypes non-1 and 1 respectively. Adverse effects were monitored during each follow up visit. The study was initiated in May 2001 and all the follow-ups were completed by June 2007. A number of study end-points were defined, based upon the copy number of HCV RNA in patient sera. End of treatment response (ETR) was defined as undetectable HCV RNA (< 100 copies/mL) at the end of treatment. Sustained virologic response (SVR) was undetectable HCV RNA 6 months after the end of treatment and non responders were those who were with detectable HCV RNA at the end of treatment. Patient relapse was defined as those whose HCV RNA was undetectable at the end of treatment but reappeared within 6 months of cessation of treatment. Rapid virologic response (RVR) was defined as undetectable HCV RNA following an initial 4 weeks of treatment.

### Hepatitis C in 2020: a north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper [^116JPiVY]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic hepatitis C — laboratory and radiologic monitoring (Table 1) provides suggested testing intervals before, during, and after therapy. Laboratory tests AST, ALT, GGT, total and direct (or conjugated) bilirubin are obtained every 4 weeks until completed during treatment, with pretreatment assessment noted as annual and repeat if clinically indicated. Complete blood count is obtained every 4 weeks during treatment, while prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (INR) is monitored only if clinically indicated during and after treatment. HCV RNA quantitative PCR is checked every 4 weeks during treatment and at 12 weeks and 12 months post-treatment. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) for females of childbearing age is assessed prior to treatment and every 4 weeks if sexually active during treatment. For hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance, alpha-fetoprotein is performed every 6 months if cirrhotic and is not applicable if SVR 12 is achieved and the patient is non-cirrhotic, and liver ultrasound is performed every 6 months if cirrhotic and continued every 6 months until becomes non-cirrhotic. These are framed as suggestions for monitoring before, during, and after treatment.

Laboratory monitoring and post-treatment follow-up for adults and adolescents with HIV and HCV coinfection — Laboratory monitoring while on treatment is not required for patients qualifying for the simplified treatment approach; however, documentation of HCV RNA levels at week 4 of therapy may be required by some payors prior to providing additional refills needed to complete therapy. Effort should be made to document SVR (HCV RNA less than lower limits of quantification) at least 12 weeks after completion of therapy (AI); patients without cirrhosis who achieve SVR do not require continued liver disease monitoring. Periodic assessment for HCV reinfection should be done via HCV RNA testing on an at least yearly basis for those with ongoing risk behaviors or more frequently as dictated by clinical circumstances (AII). In the setting of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma screening with liver ultrasound every 6 months should continue indefinitely (BII).

Determination and monitoring of viral load

The decision on whether to continue or stop therapy should primarily be based on the level of HCV RNA during treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to measure viral load accurately. Important aspects to consider in this respect are the natural fluctuations in viral load during infection, as well as intra-assay (within an individual test) and inter-assay (between different tests) variability. Currently available commercial assays vary considerably in their dynamic ranges of quantification (Table 1). Despite the introduction of international units per mL (IU/mL) for reporting viral load, discrepancies may occur when patients are monitored using different types of assay. For example, rules for early discontinuation at week 12 and 24, as well as rules for determination of treatment duration [baseline viral load, RVR, complete early viral response (cEVR)], were established mainly with standard RT-PCR based assays, which have since been replaced by real-time PCR-based assays with higher sensitivity and broader dynamic range of linear HCV RNA quantification. The differences between commercial HCV RNA assays have been well documented in several studies, with the majority of studies showing an intra-assay variability of approx. 0.2 log. Generally, comparisons between Amplicor Monitor and CAP/CTM yielded comparable results (± 0.2 log), whereas comparisons between bDNA and Abbott real-time HCV on the one hand and CAP/CTM on the other showed a difference of 0.5–0.7 log. Additionally, HCV RNA viral load decline assessed during antiviral therapy can give different results, regardless of the use of IUs. False-positive and false-negative results, as well as variations in the HCV RNA level of up to 2 log 10 IU, have been observed, which may well have an impact on the management of patients, particularly if treatment decisions are made using a single HCV RNA assessment. Practitioners should be careful not to attach undue clinical significance to small changes (< 0.5 log 10) in serum HCV RNA level. The clinical relevance of serial HCV viral level measurements in a patient is dependent on continuous use of the specific quantitative assay employed in the initial determination of the viral level. This may imply repeated testing in some cases; but these extra costs may be justified if they affect treatment management decisions.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^113aXsRo]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy — monitoring, sustained virologic response (SVR) assessment, and simplified regimens for treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis are outlined as follows: Patients taking diabetes medication(s) should be informed of the potential for symptomatic hypoglycemia during and after DAA therapy, and glucose monitoring during and after DAA treatment is recommended; dosage adjustments may be needed, and patients taking warfarin should be informed of the potential for a change in their anticoagulation status with international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring recommended during and after DAA treatment; for others, on-treatment laboratory monitoring is not required unless a patient experiences treatment-related side effects or there are adherence concerns. Based on these data, 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is recommended for adults eligible for the simplified treatment algorithm. To assess treatment response, HCV-RNA and hepatic aminotransferase testing is recommended 12 or more weeks after completing DAA treatment, undetectable HCV RNA represents SVR and virologic cure, and in the absence of cirrhosis, persons who attain SVR require no liver-specific follow-up; for those with ongoing HCV risk factors, risk-reduction counseling is recommended and HCV-RNA testing annually or anytime an increase in hepatic aminotransferase levels occurs. Recurrent HCV viremia after attainment of SVR represents either reinfection or a relapse; with reinfection, treatment approaches are identical to those for initial treatment, and if relapse is suspected or cannot be ruled out, such patients should be managed by clinicians with expertise in managing HCV treatment failure. Persons who attain SVR but have persistently elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels require evaluation for other causes of liver disease; if retreatment is delayed or not feasible, assessment for liver disease progression every 6–12 months is recommended, and advise all patients, regardless of SVR, to avoid excess alcohol intake to prevent liver damage.

### Real-time PCR assays for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA quantitation are adequate for clinical management of patients with chronic HCV infection [^113JonmK]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Because of the use of viral kinetics during polyethylene glycol (PEG)-interferon-ribavirin therapy and the development of specific new anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) drugs, assessment of the efficacy of anti-HCV drugs needs to be based not on end-point PCR assays but on real-time PCR. The aim of this study was to determine if the two available commercial real-time PCR assays, the Abbott RealTime HCV assay and the Roche Cobas TaqMan HCV assay, can become the standard for HCV RNA quantification. We investigated the prognostic relevance of HCV RNA viral loads at baseline, week 4, and week 12 to a rapid and early virological response to antiviral therapy by using the two assays. Of 59 naïve patients chronically infected by HCV (41 infected with genotype 1) who were treated with ribavirin plus PEG-interferon alfa-2b for 48 weeks, 24 patients (41%) showed a sustained virological response (SVR). With the two assays, viral loads were highly correlated, irrespective of genotype (R² = 0.94 for all cases). No difference in diagnostic value was found between the Abbott and Roche assays at week 4, with respective negative predictive values (NPVs) of 84% and 78% and positive predictive values (PPVs) of 62% and 56% (not significant), and at week 12, the respective NPVs were 91% and 90% and PPVs were 44% and 46% (not significant). At week 12, 83% (20/24) and 96% (23/24) of patients with SVR tested negative for HCV RNA by the Abbott and Roche assays, respectively (the difference is not significant). In conclusion, the high sensitivities and large dynamic ranges of the Abbott and Roche assays show that a single real-time quantitative PCR assay is fully adequate for clinical and therapeutic management of HCV.

HIV/HCV coinfection — HCV RNA monitoring and virologic response definitions during interferon and ribavirin therapy include the following schedule and terms: HCV RNA levels should be performed at baseline; after 5, 12, and 24 weeks of antiviral therapy; at treatment completion (48 weeks); and 6 months after treatment cessation, and some experts continue serial testing at 6- to 12-month intervals for an additional 1 to 5 years. Rapid virological response (RVR) is non-detectable plasma HCV RNA after 4 weeks of therapy, early virologic response (EVR) is a decrease in HCV RNA ≥ 2 log10 IU/mL below baseline after 12 weeks of therapy, end of treatment virologic response is non-detectable HCV RNA at time of treatment completion, sustained virologic response (SVR) is non-detectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after treatment completion, virologic relapse is achievement of end of treatment response followed by return of HCV RNA positivity after treatment completion, non-response is failure to suppress the HCV RNA below detection at any time during treatment, and breakthrough response is reemergence of detectable HCV RNA from non-detectable status during continuation of therapy.

### The use of molecular assays in the management of viral hepatitis [^113oRWMQ]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Molecular assays are instrumental in the clinical management of viral hepatitis. During the past years, a wide variety of molecular assays have been developed and implemented. This considerably improved the understanding of the natural history and pathogenesis of Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) or Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) hepatitis, but also caused uncertainties in the selection of the most appropriate assays for clinical requirements. Indeed, a rational choice and application of these assays requires adequate knowledge of the performance of the single test. Moreover, the choice of the most accurate assay for patients' needs and physicians' objectives, needs to be oriented to specific contexts, such as diagnosis, management or treatment. In the past, a hurdle in the routine use of assays for hepatitis viruses nucleic acid quantification was represented by the availability of only "home brew" methods which lacked standardization. Major improvement in addressing the use of molecular assays for viral hepatitis has been derived from recent standardization procedures that allowed a comparison between different tests after results were given as International Units. In addition, it should be reminded that, before getting into the market, molecular assays should be approved by European regulation authorities and validated using internationally recognized standards. A subsequent clinical validation should address the diagnostic accuracy of the assay. These proceedings have the aim of identifying which molecular tests, among those currently available, meet clinical requirements for each specific application.

### Quantification of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in a multicenter study: implications for management of HCV genotype 1-infected patients [^115ovF7Q]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Assessment of the viral load in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected patients is critical before, during, and after antiviral therapy. In patients achieving a rapid virological response at week 4 of treatment, the viral load at the baseline is considered a predictive criterion of a sustained virological response 24 weeks after the discontinuation of treatment. A ≥ 2-log(10) drop in the viral load at week 12 of treatment (early virological response) triggers the continuation of therapy. We organized a multicenter study (MS) for diagnostic laboratories involved in the quantification of HCV RNA. Commercial assays, including two based on real-time reverse transcription-PCR (TaqMan system), and in-house methods, were used by the 61 participants. The overall reproducibility of the commercial quantitative nucleic acid amplification techniques (qNAT) was acceptable. As the intermethod variability among commercial qNAT for HCV RNA was still present, the manufacturers of these test kits should join efforts to harmonize the means of quantification of HCV RNA. This study also shows that caution should be exercised when the baseline viral load is evaluated and when the 2-log(10) reduction after 12 weeks of therapy is interpreted. Finally, this MS confirms the higher sensitivity of the commercial qNAT based on the TaqMan system, making them the elective assays for the monitoring of therapy.

### Molecular testing in the diagnosis and management of hepatitis C virus infection [^112qeCGn]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review hepatitis C virus (HCV), describe the types of molecular-based tests available for the diagnosis and management of HCV infection, and discuss the appropriate utilization of these tests.

Data Sources

Current information is presented from the published literature, as well as new information where available.

Study Selection

A major cause of posttransfusion and community-acquired non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide is HCV. Approximately 4 million people in the United States are infected with HCV, resulting in 8000 to 10,000 deaths annually. Because HCV is not readily cultured, in vitro molecular-based tests have been developed for use in the diagnosis and treatment of HCV-infected patients. Molecular tests include qualitative and quantitative nucleic acid amplification tests, branched DNA tests, and HCV genotyping assays. Qualitative HCV nucleic acid amplification tests are used routinely in association with serologic tests to help make a diagnosis of infection with HCV. Quantitative HCV testing and genotyping methods have been found to be valuable tools in the treatment of infected patients. A patient's pretreatment HCV viral load and the rate of virus decline during therapy have been shown to correlate with the likelihood of long-term response to antiviral therapy. Information pertaining to the genotype of HCV infecting patients has been shown to be helpful in making recommendations regarding treatment. Certain genotypes of HCV are much more responsive to therapy, allowing a shorter course of treatment.

Conclusions

Molecular tests are valuable tools for use in the diagnosis and treatment of patients infected with HCV.

AASLD–IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — spontaneous clearance and follow-up for acute HCV reports that HCV infection spontaneously clears in 20%–50% of patients within 6 months time of infection, and only 11%–14% of those who remain viremic at 6 months spontaneously clear later. Predictors of spontaneous clearance include presentation with jaundice, elevated ALT, HBsAg positivity, female sex, younger age, genotype 1 infection, and host genetic polymorphisms near the IL28B gene. Patients who experience spontaneous clearance do not require antiviral therapy but do require counseling about the risk of reinfection and testing at least annually; transient suppression of viremia can occur, so a single undetectable HCV-RNA test result is insufficient to declare spontaneous clearance.

### Clinical performances of two real-time PCR assays and bDNA / TMA to early monitor treatment outcome in patients with chronic hepatitis C [^111GV62q]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Early viral monitoring is essential for the management of treatment outcome in patients with chronic hepatitis C. A variety of commercially available assays are now available to quantify HCV-RNA in routine clinical practice.

Objectives

Compare the clinical results of 3 commercially available assays to evaluate the positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) of rapid virological response (RVR) at week 4 and early virological response (EVR) at week 12.

Study Design

287 patients treated with standard care regimen combination therapy were studied. HCV-RNA values measured at baseline, week 4, week 12 with VERSANT HCV 3.0 Assay (bDNA), and VERSANT HCV-RNA Qualitative Assay (TMA) (bDNA/TMA); COBAS Ampliprep/COBAS/TaqMan (CAP/CTM) and Abbott m2000sp extraction/m2000rt amplification system (ART). RVR was defined as undetectable serum HCV-RNA and EVR as a > OR = 2 log decline in baseline viral load (BLV).

Results

Median (range) BVLs were: 5.585(2.585–6.816), 5.189(2.792–7.747) and 4.804(2.380–6.580) log(10)IU/ml, with bDNA/TMA, CAP/CTM and ART, respectively (p < 0.01); RVR was observed in 22%, 30% and 27% of the patients and PPVs were 97%, 91% and 94% with bDNA/TMA, CAP/CTM and ART, respectively (p = 0.317). EVR was observed in 76%, 73% and 67% of the patients and NPVs were 93%, 83% and 79% with bDNA/TMA, CAP/CTM and ART, respectively (p = 0.09).

Conclusions

Treatment monitoring should include both detection of serum HCV-RNA at week 4 to predict SVR and at week 12 to predict non-SVR. The value of all 3 assays was similar for evaluating RVR or EVR. Because of viral load discrepancies the same assay should be used throughout patient treatment follow-up.

### Minimum target prices for production of direct-acting antivirals and associated diagnostics to combat hepatitis C virus [^1121yJTY]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The current analysis further suggests that the current diagnostic and monitoring package could be substantially simplified as a result of the improved side-effect profile and efficacy of DAA combinations observed in clinical trials. Monitoring with a full blood count plus clinical chemistry test (pretreatment and during treatment) could be sufficient to monitor for side effects and could cost in the region of US$22 per person. If treatment is not pangenotypic, HCV genotyping could be added to pretreatment monitoring. Although qualitative viral load monitoring is desirable and informative, current approaches are expensive and technically complex; this limitation, together with the high SVR rates in current DAA trials, brings into question the necessity of repeated viral load monitoring during treatment. Given that the majority of HCV infections are associated with very high viral loads, including in patients relapsing after treatment, a qualitative HCV antigen test could be sufficient to confirm viral replication or suppression both pre- and post-treatment. The HCV antigen assay is less expensive and requires less technical expertise than PCR assays; further evaluations regarding the LLOD are required. New studies need to assess how often the RNA levels are above the LLOD of 2,000 IU/mL before treatment or at relapse/reinfection and to confirm that the HCV-RNA and HCV antigen tests provide comparable results.

This analysis has several limitations. The results of clinical trials on the new DAAs are not representative of all patient subpopulations in need of treatment. Relatively few patients with genotypes 4–6 have been included in clinical studies, despite these genotypes predominating in certain regions of the world. The high SVR rates for these new DAAs still need to be confirmed in real-world situations outside clinical trials. Most of these DAAs are only at phase III of development or have only recently been approved. Clinical trial populations are selective, and safety in program settings may be different. All regimen cost estimates in this analysis are based on a 12-week treatment course. Shorter treatment durations would further reduce estimated costs if efficacy is shown. Conversely, for some of the currently approved DAA regimens, some genotypes require 24 weeks of treatment. In the future, when clinical trial results are available, the costs of sequences of treatment will be required, including new or existing DAA treatments for patients who relapse on their initial combinations — these costings will need to be included in subsequent analyses. Finally, the estimated costs do not include the importation, transport, and distribution of the drugs.

### Strategy for the maximization of clinically relevant information from hepatitis C virus, RT-PCR quantification [^111SFsNK]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The increasing clinical application of viral load assays for monitoring viral infections has been an incentive for the development of standardized tests for the hepatitis C virus.

Objective

To develop a simple model for the prediction of baseline viral load in individuals infected with the hepatitis C virus.

Methodology

Viral load quantification of each patient's first sample was assessed by RT-PCR-ELISA using the Roche MONITOR assay in triplicate. Genotype of the infecting virus was identified by reverse line probe hybridization, using amplicons resulting from the qualitative HCV Roche AMPLICOR assay.

Results

Retrospective evaluation of first quantitative values suggested that 82.4% (n = 168/204) of individuals had a viral load between 4.3 and 6.7 log(10) viral copies per ml. A few patients (3.4%; n = 7/204) have a serum viremia less than the lower limit of the linear range of the RT-PCR assay. Subsequent, prospective evaluation of hepatitis C viral load of all new patients using a model based on the dynamic range of viral load in the retrospective group correctly predicted the dynamic range in 75.9% (n = 33/54).

Conclusion

The dynamic range of hepatitis C viremia extends beyond the linear range of the Roche MONITOR assay. Accurate determination of serum viremia is substantially improved by dilution of specimens prior to quantification.

### Quantification of the hepatitis B virus cccDNA: evidence-based guidelines for monitoring the key obstacle of HBV cure [^115BoMxt]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and recommendations for cccDNA quantification

To improve our knowledge on cccDNA biology, validate serological biomarkers and assess the impact of new therapies on cccDNA levels and activity, reliable and standardised quantitative cccDNA assays are paramount. To achieve this goal in a more reliable manner then previously possible, it is critical to compare protocols and perform cross-validation experiments across laboratories. The results of this concerted effort provide novel information to guide researchers and clinical trial investigators in designing and performing protocols to accurately quantify cccDNA.

The comparative analysis of parallel qPCR and SB results was a strength of our study design and allowed us to understand how each method influences the outcome and to identify the most critical points. In figure 6, we summarised the methodologies that were validated within our consortium and the observations relevant to cccDNA quantification. Because all protocols must be adapted to the sample type, infection level and treatment, there is not one protocol that suits all needs. Instead, we provide guidance and general recommendations, which are summarised in table 1.

### Role of serologic and molecular diagnostic assays in identification and management of hepatitis C virus infection [^115cph2A]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

ROLE OF TESTING IN DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE HCV INFECTION

The diagnostic methods associated with treatment are different from those designed to screen and protect the blood supply. As treatments of HCV have improved dramatically in recent years, the diagnostic paradigm has also evolved to meet the changing clinical needs. Approximately 15% to 30% of patients spontaneously clear HCV within 6 to 12 months of initial exposure. Such individuals remain anti-HCV antibody positive but have no detectable viremia and are truly cured of the infection, without long-term sequelae. Prior to placing a patient on therapy, a physician must differentiate those people who have been exposed to HCV but who have, after acute and usually asymptomatic infection, resolved their infection without sequelae from those who have been exposed and have progressed to a chronic and potentially lifelong infection. Traditionally, the RIBA was used to confirm HCV infection by demonstrating reactivity of antibodies in the serum with specific HCV proteins, increasing the specificity of the initial antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, this test has been discontinued and is consequently no longer available. The presence of HCV RNA in the peripheral blood is a reliable marker of HCV replication and is the main marker used today to confirm an active infection. Two technologies are routinely used for the qualitative HCV RNA test, PCR and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA).

### Tools needed to support same-day diagnosis and treatment of current hepatitis C virus infection [^112xhznr]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CURRENT PRACTICE, DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, AND GAPS IN CARE

Currently, pretreatment assessments start with testing to detect the presence of HCV antibody, followed, if antibody is detected, by quantitative HCV RNA testing to confirm current HCV infection. To prepare a patient for DAA therapy, clinical evaluations include testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, pregnancy status for individuals of childbearing potential, hepatic function and basic metabolic panels, noninvasive assessment to detect advanced fibrosis using clinical examination complemented by serum markers, and elastography if available. Coincident HBV or HIV infection requires additional clinical management specific to these viruses. Evaluating for the presence of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, prior treatment failure, or HIV or HBV coinfection determines the need for specialist consultation and the need for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and esophageal variceal screening after treatment.

While HCV eradication reduces the HCC risk dramatically, the presence of cirrhosis is associated with reduced but not eliminated rates of HCC after SVR, underscoring the need for ongoing surveillance in this population. Aside from patients with cirrhosis infected with HCV genotype 3, in whom resistance testing may be needed before DAA selection, the presence of compensated cirrhosis or identification of genotype does not affect the duration of treatment or selection of DAA regimen now that pangenotypic regimens are available. Indeed, treatment of patients in low- and middle-income settings has been highly successful using a minimal monitoring approach without genotyping and dispensation of full curative courses of DAA treatment.

Noninvasive assessment of fibrosis and cirrhosis is straightforward and includes physical examination findings and measurement of platelet count and serum markers, and it may include elastography as well as other imaging modalities. Physical examination findings may individually have high specificity, but each has limited sensitivity and are examiner dependent (Table 1). There are many direct and indirect serum markers of liver fibrosis that can aid in detecting advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis in patients with HCV infection. Some of these tests include commonly performed studies such as platelet count and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which, combined with an individual's age, can provide moderate sensitivity and specificity for the detection of fibrosis and cirrhosis (Table 2 and Table 3).

### Automation of laboratory testing for infectious diseases using the polymerase chain reaction – our past, our present, our future [^1124qjGQ]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

While it is an extremely powerful and versatile assay method, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be a labor-intensive process. Since the advent of commercial test kits from Roche and the semi-automated microwell Amplicor system, PCR has become an increasingly useful and widespread clinical tool. However, more widespread acceptance of molecular testing will depend upon automation that allows molecular assays to enter the routine clinical laboratory. The forces driving the need for automated PCR are the requirements for diagnosis and treatment of chronic viral diseases, economic pressures to develop more automated and less expensive test procedures similar to those in the clinical chemistry laboratories, and a shortage in many areas of qualified laboratory personnel trained in the types of manual procedures used in past decades. The automated Roche COBAS AMPLICOR system has automated the amplification and detection process. Specimen preparation remains the most labor-intensive part of the PCR testing process, accounting for the majority of the hands-on-time in most of the assays. A new automated specimen preparation system, the COBAS AmpliPrep, was evaluated. The system automatically releases the target nucleic acid, captures the target with specific oligonucleotide probes, which become attached to magnetic beads via a biotin-streptavidin binding reaction. Once attached to the beads, the target is purified and concentrated automatically. Results of 298 qualitative and 57 quantitative samples representing a wide range of virus concentrations analyzed after the COBAS AmpliPrep and manual specimen preparation methods, showed that there was no significant difference in qualitative or quantitative hepatitis C virus (HCV) assay performance, respectively. The AmpliPrep instrument decreased the time required to prepare serum or plasma samples for HCV PCR to under 1 min per sample. This was a decrease of 76% compared to the manual specimen preparation method. Systems that can analyze more samples with higher throughput and that can answer more questions about the nature of the microbes that we can presently only detect and quantitate will be needed in the future.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnosis in HIV care — screening and confirmatory testing states that on entry into HIV care, all HIV-infected patients should undergo routine HCV screening, and initial testing should use the most sensitive immunoassays licensed for detection of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) in blood; for at risk HCV-seronegative individuals, HCV antibody testing is recommended annually or as indicated by risk exposure; false-negative anti-HCV antibody results are uncommon (< 1%) in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression, and following acute HCV infection the window period prior to seroconversion ranges from 2 weeks to 12 weeks; elevated ALT early in acute infection should prompt testing for HCV RNA if serologic test results are negative or indeterminate in at-risk individuals; individuals who test positive for HCV antibody should undergo confirmatory testing using a sensitive quantitative assay to measure plasma HCV RNA level; plasma HCV RNA viral load does not correlate with HCV disease severity and should not be monitored serially in patients not taking HCV treatment, but plasma HCV RNA levels provide important prognostic information about the likelihood of response to HCV treatment.

### Virological tools to diagnose and monitor hepatitis C virus infection [^112WnyJP]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Approximately 200 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Infection with HCV is curable by therapy, with the current standard treatment based on the combination of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin. Viral eradication is achieved in approximately half of treated patients. In 2011 a new antiviral treatment based on a triple combination with a protease inhibitor will become available. Virological tools are essential to diagnose HCV infection but they have found their principal application in guiding treatment decisions and assessing the virological responses to therapy. These include the anti-HCV antibody assay, measurements of HCV core antigen and HCV viral load and HCV genotyping. The HCV RNA can be ideally assayed by a real-time assay with a limit of detection of 10–15 IU/mL. Monitoring of viral kinetics during the early phases of antiviral treatment is crucial in making treatment decisions such as early stopping rules and also in optimizing the treatment duration. The HCV genotype should be assessed before the start of treatment because it determines the treatment length and ribavirin dose and also offers prognostic information on treatment outcomes as certain genotypes respond more favourably to treatment.

### New markers for diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection [^114EceVW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Virology tools developed over the past 20 years are routinely used to diagnose and monitor chronic HCV infection. Classical assays include molecular tools used to detect and quantify HCV RNA, and techniques that determine the HCV sequence in order to determine the genotype and the subtype and eventually identify clinically relevant amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to direct acting antivirals (DAA). New assays capable of detecting and quantifying HCV core antigen are now approved in Europe and are available for research use only in the United States. Moreover, recent advances include alternatives approaches that require whole blood or oral fluid samples and will be used to extend HCV screening and improve access to care in regions without molecular biology laboratories.

A variety of biological makers are useful for the virological diagnosis and monitoring of chronic HCV infection, as well as screening of hepatitis C infection. Virological markers [total anti-HCV antibodies (Ab), core antigen titer, HCV RNA level and viral genotype], biochemical markers (ALT activity) and histological markers (hepatic fibrosis stage and necroinflamatory activity grade) are currently used in clinical practice to diagnose and monitor chronic hepatitis C. Among them, HCV RNA quantification before treatment is important for decision making. All treatment-naïve patients with compensated liver disease and detectable HCV RNA are candidates for therapy. New molecular methods for quantifying HCV RNA in blood are based on real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or TMA (transcription-mediated amplification) assays. These assays are fully or partly automated. With a broader range of linear quantification, a lower limit of detection (LLOD) in the order of 10–15 IU/mL, and an identical LLOD and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for the most recent assays, theses techniques are well suited to the clinical needs. They are recommended to quantify HCV RNA in international liver society guidelines. The HCV genotype should be determined before treatment is started. Indeed, the HCV genotype drives the treatment indication. Patients infected with HCV genotypes other than 1 should be treated with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) α-2a or-2b and ribavirin only. Patients infected with HCV genotype 1 should receive the triple combination of pegIFN, weight-based ribavirin and an NS3/4A protease inhibitor (either telaprevir or boceprevir). Direct sequence analysis (population sequencing) is the gold standard for HCV genotype determination. The viral region sequenced should be carefully chosen, because not all the regions provide accurate typing and subtyping. Alternative methods to sequencing techniques have been developed for routine clinical use. The most widely used assay is based on reverse hybridization (line probe assay). New technologies, so-called next generation sequencing (NGS), are now available for analyzing viral genome sequences, particularly amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to DAAs. NGS methods offer the capacity to generate a large amount of data, but the results are often difficult to interpret due to the lack of bioinformatic tools to analyze them. In addition, resistance testing based on HCV sequence analysis of the NS3/4A region has no utilities in clinical practice with the currently available drug regimens.

AASLD–IDSA hepatitis C virus (HCV) exposure testing algorithm — For a discrete, recognized exposure, baseline testing should be performed within 48 hours of exposure using HCV RNA, HCV antibody (Ab), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Initial result pairs map to outcomes: HCV Antibody (Ab negative, HCV RNA negative leads to NO HCV infection; HCV Ab positive, HCV RNA negative indicates Prior resolved infection; HCV Ab negative, HCV RNA positive indicates Acute HCV infection already present; and HCV Ab positive HCV RNA positive indicates Prior chronic infection. Follow-up specifies Repeat testing for 6 months to assess new infection and to Test HCV RNA and HCV Ab; if HCV RNA positive or seroconversion, classify as Acute HCV infection and note that HCV treatment recommended for HCV RNA positive. If HCV RNA negative and HCV Ab negative, or no seroconversion for 6 months: NO HCV infection, and for prior resolved infection, if HCV RNA remains negative: NO HCV infection; additionally, implement Counsel on risk reduction and Annual testing for high-risk patients.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^117BfuDX]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, the European Association for the Study of the Liver Diseases, IDSA‐AASLD HCV guidance panel, all recommend a minimum LLoD of 1000 IU/mL for HCV diagnosis, but none yet specify minimal test characteristics for test of cure. While some small studies have examined the distribution of viral load at end of treatment — including a cohort of eight patients from the United States, a cohort of 14 patients in Germanyand 330 treatment failures in an analysis of 34 phase 2/3 clinical trials. The latter study in clinical trials identify that 97% had a viral load > 10,000 IU/mL 12 weeks post‐treatment, and just 0.9% of patients had a viral load less than 1000 IU/mL (77, 405 and 680 IU/mL). To date, there have been no real world, global analyses of distribution of viral load in those with detectable viraemia at SVR12.

Our primary objective was to determine the LLoD for an HCV RNA assay to detect 90%, 95%, 97% and 99% of treatment failures at 12 weeks post‐treatment in a large multi‐cohort data set, and to assess the characteristics associated with low‐level viraemia (< 1000 IU/mL) at SVR12. These findings will help inform global policy as well as guide manufacturers as to whether existing platforms and assays meet requirements for their use both in diagnosis and as a test of cure, and for future development of testing technologies.

### Performance of the new aptima HCV quant Dx assay in comparison to the cobas taqMan HCV2 test for use with the high pure system in detection and quantification of hepatitis C virus RNA in plasma or serum [^116u22g2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

The gold standard for monitoring SVR in HCV-infected patients under treatment is to quantitate HCV RNA in the patient's plasma or serum at regular intervals during and after therapy. Depending on the regimen and the inclusion of IFN, this can include measurement at baseline, week 2 (IFN free), week 4, week 12, week 24, and week 48 (nonresponders for certain regimens) of treatment and 12 or 24 weeks after the end of therapy. Not only is HCV RNA monitoring important for determining the initial viral load, it is necessary to assess patient adherence and for following stopping rules to determine when treatment is ineffective and should be discontinued. This is a necessity for managing side effect profiles, minimizing the emergence of viral resistance, and decreasing the cost of therapy. European guidelines recommend stopping treatment with the triple combination pIFN plus ribavirin plus simeprevir if HCV RNA levels are ≥ 25 IU/ml at week 4, 12, or 24; no futility rules have been defined for other treatment regimens. United States guidelines, however, do not provide specific recommendations regarding when to stop or extend therapy except to discontinue treatment if HCV RNA is detectable at week 4 and increases by > 10-fold on repeat testing at week 6 (or thereafter). Because these rules are based on a threshold of quantitation of HCV RNA of 25 IU/ml, the guidelines recommend that monitoring be performed using a sensitive real-time quantitative HCV RNA assay, i.e. an assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for HCV RNA of ≤ 25 IU/ml and a limit of detection (LOD) of ≤ 15 IU/ml.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^114UCUfw]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

AASLD–IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — post-treatment assessment, surveillance, and retreatment: After direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, HCV-RNA and aminotransferase testing are recommended 12 or more weeks after completion to assess treatment response, and undetectable HCV RNA represents sustained virologic response (SVR) and virologic cure. For cirrhosis, ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma every 6 months after treatment completion is recommended regardless of achieving SVR. For persons with ongoing HCV risk factors, HCV-RNA testing annually or anytime an increase in hepatic aminotransferase levels occurs is also recommended. Recurrent HCV viremia after attainment of SVR represents either reinfection or a relapse; with reinfection, the treatment approaches are identical to those for initial treatment. If relapse is suspected or cannot be ruled out, such patients should be managed by clinicians with expertise in managing HCV treatment failure, and if retreatment is delayed or not feasible, assessment for liver disease progression every 6–12 months is recommended.

### Practical use of hepatitis C virus kinetics monitoring in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C [^1113GA23]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2007). Low credibility.

Prevention of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection complications can be achieved by antiviral therapy based on the use of a combination of pegylated interferon (IFN)-alpha and ribavirin. The steady-state kinetics of HCV infection represents the treatment target. The goal is cure, which is achieved when all infected cells have been cleared from the body. Because of their intrinsic properties, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods are rapidly replacing other technologies for routine quantification of HCV-RNA during antiviral therapy. The virological response at week 12 of therapy is currently used to tailor treatment duration in HCV genotype 1 infection only. Recent reports suggest that the virological response at week 4 could be used to tailor treatment duration, whatever the HCV genotype.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^114ydQNe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnosis and screening — The diagnosis of HCV infection usually begins with an immunoassay for detection of HCV IgG or total antibodies in serum or plasma, but antibody may not be detectable until 6–10 weeks after the onset of clinical illness. Individuals with negative HCV antibody screening test results do not need further testing except in immunocompromised individuals, in whom development of HCV IgG antibody may be delayed for up to 6 months after exposure, or those suspected to have acute HCV infection. Those with positive initial HCV IgG or total antibody test results should undergo confirmatory or supplemental testing for HCV RNA with nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT); supplemental HCV IgG antibody assays can confirm antibodies but are not FDA-approved currently for clinical use in the United States. Per current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, the following individuals should be screened for HCV infection: all adults aged > 18 years at least once, previously untested persons with risk factors, and pregnant women during each pregnancy except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1%. HCV RNA can be detected soon after infection and NAAT can be qualitative or quantitative; highly sensitive molecular assays with a limit of detection of ≤ 25 IU/mL are necessary to monitor virologic response and to determine cure, and determination of HCV genotype and subtypes (ie, 1 to 6 and 1a vs 1b) is used to guide antiviral therapy choice and duration and to predict response.

### Recommendations for standardized nomenclature and definitions of viral response in trials of hepatitis C virus investigational agents [^111s8q99]. Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Outdated virological response terms used at key trial timepoints in clinical trials with first-generation direct-acting antivirals plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin have failed to keep pace with hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug development. A more intuitive and flexible nomenclature capable of adapting to continuing advances in HCV drug development is needed. Assistance in standardization of the field was provided by members of the Hepatitis C Virus Drug Development Advisory Group, a project of the Forum for Collaborative HIV Research with participation from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, European Association for the of the liver, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Our proposed descriptive, virological response nomenclature for key decision points in trials (with and without lead-in treatment) is based on an assay-specified lower limit of quantitation cutoff. This allows responses to be categorized as either quantifiable or unquantifiable HCV RNA, with unquantifiable responses further divided based on whether target HCV RNA was detected or not detected. The unified reporting recommendations will facilitate interpretation of results across clinical trials and validation of new response-guided timepoints. As time-critical treatment parameters are shortened in HCV trials, the proposed nomenclature will greatly simplify and facilitate future adaptations of virological response terms. Our proposed nomenclature will also be helpful in developing treatment guidelines for use in clinical practice.

### Utilization of hepatitis C virus-infected organ donors in cardiothoracic transplantation: an ISHLT expert consensus statement [^111RT55c]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Management of patients with donor-derived HCV infection — The time to detection of HCV viremia in the recipient using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has ranged from 1 to 14 days. For centers initiating direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy only after confirmation of infection, we recommend weekly quantitative HCV PCR for 4 weeks or until detection. Once detected, we recommend genotyping; resistance testing can be considered as well, including if planning to use elbasvir/grazoprevir for genotype 1a. Weekly monitoring of liver and renal function until initiation of DAA is recommended with weekly serum and urine testing (the latter for proteinuria). Concern for worsening transaminitis, increasing HCV viremia, fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, membranous glomerulopathy, or other potential HCV-related adverse events should lead to prompt DAA initiation.

### Role of serologic and molecular diagnostic assays in identification and management of hepatitis C virus infection [^116mKB5P]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

ROLE OF HCV DIAGNOSTIC ASSAYS FOR ON-TREATMENT MONITORING AND POSTTREATMENT AND AS ADHERENCE MEASURES WITH DAA REGIMENS

Apart from some interferon-containing regimens, which rely on HCV load monitoring for assessment of treatment futility rules, decisions with regard to treatment duration with second- and third-generation DAAs are not guided by monitoring for treatment viral kinetics, although diagnostic tests remain critical for the management of patients with HCV. Virologic responses to the newest therapies depend not only on prior treatment experience, including response to previous anti-HCV treatment and other pretreatment clinical indicators, but also on viral genotype and subtype as well as baseline viral load in order to determine the optimal treatment regimen and its duration. The combination of the NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir plus the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir has been formulated into a single tablet, which has received approval in Europe and the United States for the treatment of HCV infections. Approval was granted based upon trials that reported SVR rates of > 90% (and up to 99%) in HCV genotype 1-infected patients treated with an all-oral, one pill/day regimen. The approved label for this combination indicates that treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients with a baseline viral load of < 6 million IU/ml are eligible for as few as 8 weeks of therapy whereas all others should receive a full 12 weeks of therapy. As seen previously with the establishment of RGT rules, no attention was paid during the establishment of this treatment truncation rule to the different performance characteristics of commercially available viral load tests and how they compare to those of the single, manual method used in clinical trials but not widely used in clinical practice. Independent studies designed to evaluate the clinical impact of assay variability and the time of sampling as determinants of treatment truncation for this regimen found that a substantial proportion of patients had fluctuating viral loads above and below 6 million IU/ml at different screening time points that could potentially impact treatment decisions. Based on the known bias between quantitative values given by HPS and ART assays and preliminary data from this and other studies, a viral load of 2 million IU/ml with ART could be considered equivalent to 6 million IU/ml with HPS.

AASLD–IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — medical management and transmission prevention in acute HCV infection states that after the initial diagnosis of acute HCV with viremia (defined as quantifiable RNA), HCV treatment should be initiated without awaiting spontaneous resolution (I, B). Counseling is recommended for patients with acute HCV infection to avoid hepatotoxic insults, including hepatotoxic drugs (e.g., acetaminophen) and alcohol consumption, and to reduce the risk of HCV transmission to others (I, C). Referral to an addiction medicine specialist is recommended for patients with acute HCV infection related to substance use (I, B).

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C testing… [^1179G7Pm]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

This report introduces four new CDC recommendations: 1) HCV testing of all perinatally exposed infants with a nucleic acid test for detection of HCV RNA at age 2–6 months; 2) consultation with a health care provider with expertise in pediatric hepatitis C management for all. infants and children with detectable HCV RNA; 3) perinatally exposed infants and children with an undetectable HCV RNA result at or after age 2 months do not require further follow-up unless clinically warranted; and 4) a NAT for HCV RNA is recommended for perinatally. exposed infants and children aged 7–17 months who previously have not been tested, and a hepatitis C virus antibody test followed by a reflex NAT for HCV RNA is recommended for perinatally exposed children aged ≥ 18 months who previously have not been tested.

Proper identification of perinatally infected children, referral to care, and curative treatment are critical to achieving the goal of hepatitis C elimination. Studies have estimated that chronic HCV infection will develop in 5. 8%–7. 2% of all perinatally exposed infants and children, and curative direct-acting antiviral therapy can be administered beginning at age 3 years. This approach would increase the chances of timely treatment and subsequent cure that can mitigate the consequences from chronic hepatitis C and limit further transmission. 37, 60–64). However, a recent study analyzed data from three prospective studies, accounting for interval censoring and left-truncated data, to evaluate HCV RNA clearance more precisely by age. Among 106 infants aged < 36 months with current infection included in the analysis, 57. 3% cleared by age 3 years and
65. 9% cleared by age 5 years.

Clearance is associated with sustained undetectable HCV RNA; viral RNA levels are initially high and then slowly decline. Antibody to hepatitis C virus typically persists for life but can wane over time. Limited studies have evaluated long-term outcomes among children perinatally infected with HCV. Of these children, 77% had persistently or intermittently abnormal ALT levels. In addition, ALT levels tended to be higher during the first year of life among those in the study who subsequently spontaneously cleared their infections. Another prospective study of 45 children with perinatally acquired HCV infection found that children who spontaneously cleared the infection had higher ALT levels during the first 2 years of life than those who did not.

Diagnosis of HCV Infection Among Pregnant Persons and Perinatally Infected Children Hepatitis C screening with an anti-HCV test is recommended for all pregnant persons during each pregnancy indicates current or past infection and should be followed with a NAT for HCV RNA. An undetectable HCV RNA result by NAT indicates no current HCV infection. A detectable HCV RNA result is indicative of current HCV infection, and the person should be linked to care and considered for treatment. NAT for HCV RNA cannot be used before age 2 months for diagnosis of perinatal HCV transmission because of false-negative results. Furthermore, the presence of HCV RNA during the first weeks of life might indicate contamination with maternal blood or passive transfer of maternal HCV RNA rather than newly established HCV infection of the infant.

### Assessment of hepatitis C virus-RNA clearance under combination therapy for hepatitis C virus genotype 1: performance of the transcription-mediated amplification assay [^115HHfXy]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2008). Low credibility.

Monitoring of HCV-RNA in blood during antiviral therapy is performed mostly by commercially available reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-based (RT-PCR) assays, with a lower detection limit of 30–50 IU/mL of HCV-RNA. Use of different tests in the pivotal trials of combination therapy has generated some discordance, in terms of predictive value of the early virological response (EVR). To evaluate whether the use of a more sensitive test, as a qualitative assay based on transcription mediated amplification (TMA) with a lower detection limit of 5–10 IU/mL of HCV-RNA, may obtain a better prediction of EVR and of the ultimate virological outcome, we retrospectively evaluated serial samples from 108 naïve patients with HCV genotype 1 chronic hepatitis, treated with pegylated alpha2b interferon plus ribavirin for 48 weeks and with a 24 weeks stopping rule. Serum samples of patients, obtained during treatment at weeks 4, 12, 24 and 48 and after treatment at week 24, were evaluated by TMA. Comparison of the RT-PCR and TMA assays for the qualitative detection of HCV-RNA showed no significant differences in performance when these tests were used at the end of the treatment period for assessing patients without an on-treatment virological response and those who eventually obtain a sustained virological response. Our results show instead that the use of TMA assay to detect HCV-RNA at 12 and 24 weeks of the combination therapy is more effective than RT-PCR in identifying patients with the highest probability of sustained HCV-RNA clearance.

### Rapid viral response and treatment outcome in genotype 2 and 3 chronic hepatitis C: comparison between two HCV RNA quantitation methods [^112TZfC3]. Journal of Medical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Fifty consecutive patients with genotype 2 or 3 chronic hepatitis C were treated with peg-IFN alfa-2a 135 microg weekly and ribavirin (11 mg/kg body weight) daily during 24 weeks. Rapid viral response treatment week 4, end-of-treatment response, and sustained viral response were analyzed by two different HCV RNA quantitation methods, the Cobas Amplicor Monitor test and the TaqMan test with a sensitivity of 600 and 15 IU/ml, respectively. The TaqMan test differentiated patients with rapid viral response finally achieving sustained viral response better. Hence, patients with and without rapid viral response as tested by the TaqMan test finally achieved sustained viral response in 97% (32/33) versus in 75% (12/16), P < 0.017. The corresponding figures for the Cobas Amplicor test was 91% (41/45) versus (80%) 4/5 a non-significant difference. In conclusion, the more sensitive TaqMan test yielded a lower number of patients with rapid viral response than the less sensitive Amplicor Monitor test, but predicted sustained viral response in a higher percentage of patients with rapid viral response than the Amplicor Monitor test. A rapid viral response meaning HCV RNA levels < 15 IU/ml predicted a sustained viral response in 97% of patients with genotype 2 or 3.

### Minimum target prices for production of direct-acting antivirals and associated diagnostics to combat hepatitis C virus [^112TwNGk]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment scaleup for the estimated 150 million people infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains an unresolved public health challenge, and up to 500,000 people die annually as a result of HCV-related liver complications. For widespread treatment of HCV in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to be feasible, short-course antiviral treatments need to be available at very low costs. Several combinations of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have been recently licensed or are being developed that can cure HCV in the majority of treatment-naïve patients for a range of genotypes. These drugs generally have a good safety profile and rates of sustained virological response (SVR) close to 100%, including in traditionally difficult-to-treat patients. The promising clinical trial results for these DAAs suggest they will eventually replace current interferon (IFN)-based treatment.

The U.S. launch prices for a 12-week course of the recently approved DAAs, sofosbuvir and simeprevir, are US$84,000 and US$66,000, respectively. At these prices, treatment would be out of reach for the majority of those in need in LMICs, and these medications would need to be rationed in many high-income settings. However, we have previously estimated that minimum production costs of sofosbuvir and simeprevir could be as low as US$68–136 and US$130–270, respectively, with economies of scale. Achieving these low prices is necessary to facilitate treatment scaleup.

The ability to diagnose and monitor HCV simply and inexpensively will be important to ensure widespread access to HCV treatment. At present, because of the limited efficacy and poor tolerability profile of current treatments, HCV diagnosis and monitoring requires a range of complex tests before and during treatment, including genotyping, HCV-RNA quantification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, and FibroScan to evaluate severity of liver disease. Most resource-limited settings are not equipped to undertake complex laboratory diagnostics at scale. Furthermore, with current treatments, regimen duration and rates of treatment success are highly dependent on the infecting genotype, which varies significantly in its relative prevalence worldwide. Encouragingly, the improved side-effect profile and high SVR rates of new DAAs should allow for simplification of both diagnosis and monitoring of patients and may offer the potential for a standardized package of care of patients.

Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection — abbreviated direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens: There are presently insufficient data to recommend abbreviated courses of any approved DAA regimens; until more definitive data are available, recommended treatment is as described for chronic hepatitis C infection in the online HCV guidance. Pangenotypic regimens, as recommended in the simplified HCV treatment section, represent the preferred choice for eligible patients, and for patients who are ineligible for simplified HCV treatment, genotyping may be considered to guide DAA regimen selection.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^117BgRbA]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic testing in infants and children — confirmation and chronicity criteria are specified: because of intermittent viremia, a single negative HCV RNA test is not conclusive, and two negative HCV RNA results obtained at or after age 2 months, including at least one test at or after age 12 months, definitively excludes HCV infection in an HCV-exposed infant (BIII); two positive HCV RNA results before age 18 months are required for definitive diagnosis (BIII). Most children with perinatal HCV infection will have a positive HCV RNA test by age 12 months. In children aged > 18 months, a positive anti-HCV antibody test indicates prior HCV infection, and supplemental HCV RNA testing is recommended to clarify whether the antibody reflects chronic active or resolved infection (AIII). A positive HCV RNA test confirms current HCV infection and, if positive for > 6 months, indicates chronic infection. Quantitative tests (branched-chain DNA amplification, quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR], and real-time PCR) are most useful for monitoring response to anti-HCV therapy; quantitative HCV RNA level does not correlate with degree of liver damage or measure disease severity, and continued use of the same quantitative assay for serial monitoring is strongly recommended.

### Excellent superiority and specificity of COBAS taqMan HCV assay in an early viral kinetic change during pegylated interferon α-2b plus ribavirin treatment [^113SFDrE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Previous studies demonstrated that PEG-IFN plus RBV treatment dramatically increased SVR rate in patients with HCV infection and thus are currently the gold standard of treatment. The most significant predictors of SVR to IFN treatment for patients with chronic HCV infection are absence of severe fibrosis or cirrhosis, non-genotype 1 and pretreatment serum low HCV RNA level. With regard to virological factor after the start of antiviral treatment, early clearance of HCV RNA, or rapid decline of HCV RNA level during the early treatment duration is predictive of SVR among patients treated with IFN treatment. For monitoring of the antiviral response to IFN treatment, both reverse-transcription PCR and branched DNA have been developed and have become available for clinical use. These assays are especially useful because the early monitoring of favorable viral kinetics has a direct bearing on the possibility of a sustained response by IFN treatment. Actually, our findings showed that pretreatment HCV RNA by TaqMan assay may be a predictive factor for SVR, but not by Amplicor 10-fold method assay, and that TaqMan assay is more useful than qualitative Amplicor assay in analysis of the early stage (at the initial 4 and 8 weeks) of HCV dynamics, which is most related with SVR. Early prediction of early virologic response to IFN based treatment can help identify patients who are unlikely to have SVR and allow clinicians to discontinuation of treatment, saving patients the drug-induced adverse events and cost of additional treatment.

Discussion

Measurement of serum HCV RNA level is absolutely imperative for the treatment of chronic HCV infection, because this is an effective predictive and indicative factor for the response of IFN therapy and duration of therapy. A more useful analysis is the time to first undetectability and its relation to the end of treatment response, relapse rate and SVR. Therefore, an advanced technique for detecting serum HCV RNA during the antiviral treatment needs a high degree of accuracy. The ideal molecular analysis for HCV RNA level has to be sensitive, accurate and have a broad dynamic range to monitor viral load changes during antiviral therapy. TaqMan assay is useful for simultaneously analyzing qualitative and quantitative HCV RNA level in serum. The present study included only patients infected with chronic HCV genotype 1, who received a full of 48-week treatment of PEG-IFN plus RBV combination with target dosages of both drugs (PEG-IFN alpha-2b 80% or over and RBV 60% or over of the above prescribed dosage). We believed that analyzing the exact response factors for antiviral treatment should be considered only under this enough dosage of the combined treatment. The present study showed the superiority of TaqMan assay over Amplicor assay for analyzing the early prediction of virologic response to antiviral therapy.

TaqMan assay, the performance of a fully automated system based on the real-time PCR technology, was evaluated for nucleic acid extraction from plasma. This results in enhanced user convenience, a great reduction in labor requirements minimizing hands-on time and a decrease the risk of sample contaminations. TaqMan assay was extremely sensitive with a linear dynamic range up to 6.6 log IU/mL (0.015–69,000 kIU/mL: 1.2–7.8 log IU/mL). Otherwise, Amplicor 10-fold method assay had a narrower linear dynamic range up to 3.0 log IU/mL (5–5,000 kIU/mL: 3.7–6.7 log IU/mL) than TaqMan assay and qualitative Amplicor assay, the lower limit of detection was 50 IU/mL (1.7 log IU/mL). These different ranges can explain significant differences in the pretreatment HCV RNA levels and the reduction rates of HCV RNA levels during an antiviral treatment between TaqMan and Amplicor assays.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1146p3dU]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing methods and confirmatory approach — The sensitivity and specificity of the lone FDA-approved point-of-care test are similar to laboratory-based assays, but a positive HCV-antibody test indicates current (active) HCV infection, a past resolved infection, or rarely a false-positive result, and a test to detect HCV viremia is necessary to confirm active HCV infection. Ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing, which requires a single blood collection and avoids a return visit for confirmatory testing. Collection of dried blood spots is an option for sequential HCV-antibody and reflex HCV-RNA testing, and dried blood spot collection can be accomplished with a fingerstick rather than venepuncture and transport does not require an intact cold chain, making this advantageous where phlebotomy is a testing barrier. An FDA-approved quantitative or qualitative HCV-RNA assay should be used; immunocompromised persons and those with possible HCV exposure in the prior 6 months may be HCV antibody–negative, and HCV-RNA testing is a consideration for these individuals. If clarification is needed to differentiate resolved infection from biologic false positivity, repeat testing with a different HCV-antibody assay can be undertaken, and a false positive result is more likely when the anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio is low.

AASLD-IDSA hepatitis C virus (HCV) guidance 2023 update — key targets and changes — notes the World Health Organization goal of elimination of viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030 and lists specific HCV elimination targets that include a 90% reduction in incidence and prevalence, treatment of 80% of eligible persons with chronic infection, a 65% reduction in HCV-related deaths, and universal access to key prevention and treatment services. Under the umbrella of the HCV guidance, the AASLD-IDSA HCV Guidance Panel also issues regular, periodic published updates to review new or updated data and recommendations. Major changes in the HCV guidance since the previous 2020 publication featured in this update include an ongoing emphasis on universal HCV screening; new recommendations that address the management of incomplete treatment adherence; updated recommendations regarding simplified treatment with minimal monitoring and expanded eligibility; management and treatment recommendations for solid organ transplant recipients; newly expanded treatment and retreatment recommendations for children and adolescents; and screening, management, and treatment recommendations for unique and key populations.

AASLD–IDSA simplified HCV treatment — on‑treatment and post‑treatment monitoring for treatment‑naive adults without cirrhosis advises to inform patients taking diabetes medication of the potential for symptomatic hypoglycemia with monitoring for hypoglycemia recommended, and to inform patients taking warfarin of potential anticoagulation changes with monitoring INR for subtherapeutic anticoagulation recommended; no laboratory monitoring is required for other patients. Post‑treatment, assessment of quantitative HCV RNA and a hepatic function panel are recommended 12 weeks or later following completion of therapy to confirm undetectable HCV RNA and transaminase normalization. After achieving cure, no liver‑related follow‑up is recommended for noncirrhotic patients; those with ongoing risk should be tested for HCV RNA annually and whenever they develop elevated ALT, AST, or bilirubin. If initial treatment fails, patients should be evaluated for retreatment, and for those unable to be retreated, assessment for disease progression every 6 to 12 months with a hepatic function panel, CBC, and INR is recommended.

### Transient reappearance of serum hepatitis C virus RNA observed by real-time PCR during antiviral therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin in patients with HCV genotype 1b [^114mMWNs]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The "response-guided therapy" based on response of hepatitis C virus (HCV) during antiviral combination therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin is important for patients with HCV genotype 1. However, the sensitivity of previous assays for serum HCV RNA is limited.

Objectives

We evaluated the changes in serum HCV RNA during the combination therapy using a novel method for measurement based on real-time PCR.

Study Design

Changes in serum HCV RNA during the combination therapy were reanalyzed using TaqMan PCR assay in 144 patients with chronic HCV genotype 1b infection who underwent the therapy under HCV RNA monitoring with the Amplicor Monitor assay. Treatment duration was elongated from 48 weeks to 72 weeks in 17 patients based on the time when serum HCV RNA became negative.

Results

In 9 of 144 (6.3%) patients, serum HCV RNA transiently appeared again on the TaqMan PCR assay after having previously become negative. At the point of reappearance, the Amplicor Monitor assay gave a negative result in all patients, and no flare of alanine aminotransferase activity was observed. Each of the 9 patients achieved an end-of-treatment response but relapsed after the end of treatment, including 3 patients in whom the treatment duration was elongated to 72 weeks.

Conclusions

Attention should be paid to this phenomenon in the antiviral treatment for patients with HCV infection. The transient reappearance of HCV RNA in the serum indicates a high likelihood of relapse, and is likely to be missed without frequent measurements by a sensitive detection method.

Genotype 1

Week 12 stopping rule for patients with HCV genotype 1

The current week 12 stopping rule recommends that patients without a ≥ 2 log 10 drop in viral load compared to baseline (between 19% and 29% of patients with genotype 1 infection) discontinue therapy since the likelihood of achieving SVR with continued treatment is small; the negative predictive value is almost 100%. Over-treatment of patients who have an extremely low chance of achieving SVR is thus avoided and valuable resources can be reserved for patients with a higher chance of treatment success. Week 12 monitoring should be carried out as close as possible to the week 12 time point, ideally ± 5 days, using a test with high sensitivity and wide dynamic range. Whether the 2 log 10 drop represents the most accurate cut-off level for the decision on treatment termination or proceeding remains to be determined in prospective clinical studies. It is likely that with greater use of more sensitive assays with a broader range of linear quantification (e.g. real-time PCR assays), this parameter may be refined/adjusted in the near future. It may also be the case that new drugs currently in development will require different threshold levels and/or stopping rules based on their different modes of action, although this remains to be seen.

### Clinical performance of the VERIS HCV assay for hepatitis C virus RNA quantification [^11515TyA]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and treatment monitoring rely on detection/quantification of HCV RNA and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques are expected to equivalently quantify the different HCV genotypes.

Objective

The clinical performance of the VERIS HCV assay for HCV RNA quantification was compared to that of the Abbott RealTime HCV assay.

Study Design

Qualitative concordance and quantitative comparison were evaluated on a first panel of 286 clinical samples containing HCV genotypes 1–6. Forty additional genotype 4 samples were tested to explore genotype 4 HCV RNA underquantification.

Results

Qualitative discrepancies were observed for low viral loads (< 2 log 10 IU/mL) in patients under antiviral therapy and would not have had any impact on patients' management with the current guidelines for the monitoring of patients on direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Quantification results were well correlated (R² = 0.89) with an overall minimal quantification bias (mean VERIS - Abbott difference) of -0.09 log 10 IU/mL. Quantification agreement for genotypes 1, 2 and 3 samples was excellent, but reached -0.57 log 10 IU/mL for 46 genotype 4 samples. A lower quantification bias of -0.24 log 10 IU/mL was observed when testing 40 additional genotype 4 samples with a second reagent lot. Underquantification was not associated with 5' untranslated region (UTR) sequence polymorphisms but could be explained by 5' UTR RNA molecular modeling.

Conclusion

HCV RNA quantification by the VERIS HCV assay and the Abbott RealTime HCV assay was well correlated for all HCV genotypes, except genotype 4 where 5' UTR RNA folding may impact quantification. Nevertheless, this underestimation of HCV RNA levels had no impact on clinical use.
