## Question

Do you anticoagulants before you ablation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether anticoagulation should be continued or interrupted before atrial fibrillation catheter ablation, and how to structure the periprocedural plan including DOAC timing, intraprocedural heparin, TEE, and post-procedure duration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-level guideline direction on uninterrupted versus interrupted strategies. Then, I should verify the evidence base supporting uninterrupted anticoagulation, especially for DOACs. Next, I will examine intraprocedural heparin targets and whether DOAC levels complicate ACT monitoring. After that, I need to check when TEE is indicated and whether it can be omitted in some uninterrupted DOAC patients. Finally, I will review post-ablation duration and how long-term anticoagulation should be decided by stroke risk rather than procedural success.

> Let me first confirm the guideline stance so I don't jump to conclusions. Contemporary guidelines consistently recommend performing AF ablation with uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation: for warfarin, maintain INR 2.0–3.0; for DOACs, either continuous or minimally interrupted dosing is acceptable, and this approach reduces thromboembolism without excess bleeding compared with interrupted strategies, which aligns with both North American and European guidance [^113GJkHx] [^1165kZWx] [^111qDSWo] [^111Fia6z] [^112qermU].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base supporting uninterrupted DOACs. The RE-CIRCUIT randomized trial showed uninterrupted dabigatran reduced major bleeding versus uninterrupted warfarin (1.6% vs 6.9%) with fewer tamponades and no strokes on dabigatran, while VENTURE-AF suggested favorable signals with rivaroxaban versus warfarin. Pooled analyses corroborate lower major bleeding with uninterrupted DOACs versus VKAs, supporting a Class I recommendation for dabigatran and rivaroxaban and a Class IIa for other Xa inhibitors in this setting [^117GXpvr] [^111EEAGL] [^113vAY6b].

> Hold on, I should verify the intraprocedural plan because this is where practice nuances matter. Regardless of pre-procedural anticoagulation, unfractionated heparin should be administered before or immediately after transseptal puncture with a target ACT of at least 300 seconds, often 300–350 or even 300–400 seconds depending on center protocol, with frequent ACT checks and continuous heparinized sheath flushes; patients on DOACs may require higher heparin loads to achieve target ACT, and some centers individualize dosing accordingly [^117FPr8h] [^114B8j7z] [^112e7eLG] [^113vAY6b].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought DOAC levels might reliably guide intraprocedural heparin dosing, but I should double-check that assumption. ACT correlates poorly with DOAC concentrations, and pre-procedural DOAC levels can be highly variable even after holding doses, complicating ACT-based titration; thus, ACT remains the pragmatic intraprocedural target, but operators should anticipate higher heparin requirements and consider early, aggressive heparinization while acknowledging the limitations of ACT in DOAC-treated patients [^113RqGHK] [^114oatBy].

> Next, I should review when to obtain pre-ablation TEE so I don't overuse it. TEE is indicated if AF duration is > 48 hours or unknown and there has been inadequate therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks, or if anticoagulation is being interrupted or initiated just before the procedure; importantly, in patients on uninterrupted DOACs for at least 3–4 weeks, large registries suggest TEE can often be omitted when intracardiac echocardiography is used to visualize the LAA, though practice varies and shared decision-making is prudent [^111Y2mvh] [^116BbEnQ] [^1176gHLX] [^111FZPRB].

> I need to ensure the post-ablation plan is explicit. Guidelines recommend continuing therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 2–3 months after ablation in all patients, irrespective of rhythm outcome, because the early post-procedural period carries elevated thromboembolic risk. Thereafter, decisions should be based on stroke risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc/VA), not on apparent procedural success, and ablation should not be performed with the intent to stop anticoagulation in high-risk patients [^113hxTwH] [^1136KyqC] [^114QEgYk] [^116crpcz].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a DOAC and we're worried about bleeding during the case. Minimal interruption strategies, such as skipping one dose for once-daily agents or holding the morning dose for twice-daily agents, have shown comparable safety and efficacy to uninterrupted regimens in randomized data, and contemporary guidance allows either continuous or minimally interrupted DOACs, so a brief hold is reasonable if bleeding risk is a particular concern [^112L1ZG6] [^111qDSWo].

> I should confirm the practical steps to implement this. For warfarin, continue without interruption and aim for INR 2.0–3.0. For DOACs, either continue uninterrupted or hold 1–2 doses based on agent and bleeding risk, then resume promptly after hemostasis. Intraprocedurally, give heparin early with ACT targets ≥ 300 seconds and adjust boluses/infusion to maintain therapeutic ACT with frequent checks. Post-procedurally, restart or continue the oral anticoagulant within a few hours once hemostasis is secured and maintain for at least 2–3 months before transitioning to stroke risk–based long-term management [^113GJkHx] [^117FPr8h] [^113hxTwH] [^111qh27E].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping anticoagulation after a "successful" ablation. Observational and registry data indicate that stroke risk persists in higher CHA₂DS₂-VASc patients even after apparent rhythm success, and contemporary cohorts suggest that discontinuation increases thromboembolic events in some phenotypes, so long-term anticoagulation should follow standard AF stroke risk schemes rather than ablation outcomes, with enhanced monitoring considered if anticoagulation is stopped in select lower-risk patients [^112bnrkV] [^112YhJaG] [^116crpcz].

---

In general, **anticoagulation is continued before ablation** for atrial fibrillation, using an uninterrupted strategy for warfarin (INR 2.0–3.0) [^1165kZWx] or continuous/minimally interrupted DOACs [^111qDSWo], to balance thromboembolic and bleeding risks [^114cQRzH]. For ventricular arrhythmia ablation, **anticoagulation is individualized** — continued if indicated for AF/VT risk, otherwise held 2–3 days pre-procedure based on bleeding risk and procedural factors [^117MiD3C]. Pre-ablation TEE is recommended if AF duration is > 48 hours or unknown and anticoagulation is inadequate [^111Y2mvh] [^116BbEnQ]. Post-ablation, continue anticoagulation for at least 2–3 months [^113hxTwH], then tailor to stroke risk, not rhythm outcome [^114QEgYk].

## Anticoagulation before atrial fibrillation ablation

### Current guidelines and recommendations

- **Uninterrupted anticoagulation**: Recommended for AF ablation to reduce periprocedural thromboembolism without excess bleeding [^111Fia6z] [^113vAY6b].

- **Warfarin**: Maintain therapeutic INR (2.0–3.0) without interruption [^1165kZWx].

- **DOACs**: Use continuous or minimally interrupted dosing (skip 1–2 doses pre-procedure) [^111qDSWo] [^112L1ZG6].

- **Pre-ablation TEE**: Recommended if AF > 48 hours or unknown duration and inadequate anticoagulation [^111Y2mvh] [^116BbEnQ].

---

### Evidence supporting uninterrupted anticoagulation

Evidence includes the **RE-CIRCUIT trial**, which showed uninterrupted dabigatran reduced major bleeding versus warfarin (1.6% vs 6.9%) with no strokes in the dabigatran arm [^117GXpvr]. A meta-analysis likewise found **lower major bleeding and tamponade with uninterrupted DOACs versus VKAs**, with similar thromboembolic risk [^111EEAGL].

---

### Risks associated with interrupting anticoagulation

Interrupting anticoagulation increases **thromboembolic risk**, including stroke and systemic embolism, particularly in the first 2 weeks post-ablation [^115d6noZ]. It also increases **bleeding risk** due to the periprocedural prothrombotic state and vascular injury [^113vAY6b].

---

## Anticoagulation before ventricular arrhythmia ablation

### Current guidelines and recommendations

For ventricular arrhythmia ablation, **individualized anticoagulation** is advised, balancing thromboembolic and bleeding risks [^111hMewc]. Anticoagulation is generally continued when indicated for AF, VT risk, or prior thromboembolism. If interruption is needed, hold anticoagulation for 2–3 days pre-procedure based on bleeding risk and procedural factors.

---

### Evidence supporting individualized anticoagulation

Evidence is limited; decisions are guided by patient risk, procedural factors, and operator judgment [^111hMewc]. For VT ablation, **systemic heparinization** is recommended for left-sided procedures to reduce thromboembolism [^111hMewc].

---

## Special considerations and exceptions

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust DOAC dosing and timing pre-procedure [^117MiD3C].

- **High bleeding risk**: Consider minimally interrupted or individualized strategies [^117MiD3C].

- **Surgical ablation**: Anticoagulation is individualized based on stroke and bleeding risk [^114sShzU].

---

## Post-ablation anticoagulation management

Post-ablation anticoagulation should be continued for **at least 2–3 months** in all patients [^113hxTwH] [^1136KyqC]. Long-term therapy should be guided by **stroke risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc)** rather than rhythm outcome [^114QEgYk] [^116crpcz].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Procedure** | **Anticoagulation strategy** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| AF ablation | Uninterrupted anticoagulation (warfarin or DOACs) | High |
| VT ablation | Individualized strategy based on risk | Moderate |
| Pre-ablation TEE | If AF > 48 hours or unknown duration and inadequate anticoagulation | High |
| Post-ablation anticoagulation | Continue ≥ 2–3 months, then risk-based | High |

---

Anticoagulation is **continued before ablation**, with an uninterrupted strategy for AF and individualized plans for VT, to minimize thromboembolism while controlling bleeding risk [^111Fia6z] [^111hMewc].

Patient drug and ablation treatment

Pharmacologic treatment

Patients randomized to the drug therapy strategy were to first receive rate control medication if appropriate. Anti-arrhythmic medication use was guided by the Guidelines for Management of Subjects with AF published in 2006 by the ACC/AHA/ESC.

Ablative treatment arm

The NHLBI Work Group on AF Ablation, the AF Ablation Consensus document, and the Venice Chartdocuments all agreed that PVI should be the starting point for AF ablation for every patient in the trial, which has been subsequently adopted in three other large randomized clinical trials. – Adjunctive procedures such as enlarging the field of ablation for the targeting of complex fractionated atrial electrograms, sites of apparent ganglia, or the use of additional linear lesions was allowed as adjunctive therapy, but only after wider area or antral PVI was completed. The methods for each of these procedures are as outlined in the three AF Ablation Consensus Documents.

Guidelines for anti-thrombotic therapy

Drug treated patients with risk factors for cerebral vascular accidents or peripheral thromboembolic events at the time of enrollment, treated with rate control agents alone, were to remain on active anticoagulation therapy with warfarin throughout the duration of the trial. Unlike the AFFIRM trial, patients receiving rhythm control therapy were also required to receive warfarin anticoagulation for the duration of the trial. In the use of warfarin therapy, target INRs of 2 to 3 were required, unless higher INRs were mandated because of underlying disease.

Anticoagulation before, during, and after the ablative intervention was to follow the guidelines of the AF Ablation Consensus Document. Prior to the ablative intervention, patients with persistent and long-standing persistent AF were to receive at least one month of warfarin anticoagulation (INRs: 2,3), or have a TEE excluding intra-atrial thrombus at the time of the intervention. During the ablative intervention, maintaining an ACT between 300 and 400 seconds was strongly recommended. Following the ablative intervention, patients were to be started on IV heparin or subcutaneous injections of low molecular weight heparin beginning 4 to 6 hours after all sheaths were removed, and warfarin anticoagulation reinstituted the evening of the intervention.

4.6 Study Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, since the analyses were not conducted as part of a randomized controlled trial, caution must be exercised in deriving recommendations from the results. Second, the small number of patients enrolled in some subanalysis groups, and the insufficient number of thromboembolic events means that analyses of safety and efficacy outcomes may not have been adequate for each DOAC dose category, and the magnitude of differences may not have been large enough to identify in multivariate analyses adjusting for clinical risk factors. In addition, caution is needed due to differences in approved dosages and criteria for reducing DOAC doses in Japan compared to other regions. Finally, despite the prospective nature of this study, a significant limitation was seen in terms of the short follow‐up. In fact, the latest expert consensus statement states that "in the intermediate‐risk patients (CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc one in men and two in females) category, discontinuation of anticoagulation may be considered 12 months following CA in the absence of clinical symptoms or electrocardiographically documented AF recurrence". Separate strategies may, therefore, need to be considered for anticoagulation therapy before and after 1 year following CA.

Atrial fibrillation ablation — periprocedural anticoagulation evidence includes uninterrupted vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and non–vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) strategies. An initial large study found uninterrupted VKA anticoagulation "did not result in a higher incidence of tamponade compared with interrupted VKA anticoagulation therapy with bridging heparin". Another study "compared the outcomes of 23 patients who developed pericardial tamponade with an INR < 2 to 17 patients on warfarin with an INR > 2" and reported "No difference was observed in the initial pericardial drainage, or the duration of drainage; no patients required surgery". A "more recent shift" is performing ablation on uninterrupted NOAC therapy; the RE-CIRCUIT trial "was a head-to-head comparison of performing AF ablation on uninterrupted dabigatran vs uninterrupted warfarin", and "randomized 704 patients across 104 sites to these two anticoagulation strategies".

Catheter ablation to reduce stroke risk — systemic anticoagulation with warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) is recommended for at least 2 months post-catheter ablation of AF (Class I, LOE C-EO), and decisions regarding continuation of systemic anticoagulation more than 2 months postablation should be based on the patient's stroke risk profile and not on the perceived success or failure of the ablation procedure (Class I, LOE C-EO); anticoagulation is recommended for patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 in men or 3 in women, for those with one stroke risk factor (CHA2DS2-VASc 1 in men or 2 in women) OAC can be "considered", and anticoagulation is generally not recommended 2 or more months post-AF ablation for low-risk profiles (CHA2DS2-VASc 0 in men or 1 in women) unless cardioversion is anticipated or has recently been performed; adherence to AF anticoagulation guidelines is recommended regardless of apparent procedural success (Class I, LOE C-EO), patients contemplating discontinuation based on values and preferences should consider undergoing continuous or frequent ECG monitoring to screen for AF recurrence (Class IIb, LOE C-EO), and a patient's desire to eliminate long-term anticoagulation by itself should not be considered an appropriate selection criterion for AF ablation (Class III, LOE C-EO).

Anticoagulation Considerations Two or More Months Postablation

Whether elimination of AF or reduction of AF burden by catheter ablation results in a significant reduction in stroke risk is an important, and as yet unanswered, question. Until this important question is addressed by an adequately designed clinical trial, adherence to the AF anticoagulation guidelines is recommended for patients who have undergone AF ablation procedures, regardless of the apparent success or failure of the procedure (Class I, LOE C-EO, Table 4). The writing group advises that decisions regarding continuation of systemic anticoagulation more than 2 months postablation should be based on a patient's stroke risk profile and not on the apparent success or failure of the ablation procedure (Class I, LOE C-EO, Table 4). And finally, the writing group recommends that for patients in whom discontinuation of anticoagulation is being considered based on the patient's values and preferences, they should consider undergoing continuous or frequent ECG monitoring to screen for AF recurrence (Class IIb, LOE C-EO, Table 4). This recommendation is based on the following: (1) recurrences of AF are common both early and late following AF ablation; (2) asymptomatic AF is common, and is more common following AF ablation than prior to AF ablation; (3) AF ablation destroys a portion of the atria and the impact of this on stroke risk is uncertain; (4) there have been no large, randomized prospective trials that have assessed the safety of discontinuing anticoagulation in this patient population; (5) studies have shown that strokes in patients with AF might not be temporaneously related to an AF event; and (6) the use of direct thrombin inhibitors or Factor Xa inhibitors, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban and apixaban, is more convenient than warfarin.

Thermal ablation technique considerations — periprocedural and modality-specific: "Although clotting disorders should be corrected and anticoagulants should be withheld before all ablation procedures, LA uses a thinner guide needle for access… and by virtue of this may pose less risk of peri-procedural bleeding than other techniques". "HIFU is the only technique that does not necessitate the insertion of an applicator but is reportedly a more painful procedure… can take longer to perform, and is highly sensitive to movement, frequently necessitating conscious sedation… under local anesthesia". "Efficacy of HIFU is less established than the other techniques; however, the choice of technique is generally a matter of proceduralist preference, training, and skill set".

### 2012 HRS / EHRA / ECAS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: recommendations for patient selection, procedural techniques, patient management and follow-up, definitions, endpoints, and research trial design [^114fALa8]. Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation two or more months post AF ablation — consensus recommendation, rationale, and monitoring: It is the consensus of this Task Force Writing Group that systemic anticoagulation should be continued indefinitely in patients with a high risk for stroke as estimated by currently recommended schemes (CHADS2, or CHA2DS2VASc), especially those who are 75 years of age or older or with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA); this is based on observations that AF recurrences and asymptomatic AF are common, AF ablation destroys a portion of the atria with uncertain stroke impact, no large randomized trials have assessed stopping anticoagulation, and direct thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitors such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are more convenient than warfarin. A TRENDS sub-analysis identified a subgroup of 40 patients (1.6%) with stroke or systemic embolism and reported that 29 (73%) had a zero AF burden within 30 days prior to the event. For patients who stop systemic anticoagulation we recommend that some type of continuous monitoring be performed to screen for silent AF at regular intervals as long as they remain off systemic anticoagulation.

QM-9 atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation anticoagulation measure — The measure describes the percentage of patients, age ≥ 18 y, who underwent AF ablation who were not treated with anticoagulation therapy both during and after a procedure; the numerator is patients who were not treated with anticoagulation both during and after a procedure, and the denominator is all patients with AF who underwent catheter ablation, with denominator exclusions including patients who leave against medical advice, die during hospitalization, are on comfort care measures only, or are transferred to another acute care hospital, and a denominator exception for documentation of a medical reason for not prescribing warfarin or another FDA-approved anticoagulant to a patient with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥ 2; the measurement period is the encounter, sources of data are medical record or other databases, the measure is reportable at the facility or physician level, and the care setting is inpatient; the rationale notes that both intraprocedural heparin and oral anticoagulation are recommended for ≥ 2 months post-procedure and that AF catheter ablation should not be performed in patients who cannot be treated with anticoagulant therapy during and after the procedure, consistent with guideline language that "AF catheter ablation should not be performed in patients who cannot be treated with anticoagulant therapy during and after the procedure. (Class III, Level of Evidence: C)".

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^111qh27E]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation — postablation anticoagulation: In patients not therapeutically anticoagulated prior to ablation and in whom warfarin will be used postablation, low molecular weight heparin or intravenous heparin should be used as a bridge for initiation of systemic anticoagulation with warfarin following AF ablation; Time in therapeutic range (TTR) should be > 65% – 70% on warfarin. Systemic anticoagulation with warfarin or a NOAC is recommended for at least 2 months postcatheter ablation of AF, and adherence to AF anticoagulation guidelines is recommended regardless of apparent success or failure of the procedure. Decisions regarding continuation of systemic anticoagulation more than 2 months post ablation should be based on the patient's stroke risk profile and not on the perceived success or failure of the ablation procedure. In patients not anticoagulated prior to ablation or in whom anticoagulation with a NOAC or warfarin has been interrupted, administration of a NOAC 3 to 5 hours after achievement of hemostasis is reasonable postablation. Patients in whom discontinuation of anticoagulation is being considered based on patient values and preferences should consider undergoing continuous or frequent ECG monitoring to screen for AF recurrence.

### When is it appropriate to stop non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants before catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation? A multicentre prospective randomized study [^112L1ZG6]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Although a recent expert consensus statement has recommended periprocedural uninterrupted (UI) non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) during catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) as a Class I indication, there have been no clear randomized trials. We investigated the safety and efficacy of UI, procedure day single-dose skipped (SDS), and 24-hour skipped (24S) NOACs in patients undergoing AF ablation.

Methods and Results

In this prospective, open-label, randomized multicentre trial, 326 patients (75% male, 58 ± 11 years old) scheduled for AF catheter ablation were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to UI, SDS, and 24S at three tertiary hospitals. Bridging with low molecular weight heparin was carried out in the patients with persistent AF who were assigned to the 24S group. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban were assigned in order after randomization. The primary endpoint was the incidence of bleeding events within 1 month after ablation. The secondary endpoints included thrombo-embolic and other procedure-related complications. The intra-procedural heparin requirement was higher in the 24S group than others (P < 0.001), and the mean activated clotting time was comparable among the groups (P = 0.139). The incidence of major bleeding up to 1 month after ablation and a post-procedural reduction in the haemoglobin levels did not significantly differ among the treatment groups and different NOACs (P > 0.05). There were no fatal events or thrombo-embolic complications in all the three groups.

Conclusion

In patients undergoing AF ablation, UI NOACs and SDS or double dose skipped NOACs had a comparable efficacy and safety, regardless of the type of NOAC.

Atrial fibrillation catheter ablation — anticoagulation before and after catheter ablation includes the following directives: In patients on warfarin undergoing catheter ablation of AF, ablation "should be performed on uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation with a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0" (COR 1; LOE B-NR). In patients on a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), ablation "should be performed with either continuous or minimally interrupted oral anticoagulation" (COR 1; LOE A). After ablation, oral anticoagulation "should be continued for at least 3 months after the procedure with a longer duration determined by underlying risk" (COR 1; LOE B-NR). For longer-term therapy after ablation, continuation of oral anticoagulation "should be dictated according to the patient's stroke risk (eg, CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2)" (COR 1; LOE B-NR).

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115xgqXe]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial flutter (AFL) ablation outcomes and post-procedure management emphasize high acute success but substantial atrial fibrillation (AF) incidence, ongoing anticoagulation by risk, and vigilant monitoring. Procedural efficacy is high with "92% with a single procedure and 97% with multiple procedures in a meta-analysis", yet "the subsequent incidence of AF occurring after ablation of CTI-dependent AFL is reported to be 16% to 82%, with a higher incidence in patients with a history of AF before ablation than those without (53% versus 23% after 16–18 months; P < 0.05)", and "In 1 study, 82% of patients who underwent typical AFL ablation experienced new-onset AF during long-term follow-up (mean, 39 months)". Because AF may persist, "continued anticoagulation is recommended based on thromboembolic risk assessment", and "close follow-up and monitoring are recommended", with detection increasing "with more frequent monitoring and/or longer duration of follow-up", especially in those "at high risk of stroke or thromboembolism (≥ 2%/ year)". Monitoring options include that "Intermittent monitoring may be performed with ambulatory monitors or wearable devices", while "implantable devices can provide more prolonged and continuous monitoring", and "Implantable cardiac monitors have been used in multiple settings to detect AF, including after AF ablation or in patients with cryptogenic stroke".

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111Gy6R1]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

The "2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 12, 2022, to November 3, 2022, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through November 2022, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables, where appropriate.

Structure

Atrial fibrillation is the most sustained common arrhythmia, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing in the United States and globally. Recommendations from the "2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" and the "2019 AHA/ACC/HRS Focused Update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic risk assessment, anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occlusion, atrial fibrillation catheter or surgical ablation, and risk factor modification and atrial fibrillation prevention have been developed.

### 2012 HRS / EHRA / ECAS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: recommendations for patient selection, procedural techniques, patient management and follow-up, definitions, endpoints, and research trial design [^113xALB7].

Thromboembolism after atrial fibrillation ablation — stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) are key concerns, with the incidence of thrombo-embolism associated with AF ablation reported to be between 0% and 7%, and more than two-thirds of reviewed clinical trials reporting one or more cerebrovascular events; thromboembolic events typically occur within 24 hours with a high risk period for the first two weeks following ablation. Incidence of these events may be reduced by a combination of detailed pre-procedural imaging, a strict anticoagulation protocol, and careful control of radiofrequency energy to minimize char formation, and maintaining a constant heparinized flush through all long sheaths with access to the left atrium is strongly advised.

13 ANTICOAGULATION

The same strategy used in the general population for stroke prophylaxis with anticoagulants should be used in athletes. The prescription of DOAC depends on the clinical risk profile (mainly CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score). Sports involving direct physical contact or sports prone to trauma should be avoided in patients on DOAC. However, a short‐term withdrawal strategy can be devised for some athletes, allowing them to return to full sporting activity. Several studies, based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of DOAC in athletes treated for deep vein thrombosis, have proposed strategies for DOAC discontinuation in relation to the sports competition timing. The rationale of these methods is to encourage sporting activity at a time when the lowest DOAC concentration is reached after intake. This strategy is able to minimize competition‐related hemorrhagic risk and, at the same time, is able to reduce thrombotic risk by shifting the time of anticoagulant resumption to the end of a competition, when the risk of hemorrhagic trauma is practically absent.

The endurance sport activity individual's preference has to be considered in a complex shared decision‐making process. It seems prudent to advise to consider a stepwise approach, starting with a period of detraining ‐ often disagreed with by the individual — to determine whether AF is associated with exercise or not. Prior CHA₂DS₂-VASc score and the need for anticoagulant therapy after ablation are other aspects that need to be evaluated, particularly in those practicing contact sports. An early invasive approach with catheter ablation might be reasonable not only in those who quickly prove intolerant to medical therapy but also in selected endurance sport activity individuals who elect ablation as a first‐line strategy: recent data show ablation as an acceptable initial rhythm control strategy, at least for symptomatic AF athletes.,

In summary, an active and fit lifestyle is better than a sedentary lifestyle and also reduces the AF risk. Data suggests that the risk of developing AF seems to be related to the type and intensity of exercise. Endurance exercise far beyond the recommended amount in current guidelines, seems to be associated with higher AF risk. Athletes with AF can present with heterogeneous clinical symptoms or being asymptomatic. Although data is lacking, reduction in physical activity should be considered an initial approach in AF athletes. Symptomatic athletes should undergo medical therapy or be referred for ablation. DOAC, when needed, can be considered in AF athletes. AF ablation is recommended in exercising individuals with recurrent, symptomatic AF and/or in those who do not want drug therapy, given it impact on athletic performance.

Perioperative interruption and resumption of DOACs — evidence from randomized trials and observational analyses indicates that perioperative management in major DOAC vs warfarin trials was generally non-standardized with 15% to 20% receiving heparin bridging, and a meta-analysis of > 19,000 such patients reported perioperative ATE rates of 0.5% to 1.0% and major bleeding rates of 2% to 5%. Additional studies around catheter ablation showed mixed findings: an observational study reported an increase in bleeding with periprocedural DOAC continuation while another reported no difference, and a 306-patient randomized trial comparing 1-day interruption vs no interruption found no significant difference in bleeding outcomes (11.3% vs 9.7%; risk difference = 1.7%; 95% CI −5.5 to 8.8).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation risk assessment when initiating oral anticoagulation (OAC) — it is important to first assess thromboembolic and bleeding risks. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is the most extensively validated tool to assess stroke or systemic embolism risk; current ACC/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines recommend that men with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 and women with a score ≥ 3 take an OAC. Patients with lower scores may be considered for OAC based on additional clinical factors and patient preference. Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or rheumatic mitral stenosis are advised to take an OAC regardless of the CHA2DS2-VASc score; similar guidance exists for patients undergoing electrical cardioversion or AF ablation. The type of AF, symptoms, and AF burden do not usually affect OAC decision-making, although OAC for brief, asymptomatic, device-detected AF is uncertain. Several bleeding risk scores (e.g. HAS-BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, ATRIA) and definitions (e.g. ARC-HBR) exist, but none are perfectly discriminant.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — post‑procedure anticoagulation emphasizes risk‑based decisions and monitoring: decisions regarding the use of systemic anticoagulation more than two months following ablation should be based on the patient's risk factors for stroke and not on the presence or type of AF; discontinuation of systemic anticoagulation therapy post ablation is not recommended in patients who are at high risk of stroke as estimated by CHADS2 or CHA2DS2‑VASc; patients at increased risk for stroke in whom discontinuation is being considered should undergo some type of continuous ECG monitoring to screen for asymptomatic AF/AFL and AT; and for high‑risk patients motivated to stop anticoagulation, the authors state we recommend that some type of continuous monitoring be performed to screen for silent AF at regular intervals as long as they remain off systemic anticoagulation.

A survey of the writing group members shows that 51% perform a TEE in all patients presenting for AF ablation regardless of presenting rhythm and anticoagulation status. This survey also revealed that 71% of the writing group members perform a TEE in patients presenting AF who have been therapeutically anticoagulated for 3 or more weeks prior to ablation. Among patients who present for AF ablation in sinus rhythm who have not been previously anticoagulated, 78% of the writing group members routinely perform a TEE. Among patients presenting for AF ablation who are chronically anticoagulated with warfarin, 87% of the writing group members perform AF ablation on uninterrupted warfarin. Among patients undergoing AF ablation who are chronically maintained on a NOAC, 38% of the writing group members perform AF ablation on a patient receiving uninterrupted NOAC without withholding a dose. For patients not anticoagulated prior to ablation or in whom NOAC therapy is interrupted prior to ablation, 16% of the writing group members reinitiate the NOAC at 2 hours, 12% at 3 hours, 37% at 4 hours, and 35% at 4 or more hours after initially achieving hemostasis. It is important to recognize that this is a rapidly evolving area in AF ablation. The results of the above survey were obtained prior to publication of the results of the Randomized Evaluation of Dabigatran Etexilate Compared to Warfarin in Pulmonary Vein Ablation: Assessment of an Uninterrupted Periprocedural Anticoagulation Strategy (RE-CIRCUIT) trial, which demonstrated that performance of AF ablation on patients receiving uninterrupted dabigatran results in a lower rate of major bleeds compared with the uninterrupted warfarin strategy. Shown in Table 4 are the writing group recommendations concerning anticoagulation strategies prior to ablation. As with the anticoagulation guidelines for cardioversion of AF, if a thrombus is identified in the LAA prior to catheter ablation of AF, the AF ablation procedure should not be performed.

Aim

The "2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 12, 2022, to November 3, 2022, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through November 2022, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables, where appropriate.

Structure

Atrial fibrillation is the most sustained common arrhythmia, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing in the United States and globally. Recommendations from the "2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" and the "2019 AHA/ACC/HRS Focused Update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic risk assessment, anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occlusion, atrial fibrillation catheter or surgical ablation, and risk factor modification and atrial fibrillation prevention have been developed.

Table 12 — Bleeding endpoints and oral anticoagulation reporting for AF ablation trials specify ISTH-based thresholds and documentation. Major bleeding is defined as fatal bleeding and/or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ with listed sites, and/or bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 2 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) or more, or leading to transfusion of one or more units of blood. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleed is an acute or subacute clinically overt bleed that does not meet the criteria for a major bleed but prompts a clinical response such as hospital admission for bleeding, physician-guided medical or surgical treatment for bleeding, or change in antithrombotic therapy (including interruption or discontinuation). Minor bleeding is defined as all nonmajor bleeds. Incidence and discontinuation of oral anticoagulation should include documentation of the number and type at end of follow-up and, if discontinued, the number discontinuing, timing, reasons, and patients' clinical characteristics and stroke risk profile.

### Patterns of anticoagulation use and cardioembolic risk after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^115Sv2aN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Catheter ablation carries a class I recommendation for the management of symptomatic, drug‐refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). 1 Although one might expect that maintenance of sinus rhythm would lower the subsequent risk of stroke, systematic reviews of the available data do not necessarily support this notion. 2 Patients who undergo AF ablation may have other stroke risk factors that persist after ablation, and asymptomatic AF recurrences are not uncommon. 3, 4 In addition, ablation may modify electrical activation of the left atrial appendage and introduce consequent mechanical dysfunction. Accordingly, the current guidelines from the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Heart Rhythm Society state that "catheter ablation to restore sinus rhythm should not be performed with the sole intent of obviating the need for anticoagulation". 1

With limited data available on the need for and duration of anticoagulation after catheter ablation, considerable practice variation exists with respect to oral anticoagulation (OAC) after ablation. The prevailing consensus is that OAC with warfarin or non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) should be continued for at least 2 to 3 months after a successful ablation depending on patient preference and the estimated embolic and bleeding risks. 1, 5

Using data from a national administrative claims database of patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF in the United States, we sought to examine OAC practice patterns after ablation, such as rates and timing of OAC discontinuation, and the extent of NOAC use. We also aimed to assess the impact of OAC discontinuation on short‐ and long‐term risk of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and systemic embolism.

It also notes greater flexibility for low or moderate risk patients because current guidelines do not mandate systemic anticoagulation, and that patient preference plays a large role in this decision.

Section 7: Technical Aspects of Ablation to Maximize Safety and Anticoagulation

Prevention of Thromboembolism During and Following AF Ablation

Patients with AF are at increased risk of thromboembolism during, immediately following, and for several days to months after their ablation. ACE lesions have also been observed after AF ablation. The prothrombotic state associated with AF ablation results in a higher, but transient, thromboembolism risk in patients with AF who were identified as low-risk before ablation. Careful attention to anticoagulation of patients before, during, and after ablation for AF is critical to avoid the occurrence of a thromboembolism event. Consensus recommendations for anticoagulation prior to, during, and following ablation are summarized in Table 4. The ablation procedure leaves patients with substantial areas of damaged LA endothelium that can become a nidus for thrombus formation. Transseptal sheath placement and insertion of electrode catheters can precipitate thrombus formation on the catheter or on or within the sheath during the procedure. The atrial tissue can be stunned for weeks or months postprocedure, leading to impairment of normal contraction. Anticoagulation, in turn, contributes to some of the most common complications of the procedure, including hemopericardium, pericardial tamponade, and vascular complications. Therefore, attention must be paid to achieving the optimal safe level of anticoagulation throughout the process.

Screening for LAA Thrombi Prior to Ablation

Transesophageal Echocardiography

Thromboembolic stroke after AF ablation is a devastating consequence of an invasive procedure. One of the mechanisms could be dislodgement of a pre-existing clot that could be identified by a screening TEE. The risk of a thromboembolic event at the time of an AF ablation procedure varies, depending on a number of factors, including (1) the type of AF; (2) the presence, absence, and duration of AF as the presenting rhythm on the day of ablation; and (3) the patient's stroke risk profile, including LA size and CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. With careful, multiplanar inspection of the LAA and the number of LAA lobes, the TEE can also provide additional information to help guide the procedure, such as identification of a pre-existing pericardial effusion, globally impaired cardiac function, presence of an atrial septal defect (ASD) or persistent foramen ovale, or fibrosis of the interatrial septum after previous ablation. In addition, LA anatomical features, such as a thickened ridge toward the left PVs, PV stenosis or occlusion, or cor triatriatum, can be identified.

### Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation: results from a European survey [^115RQMCx]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Current data are limited regarding how electrophysiologists are integrating emerging technologies and updated atrial fibrillation (AF) guidelines into clinical practice.

Objective

This survey aimed to analyze the periprocedural management of patients undergoing AF ablation across Europe.

Methods

An online-based questionnaire was conducted between September and November 2024. An additional set of questions was sent to all participants 6 months later.

Results

A total of 203 physicians from 23 European countries participated; 53% had > 10 years of experience as electrophysiologists, 58% worked in university hospitals, and 63% worked in centers performing more than 400 procedures annually. Preprocedural imaging is routinely used by 53%, with computed tomography being the most common modality (47.7%). General anesthesia is used by 42.4%, and 29.6% of physicians do not interrupt anticoagulants before the procedure. In paroxysmal AF ablation, pulmonary vein isolation is the main strategy (93%). Point-by-point radiofrequency (RF) was the predominant energy source (68%), with 65% of physicians performing RF adopting a high-power strategy (> 50 W). For persistent AF ablation, high-density mapping catheters are used by 82.8%, and 66.4% perform additional lesions beyond pulmonary vein isolation, most commonly targeting low-voltage areas and aiming at posterior wall isolation. Between the 2 phases of the survey, half of the physicians switched from RF or cryoballoon to pulsed field ablation. Intermittent use of 24-hour Holter is the primary strategy in 44.3% of cases for monitoring AF recurrence.

Conclusion

This survey highlights some discrepancies between the routine clinical practice of European physicians performing AF ablation and European guidelines, emphasizing the need for better integration of emerging technologies and greater adherence to updated protocols across Europe.

8 Periprocedural Anticoagulation

Periprocedural anticoagulation is meant to limit the risk of periprocedural thromboembolism and comprises three management phases: (1) antithrombotic treatment before the ablation session; (2) intraprocedural anticoagulation; and (3) post‐procedural anticoagulation. Anticoagulation strategies and regimens need to be selected considering that even within therapeutic range, they may cause or worsen periprocedural bleeding. Bleeding is mostly observed at the site of vascular access, within the cardiovascular system (because of catheter‐induced cardiac or vessel perforation) and at peripheral sites, including intracranial, ocular, retroperitoneal.

8.1 Pre‐Ablation Anticoagulation

Most data relative to peri‐procedural anticoagulation is derived from studies of intermediate‐ to low‐quality. This is reflected in the recommendation scheme of the present guidelines, where the available evidence does not support anything more than a Class II indication.

Aside from patients with a low CHADS2, CHA2DS2‐VASc or CHA2DS2VA score and no pre‐existing antithrombotic treatment, most patients undergo catheter ablation under chronic anticoagulation. In comparison with an elevated risk of bleeding while bridging interrupted warfarin with subcutaneous heparin, use of uninterrupted warfarin was shown to provide a better safety profile. Subsequent studies showed that uninterrupted or minimally interrupted (i.e. dose reduction or discontinuation on the procedure day for once‐daily prescriptions, or pre‐procedural discontinuation on the day of ablation) NOACs were as effective as VKAs, and safer with respect to major bleeding. Therefore, uninterrupted or minimally interrupted NOAC treatment represents the currently preferred option. Table 5 shows details and a class of recommendation for peri‐procedural hemostasis and vascular access.

8.2 Intraprocedural Anticoagulation

Irrespective of the strategy used, intravenous heparin should be administered before or immediately following transseptal puncture. Heparin dosing should be adjusted to achieve and maintain an ACT of at least 300 s throughout the ablation procedure duration (Table 4).

### Is transesophageal echocardiography necessary in patients undergoing ablation of atrial fibrillation on an uninterrupted direct oral anticoagulant regimen? Results from a prospective multicenter registry [^1176gHLX]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Thromboembolic stroke is a rare but devastating consequence of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is recommended to rule out left atrial appendage thrombus; however, its use is variable.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess whether TEE is mandatory in patients undergoing AF ablation on uninterrupted direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).

Methods

Data from our prospective multicenter registry of patients with AF undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation on uninterrupted DOACs were analyzed. All the included patients were on anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks before ablation. All AF ablation procedures were performed under intracardiac echocardiography guidance. Before transseptal puncture, heparin bolus was administered, followed by continuous infusion, with a target activated clotting time of > 300 seconds.

Results

A total of 6186 patients (3180 on apixaban [51.4%], 2528 on rivaroxaban [40.9%], 404 on dabigatran [6.5%], and 74 on edoxaban [1.2%]) were analyzed. The mean age of the study population was 69.4 ± 10.3 years; 4194 patients (67.8%) were male, and 5120 patients (82.8%) had persistent and long-standing persistent AF. The mean CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was 2.86 ± 1.58; the mean CHADS₂ score was 1.65 ± 1.14. Intracardiac echocardiography ruled out left atrial appendage and left atrial thrombi in all patients and revealed "smoke" in 1672 patients (27.03%). Transient ischemic attack was noted in 1 patient with long-standing persistent AF in the setting of a missed dose of rivaroxaban before ablation.

Conclusion

Our study showed that performing AF ablation in patients on uninterrupted DOACs without TEE is safe and feasible in high stroke risk patients. Elimination of routine preablation TEE would have significant economic and clinical implications.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1122fZyw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Postprocedural anticoagulation management in patients on oral anticoagulants specifies that once adequate postprocedural hemostasis is achieved, anticoagulation should likely be restarted expeditiously. For procedures with low postprocedural bleeding risk, anticoagulation can likely be restarted 24 hours after the procedure, whereas if postprocedural bleeding risk is higher, therapeutic-dose anticoagulation should be delayed for 48 to 72 hours. For patients at high thrombotic risk who will be restarting VKA therapy, bridging anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulants may be considered once hemostasis is achieved, but such bridging is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and no decrease in thrombotic events in nonvalvular AF; if a DOAC is used postprocedurally, bridging anticoagulation should not be used. When surgeries or procedures are performed to control bleeding, restarting anticoagulation after the procedure may carry a higher bleeding risk; if the source of bleeding is identified and completely corrected with adequate hemostasis, restarting anticoagulation may be reasonable, and individualized strategies with close clinical monitoring apply when bleeding was not successfully controlled by surgical/procedural management.

The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA. Additional information and downloads of the text and anticoagulation cards in different languages can be found on an EHRA website (www.NOACforAF.eu).

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^1179XWKh]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

The need for periprocedural anticoagulation (with the use of interrupted or uninterrupted OAC strategies) and for intra-procedural anticoagulation (with the infusion of intravenous heparin to achieve a stable ACT above 300 seconds throughout the procedure duration) can exacerbate the bleeding risk and increase the volume of bleeding following the occurrence of one or more of the causes above. One initial large study reported that uninterrupted VKA anticoagulation therapy did not result in a higher incidence of tamponade compared with interrupted VKA anticoagulation therapy with bridging heparin. This observation was further corroborated by two meta-analyses. Another study compared the outcomes of 23 patients who developed pericardial tamponade with an INR < 2 to 17 patients on warfarin with an INR > 2. No difference was observed in the initial pericardial drainage, or the duration of drainage; no patients required surgery. A more recent shift in periprocedural anticoagulation strategies during AF ablation involves performing AF ablation on uninterrupted NOAC therapy. The results of the RE-CIRCUIT study, which was a head-to-head comparison of performing AF ablation on uninterrupted dabigatran vs uninterrupted warfarin, were recently published. This study randomized 704 patients across 104 sites to these two anticoagulation strategies. The incidence of major bleeding events during and up to 8 weeks postablation among the 635 patients who underwent AF ablation was significantly lower with dabigatran than with warfarin (5 patients [1.6%] vs 22 patients [6.9%]; absolute RD -5.3%; RR reduction 77%). It is notable that there were six patients with cardiac tamponade in the warfarin arm vs one in the dabigatran arm. All the patients with cardiac tamponade underwent successful pericardiocentesis with no need for surgical drainage. No strokes or other thromboembolic events occurred in the dabigatran arm compared with one TIA in the warfarin arm. No patients in the dabigatran arm required the specific reversal agent idarucizumab. Another smaller prospective trial of 250 patients that randomized patients to undergoing AF ablation on uninterrupted rivaroxaban versus uninterrupted warfarin has been published. The incidence of major bleeding was low (0.4%), and no patient developed pericardial tamponade. A recent meta-analysis reported that performance of AF ablation on NOACs was associated with a lower risk of minor bleeding and no major differences in the risk of stroke or TIA, cardiac tamponade, or groin hematomas. Another recent study described the outcomes of 16 patients who developed a pericardial effusion while taking an uninterrupted Xa inhibitor. Eleven occurred in the periprocedural setting and 5 occurred between 1 and 28 days postprocedure. All the patients underwent pericardiocentesis. Protamine and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate were given to all periprocedure cases. Two patients required surgery. There were no deaths in this series.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Table 4 — post-ablation anticoagulation after atrial fibrillation ablation indicates that in patients who are not therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin at the time of AF ablation, low molecular weight heparin or intravenous heparin should be used as a bridge to resumption of systemic anticoagulation with warfarin following AF ablation, and initiation of a direct thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitor after ablation may be considered as an alternative post procedure anticoagulation strategy. Because of the increased risk of post procedure bleeding on full dose low molecular weight heparin (1 mg/kg bid) a reduction of the dose to 0.5 mg/kg should be considered. Systemic anticoagulation with warfarin or a direct thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitor is recommended for at least two months following an AF ablation procedure. Decisions regarding the continuation of systemic anticoagulation agents more than two months following ablation should be based on the patient's risk factors for stroke and not on the presence or type of AF, and discontinuation of systemic anticoagulation therapy post ablation is not recommended in patients who are at high risk of stroke as estimated by currently recommended schemes (CHADS2, or CHA2DS2-VASc).

### Safety and efficacy of dabigatran versus warfarin in patients undergoing catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111qx333]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and search strategy

We performed a search on Medline (via Ovid and PubMed), Embase, and Cochrane (from inception to 13 April 2013) databases using the following search string: "atrial fibrillation" AND "ablation" AND "dabigatran".

The reference lists of the accessed full text articles were further researched for sources of potential information relevant to this analysis. Experts in the field were contacted to ensure that all important studies in this area were covered. Abstract authors in congresses were also contacted by email in order to retrieve additional information. The databases were reassessed before the completion of the manuscript to find if any of the included abstracts had been published as full text meanwhile.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The population, intervention, comparison, and outcome approach was used for conducting the meta-analysis. The population of interest included patients with AF. The intervention was catheter ablation of AF and the associated periprocedural anticoagulation. Comparisons were performed between the following groups: warfarin versus dabigatran; dabigatran 110 mg twice daily vs 150 mg twice daily. The primary outcomes were: major bleeding, thromboembolism, and all cause mortality. The presence of minor bleeding, when reported, was also assessed.

Only controlled trials (full text articles or conference abstracts) of patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF and treated either with warfarin or dabigatran before the procedure were selected.

The minimum necessary follow-up for study inclusion was until discharge after the procedure. Additionally, to be included, studies needed to provide information on assessment of all three major clinical outcome parameters: major bleeding, thromboembolism, and death.

The following exclusion criteria were defined: trials with no comparator (ie, warfarin), namely observational studies including only patients treated with dabigatran; starting of dabigatran treatment only after catheter ablation; and evaluation of efficacy restricted to laboratory or imaging end points.

To ensure that trials met the prespecified inclusion criteria, search results were reviewed by three investigators (RP, AB, BC), who needed to be in agreement for study selection.

Data extraction and presentation for the preparation of this manuscript followed the recommendations of the PRISMA group.

Study quality was formally evaluated using the Delphi Consensus criteria for randomised controlled trialsand a modified Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for Case Control Studiesby three reviewers (RP, AB, BC). An agreement, between the three reviewers was mandatory for the final classification of studies.

### Anesthesiologists guide to the 2019 AHA / ACC / HRS focused update for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation [^113WGsCK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Perioperative physicians should be well versed in atrial fibrillation (AF) management because it is the most common sustained arrythmia in the United States. In this narrative review of the 2019 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologists/Heart Rhythm Society Focused Update on Atrial Fibrillation, the authors detail the emergence of new evidence from completed studies that may affect the management of patients with AF presenting for surgery. Updates regarding non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) comprise the bulk of the update with newer evidence emerging regarding their equivalence and/or superiority compared to Coumadin. Apixaban is now the preferred drug of choice for first line stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF over Coumadin. Renal dysfunction and the management of patients with AF on hemodialysis is examined; in patients on hemodialysis with AF, the focused update recommends administration of either warfarin or dose-reduced apixaban. Evidence from new trials addressing the appropriate bridging of NOACs before surgery is discussed. Patients with nonvalvular AF may not exhibit an added benefit from bridging of anticoagulation, and perioperative physicians should balance the risks of stroke and major bleeding before surgery. Advances in nonpharmacologic treatment and management of AF are outlined, including left atrial appendage occlusion devices, catheter ablations, and electrical cardioversion. Anesthesiologists' understanding of these 2019 updated guidelines will allow for more adept optimization of patients with AF presenting for surgery.

### Current real-world status of off-label under-and over-dose of direct oral anticoagulants after atrial fibrillation ablation [^1158Ejdz]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the common cardiac arrhythmia worldwide. Catheter ablation (CA) is currently the most effective treatment for AF, however, approximately 2%–3% of patients undergoing AF ablation develop periprocedural complications such as thromboembolism (0.2%) and major bleeding (0.9%). Optimal perioperative anticoagulation therapy is essential to reduce the risk of these complications, and an uninterrupted anticoagulant strategy including direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and warfarin is recommended before AF ablation.

The Real‐world ablation therapY with anticOagUlants in Management of Atrial fibrillation (RYOUMA) registry was conducted to investigate the relationship between oral anticoagulants (OACs) therapy and efficacy/safety during the periprocedural and long‐term follow‐up periods in patients who underwent CA for nonvalvular AF in a real‐world setting. The RYOUMA registry revealed that some patients received off‐label underdose (13.1%) and some received off‐label overdose (4.7%). "Off‐label" describes the otherwise proper use of prescription drugs at a dose that is not in accordance with the approved dose criteria. A real‐world database and various meta‐analyses have shown that off‐label underdosing of DOACs increases the risk of thromboembolism while not decreasing the risk of major bleeding, whereas off‐label overdosing of DOACs is associated with increased risks of thromboembolic and major bleeding events compared with on‐label doses. Since this evidence is not based on a CA setting, how off‐label under‐ or overdosing affects efficacy and safety profiles during and after AF ablation remains unclear. We, therefore, conducted a subanalysis of the RYOUMA registry focusing on off‐label under‐ and overdosing.

This study aimed to identify efficacy and safety outcomes during the periprocedural and long‐term follow‐up periods among patients who had undergone CA for nonvalvular AF, focusing on (1) on‐label standard dose versus off‐label underdose; and (2) on‐label reduced dose versus off‐label overdose. In addition, we aimed to identify reasons for off‐label overdose occurring counter to approved dose reduction criteria and the novel risk score for bleeding adjusted to DOACs in addition to the existing risk score.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^117GXpvr]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation ablation — use of uninterrupted oral anticoagulation is common and supported by comparative trials and recommendations. Most operators initiate therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks prior to ablation in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc risk score of 2 or greater. In the RE-CIRCUIT randomized comparison of uninterrupted dabigatran versus warfarin, 704 patients across 104 sites were assigned to two strategies; among 635 patients undergoing AF ablation, major bleeding during and up to 8 weeks postablation was lower with dabigatran (5 patients [1.6%] vs 25 patients [6.9%]; absolute risk difference (RD) -5.3%, RR reduction 77%), with six cardiac tamponades in the warfarin arm versus one with dabigatran, no strokes in the dabigatran arm versus one TIA with warfarin, and two dabigatran patients requiring idarucizumab. A smaller head-to-head study of uninterrupted rivaroxaban versus warfarin (Venture-AF, N = 248) reported one major bleeding event, one ischemic stroke, and one vascular death, each in the warfarin arm. Based on these data, the writing committee states a Class I recommendation for performing AF ablation with uninterrupted dabigatran (Class I, LOE A) or rivaroxaban (Class I, LOE B-R), and a 2a recommendation for the other Xa inhibitors.

Anticoagulation during and following atrial fibrillation ablation — patients are "at increased risk of thromboembolism (TE) during, immediately following, and for several weeks to months after their ablation", and "careful attention to anticoagulation of patients before, during, and after ablation for AF is critical to avoid the occurrence of a TE event". The document states that "consensus recommendations for anticoagulation prior to, during, and following ablation are summarized in Table 4", and explains mechanisms for thrombosis, noting that the procedure "leaves patients with substantial areas of damaged LA endothelium that may become a nidus for thrombus formation", and that "transseptal sheath placement and insertion of electrode catheters can precipitate thrombus formation on the catheter or on or within the sheath during the procedure".

Antithrombotic therapy after AF ablation — The document states that discontinuation of warfarin or equivalent therapies post-ablation is not recommended in patients who have a high stroke risk as determined by the CHADS2, or CHA2DS2-VASc score. It also states that either aspirin or warfarin is appropriate for patients who do not have a high stroke risk, that if anticoagulation withdrawal is being considered, additional electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring may be required and a detailed discussion of risk versus benefit should be entertained, and that a patient's desire to eliminate the need for long-term anticoagulation by itself should not be considered an appropriate selection criterion.

Post-procedural anticoagulation after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — bridging, INR targets, and duration: "After removal of all sheaths, warfarin should be reinitiated within 4–6 h and low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (enoxaparin 0.5–1.0 mg/kg twice daily) or intravenous heparin should be used as a bridge to resumption of international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0–3.0". "Alternatively, a direct thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitor can be administered following ablation". "If warfarin was not interrupted before ablation, use of LMWH can be avoided; continue warfarin maintaining INR 2.0–3.0".

Implications for electrophysiology procedures and cognitive risk — screening, anticoagulation, and intraprocedural anticoagulation targets: The routine use of transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) to identify pre-existing thrombus remains controversial; in the most recent expert consensus, 51% perform a TOE in all atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation patients regardless of rhythm/anticoagulation, 71% perform a TOE in patients presenting in AF even on therapeutic anticoagulation, and 78% perform a TOE in patients not previously anticoagulated even in sinus rhythm, while computed tomography and intra-cardiac echocardiography have been used but large comparative evidence is lacking. Evidence suggests patients with an anticoagulation window or requiring bridging are at increased risk of peri-procedural events; uninterrupted anticoagulation ensures the full anticoagulant effect in the early post-procedural phase when embolic events are most likely, AF ablation has become routine on uninterrupted warfarin with a therapeutic INR, and emerging data support the safety of this approach for NOACs. Intraoperatively, more aggressive heparin dosing is supported by data that an activated clotting time (ACT) of < 300 s during the procedure carries increased risk of silent cerebral infarction, and the current consensus document recommends an ACT target of 300–400 with repeated checks at 15–20 min intervals.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^1121JKD9]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Less information is available concerning the optimal approaches to anticoagulation following surgical ablation of AF. Many variables need to be considered, including whether the patient underwent ligation of their LAA and the patient's stroke risk profile. At the present time, there is little to no evaluable evidence for or against the merits of anticoagulation following surgical ablation when the LAA has been surgically obliterated. In the absence of current evidence, the decision to anticoagulate and the duration of treatment should be made on an individual basis weighing the risks and benefits of anticoagulation in the postsurgical patient. It is, however, not unreasonable to anticoagulate for several months following surgical ablation, provided there are no other bleeding risks. For patients in whom appendage closure or ligation was performed at the time of surgical ablation, and in whom discontinuation of anticoagulation is being considered, TEE-based assessment of whether complete appendage closure has been accomplished is recommended because incomplete closure of the LAA is not uncommon.

Anesthesia or Sedation During Ablation

Patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF are required to lie motionless on the procedure table for several hours, and repeated stimuli from ablation are sometimes painful. For these reasons, most patients are treated with conscious sedation or general anesthesia. The choice of approach is determined by the institutional preference and by assessment of the patient's suitability for conscious sedation.

### Periprocedural management of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation catheter ablation in direct oral anticoagulant-treated patients [^113RqGHK]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend performing atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation without interruption of a direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and to administer unfractionated heparin (UFH) for an activated clotting time (ACT) ≥ 300seconds, by analogy with vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Nevertheless, pharmacological differences between DOACs and VKA, especially regarding ACT sensitivity and UFH response, prevent extrapolation from VKA to DOACs.

Hypothesis

The level of anticoagulation at the time of the procedure in uninterrupted DOAC-treated patients is unpredictable and would complicate intraprocedural UFH administration and monitoring.

Methods

This prospective study included interrupted DOAC-treated patients requiring AF ablation. Preprocedural DOAC concentration ([DOAC]), intraprocedural UFH administration, and ACT values were recorded. A cohort of DOAC-treated patients requiring flutter catheter ablation was considered to illustrate [DOAC] without DOAC interruption.

Results

Forty-eight patients underwent AF and 14 patients underwent flutter ablation, respectively. In uninterrupted DOAC-treated patients, [DOAC] ranged from ≤ 30 to 466ng/mL. When DOAC were interrupted, from 54 to 218hours, [DOAC] were minimal (maximum: 36ng/mL), preventing DOAC-ACT interference. Anyway, ACT values were poorly correlated with UFH doses (R² = 0.2256).

Conclusions

Our data showed that uninterrupted DOAC therapy resulted in an unpredictable and highly variable initial level of anticoagulation before catheter ablation. Moreover, even with DOAC interruption preventing interference between DOAC, UFH, and ACT, intraprocedural UFH monitoring was complex. Altogether, our exploratory results call into question the appropriateness of transposing UFH dose protocols, as well as the relevance of ACT monitoring in uninterrupted DOAC-treated patients.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, peri-catheter ablation, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to decide on continuing anticoagulation for the long term based on the patient's stroke risk (such as CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2).

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^117MKywN]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

The results of the RE-CIRCUIT study were recently published, which was a head-to-head comparison of performing AF ablation on patients receiving uninterrupted dabigatran vs uninterrupted warfarin. This study randomized 704 patients across 104 sites to these two anticoagulation strategies. The incidence of major bleeding events during and up to 8 weeks postablation among the 635 patients who underwent AF ablation was significantly lower with dabigatran than with warfarin (5 patients [1.6%] vs 22 patients [6.9%]); absolute risk difference [RD] 25.3%, RR reduction 77%. There were six patients with cardiac tamponade in the warfarin arm vs one in the dabigatran arm. No strokes or other thromboembolic events occurred in the dabigatran arm compared with one TIA in the warfarin arm. No patients in the dabigatran arm required the specific reversal agent idarucizumab. There has been one other smaller head-to-head comparison published of uninterrupted rivaroxaban vs uninterrupted warfarin (Venture-AF, N = 248). This study reported one major bleeding event, one ischemic stroke, and one vascular death, each of which occurred in the warfarin arm of the study. A third trial of apixaban vs coumadin is also underway (NCT02227550).

Based on these clinical trials, it is now apparent that a strategy of performing AF ablation on patients receiving uninterrupted anticoagulation can be performed safely and minimizes the risk of thromboembolic events. specific recommendations for pre- and intraprocedure anticoagulation are shown in Table 4. Although further studies are needed to further define the efficacy and safety of performing AF ablation on uninterrupted Factor XA inhibitors or direct thrombin inhibitors, the writing committee believes that the data and worldwide experience are now sufficient to provide a Class I recommendation for performing AF ablation with uninterrupted dabigatran (Class I, LOE A) or rivaroxaban (Class I, LOE B-R), and a 2A recommendation for the other XA inhibitors for which specific clinical studies have not been performed at this time. Further studies are needed to determine if a TEE can be omitted in patients with a high stroke risk profile who present for ablation in AF and are undergoing ablation on uninterrupted anticoagulation. Data will also be needed on outcomes and use of specific reversal agents in this setting, particularly for management of serious procedural bleeding complications.

Regarding perioperative care for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to pre-procedural anticoagulation interruption, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to guide the timing of interruption of DOACs by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk of the procedure in patients with AF receiving DOACs scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure or surgery impossible to perform safely on uninterrupted anticoagulation.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^115bEjTR]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

It is important to recognize that the above discussion has focused on patients at high risk of stroke (i.e. CHA 2 DS 2 - VASc score ≥ 2). There is far greater flexibility as to how anticoagulation is managed in patients at a low or moderate risk of stroke because current guidelines do not mandate systemic anticoagulation. Another important consideration is that patient preference plays a large role in this decision. It is our belief that patients should be made aware of the available data and consensus recommendations, and then should be encouraged to consider the risks and benefits of continuing vs discontinuing systemic anticoagulation. Some patients who are at increased risk of stroke are highly motivated to discontinue systemic anticoagulation and are willing to accept an increased risk of stroke. For these patients, we recommend diligent pulse assessment at least twice daily and strong considerations that some type of continuous monitoring be performed to screen for silent AF at regular intervals as long as they remain free from systemic anticoagulation. A final comment worth mentioning is that the mechanisms of stroke are not limited to cardioembolism due to AF; thus, other sources of emboli should also be considered, such as paradoxical embolism and atheromas from the aortic arch. In the remainder of this section, we will briefly review some of the available data.

In multiple randomized trials, AF ablation was superior to AADs in reducing AF recurrence in drug-refractory patients. However, stroke prevention among these strategies has been largely similar. One investigator recently undertook a meta-analysis to evaluate whether AF ablation reduces the long-term risk of stroke compared with AAD therapy. Thirteen RCTs were analyzed, with 1097 patients treated by catheter ablation and 855 patients receiving AAD therapy. Overall, seven patients (0.64%) in the catheter ablation group had ischemic stroke or TIAs vs two patients (0.23%) in the drug therapy group. No difference was shown in the rate of stroke or TIA between ablation and drug therapy. To date, however, no AF ablation trial has evaluated whether successful ablation obviates the need for long-term OAC, but there are reports from large administrative registries and observational studies addressing this issue.

8.3 Post‐Procedural Anticoagulation

8.3.1 Immediate Post‐Ablation Period

Patients under minimally interrupted NOACs should receive their next drug dose after procedure termination while uninterrupted dosing should continue as per prescription. Conversely, patients under uninterrupted VKAs should continue therapy under INR‐guided drug dose administration.

8.3.2 Mid‐Long Term Post‐Ablation Period

Patients with low CHADS2, CHA2DS2‐VASc or CHA2D2VA score and with no mandatory indication for long‐term oral anticoagulation should discontinue anticoagulation therapy 2–3 months after ablation irrespective of clinical outcome as the risk of major bleeding due to therapy continuation in these patients outweighs the risk reduction of thromboembolism.

In patients with a CHADS2, CHA2DS2‐VASc or CHA2D2VA score of 2–3 and no documented atrial arrhythmia recurrences during 6‐month follow‐up, permanent discontinuation of oral anticoagulants post‐ablation may be safe.

To summarize the clinically most relevant situations of patients undergoing AF catheter ablation with a NOAC pre‐treatment or no pre‐treatment but initiation of a post‐ablation oral anticoagulation Figure 4 depicts a clinical pathway for anticoagulation handling depending on adoption of CHADS2 (a), CHA2DS2VASc (b), and CHA2DS2VA (c) individual risk score (Table 4 and 5).

### Management of intraprocedural anticoagulation in patients on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation: understanding the gaps in evidence [^114oatBy]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Catheter ablation has gained a prominent role in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF), with recent data providing positive evidence on hard outcomes, including hospitalization and mortality. Ablation, however, exposes the patient to a rather unique situation, combining risks for both major bleeding and thromboembolic events. In this setting, the critical importance of rigorous anticoagulation during the procedure has been underlined, and the latest international guidelines now recommend performing AF catheter ablation with uninterrupted non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and concomitant administration of unfractionated heparin adjusted to achieve and maintain a target activated clotting time of ≥ 300 seconds. Whereas observational studies and randomized controlled trials support the safety and efficacy of uninterrupted NOAC strategy for AF catheter ablation, recent experiences have questioned this point, showing a greater unfractionated heparin requirement in NOAC-treated patients compared with vitamin K antagonists-treated patients to achieve the target activated clotting time. Important gaps in evidence regarding optimal intraprocedural anticoagulation management need to be acknowledged. A thorough appreciation of the physiology of anticoagulation during AF catheter ablation and the relevant differences between vitamin K antagonists and NOACs is required, while also understanding the limitations of activated clotting time measurement with regard to accurate intraprocedural anticogulation monitoring. This review aims to provide a critical look at this relatively ignored aspect of AF catheter ablation, especially pitfalls in NOAC monitoring, and to identify gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed in the near future.

### Discontinuation of oral anticoagulation after successful atrial fibrillation ablation [^112YhJaG]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What patient characteristics are associated with benefit following oral anticoagulant (OAC) discontinuation after successful catheter ablation (CA) for atrial fibrillation (AF)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 1821 patients, thromboembolic risk increased in the OAC discontinuation group 12 months after successful CA, while the OAC continuation group exhibited more bleeding events. OAC discontinuation was associated with increased thromboembolic risk in patients with asymptomatic AF and poor cardiac function, whereas it was associated with decreased bleeding risk in patients with a HAS-BLED score of 2 or greater.

Meaning

These findings suggest that a better balance of the risk estimation between 2 conflicting events should be constructed based on the specific characteristics.

### Interrupted versus uninterrupted anticoagulation therapy for catheter ablation in adults with arrhythmias [^114cQRzH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of anticoagulation therapy around the time of catheter ablation (CA) procedure for adults with arrhythmia is critical and yet is variable in clinical practice. The ideal approach for safe and effective perioperative management should balance the risk of bleeding during uninterrupted anticoagulation while minimising the risk of thromboembolic events with interrupted therapy.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and harms of interrupted versus uninterrupted anticoagulation therapy for catheter ablation (CA) in adults with arrhythmias.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and SCI-Expanded on the Web of Science for randomised controlled trials on 5 January 2021. We also searched three registers on 29 May 2021 to identify ongoing or unpublished trials. We performed backward and forward searches on reference lists of included trials and other systematic reviews and contacted experts in the field. We applied no restrictions on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing uninterrupted anticoagulation with any modality of interruption with or without heparin bridging for CA in adults aged 18 years or older with arrhythmia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors conducted independent screening, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias. A third review author resolved disagreements. We extracted data on study population, interruption strategy, ablation procedure, thromboembolic events (stroke or systemic embolism), major and minor bleeding, asymptomatic thromboembolic events, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, quality of life (QoL), length of hospital stay, cost, and source of funding. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 12 studies (4714 participants) that compared uninterrupted periprocedural anticoagulation with interrupted anticoagulation. Studies performed an interruption strategy by either a complete interruption (one study) or by a minimal interruption (11 studies), of which a single-dose skipped strategy was used (nine studies) or two-dose skipped strategy (two studies), with or without heparin bridging. Studies included participants with a mean age of 65 years or greater, with only two studies conducted in relatively younger individuals (mean age less than 60 years). Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) was the primary type of AF in all studies, and seven studies included other types of AF (persistent and long-standing persistent). Most participants had CHADS2 or CHADS2-VASc demonstrating a low-moderate risk of stroke, with almost all participants having normal or mildly reduced renal function. Ablation source using radiofrequency energy was the most common (seven studies). Ten studies (2835 participants) were conducted in East Asian countries (Japan, China, and South Korea), while the remaining two studies were conducted in the USA. Eight studies were conducted in a single centre. Postablation follow-up was variable among studies at less than 30 days (three studies), 30 days (six studies), and more than 30 days postablation (three studies). Overall, the meta-analysis showed high uncertainty of the effect between the interrupted strategy compared to uninterrupted strategy on the primary outcomes of thromboembolic events (risk ratio (RR) 1.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 9.46; I² = 59%; 6 studies, 3468 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, subgroup analysis showed that uninterrupted vitamin A antagonist (VKA) is associated with a lower risk of thromboembolic events without increasing the risk of bleeding. There is also uncertainty on the outcome of major bleeding events (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.05; I² = 6%; 10 studies, 4584 participants; low-certainty evidence). The uncertainty was also evident for the secondary outcomes of minor bleeding (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.22; I² = 87%; 9 studies, 3843 participants; very low-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.21; 442 participants; low-certainty evidence) and asymptomatic thromboembolic events (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.47; I² = 56%; 6 studies, 1268 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was a lower risk of the composite endpoint of thromboembolic events (stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality) in the interrupted compared to uninterrupted arm (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.81; 1 study, 442 participants; low-certainty evidence). In general, the low event rates, different comparator anticoagulants, and use of different ablation procedures may be the cause of imprecision and heterogeneity observed.

Authors' Conclusions

This meta-analysis showed that the evidence is uncertain to inform the decision to either interrupt or continue anticoagulation therapy around CA procedure in adults with arrhythmia on outcomes of thromboembolic events, major and minor bleeding, all-cause mortality, asymptomatic thromboembolic events, and a composite endpoint of thromboembolic events (stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality). Most studies in the review adopted a minimal interruption strategy which has the advantage of reducing the risk of bleeding while maintaining a lower level of anticoagulation to prevent periprocedural thromboembolism, hence low event rates on the primary outcomes of thromboembolism and bleeding. The one study that adopted a complete interruption of VKA showed that uninterrupted VKA reduces the risk of thromboembolism without increasing the risk of bleeding. Hence, future trials with larger samples, tailored to a more generalisable population and using homogeneous periprocedural anticoagulant therapy and ablation source are required to address the safety and efficacy of the optimal management of anticoagulant therapy prior to ablation.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Systemic anticoagulation prior to atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — current practices and reversal: Many patients are already anticoagulated, and historically "bridged" strategies with intravenous or low molecular weight heparin were used, but this approach "resulted in a high incidence of bleeding complications", leading to "a new trend towards performing AF ablation procedures in patients who are continuously therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin". In the event of intraprocedural bleeding, "protamine is administered to reverse heparin", and for excessive bleeding on therapeutic warfarin, "Fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC; Factors II, VII, IX, and X), or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) can be used". An "emerging anticoagulation strategy" uses dabigatran or Factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban), but "Clinical experience with these new anticoagulation agents in association with an AF ablation procedure at the present time is limited".

Atrial fibrillation surgical ablation — postoperative anticoagulation and left atrial appendage (LAA) management: Evidence is limited for anticoagulation after surgical ablation, especially when the LAA is surgically obliterated; decisions should be individualized, and it is not unreasonable to anticoagulate for several months if bleeding risk permits. When LAA closure/ligation was performed and stopping anticoagulation is considered, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to confirm complete closure is recommended because incomplete closure is not uncommon.

### Uninterrupted anticoagulation with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation catheter ablation: lessons learned from randomized trials [^111EEAGL]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Catheter ablation has been established as a rhythm control strategy in selected patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have failed or wish to avoid anti-arrhythmic drugs. Uninterrupted oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) peri-ablation is associated with a lower risk of thromboembolic and bleeding complications as compared to interrupted oral anticoagulation and bridging heparin. However, a substantial portion of patients with AF are treated with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Herein, we perform an in-depth review and comparison of three recent randomized trials of uninterrupted oral anticoagulation with NOACs vs VKAs in patients undergoing AF catheter ablation. Furthermore, we report pooled results of these randomized trials. The pooled incidence of major bleeding was significantly lower with NOACs as compared to VKAs (2% vs 4.9%, respectively; odds ratio [OR] 0.40; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.16–0.99). Similarly, cardiac tamponade was also reduced in the NOAC group (0.4% vs 1.5%; OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.07–0.97). Thromboembolic complications were not significantly different between groups. Overall, these findings support the 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLAECE expert consensus statement's class I recommendation for uninterrupted NOAC use in patients undergoing AF catheter ablation.

### Oral anticoagulant use around the time of atrial fibrillation ablation: a review of the current evidence of individual oral anticoagulant use for periprocedural atrial fibrillation ablation thromboembolic prophylaxis [^113iUtFc]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and ablation is becoming more prevalent as a treatment option. Appropriate treatment of atrial fibrillation mandates thromboembolic prophylaxis, and atrial fibrillation ablation periprocedural management of oral anticoagulation is paramount because of the unique susceptibility for thromboembolism that exists for a patient undergoing ablation. Uninterrupted warfarin therapy is the current standard approach for periprocedural atrial fibrillation anticoagulation. Novel oral anticoagulants, including direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors, are being used more frequently for thromboembolic prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation patients, but the best strategy for using novel oral anticoagulants in periprocedural anticoagulation is unknown. Optimal periprocedural anticoagulation management strategies with oral anticoagulants, limitations of using novel oral anticoagulants, and future directions in this field are discussed.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^114sTFEi]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

As stated above, there is a lack of randomized trials evaluating this important clinical challenge; however, there are some ongoing trials, such as EAST and CABANA, which will address the prognostic impact of rhythm control therapy, including AF ablation and the effect of rhythm control therapy on stroke. Other trials are needed to define the optimal anticoagulation during AF ablation procedures in an era in which novel anticoagulants are increasingly used. We are optimistic about the ongoing Optimal Anticoagulation for Higher Risk Patients Post-Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation (OCEAN) trial (NCT02168829), which will effectively determine whether successful long-term reduction or elimination of AF with catheter ablation will reduce stroke risk sufficiently to obviate the need for long-term OAC. Additionally, the ongoing Prevention of Silent Cerebral Thromboembolism by Oral Anticoagulation With Dabigatran After PVI for Atrial Fibrillation (ODIn-AF) trial (NCT02067182) will address the effect of dabigatran compared with no OAC on the incidence of silent cerebral embolic events in patients with a high risk for embolic events, but who are free from symptomatic AF after successful PV ablation.

Until the outcomes of such trials are available, our current treatment recommendations to continue OAC after catheter ablation of AF in patients at high risk for stroke should continue. In patients who desire to discontinue anticoagulants because of ECG-documented AF elimination who remain at risk because of high CHA₂DS₂-VASc score, an individualized approach after full disclosure is warranted. It is important that patients who are considering discontinuation of anticoagulation in the setting of a stroke risk profile have a complete discussion of the potential risks of this strategy. As noted above, the writing group recommends that, for patients in whom discontinuation of anticoagulation is being considered based on the patient's values and preferences, they should consider undergoing continuous or frequent ECG monitoring to screen for AF recurrence, although recurrence of AF is only one of many reasons for stroke events after discontinuation of anticoagulation (Class IIb, LOE C-EO, Table 4). Whether this strategy results in a significant reduction of stroke risk remains uncertain at this time.

### Radiofrequency ablation vs antiarrhythmic drugs as first-line treatment of symptomatic atrial fibrillation… [^1168qEu7]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary vein isolation with radiofrequency ablation may cure AF, obviating the need for antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulation. frequently ineffective and have serious potential adverse effects. 2, 5–8 Preliminary data from our and other laboratories suggest that pulmonary vein isolation may cure AF, obviating the need for antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulation in many patients. 9–13 However, ablative therapy is usually considered only after drugs have failed because. catheter ablation is an invasive procedure with attendant potential risks, including procedural stroke and pulmonary vein stenosis.

Calif). Intravenous heparin was administered to achieve an activated clotting time of 350 to 400 seconds. Radiofrequency ablation was performed wherever pulmonary vein potentials were recorded around the pulmonary vein antra. The end point of ablation was complete electrical disconnection of the pulmonary vein antrum from the left. group, the mean number of nonsustained AF episodes recorded per Holter monitoring decreased from 13 episodes pre-PVI to 1 episodes after the ablation procedure. In the antiarrhythmic drug group, the number of AF episodes decreased from 12. lower mortality and adverse events compared with drug therapy.

In current clinical practice, ablation therapy for AF is reserved for patients with symptoms who have failed multiple antiarrhythmic drug regimens. The primary concern in offering an ablation procedure to treat AF as first-line therapy is that complications from the procedure can occur. A recent worldwide. a study is performed, PVI should not be considered standard of care as first-line therapy for AF. Nevertheless, the results of our study suggest that ablation to cure AF may become the treatment of first choice in appropriately selected patients with AF.

Intraprocedural Anticoagulation

Optimal anticoagulation using heparin with close attention to maintaining therapeutic dosing during the procedure is important. It is recommended that heparin be administered prior to or immediately following transseptal puncture during AF ablation procedures and adjusted to achieve and maintain a target activated clotting time (ACT) of 300 seconds or greater (Class I, LOE B-NR, Table 4). It has been observed that thrombi can form on the transseptal sheath and/or the electrode catheter almost immediately after crossing the septum and that early heparinization substantially decreases this risk. A recent meta-analysis of more than 7000 patients supports this recommendation, showing that performing ablation of AF with a target ACT > 300 seconds decreases the risk of thromboembolic complications without increasing the risk of bleeding. Seventy-seven percent of the writing group members administer heparin prior to the transseptal puncture. A heparin loading dose should be administered initially, followed by a standard heparin infusion. The ACT level should be checked at 10–15 minute intervals until therapeutic anticoagulation is achieved, and then at 15–30 minute intervals for the duration of the procedure. Patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) require less heparin and reach the target ACT faster compared with NOACs; thus, when using anticoagulation strategies with the latter, more frequent ACT monitoring and higher heparin doses should be used. This recent report from a large-volume medication center employs an initial heparin bolus of 50 units per kg in patients who are therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin, 75 units per kg in patients who are not anticoagulated prior to ablation, and 120 units per kg for patients who are anticoagulated on a NOAC and have held one to two doses. A survey of the writing group showed great variability in loading protocols for heparin prior to an ablation procedure. The heparin dose should be adjusted to maintain an ACT of at least 300–350 seconds throughout the procedure. One-third of the writing group members routinely employ a target ACT of > 350 seconds. Heparinized saline should be infused continuously through each transseptal sheath to further reduce the risk of thrombi. The risk of systemic embolization of thrombus formed on a sheath can be reduced by withdrawing the sheath to the RA once a catheter is positioned in the LA. Heparin infusion can be discontinued once all catheters are removed from the LA, and the sheaths removed from the groin when the ACT is less than 200–250 seconds. Sheaths can be removed during full anticoagulation by employing a figure-of-eight suture. Alternatively, the heparin effect can be reversed with protamine (Class IIa, LOE B-NR, Table 4). This approach is used by 70% of the writing group members.

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

Catheter ablation of VA can be associated with risk of thrombus formation and thromboembolism. Although the individual risk varies with type and site of ablation and patient factors, the risk of clinically apparent stroke or thromboembolism in patients with SHD undergoing VT ablation in RCTs has ranged from 0% to 1.9% and is lower in patients without SHD. A small study with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance brain imaging demonstrated the presence of a new brain lesion in 58% of patients undergoing LV endocardial ablation. These lesions were detected in the absence of clinically apparent stroke; no brain lesion was identified in patients undergoing RV ablation. Although systemic heparinization has been routine for LV endocardial ablation since the earliest large-scale investigations, few studies have compared different approaches to anticoagulation before, during, or after the VT ablation procedure (Table 9). Systemic anticoagulation with heparin is recommended for all procedures that last more than several minutes involving left heart catheterization. Intraprocedural anticoagulation schemes differ between centers. Unfractionated heparin is commonly administered after sheath insertion as an initial bolus (empirical dose 5000–10,000 IU or 50–100 IU/kg) followed by intermittent boli and/or continuous infusion to maintain a target activated clotting time (ACT) longer than 250–350 seconds. In a survey regarding intraprocedural anticoagulation among the writing committee members, for idiopathic VA, 48% of the responders use ACT levels longer than 250 seconds, 39% longer than 300 seconds, and 13% longer than 350 seconds. For patients with SHD, 25% of the committee members use an ACT target of 250 seconds, 58% use a target longer than 300 seconds, and 17% use a target longer than 350 seconds. The ACT level should be checked at 15-minute intervals until therapeutic anticoagulation is achieved, and then at 15- to 30-minute intervals for the duration of the procedure. Approximately 90% of the surveyed committee members routinely check for ACT during VT ablation procedures. Most members use either a Hemochron ACT (Instrumentation Laboratory, Bedford, MA) or an i-STAT (Abbott Point of Care Inc. Princeton, NJ) device for ACT monitoring. For transseptal access, heparin should be administered prior to or immediately following the transseptal puncture. More than 70% of the writing committee members surveyed routinely administer heparin before the transseptal puncture, and approximately 20% use a higher target ACT when a transseptal approach is used. Among the writing committee members, 85% use continuous flushing for sheaths, especially if a transseptal approach is used. Heparin infusion can be discontinued once all catheters are removed from left sided chambers. In the event of significant persistent bleeding or cardiac tamponade, protamine should be administered to reverse heparin. In patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or allergy, a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as bivalirudin or argatroban, can be considered as an alternative for intraprocedural anticoagulation; however, limited experience exists in patients undergoing VA ablation.
During RV endocardial mapping, systemic anticoagulation with heparin is not necessary unless other factors are present that increase the thromboembolic risk. The use of heparin can, however, prevent deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, especially when a prolonged procedure with multiple venous catheters and extensive ablation is anticipated. Similarly, patients with a history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, hypercoagulable state (eg, factor V Leiden), right-to-left cardiac shunt, severe RV dilatation, and advanced heart failure should undergo systemic anticoagulation. Among the writing committee members, 65% reported routine use of heparin for VT ablation procedures even in the absence of risk factors for thromboembolism.
Anticoagulation is not required solely for epicardial mapping and/or ablation. If LV mapping is planned, epicardial access can be obtained prior to LV instrumentation and systemic anticoagulation (see Section 6.3). When epicardial access is required after therapeutic heparinization, reversal of heparin anticoagulation with protamine is typically performed. Two small studies reported epicardial access in fully anticoagulated patients without a major increase in risk of bleeding complications. When the writing committee was surveyed about epicardial access after full heparinization, half of the writing committee would administer protamine for heparin reversal even when extensive endocardial ablation had been performed, 20% would administer protamine only after limited LV endocardial ablation, and another 20% of the writing committee members would terminate the procedure and schedule an epicardial ablation as a separate procedure.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Table 4 — pre-ablation anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation ablation specifies that anticoagulation guidelines that pertain to cardioversion of AF be adhered to in patients who present for an AF ablation in atrial fibrillation at the time of the procedure; if the patient has been in AF for 48 hours or longer or for an unknown duration, we require three weeks of systemic anticoagulation at a therapeutic level prior to the procedure, and if this is not the case, we advise that a TEE be performed to screen for thrombus, and each of these patients will be anticoagulated systemically for two months post ablation. Prior to undergoing an AF ablation procedure a TEE should be performed in all patients with atrial fibrillation more than 48 hours in duration or of an unknown duration if adequate systemic anticoagulation has not been maintained for at least three weeks prior to the ablation procedure. Performance of a TEE in patients who are in sinus rhythm at the time of ablation or patients with AF who are in AF but have been in AF for 48 hours or less prior to AF ablation may be considered but is not mandatory. The presence of a left atrial thrombus is a contraindication to catheter ablation of AF. Performance of catheter ablation of AF on a patient who is therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin should be considered.

Screening transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before atrial fibrillation ablation — risk estimates and practice variation are described, noting that the results of three studies were remarkably consistent, demonstrating that 1.6% to 2.1% of patients will demonstrate a thrombus or "sludge" in the left atrial appendage, with risk related to CHADS2 score such that among patients with a CHADS2 score of zero a thrombus was identified in ≤ 0.3% of patients and ≥ 5% of patients with a CHADS2 score of two or greater. Approximately 50% of Task Force Members perform a TEE in all patients undergoing AF ablation regardless of presenting rhythm and CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc score, another 20% only performs a TEE if a patient presents in AF of unknown duration or more than 48 hours' duration and has not been systemically anticoagulated for at least four weeks, and the remaining one-third employ clinical judgment and decide on a case-by-case basis, with examples including obtaining a TEE if a patient has had AF for > 48 hours or in longstanding persistent AF with a CHADS2 score greater than two and a large LA even if the patient has been therapeutically anticoagulated for four weeks or longer.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^1158GhaU]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation — preablation anticoagulation: For patients therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin or dabigatran, performance of the ablation procedure without interruption of warfarin or dabigatran is recommended, and for those on rivaroxaban, performance without interruption of rivaroxaban is recommended; for novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) other than dabigatran or rivaroxaban, performance without withholding a NOAC dose is reasonable. Anticoagulation guidelines that pertain to cardioversion of AF should be adhered to in patients who present for an AF catheter ablation procedure. For patients anticoagulated with a NOAC prior to AF catheter ablation, it is reasonable to hold one to two doses of the NOAC prior to AF ablation with reinstitution postablation. Performance of a TEE is reasonable in patients who are in AF on presentation and have been receiving anticoagulation therapeutically for 3 weeks or longer, and is also reasonable in those who present in sinus rhythm and have not been anticoagulated prior to catheter ablation.

Atrial fibrillation catheter ablation — supportive evidence for periprocedural anticoagulation states that "all patients undergoing catheter ablation require intraprocedural intravenous anticoagulation with heparin or direct thrombin inhibitors in those with heparin allergies", and among warfarin-treated patients, "optimal efficacy and safety is achieved with uninterrupted warfarin". In the COMPARE trial, interrupting warfarin was "highly associated with periprocedural thromboembolic events (OR, 13 [95% CI, 3.1–55.6]; P < 0.001)", and uninterrupted warfarin yielded "lower rates of thromboembolic events (5% versus 0.25%; P < 0.001)" and lower periprocedural bleeding versus stopping or interrupting warfarin. Meta-analyses "have demonstrated lower risks of major bleeding with uninterrupted direct oral anticoagulation compared with uninterrupted vitamin K antagonism", trials "have demonstrated the noninferiority of uninterrupted direct-acting oral anticoagulation compared with uninterrupted vitamin K antagonism", and outcomes with "minimally interrupted direct-acting oral anticoagulation are not different compared with continuous oral anticoagulation".

The writing group also recommends that adherence to AF anticoagulation guidelines is recommended for patients who have undergone an AF ablation procedure, regardless of the apparent success or failure of the procedure (Class I, LOE C-EO, Table 4). Patients in whom discontinuation of anticoagulation is being considered based on patient values and preferences should consider undergoing continuous or frequent ECG monitoring to screen for AF recurrence (Class IIb, LOE C-EO, Table 4). A patient's desire to eliminate the need for long-term anticoagulation by itself should not be considered an appropriate selection criterion for AF ablation. In arriving at this recommendation, the writing group recognizes that patients who have undergone catheter ablation of AF represent a new and previously unstudied population in trials of OAC therapy. Clinical trials are therefore needed to define the stroke risk of this patient population and to determine whether the risk factors identified in the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc or other scoring systems apply to these patients. Please refer to Section 7 for a more detailed discussion of this topic and the writing group recommendations for long-term anticoagulation.

### Is transesophageal echocardiogram mandatory in patients undergoing ablation of atrial fibrillation with uninterrupted novel oral anticoagulants? Results from a prospective multicenter registry [^111FZPRB]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is recommended in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, but use of this strategy is variable.

Objective

To evaluate whether TEE is necessary before AF ablation in patients treated with novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs).

Methods

We performed a prospective multicenter registry of AF patients undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation on uninterrupted NOACs (apixaban and rivaroxaban). All patients were on NOACs for at least 4 weeks before ablation. Heparin bolus was administered to all patients before transseptal catheterization to maintain a target activated clotting time above 300 seconds. A subset of 86 patients underwent brain diffuse magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to detect silent cerebral ischemia (SCI).

Results

A total of 970 patients (514 [53%] apixaban patients and 456 [47%] rivaroxaban patients) were enrolled for this study. The mean age was 69.5 ± 9.0 years, with 824 patients (85%) having nonparoxysmal AF, and 636 patients (65.6%) were male. The average CHA2DS2-VASc score was 3.01 ± 1.3 and CHADS2 score was ≥ 2 in 609 patients (62.8%). Intracardiac echocardiogram ruled out left atrial appendage thrombus in all patients whose left atrial appendage was visualized (692, 71%), and detected "smoke" in 407 patients (42%). SCI at postprocedure dMRI was detected in 2.3% (2/86). One thromboembolic event (transient ischemic attack) (0.10%) with positive dMRI occurred in a patient on uninterrupted rivaroxaban with longstanding persistent AF.

Conclusion

Our study illustrates that performing AF ablation while on uninterrupted apixaban and rivaroxaban without TEE is feasible and safe. This finding has important clinical and economic relevance.

### Anticoagulation after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation: an unnecessary evil? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1151Qoy2]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is currently based on clinical parameters (CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score) that have been shown to predict cerebrovascular events (CVE). Controversy exists as to whether CVE risk persists unmodified after successful catheter ablation, as observational studies suggest a lower risk of CVE. Current guidelines recommend continued oral anticoagulation (OAC) based on the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score risk profile.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature review of all studies published up to July 31, 2018, that reported CVE after catheter ablation of AF and compared patients on or off OAC. Random-effects models were used to demonstrate the risk of CVE and major bleeding in on-OAC vs off-OAC patients. This analysis was further stratified by CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score.

Results

We retained 16 studies, 10 prospective cohort and 6 retrospective cohort, that met inclusion criteria, and which enrolled 25 177 patients: 13 166 off-OAC and 12 011 on-OAC. No significant difference in the incidence of CVE emerged between on-OAC and off-OAC patients after AF ablation (risk ratio, 0.66; confidence interval [CI] 0.38, 1.15). Similar results were found after stratification by CHADS₂ and CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. Off-OAC patients suffered significantly less bleeding than those on OAC (RR, 0.17; CI, 0.09, 0.34). Of note, the percentage of patients with AF recurrence impacts the treatment effect in the two groups (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

In this metanalysis, the risk-benefit ratio favored the suspension of OAT after successful AF ablation even in patients at moderate-high risk. Whether the reported results can be extended also to non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants warrants further investigations.

Atrial fibrillation surgical ablation with left atrial appendage occlusion — anticoagulation practice and evidence gaps are summarized: Similar challenges exist for the use of anticoagulation after surgical ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion, and balancing the risk of postoperative bleeding, oral anticoagulation is often initiated early postoperatively in patients after atrial fibrillation surgery because of the endothelial damage caused during ablation. Some centers have adopted single-antiplatelet therapy with no oral anticoagulation after surgical ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion, but regarding long-term oral anticoagulation strategy, there are no randomized or robust observational data available to guide specific recommendations. Currently, factors to consider in the decision to use oral anticoagulation or not after surgical ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion are documented freedom from atrial fibrillation, completeness of left atrial appendage occlusion, and the patient's bleeding risk and stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score), and anticoagulation management after surgical ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion certainly is an area in need of further research.

The incidence of these complications can be related to the number and size of the venous sheaths used, insertion of an arterial pressure line, and perhaps to the intense anticoagulation management before, during, and after the procedure. Recent studies have suggested uninterrupted warfarin as an optimal anticoagulation regimen because it reduces stroke and nonmajor bleeding complications compared with interrupted warfarin with heparin bridging. Further, uninterrupted or briefly interrupted use of a direct oral anticoagulant was shown to be as safe and effective as uninterrupted warfarin. The results of the RE-CIRCUIT study were recently published, which was a head-to-head comparison of performing AF ablation on patients receiving uninterrupted dabigatran vs uninterrupted warfarin. This study randomized 704 patients across 104 sites to these two anticoagulation strategies. The incidence of major bleeding events during and up to 8 weeks postablation among the 635 patients who underwent AF ablation was significantly lower with dabigatran than with warfarin (5 patients [1.6%] vs 22 patients [6.9%]); absolute RD -5.3%, RR reduction 77%). There has been one other smaller head-to-head comparison published of uninterrupted rivaroxaban vs uninterrupted warfarin (Venture-AF, N = 248). This study reported one major bleeding event, one ischemic stroke, and one vascular death, each of which occurred in the warfarin arm of the study.

The approach used for femoral venous access can impact on the risk of vascular complications. When an inferior approach to femoral vein access is used, small medial branches of the femoral artery, which can run across and superficial to the femoral vein, might be penetrated before entry to the femoral vein, possibly leading to a femoral pseudoa-neurysm and arteriovenous fistula. When a superior approach is used, there is an increased risk of retroperitoneal bleeding. To prevent these vascular complications, real-time ultrasound-guided venipuncture is useful and can be recommended because it reduces both major and minor vascular complications in patients undergoing AF ablation and/or electrophysiological procedures. Among the writing group members, two-thirds routinely use ultrasound imaging to guide vascular access.

### How would you manage this patient with recent-onset atrial fibrillation? Grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115AEHEC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. Risk factors for AF include obstructive sleep apnea, physical inactivity, obesity, cigarette use, and alcohol misuse. Atrial fibrillation substantially increases the risk for stroke and is associated with higher rates of mortality than for individuals without AF. Strategies to prevent these risk factors and to optimize those that already exist reduce the risk for subsequent AF. Physicians play an important role in proposing strategies to reduce the risk for AF among patients. Decision making regarding management of AF is often complex and requires consideration of symptoms, burden of AF (the percentage of time in AF), comorbid conditions that increase stroke risk, and the risk for bleeding. In particular, novel risk scoring systems to predict stroke risk, and consideration of factors beyond those in these tools, refine the ability to identify patients with AF who are most likely to benefit from anticoagulation to reduce stroke risk. Early use of catheter ablation of AF in selected patients improves symptoms and reduces the potential for progression from intermittent to persistent AF. A 2023 collaborative guideline from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, American College of Chest Physicians, and the Heart Rhythm Society addressed multiple aspects of care of patients with AF. Here, a general cardiologist and a cardiac electrophysiologist discuss recommendations derived from this guideline and how to apply them to the care of a particular patient.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — intraprocedural heparin anticoagulation recommendations and practices: "Heparin should be administered prior to or immediately following transseptal puncture… and adjusted to achieve and maintain a target ACT (activated clotting time) of 300 to 400 seconds", and "More than 50% of the Task Force Members give heparin prior to the transseptal puncture". "A heparin loading dose should be administered initially followed by a standard heparin infusion", and "an ACT level should be checked at 10–15-minute intervals… and then at 15–30-minute intervals for the duration of the procedure". "The heparin dose should be adjusted to maintain an ACT of at least 300–350 seconds throughout the procedure", with "Approximately one-third of the Task Force" using "a target ACT of 350 seconds". "It is also recommended that heparinized saline be infused continuously through each transseptal sheath". "Heparin infusion can be discontinued… when the ACT is less than 200–250 seconds", or "the heparin effect can be reversed with protamine", an approach "used by approximately 50% of Task Force members", though "Controlled data to support either of these specific suggestions are lacking".

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113QkgdY]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS 2023 — Anticoagulation of typical atrial flutter (AFL): For patients with AFL, anticoagulation therapy is recommended according to the same risk profile used for atrial fibrillation (AF). In patients with AFL who undergo successful cardioversion or ablation resulting in restoration of sinus rhythm, anticoagulation should be continued for at least 4 weeks postprocedure. Patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation and have had AF previously detected before AFL ablation should receive ongoing oral anticoagulation as indicated for AF. Patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful CTI ablation and are deemed to be at high thromboembolic risk, without any known previous history of AF, should receive close follow-up and arrhythmia monitoring to detect silent AF if they are not receiving ongoing anticoagulation in view of significant risk of AF. In patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful CTI ablation without any known previous history of AF who are at high risk for development of AF, it may be reasonable to prescribe long-term anticoagulation if thromboembolic risk assessment suggests high risk (> 2% annual risk) for stroke.

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

Antiplatelet therapy for less extensive endocardial VT ablation appears to be safe, with no significant bleeding nor thromboembolism risks. The Multicenter Thermocool Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation Trial has recommended antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 325 mg/day or anticoagulation with warfarin for 3 months after ablation, if ablation has been performed over an area with > 3 cm between ablation sites. No procedure-related thromboembolic complication or stroke had been detected by neurological examination. In the study by Siontis et al. in patients with less extensive ablation, antiplatelet agents with full-dose aspirin or clopidogrel plus aspirin were used at the physician's discretion instead of therapeutic anticoagulation. Among 24 patients discharged on only antiplatelet agents (4 low-dose aspirin, 9 full-dose aspirin, 1 clopidogrel, 10 combination of aspirin and clopidogrel), no definite or possible thromboembolic events and no bleeding events were documented in the first 3 months. Among the writing committee, over 90% prescribe either antiplatelets or anticoagulants after endocardial VA ablation, with various criteria used to decide which. When antiplatelets were used (almost exclusively aspirin), the most common duration was 4 to 6 weeks.
Anticoagulation during left-sided VT ablation procedures is generally reversed for sheath removal, typically with protamine. In a retrospective cohort study of 158 patients undergoing RF catheter ablation, including 11 for VAs, 116 received protamine and 42 did not. No significant difference in thrombotic events was observed between groups (one pulmonary embolism in the protamine group and 0 thrombotic events in the control group). Among 150 patients undergoing AF ablation, a randomized trial reported that compared to control, protamine reversal of heparin led to a trend toward shorter duration of manual compression (20 ± 9 vs 24 ± 16 minutes; p = 0.06) and a shorter time to ambulation (316 ± 80 vs 480 ± 92 minutes; P < .001), with no differences in vascular access complications or thromboembolic events.
After extensive endocardial VT ablation, use of anticoagulation for a period of time has frequently been included as part of postprocedural practice, although there are no comparison studies. In the Multicenter Thermocool Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation Trial, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 325 mg/day or anticoagulation with warfarin was administered for 3 months after ablation if ablation was performed over an area with > 3 cm between ablation sites. No procedure-related thromboembolic complication or stroke was detected. The anticoagulation regimens used in other major prospective clinical trials are described in Table 9. Siontis et al. evaluated an anticoagulation protocol after VT ablation of large LV endocardial ablation areas (> 3 cm between ablation sites) in 217 patients with infarct-related VT without evidence of procedure-related pericardial effusion. Starting 8 hours after access site hemostasis, an infusion of lowdose, slowly escalating unfractionated heparin 600–900 U/h was administered for 6 hours, along with initiation of warfarin. This was followed by 3 months of anticoagulation, or longer if another indication was present. If a direct oral anticoagulant had been administered prior to the procedure, it was resumed as early as 48 hours after sheath removal if there was no bleeding. With thiregimen, in-hospital bleeding occurred in 6% and an arterial thromboembolic event occurred in 1 (0.6%) patient who had received bridging anticoagulation. Among the 214 patients discharged, 89% were prescribed systemic anticoagulation, and no definite or possible thromboembolic events were documented in the first 3 months; 1 patient had a major bleeding event. Of the writing committee members, approximately two-thirds initiate anticoagulation after LV endocardial ablation in some patients, generally after more extensive lesions. The postprocedural anticoagulation protocols in the major prospective studies of VT catheter ablation are outlined in Table 9.
Heparin bridging to oral anticoagulation or ambulation has been practiced but can be associated with a small risk of periprocedural bleeding after VT ablation. Among patients bridged with low-molecular-weight heparin to oral anticoagulation after VT ablation, Siontis et al. reported in-hospital bleeding in 6% of the patients. Of the two-thirds of writing committee members who initiate anticoagulation after endocardial LV ablation, 60% initiate heparin until this has been established, and a further 20% if starting warfarin until the international normalized ratio is > 2, but not if starting a direct oral anticoagulant. See Section 5.5 for further discussion of this topic, including the writing committee's practices.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^112bnrkV]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation catheter ablation — postablation anticoagulation: Registry data link stopping warfarin after ablation to higher ischemic stroke rates in patients with elevated CHA2DS2-VASc, supporting continuation of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in those at high stroke risk. Among 1175 individuals, 30% stopped warfarin in the first year; in those with CHA2DS2-VASc score > 2, ischemic stroke was 1.6% per year vs 0.3% per year with continued warfarin, and prior stroke further increased risk (HR 4.6). Stroke patients frequently required additional rhythm control (8 of the 11 patients with stroke (72.7%) underwent cardioversion of AF or a second PV procedure). The document states OAC therapy should not be discontinued in patients with recurrent AF and affirms that recommendations to continue OAC after ablation in patients at high risk for stroke should continue.
