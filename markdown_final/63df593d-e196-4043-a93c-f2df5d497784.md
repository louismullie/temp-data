## Question

Hepatoma treatment after surgical resection without metastases

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative-intent surgical resection in patients without metastases, including considerations for adjuvant therapy, surveillance, and recurrence management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the curative-intent resection and baseline risk of recurrence. Then, I should verify the current status of adjuvant systemic therapy and reconcile any conflicting guidance. Next, I will outline surveillance protocols and triggers for action. After that, I need to plan for recurrence management, including salvage transplantation and liver-directed options. Finally, I should consider special populations and summarize a practical, guideline-concordant algorithm with caveats and ongoing trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and recurrence risk after R0 resection. Even with negative margins and no metastases, HCC recurrence remains substantial, historically approaching 50–70% at 5 years, reflecting both intrahepatic metastases and de novo carcinogenesis in the diseased liver, which frames why adjuvant strategies have been so intensively studied [^116UA5sX] [^113rV2Hp].

> Now, I should review adjuvant systemic therapy, and I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions from early signals. Initially, I thought the IMbrave050 regimen might have established a new standard given an early RFS benefit, but wait, let me verify the durability and OS data before recommending it routinely [^1145BdbR]. The updated analyses showed that the RFS advantage did not persist and overall survival was not improved, leading major societies to advise against routine adjuvant atezolizumab plus bevacizumab after resection or ablation, so I should correct my initial inclination and align with current guidance [^114wgTdc] [^115MdBTE] [^111JnCty]. I should also double-check older adjuvant data: sorafenib in the STORM trial failed to improve RFS or OS, reinforcing that TKIs should not be used adjuvantly after curative-intent therapy [^113jJ8ut] [^112X3N7K] [^116k4HJR]. Hold on, I should verify guideline concordance across regions: EASL and ESMO similarly recommend against adjuvant systemic therapy after resection or ablation, and AASLD explicitly advises against adjuvant and neoadjuvant systemic therapies outside trials, so surveillance remains the standard of care [^116LkMzZ] [^112qHG7E] [^113pH4JG] [^115MdBTE].

> Next, I should review surveillance protocols and make sure I am precise about intervals and modalities. AASLD recommends indefinite surveillance with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI every 3–6 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months thereafter, with earlier imaging if AFP rises or new symptoms occur, which I should confirm as the backbone post-resection strategy [^1139yLSs] [^113AVjQ5]. Let me consider the rationale: early detection of intrahepatic recurrence enables timely salvage options, including re-resection, ablation, or liver-directed therapy, and potentially salvage transplantation if within Milan criteria, so adherence to surveillance meaningfully affects outcomes [^1142edd2].

> I will now examine how to manage recurrence when it occurs, and I need to ensure I apply stage-based algorithms correctly. For liver-confined recurrence within Milan criteria, salvage liver transplantation is a key curative pathway and should be prioritized in appropriate candidates after MDT review, whereas liver-localized recurrence beyond Milan may be addressed with liver-directed therapies such as TACE, TARE, ablation, or SBRT, with transplant reconsideration if successful downstaging occurs [^1142edd2] [^116ZKouE]. But wait, what if the recurrence is solitary and resectable? Repeat hepatectomy or ablation can be reasonable in well-selected patients, and although evidence is largely retrospective, survival after repeat resection or ablation can approach that of primary resection in specialized centers, so I should individualize based on liver function, tumor factors, and local expertise [^11128RdR] [^1137ps5N]. I should confirm that extrahepatic spread shifts management toward systemic therapy rather than curative-intent local approaches, consistent with contemporary guidance [^1142edd2].

> Let me consider special populations and surgical candidacy nuances, and I should double-check liver function thresholds. In noncirrhotic livers, resection is the treatment of choice and can achieve excellent 5-year survival, often exceeding 50–70% in well-selected patients, which supports aggressive surveillance and timely salvage for recurrence [^1139yLSs] [^113gk13Y] [^1172nw8V]. In compensated cirrhosis without clinically significant portal hypertension and with adequate future liver remnant, resection remains appropriate; conversely, Child-Pugh C or decompensated cirrhosis generally precludes resection and favors transplant pathways or noncurative strategies, so I need to ensure liver function is reassessed at each recurrence evaluation [^1139yLSs] [^1165vFEa] [^115zhFCq]. Hold on, I should verify that minimally invasive approaches are acceptable when feasible; laparoscopic resection offers comparable oncologic outcomes with less morbidity in experienced hands and can be considered for suitable recurrences as well as primaries [^1139yLSs] [^1134D1bd].

> I need to ensure I address the role of neoadjuvant or perioperative systemic therapy, and I should be explicit about where it fits. AASLD advises against neoadjuvant systemic therapy outside clinical trials, so for upfront resectable, nonmetastatic HCC, preoperative systemic therapy should not be routine; however, in borderline or initially unresectable disease, conversion strategies including modern immunotherapy-based regimens may downstage tumors to resectability, and these approaches should be coordinated via MDT in high-volume centers [^113pH4JG] [^115BwhRu] [^113iVYZT]. Let me reconsider whether any guidance supports adjuvant therapy in all-comers; current consensus is that no systemic adjuvant therapy is standard after R0 resection, and ongoing phase III trials of pembrolizumab, nivolumab, durvalumab plus bevacizumab, and others may refine this, but until then surveillance remains the default [^115MdBTE] [^116Hx3Fb].

> Next, I should review prognostic factors that modify surveillance intensity and recurrence management thresholds. Microvascular invasion, multiple nodules, larger tumor size, and cirrhosis increase recurrence risk and may justify closer follow-up intervals and earlier consideration of liver-directed therapy or transplant referral upon recurrence, so I should document these at baseline and incorporate them into the surveillance plan and MDT discussions [^113rV2Hp]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that identifying high-risk features mandates adjuvant therapy; I should correct that and emphasize that while high-risk features inform vigilance, they do not currently compel adjuvant systemic therapy outside trials given negative or neutral RCT results to date [^113pH4JG] [^116LkMzZ].

> Putting this together, my practical, guideline-concordant algorithm is as follows, and I should double-check each step against society statements. After curative-intent resection with R0 margins and no metastases, do not administer adjuvant systemic therapy. Initiate indefinite surveillance with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI every 3–6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months, with earlier imaging for rising AFP or new symptoms. At recurrence, apply a stage-based approach prioritizing salvage transplantation within Milan, liver-directed therapies for localized disease beyond Milan with reassessment for transplant after downstaging, and systemic therapy for vascular invasion, extrahepatic spread, or TACE-unsuitable disease. Throughout, manage in a multidisciplinary setting and tailor to liver function, comorbidity, and patient preferences [^1139yLSs] [^1142edd2] [^116ZKouE] [^115MdBTE].

> Finally, I should confirm key caveats and communicate uncertainties. The field of adjuvant immunotherapy remains dynamic. Although IMbrave050 initially suggested RFS benefit, the lack of sustained benefit and absence of OS improvement led to recommendations against routine adjuvant atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, and ongoing trials may yet redefine standards, so patients should be informed and, when appropriate, offered clinical trial participation [^114wgTdc] [^115MdBTE]. I need to ensure shared decision-making includes discussion of recurrence risk, surveillance adherence, and the potential role of salvage transplantation, as these elements materially influence long-term outcomes and quality of life after curative-intent resection [^1139yLSs] [^1142edd2].

After curative-intent resection of hepatocellular carcinoma without metastases, **surveillance is essential** [^1139yLSs] because recurrence is common (40–70% at 5 years) [^116UA5sX]. No adjuvant therapy is **routinely recommended** [^113pH4JG]; sorafenib is ineffective [^113jJ8ut], and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is not supported by mature OS data [^114wgTdc] [^112qHG7E]. Management is **multidisciplinary** [^1131wFS1], with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI every 3–6 months for the first 2 years, then every 6–12 months, plus AFP [^1139yLSs]. If recurrence is within Milan criteria, consider **salvage transplantation** [^1142edd2]; for liver-only recurrence, use TACE, ablation, or SBRT [^1142edd2]; for extrahepatic or vascular invasion, use systemic therapy [^1142edd2]. Optimize liver function, control HBV/HCV, and address modifiable risks to reduce recurrence [^111robYw].

---

## Surveillance and follow-up

Regular surveillance is critical after resection because of the **high recurrence risk** [^116UA5sX]. The following schedule is recommended:

- **Imaging**: Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI every 3–6 months for the first 2 years, then every 6–12 months indefinitely [^notfound].

- **Laboratory tests**: Serum AFP at each visit; elevated or rising AFP may prompt earlier imaging [^notfound].

- **Clinical assessment**: Monitor for new symptoms, performance status, and liver function at each visit [^notfound].

---

## Adjuvant therapy

Currently, **no adjuvant therapy is routinely recommended** after curative-intent resection:

- **Sorafenib**: The STORM trial showed no benefit in recurrence-free or overall survival and is not recommended [^113jJ8ut] [^112X3N7K].

- **Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab**: The IMbrave050 trial showed improved recurrence-free survival initially, but mature overall survival data are pending and routine use is not supported by current guidelines [^114wgTdc] [^112qHG7E].

- **TACE or other locoregional therapies**: Not recommended routinely after curative resection.

---

## Management of recurrence

Recurrence is managed according to **tumor burden, liver function, and patient factors**:

| **Recurrence scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Within Milan criteria | Salvage liver transplantation [^1142edd2] |
| Liver-only recurrence | - TACE <br/> - Ablation <br/> - Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) [^11128RdR] [^111QL3EW] |
| Extrahepatic spread or vascular invasion | Systemic therapy (e.g. atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, lenvatinib, or sorafenib) [^1142edd2] |

---

## Lifestyle modifications and risk factor management

Optimizing liver function and addressing underlying liver disease are critical to reduce recurrence:

- **Alcohol abstinence**: Strongly recommended.

- **Weight management**: Maintain healthy weight to reduce NAFLD progression.

- **Antiviral therapy**: Treat chronic HBV or HCV infection to improve liver function and reduce recurrence risk [^notfound].

- **Metabolic syndrome management**: Control diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.

---

## Prognostic factors influencing recurrence and survival

Several factors influence **recurrence and survival** after resection:

- **Microvascular invasion**: Strong predictor of early recurrence and poor survival [^notfound].

- **Tumor size and number**: Larger or multiple tumors increase recurrence risk [^113rV2Hp].

- **Liver function**: Child-Pugh score and degree of fibrosis/cirrhosis impact outcomes [^113gk13Y].

- **Margins**: Positive margins increase recurrence risk.

---

## Multidisciplinary care

Management should involve hepatology, surgical oncology, medical oncology, interventional radiology, and pathology to individualize care and optimize outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Surveillance**: Regular imaging and AFP monitoring [^111gQ1v7].

- **Adjuvant therapy**: Not routinely recommended [^113pH4JG].

- **Recurrence management**: Tailored to tumor burden, liver function, and patient factors [^116DoknP].

- **Lifestyle and risk factor management**: Essential to reduce recurrence [^notfound].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Central to optimal outcomes [^1131wFS1].

---

After curative-intent resection of HCC without metastases, **surveillance is essential** [^1139yLSs] and adjuvant therapy is not routine [^113pH4JG]; management is individualized within a multidisciplinary framework.

Downstaging of patients beyond Milan criteria

According to the SEOM guidelines, downstaging cannot be recommended. According to the EASL-EORTC guidelines, downstaging policies for HCCs exceeding conventional criteria cannot be recommended and should be explored in the context of prospective studies aimed at survival and disease progression end points. According to the APASL guidelines, downstaging therapy using local ablation or chemoembolisation may reduce the dropout rate with long waiting time of more than 6 months, but there is no proven benefit in long-term survival or downstaging to allow expanded indication. The Japanese evidence-based guidelines state that there is insufficient scientific evidence to support tumour downstaging prior to LT to improve HCC prognosis. The role of transplantation after downstaging is not established in Italy because of lack of high-quality evidence. On the basis of the available data, it is reasonable that patients slightly beyond Milan and in good general conditions can receive a consultation for possible transplantation. According to the German S3 guidelines, downstaging can be considered in order to achieve Milan criteria. AASLDand ESMO-ESDOoffer no recommendation regarding downstaging.

HCC recurrence risk following resection

Even following resection with a curative intent, HCC shows recurrence rates of approximately 50% during the first 3 years and more than 70% during the first 5 years, which constitutes either intrahepatic metastasis (early recurrence) or a de novo HCC in the cirrhotic remnant liver (late recurrence). In particular, microvascular invasion is a known predictor of recurrence, likewise histological grading, multifocality and the size of lesion(s).

A multicenter phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled study called "Adjuvant sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma after resection or ablation (STORM)" assessed the safety and efficacy of an adjuvant treatment with sorafenib for a maximum of 4 years with the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival following resection or ablation. There was no significant difference in recurrence-free survival between sorafenib and placebo (33.3% months in sorafenib group vs. 33.7% in the placebo group). Therefore, sorafenib is not an effective intervention in the adjuvant setting for HCC following resection or ablation.

In a cohort of 164 HCC patients, Ferrer-Fabrega et al prospectively validated an ab initio liver transplantation (LT) after liver resection in cases where histology of the resected specimen revealed risk factors for recurrence (microvascular invasion and/or satellites). They concluded that ab initio LT should be offered to those patients with a histologically proven risk of recurrence, there being no benefit in waiting for clinical evidence of recurrence by imaging. However, to avoid aggressive disease recurrence associated with poor prognosis, they proposed a waiting time of at least 6 months between resection and enlistment for transplant.

LT

LT is the treatment of choice in patients with early HCC according to the Milan criteria (MC), at BCLC stage 0 or A, with evidence of portal hypertension and/or hepatic dysfunction, who are therefore ineligible for resection. Despite its limited access, it represents a unique strategy to cure HCC, resolving both the tumor and the underlying cirrhosis.

### Liver metastasectomy and systemic therapy improve overall survival compared with surgery alone after curative liver resection of colorectal metastases in a developing country (costa rica) | JCO global oncology… [^112eQ7xp]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract Background Resection of liver-isolated metastases of colorectal cancer offers the greatest likelihood of cure. Nevertheless, recurrence rates after this procedure are high, and chemotherapy is a reasonable choice with inconclusive evidence. We aimed to determine if there is a survival difference between patients receiving systemic therapy with surgery versus surgery alone for resection of liver metastases. Results After a median follow-up of 41. 6 months, OS was significantly better for patients treated with systemic therapy versus surgery alone as part of isolated hepatic metastasectomy from CRC. 1Approximately 50% of patients develop hepatic metastases, and in one-third of cases the liver is the only affected organ.

At the time of diagnosis, synchronous isolated liver metastases are detected in approximately 25% of patients. If these lesions become resectable, the reported 5-year survival rate increases from 30% to 65%, and fewer than 2% of patients are still alive 5 years after diagnosis without any medical or surgical treatment.
2. For this reason, surgical resection of isolated liver metastases is the treatment of choice when feasible. Nevertheless, recurrence rates after this procedure are high, making systemic treatment plausible to achieve longer survival. Discussion The survival benefit from complete hepatic resection in patients with limited liver metastases from CRC is well established. 9Nevertheless, the role of systemic therapy following metastasectomy is currently under debate. 10Two randomized trials have shown a significant improvement in progression-free survival in patients receiving chemotherapy versus observation alone after hepatic resection.

Both these trials were prematurely closed because of slow accrual; however, the pooled analysis of these trials showed a nonsignificant trend toward better OS in patients receiving adjuvant therapy. In our study, we found that the relapse rate was similar to that reported previously in the literature. Despite these caveats and the low statistical power, we did find a significant difference in OS among patients treated with surgery alone versus those who received any systemic treatment modality before and/or after metastasectomy. These results are in agreement with a recent meta-analysis that showed a 23% improvement in OS among patients treated with liver metastasectomy plus chemotherapy, regardless of the timing of administration. 6.

### Liver metastases in colorectal cancer… [^114nLcUo]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Resection of colorectal liver metastases is a treatment standard because patients experience long-term disease-free survival or are even cured after undergoing this procedure. Improved surgical techniques for liver resection and downsizing liver metastases by chemotherapy, interventions to induce liver hypertrophy before resection, and the use of ablative techniques have allowed us to widen the indications for liver surgery and local treatment in situations with limited metastatic colorectal cancer. Retrospective analyses have demonstrated that patients who underwent resection for their metastases experienced improved survival compared with patients with medical treatment alone. This knowledge is based on retrospective cohorts 1, 4and patients resected for liver and lung metastases in prospective trials. 5Unfortunately, these reports are influenced by several biases.

6Resections are offered to patients whose disease responded to chemotherapy and who have a "better" prognosis, and the resection cohort excludes patients who have an early disease progression, a worsened performance status, or died before the decision for resection could be made. Unfortunately, overall and disease-free survival rates after resection decrease for patients with poor prognostic factors. In the CELIM study, the median disease-free survival after conversion therapy and resection was 16. 8 months among patients with less than five metastases,
8. 2 months among patients with 5 to 10 metastases, and 2. 5 months among patients with more than 10 metastases.

Improving Resectability Among patients whose disease is not regarded as suitable for up-front resection due to the location of the metastases or poor prognostic factors, chemotherapy is mostly the first treatment step, but other interventions also can improve resectability. Preoperative portal vein embolization of the liver segments planned for resection, which induces a hypertrophy of the not-embolized liver segments, enlarges the remaining functional liver tissue. 19In a recently published register of 320 patients, second resection was performed 14 days after the first intervention. During those 2 weeks, the functional liver remnant increased from 21% to 40%. 20This technique increases the options for resection of liver metastases and primary hepatobiliary cancers but was associated with a 90-day mortality of 8. 8% among patients with colorectal liver metastases of 5%.

20The combination of ablation with resection of metastases provides a more parenchymal-sparing approach for extensive liver metastases. 21.

### Advances in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma: an overview of the current and evolving therapeutic landscape for clinicians [^116dB3GY]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer‐related death worldwide. Contemporary advances in systemic and locoregional therapies have led to changes in peer‐reviewed guidelines regarding systemic therapy as well as the possibility of downstaging disease that may enable some patients with advanced disease to ultimately undergo partial hepatectomy or transplantation with curative intent. This review focuses on all modalities of therapy for HCC, guided by modern‐day practice‐changing randomized data where available. The surgical management of HCC, including resection and transplantation, both of which have evolving criteria for what is considered biologically resectable and transplantable, as well as locoregional therapy (i.e. therapeutic embolization, ablation, radiation, and hepatic arterial infusion), are discussed. Historical and modern‐day practice‐changing trials evaluating immunotherapy with targeted therapies for advanced disease, as well as adjuvant systemic therapy, are also summarized. In addition, this article examines the critical dimension of toxicities and patient‐oriented considerations to ensure a comprehensive and balanced discourse on treatment implications.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma: current surgical management [^111nLfwB]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy in the world, responsible for 500,000 deaths globally every year. Although HCC is a slow-growing tumor, it is often rapidly fatal because it is usually not discovered until the disease is advanced. HCC occurs primarily in individuals with cirrhosis, a condition that increases the risk of performing potentially curative surgical therapy. Over the last 2 decades, however, the safety of surgical resections has greatly improved because of advances in radiologic assessment, patient selection, and perioperative care. As such, the operative mortality rate for hepatectomy has decreased from the 10%-20% level seen in the 1980s to less than 5% today. The ultimate goal of treatment of HCC is to prolong the quality of life by eradicating the malignancy while preserving hepatic function. For treatment with a curative intent, the gold standard remains surgical resection, by either partial hepatectomy or total hepatectomy followed by liver transplantation. Resectability and choice of procedure depend on many factors, including baseline liver function, absence of extrahepatic metastases, size of residual liver, availability of resources including liver graft, and expertise of the surgical team. Patients without cirrhosis can tolerate extensive resections, and partial hepatectomy should be considered first. For Child class B and C patients with a small HCC, liver transplantation offers the best results, whereas partial liver resection is indicated in patients with well-compensated cirrhosis. Living donor liver transplantation should be considered using the same criteria as that used for cadaveric transplantation.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^1134D1bd]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

A strategy to allow for safe major liver resection in patients who would otherwise be left with an FLR < 40% is the use of preoperative portal vein embolisation (PVE). The portal vein branch ipsilateral to the tumour-bearing liver is embolised, inducing regeneration and hypertrophy of the contralateral lobe within 4 to 8 weeks after PVE. The success rate of PVE been reported to be around 85%, but is associated with a 10–20% complication rate and a risk of inducing severe portal hypertension in 1% of cirrhotic patients.

Recent data suggest that the presence of clinically significant portal hypertension in isolation might not be a formal contraindication in highly selected patients, such as those with well-preserved liver function (MELD score < 9) and good performance status in whom limited liver resection is planned. Outcomes are probably not as good as those for transplant in those suitable for this intervention. While further data are awaited, the decision to perform resection in this patient phenotype should be individualised.

Liver resection is a safe operation when performed in the appropriate context and with adequate patient selection. Modern standards of HCC resection in cirrhotic patients are defined as expected 5-year survival rates of 60%, a perioperative mortality of 2–3% and blood transfusion requirements of < 10%. Resection should follow general oncological principles (complete R0 resection) but must also be performed in a way to maximise recovery and preserve liver function. Anatomic liver resections with a 2 cm margin achieve the best results from an oncologic standpoint, and are recommended if adequate liver function can be maintained by the liver remnant. Non-anatomic resections can be considered if there are concerns about sparing the liver parenchyma when performing complete resection, such as with peripheral HCCs. The safety and efficacy of laparoscopic liver resection has been evaluated in several meta-analyses and propensity score analyses. These studies demonstrated equivalent or superior outcomes of laparoscopy compared with open hepatectomy. In a propensity score analysis, oncological outcomes were not compromised in those undergoing laparoscopic surgery, which was associated with shorter hospital stay, less morbidity, less transient liver dysfunction and fewer wound complications. Patient selection remains key. Further advances in liver surgery include robotic-assisted partial hepatectomy.

Tumour recurrence occurs in up to 70% of patients at 5 years, either as a result of intrahepatic metastases (true recurrent disease) or the development of de novo cancer in the cirrhotic liver. As outlined in a prevention section of this document, there is a promising signal that adjuvant systemic therapy using immunotherapy might reduce tumour recurrence.

### Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation followed by three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy versus transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation alone for primary hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^1146S11e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatocellular carcinoma, also called malignant hepatoma, is a primary malignancy of the liver. Despite regular surveillance conducted in high-risk populations, most people with hepatocellular carcinoma are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Consequently, only a minority of people with the disease are suitable for surgical resection when diagnosed.

Objectives

To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) followed by three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3-DCRT) versus TACE alone in adults with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, considered unsuitable for surgical resection.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science up to 31 May 2018. We checked reference lists for all included studies and related reviews for further relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials comparing TACE followed by 3-DCRT versus TACE alone in people with primary hepatocellular carcinoma.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as suggested by Cochrane. We presented the results of the fixed-effect model in the absence of statistical heterogeneity. Otherwise, we reported the results from the random-effects model meta-analysis. We assessed risk of bias of the included trials using bias risk domains and presented the review results incorporating the methodological quality of the trials using GRADE. Our main conclusions were based on the analysis up to three years' follow-up.

Main Results

We identified eight randomised clinical trials (632 participants) that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. All eight trials were at high risk of bias, and we rated the evidence as low to very low certainty. The mean age ranged from 16 years to 78 years. The proportion of men ranged from 60% to 75% and the proportion of people with stage III primary hepatocellular carcinoma ranged from 22% to 85%. The median follow-up duration was 12 months (2 months to 38 months).TACE followed by 3-DCRT compared with TACE alone may have reduced all-cause mortality at three years' follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.88; 552 participants; 7 trials; low-certainty evidence). TACE followed by 3-DCRT compared with TACE alone may reduce the proportion of participants without tumour response (complete response plus partial response) (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.61; 632 participants; 8 trials; low-certainty evidence). Data, from one trial on health-related quality of life, favoured the TACE followed by 3-DCRT group, but the provided data were ill-defined (very low-certainty evidence). None of the trials reported serious adverse events. The results on non-serious adverse events were as follows: TACE followed by 3-DCRT compared with TACE alone showed no difference in the results for proportion of participants with leukopenia (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.34; 438 participants; 5 trials; very low-certainty evidence) and serum transaminases elevation (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.66 to 4.27; 280 participants; 4 trials; very low-certainty evidence). However, the proportion of participants with total bilirubin elevation was larger in the TACE followed by 3-DCRT group than in the TACE alone group (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.40; 172 participants; 2 trials; very low-certainty evidence). The rate of participants with serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) without decline or normalisation was significantly lower in the TACE followed by 3-DCRT group than in the TACE group, but these data were from one trial only (Chi² = 7.24, P = 0.007; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

TACE followed by 3-DCRT may be associated with lower all-cause mortality and increased tumour response, despite the increased toxicity expressed by a higher rise of total bilirubin. Our review findings should be considered with caution because of the methodological weaknesses in the included trials, resulting in low- to very low-certainty evidence. Data on serious adverse events and health-related quality of life are lacking. We are also very much uncertain in the results of the reported non-serious adverse events. High-quality trials are needed to assess further the role of TACE followed by 3-DCRT for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

### Meta-analysis of determinants of survival following treatment of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma [^11128RdR]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following resection is common. However, no current consensus guidelines exist to inform management decisions in these patients. Systematic review and meta-analysis of survival following different treatment modalities may allow improved treatment selection. This review aimed to identify the optimum treatment strategies for HCC recurrence.

Methods

A systematic review, up to September 2016, was conducted in accordance with MOOSE guidelines. The primary outcome was the hazard ratio for overall survival of different treatment modalities. Meta-analysis of different treatment modalities was carried out using a random-effects model, with further assessment of additional prognostic factors for survival.

Results

Nineteen cohort studies (2764 patients) were included in final data analysis. The median 5-year survival rates after repeat hepatectomy (525 patients), ablation (658) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) (855) were 35.2, 48.3 and 15.5 per cent respectively. Pooled analysis of ten studies demonstrated no significant difference between overall survival after ablation versus repeat hepatectomy (hazard ratio 1.03, 95 per cent c.i. 0.68 to 1.55; P = 0.897). Pooled analysis of seven studies comparing TACE with repeat hepatectomy showed no statistically significant difference in survival (hazard ratio 1.61, 0.99 to 2.63; P = 0.056).

Conclusion

Based on these limited data, there does not appear to be a significant difference in survival between patients undergoing repeat hepatectomy or ablation for recurrent HCC. The results also identify important negative prognostic factors (short disease-free interval, multiple hepatic metastases and large hepatic metastases), which may influence choice of treatment.

### Is there a standard for surgical therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma in healthy and cirrhotic liver? A comparison of eight guidelines [^112cjHCD]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Expansion of the criteria beyond Milan

The AASLD guidelines, APASL, evidence-based Japanese guidelines and Germando not recommend the expansion of the listing criteria beyond the standard Milan criteria. ESMO-ESDO guidelinesgive no statement in this regard. According to the SEOM guidelines, patients with tumour characteristics slightly beyond Milan criteria and without microvascular invasion may be considered for LT. However, this indication requires prospective validation. The EASL-EORTC guidelinesstate that the extension of tumour limit criteria for LT for HCC has not been established. Modest expansion of Milan criteria applying the 'up-to-seven' criteria (new Milan criteria: HCC with seven as the sum of the size of the largest tumour (in cm) and the number of tumours) proposed by Mazzaferro et al in 2009in patients without microvascular invasion achieves competitive outcomes, and thus this indication requires prospective validation. In Italy, the expansion of the criteria was proposed, but the probability that a patient beyond Milan is transplanted is very low. LT for patients beyond Milan cannot be recommended according to the German S-3 guidelines.

Bridging therapy for liver transplant candidates already on waiting list

Generally, all guidelines recommend bridging therapy if the waiting list time exceeds 6 months. According to the ESMO-ESDO guidelinesin case of a long-anticipated waiting time (> 6 months), patients may be offered resection, local ablation or transarterial chemoembolisation in order to minimise the risk of tumour progression and to offer a 'bridge' to transplant. In Italy, bridging therapies are also allowed under progression while on waiting list. According to the German S3 guidelines, bridging is recommended when a long waiting time until transplantation is expected. According to the APASL guidelines, bridging therapy using local ablation or chemoembolisation may reduce the dropout rate with long waiting time of more than 6 months. According to the EASL-EORTC guidelines, patients already on the waiting list with tumour progression beyond Milan criteria and liver-only disease should be placed on hold until downstaging by local ablation or chemoembolisation is achieved and maintained for a period of at least 3 months. In the SEOMand JSH guidelines, no recommendation is given about bridging therapy for patients on waiting list.

### Survival analysis of re-resection versus radiofrequency ablation for intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma [^1137ps5N]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the fact that the chance of survival was improved by further surgical treatment, early first intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy, early second intrahepatic recurrence after either RFA or re-resection, and second recurrence in more than one organ remained poor prognostic factors for overall survival in patients with recurrent HCC after hepatectomy. Further research should therefore focus on adjuvant treatment after resection of a primary HCC. In fact, our recent study demonstrated the survival benefit of postresection antiviral therapy in antiviral-naive patients with early staged tumors. Alternatively, results from the STORM trial might identify a new avenue in the area of adjuvant treatment for HCC in the future.

Our study design was not without pitfalls: a small sample size, nonrandomization regarding choices of treatment, and selection bias. However, a randomized controlled trial might not be practical as fewer than 50% of the patients with a first intrahepatic recurrence were eligible for further surgical treatment in this study.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma: current management and future trends [^114yFjky]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The hallmarks of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are that it is identified clinically at an advanced stage and usually together with cirrhosis. Surgical resection has been considered the optimal treatment approach, but only a small proportion of patients qualify for surgery, and there is a high rate of recurrence. Approaches to prevent recurrence have included chemoembolization before and neoadjuvant therapy after surgery, neither of which has proven to be beneficial. Liver transplantation has been successful in treating limited-stage HCC, affecting cure of both the tumor and underlying cirrhosis. However, only a minority of patients with HCC qualify for transplantation. Recently, chemoembolization has been shown to prolong survival in selected patients who do not qualify for transplantation or resection. Other innovative, relatively noninvasive local ablative therapies have been introduced and have been shown to be effective in reducing tumor size but not in prolonging survival. Standard chemotherapy is poorly tolerated in patients who do not qualify for resection. Both doxorubicin and cisplatin are frequently used, but overall response rates are low, and neither seems to prolong survival. Prospective, randomized controlled trials using current therapies are needed to better define optimal management of this important tumor. Most needed, however, are new therapeutic agents that are effective against HCC, are noncytotoxic, and are tolerated by the typical patient with underlying cirrhosis. Newly emerging agents with promise include 90 Y microspheres, antiangiogenesis agents, inhibitors of growth factors and their receptors, and K vitamins.

### Anatomic considerations in the surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma [^117Ut3AZ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver and is a common cause of cancer death worldwide. Treatment of HCC usually consists of combinations of locoregional therapy, surgical resection, orthotopic liver transplantation, and in advanced cases, systemic chemotherapy. The best rates of cure are achieved with surgical resection or orthotopic liver transplantation in well-selected patients. The success of surgical resection depends on the adequacy of the extent of resection, balanced with the need to preserve functional hepatic parenchyma. Nonanatomic resection for HCC has been proposed as a surgical technique to maximize residual liver mass, but has been shown by some to yield inferior oncologic outcomes compared with formal anatomic resection. This review discusses relevant surgical anatomy of the liver, classifications of hepatic resection, and the current literature regarding outcomes of anatomic and nonanatomic resection of the liver.

Discussion

There is no worldwide consensus on the recommendation for surgical treatment of HCC, although the evidence is the same. Relative homogeneity in indications exists for the countries using the BCLC classification, with the exception of patients within Milan criteria and Child-Pugh C cirrhosis. These patients are classified as patients with end-stage disease according to the AASLD, SEOMand EASL-EORTCand therefore are consequently excluded from transplantation. Therapeutic-suggested option is best supportive care. The ESMO-ESDO guidelinesallow transplantation for HCC within Milan on Child-Pugh C, and these patients are not classified as end stage. It is remarkable that the two European guidelines differ in a so important point, in one case excluding Child-Pugh C patients from transplantation (EASL-EORTC) and in the other allowing it (ESMO-ESDO). The Italianand German guidelinesrecommend transplantation for Child-Pugh C patients within Milan criteria. The question about the effective usefulness of European guidelines, when, for example, European countries like Germany and Italy use their national guidelines, remains open. Moreover, there is no homogeneity between European guidelines itself. Spain has also its own guidelines which are only accessible to members of the Spanish society of medical oncology.

Another critical point where misunderstanding can arise is the treatment of single tumours between 2 and 5 cm in liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh A/B according to the EASL-EORTC and SEOM guidelines. In fact, both rely on the updated BCLC staging system (2011). As the original BCLC classification, on which the AASLD guidelines rely, clearly states that first-line treatment option is LR if no portal hypertension and elevated bilirubin are present and LT is indicated only in case of advanced liver dysfunction, the EASL-EORTC and SEOM guidelines are unclear in this point. While the text of the guidelines suggests treatment according to the original BCLC classification LR as first-line therapy, the graphical representation of the treatment algorithm in both guidelines suggests first-line therapy for such tumours is transplantation and not resection. Taking into consideration the graphical representation of patients with early stage disease (BCLC A) that they are not candidate for LR, we interpreted the guidelines according to the text and not according to the figure. However, this possible double interpretation needs to be mentioned and future guidelines should state without ambiguity the therapeutic strategy for these tumours.

### Resection versus transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma: how to offer the best modality [^116EAbnM]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Liver resection and liver transplantation are the mainstay of treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Patient comorbidities, tumor resectability, and perioperative morbidity and mortality risk, specifically of post-hepatectomy liver failure, are determining factors when deciding between liver resection and liver transplantation in patients who do not have an obvious contraindication to either treatment. Liver resection is preferred in patients without cirrhosis, and it may be a reasonable choice in patient with cirrhosis but preserved liver function and no portal hypertension if the size and function of the future liver remnant are appropriate, especially if organ availability is scarce.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma: locoregional and targeted therapies [^115BCJUL]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

HCC is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Advances in cancer screening and surveillance have allowed for earlier detection of tumors, affording greater treatment potential. The advent of locoregional therapies has generated greater treatment options for patients with HCC. Either alone or in combination as an adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, these novel approaches continue to hold promise for improving morbidity and/or mortality of patients with HCC. The emergence of systemic molecular targeted therapies increases the role of translational science. Whereas surgical resection and transplantation conventionally form the cornerstone of curative approaches, the advancement of locoregional therapies holds great promise in adding to the curative armamentarium.

### A snapshot of the effective indications and results of surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma in tertiary referral centers: is it adherent to the EASL / AASLD recommendations? an observational study of the HCC east-west study group [^113bgYVy]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate in a retrospective setting the patients' profile and results of those undergoing surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-volume surgical centers throughout the world.

Background

Whether surgery for HCC is a suitable approach and for which subset of patients is still controversial. The EASL/AASLD (European Association for the Study of Liver Disease/American Association for the Study of Liver Disease) guidelines, based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification, leave little room for hepatic resection; inversely, other reports promote its wider application.

Methods

On the basis of the network "Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Eastern & Western Experiences", data for 2046 consecutive patients resected for HCC in 10 centers were collected. According to the BCLC classification, 1012 (50%) were BCLC 0-A, 737 (36%) BCLC B, and 297 (14%) BCLC C. Analysis of overall survival and disease-free survival and multivariate analysis of prognostic factors were performed.

Findings

The 90-day mortality rate was 2.7%. Overall morbidity was 42%. After a median follow-up of 25 months (range, 1–209 months), the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 95%, 80%, and 61% for BCLC 0-A; 88%, 71%, and 57% for BCLC B; and 76%, 49%, and 38% for BCLC C (P = 0.000). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were as follows: 77%, 41%, and 21% for BCLC 0-A; 63%, 38%, and 27% for BCLC B; and 46%, 28%, and 18% for BCLC C (P = 0.000). The multivariate analysis identified bilirubin, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, tumor size, and macrovascular invasion to be statistical and independent prognostic factors for overall survival.

Conclusions

This large multicentric survey shows that surgery is in current practice widely applied among patients with multinodular, large, and macrovascular invasive HCC, providing acceptable short- and long-term results and justifying an update of the EASL/AASLD therapeutic guidelines in this sense.

### Surgical resection of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer: a systematic review of published studies [^116c9vtp]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

No consensus on the indications for surgical resection of colorectal liver metastases exists. This systematic review has been undertaken to assess the published evidence for its efficacy and safety and to identify prognostic factors. Studies were identified by computerised and hand searches of the literature, scanning references and contacting investigators. The outcome measures were overall survival, disease-free survival, postoperative morbidity and mortality, quality of life and cost effectiveness, and a qualitative summary of the trends across all studies was produced. Only 30 of 529 independent studies met all the eligibility criteria for the review, and data on 30-day mortality and morbidity only were included from a further nine studies. The best available evidence came from prospective case series, but only two studies reported outcomes for all patients undergoing surgery. The remainder reported outcomes for selected groups of patients: those undergoing hepatic resection or those undergoing curative resection. Postoperative mortality rates were generally low (median 2.8%). The majority of studies described only serious postoperative morbidity, the most common being bile leak and associated perihepatic abscess. Approximately 30% of patients remained alive 5 years after resection and around two-thirds of these are disease free. The quality of the majority of published papers was poor and ascertaining the benefits of surgical resection of colorectal hepatic metastases is difficult in the absence of randomised trials. However, it is clear that there is group of patients with liver metastases who may become long-term disease-free survivors following hepatic resection. Such survival is rare in apparently comparable patients who do not have surgical treatment. Further work is needed to more accurately define this group of patients and to determine whether the addition of adjuvant treatments results in improved survival.

### Neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors for hepatocellular carcinoma [^116Xp5T1]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for over 80% of all primary liver cancers and is the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. HCC's rise in recent years may be driven by the rise in alcohol use, obesity, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)/metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Approaches to HCC treatment remain challenging as many patients are diagnosed at advanced stages or with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Staging System stage C disease (that is, with portal vein invasion, distant metastases, and/or an ECOG performance status of 1–2). Many of those with intermediate-stage HCC who are ineligible for, or have disease progression after, locoregional therapies are candidates for systemic therapies but not for curative local treatments, including percutaneous ablation, resection, or transplantation. In patients diagnosed with early-stage disease, surgical resection has served as the mainstay curative treatment to achieve remission. However, recurrence rates remain as high as 70% within 5 years of surgery. Curative surgical resection outcomes depend on multiple factors, including tumor stage and pathological features such as microvascular invasion and undetectable micrometastatis at the time of resection. The 5-year survival rate is better in early-stage (75%) than intermediate or advanced stage (35%) cases.

There is growing evidence suggesting the use of adjuvant therapy, but neoadjuvant therapy is less explored. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are emerging as a promising treatment option for HCC, particularly in the neoadjuvant setting. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy can be used to downstage solid tumors, converting locally advanced HCC into resectable disease, and to reduce recurrence by eliminating micrometastatic burden. This paper provides an overview of the current landscape of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting for HCC, highlighting recent advances and ongoing clinical trials.

Background and aims

Liver resection (LR) and transplantation are the most reliable treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Aim was to compare different guidelines regarding indication for resection and transplantation because of HCC with and without underlying cirrhosis.

Methods

We compared the following guidelines published after 1 January 2010: American (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)), Spanish (Sociedad Espanola de Oncologia Medica (SEOM)), European (European Association for the study of liver-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EASL-EORTC) and European Society for Medical Oncology-European Society of Digestive Oncology (ESMO-ESDO)), Asian (Asian Pacific Association for the Study of Liver (APASL)), Japanese (Japan Society of Hepatology (JSH)), Italian (Associazione Italiana Oncologia Medica (AIOM)) and German (S3) guidelines.

Results

All guidelines recommend resection as therapy of choice in healthy liver. Guidelines based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system recommend resection for single HCC < 2 cm and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis and for HCC ≤ 5 cm with normal bilirubin and portal pressure, whereas transplantation is recommended for multiple tumours between Milan criteria and for single tumours ≤ 5 cm and advanced liver dysfunction. Patients with HCC and Child-Pugh C cirrhosis are not candidates for transplantation. JSH guidelines recommend LR for patients with Child-Pugh A/B with HCC without tumour size restriction; APASL guidelines in general exclude patients with Child-Pugh A from transplantation. In patients with Child-Pugh B, transplantation is the second-line therapy, if resection is not possible for patients within Milan criteria. German and Italian guidelines recommend transplantation for all patients within Milan criteria.

Conclusions

Whereas resection is the standard therapy of HCC in healthy liver, a standard regarding the indication for LR and transplantation for HCC in cirrhotic liver does not exist, although nearly all guidelines claim to be evidence based. Surprisingly, despite European guidelines, Germany and Italy use their own national guidelines which partially differ from the European. Possible solutions of the problems are discussed.

Recommendations: surgical resection

Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for HCC occurring in a non-cirrhotic liver (evidence moderate; recommendation strong).
The assessment for resection of HCC in a cirrhotic liver is a multiparametric evaluation considering liver function linked to severity of portal hypertension, extent of hepatectomy, volume of future liver remnant, as well as the patient's comorbidity profile and performance status (evidence high; recommendation strong).
Surgical resection is considered a first-line treatment for solitary HCC in a cirrhotic liver of any size when liver function is maintained and an adequate remnant liver volume can be preserved (evidence moderate; recommendation strong).
Laparoscopic resection of tumours should be recommended in suitable patients (evidence moderate; recommendation weak).
Clinical scenarios where resection may be considered include multifocal disease in patients not suitable for liver transplant, tumours associated with vascular invasion (highly selected cases) and after rupture of HCC into the peritoneal cavity (evidence weak; recommendation weak).
Adjuvant therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab improves recurrence-free survival but longer-term follow-up is required (evidence moderate; recommendation moderate).

Implications for Practice

The difference in prognoses between treatment with surgical therapy and continuation of local-plus-systemic therapy following successful down-staging of intermediate-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not clear. This study showed that for patients with intermediate-advanced HCC who underwent local-plus-systemic therapies, surgical therapy is a protective factor for long-term prognosis and can prolong overall survival. The same results can be obtained for intermediate-advanced HCC patients who met the criteria for surgical resection after conversion therapy. For patients who met the surgical resection criteria after conversion therapy, surgical therapy is recommended.

Results

Surgical treatment of HCC without cirrhosis

In all analysed guidelines, surgical resection is the treatment of choice for resectable HCC in absence of cirrhosis. In several guidelines, a more precise indication is given. According to the Spanish guidelines, LR is preferred in patients with early stage HCC who have no cirrhosis and an anticipated liver remnant of at least 20%. According to the ESMO-ESDO guidelines, resection is the recommended treatment in patients without advanced fibrosis, as long as an R0 resection can be carried out without causing postoperative liver failure due to a too small liver remnant. The German S3-guidelinesdefine the criteria of non-resectability as follows: non-resectable extrahepatic tumour manifestation, patients' general comorbidities, tumour infiltration in all three liver veins and a too small liver remnant. Also, re-resection in case of a recurrence appears to be feasible, as 5-year survival rates of up to 80% can be achieved as long as no extrahepatic tumour manifestation is found. Adequate postoperative liver function and portal hypertension need to be taken into account on functional resectability. In healthy liver, a minimum of 25–30% of liver parenchyma is needed to prevent risk of postoperative liver failure. Only the Italianand German S3-guidelinesexpress a clear recommendation regarding LT for HCC in absence of cirrhosis. According to the Italian guidelines, a LT can be performed if surgical resection is not possible and no vascular and nodal invasion detectable. Moreover, LT should be offered to those patients who develop a local recurrence not suitable for resection at least 1 year after the primary resection. According to the German S3-guidelines, LT without cirrhosis should only be considered in the specific case of local recurrence of fibrolamellar carcinoma in absence of lymphonodal metastases. Figure 1 illustrates the comparison of the guidelines using the assigned colour codes as described in the methods section.

Surgical treatment of HCC with cirrhosis

The American, the SEOMand the European guidelines EASL-EORTC and ESMO-ESDObase the therapy of HCC on the BCLC. For this reason, indication for resection and transplantation are mostly similar. The Asian, Italianand Germanguidelines base the treatment on the Child-Pugh Score. The Japanese evidence-based guidelines base the treatment algorithm on three major factors: liver function (Child-Pugh score), number and size of tumours.

Child-Pugh class A

According to the AASLD guidelines, resection is the first-line therapy for patients who have a single lesion irrespective of the size and a still preserved liver function, normal bilirubin and hepatic vein pressure gradient < 10 mm Hg. An increased bilirubin, a significant portal hypertension or minor fluid retention requiring diuretic therapy exclude resection also in case of Child A, and LT is indicated if the patient is within the Milan criteria (BCLC-A). In case of multinodular HCC within Milan criteria, LT is the first-line therapy. Resection is not indicated. For multinodular tumour outside the transplant criteria, neither resection nor transplantation is indicated.

The SEOM guidelinesrecommend LR for patients with solitary or limited multifocal HCC (stage BCLC-0 and BCLC-A), with no major vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread, no portal hypertension (defined as hepatic venous pressure gradient < 11 mm Hg or platelet count > 100 000), adequate liver reserve and an anticipated liver remnant of at least 30–40%. Patients within Milan criteria could be considered for LT from either a dead or living donor.

Similarly, according to the EASL-EORTC guidelines, resection is the first-line therapy option for patients with solitary tumours and well-preserved liver function, defined as normal bilirubin with either hepatic venous pressure gradient < 10 mm Hg or platelet count ≥ 100 000. LT is the first treatment choice for patients with small multinodular tumours meeting Milan criteria (≤ 3 nodules ≤ 3 cm) or those with single tumours ≤ 5 cm and advanced liver dysfunction. In case of recurrence, the patient is reassessed with BCLC and treated accordingly.

According to the ESMO-ESDO guidelines, in case of cirrhosis, resection is effective and safe (postoperative mortality < 5%) in early BCLC stages (0 and A), provided that one is dealing with a single lesion, a good performance status and no clinically important portal hypertension.

### Management of hepatocellular carcinoma [^114k5Em6]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rapidly evolving field. Advances in liver surgery and transplantation mean that curative treatment can be offered to patients with HCC in compensated livers who are diagnosed early or to those who are within transplant criteria. Explanted livers have provided a growing understanding of the underlying mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis and diagnostic modalities. Several locoregional therapies are also available. For advanced tumors, molecular targeted therapies are yielding promising results. Because of the heterogeneity of the patients and the disease, many questions are waiting for answers through well-designed, adequately powered, and bias-free multicenter, controlled, randomized trials.

### Role of repeated hepatectomy in the multimodal treatment of hepatic colorectal metastases… [^115cC5Sn]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion Multimodal treatment of recurrent colorectal cancer confined to the liver should begin with consideration of repeated hepatectomy. Surgical resection is the only proven therapy for long-term survival in patients with hepatic colorectal metastases confined to the liver. 1 Reports of 5-year survival after resection have improved from 30% to 40% several years ago to as high as 58% in recent series. 2, 3 Credit has. Treatment of recurrent hepatic metastases includes systemic therapy, hepatic artery infusion, radiofrequency ablation, and repeated hepatectomy. In the past, repeated resection was avoided owing to the concern about the increased morbidity of repeated operation, 10 but institutions experienced in hepatic surgery have shown that the morbidity rate of repeated hepatic resection is similar to that of primary resection. 11 Up to 30% of resections for hepatic colorectal metastases are now repeated hepatectomies.

11 Studies11–13 of survival after repeated hepatectomy vary widely, some showing limited success and others showing success similar to that of primary hepatic resection. Also, little is known about the utility of the newer systemic agents after hepatic resection. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients at the John Wayne Cancer Institute at St John's Hospital who underwent resection of hepatic colorectal metastases confined to the liver during a 6-year period. All patients during this period were treated in a multimodal manner with irinotecan hydrochloride– or oxaliplatin-based systemic chemotherapy in addition to surgery. Survival and risk factors after primary hepatectomy and repeated hepatectomy were analyzed to determine the value of repeated hepatic resection in patients with recurrent hepatic colorectal metastases. Because of the potential hepatic toxic effects of newer systemic agents, resection should be offered as soon as metastases are deemed resectable.

Because the risk and survival benefit approximate those of primary hepatic resection, repeated hepatectomy should be the initial consideration in the multimodal treatment of recurrent hepatic colorectal cancer metastases. For this paper today and this report, Dr Ahmad and his colleagues from the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica report their encouraging experience performing repeated resections in 19 out of 274 patients who initially received hepatic resection at their center and were followed over a 7-year time period. Importantly, the authors discuss and demonstrate excellent long-term survival in these 19 patients, with median survival of 70 months and a 5-year OS rate of 73% when taken from the time of initial resection.

### Recent advances in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [^1133s3wm]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide an up-to-date summary of the recent advances in therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Recent Findings

Surgical resection, liver transplantation, and local ablative therapies such as radiofrequency ablation offer potential cure for tumors detected at an early stage in well selected patients. The role of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy is being investigated, but there is no clear evidence supporting its routine use currently. Some have proposed expanding size criteria for transplantation or downstaging tumors detected beyond an early stage, although benefits must be weighed against harms to others on the waiting list. For intermediate-stage HCC, transarterial chemoembolization is the mainstay of treatment, although there is increasing evidence supporting a role for transarterial radioembolization. For advanced HCC, sorafenib is the only systemic therapy to significantly prolong survival in patients with Child A cirrhosis and good performance status. Ongoing trials are evaluating the role of other targeted therapies in patients with advanced HCC.

Summary

There have been advances in HCC treatment options over the last couple of years and there are now potential therapies for most patients with any stage of disease. Treatment decisions must be individualized after accounting for factors such as degree of liver dysfunction and patient performance status.

### AASLD practice guidance on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [^113gk13Y]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Surgical resection for localized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in noncirrhotic livers is the curative treatment of choice, while patient selection in cirrhosis hinges on tumor factors and liver reserve including future liver remnant (FLR) and clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Noncirrhotic HCC has historically accounted for only ~10% of cases in the Western world, although up to 30% of NAFLD-related HCC develop in the absence of cirrhosis, and patients without cirrhosis have lower postoperative liver-related morbidity, lower cumulative HCC recurrence rates, and higher disease-specific survival than those with cirrhosis. A meta-analysis of nine studies reported worsened disease-free and OS after liver resection in NAFLD HCC, though acceptable postresection outcomes can be achieved in well-selected patients. For compensated cirrhosis, most data support resection of a single lesion without CSPH and with an adequate FLR (typically > 30% in the absence of cirrhosis and > 40% in patients with cirrhosis), yielding 5-year survival exceeding 70% and postoperative mortality of < 3%; eligibility is not restricted by tumor size if FLR is sufficient.

Data support the role of surgical resection in select patients with multifocal HCC beyond BCLC Stage A criteria, a meta-analysis reported a survival advantage for resection in BCLC Stage B HCC (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35–0.90), and a Western multicenter study reported a 52.8% 5-year survival beyond Milan criteria; however, resection in PVTT is more controversial and extended indications should only be performed in high-volume centers after multidisciplinary discussion.

### Surgical management of hepatocellular carcinoma: resection and ablation [^1124FT6Y]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

In this article, the author reviews the recent advances in the surgical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Partial hepatic resection or, in some instances, liver transplantation provides the best chance for cure. Risk of perioperative mortality after partial hepatectomy is less than 5% in most experienced centers. Careful preoperative assessment of hepatic function is important to reduce the risk of postoperative liver failure after liver resection. Long-term outcomes after resection are comparable to those with liver transplantation, with reported 5-year survival rates of 25%-50%. Although limited controlled comparative studies exist, surgical and nonsurgical local ablative therapies, including ethanol and radiofrequency ablation, may result in survival benefit.

### Recurrence-free survival more than 10 years after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma [^1178JqfX]. The British Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

High recurrence rates after liver resection with curative intent for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain a problem. The characterization of long-term survivors without recurrence after liver resection may help improve the therapeutic strategy for HCC.

Methods

A nationwide Japanese database was used to analyse 20 811 patients with HCC who underwent liver resection with curative intent.

Results

The 10-year recurrence-free survival rate after liver resection for HCC with curative intent was 22.4 per cent. Some 281 patients were recurrence-free after more than 10 years. The HCCs measured less than 5 cm in 83.2 per cent, a single lesion was present in 91.7 per cent, and a simple nodular macroscopic appearance was found in 73.3 per cent of these patients; histologically, most HCCs showed no vascular invasion or intrahepatic metastases. Multivariable analysis revealed tumour differentiation as the strongest predictor of death from recurrent HCC within 5 years.

Conclusion

Long-term recurrence-free survival is possible after liver resection for HCC, particularly in patients with a single lesion measuring less than 5 cm with a simple nodular appearance and low tumour marker levels.

### Advances in local and systemic therapies for hepatocellular cancer [^112Vd48r]. Current Oncology Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Global incidence and mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has increased over the past two decades. Although transplantation and surgical resection offer a chance for cure and long-term survival, most patients present with more advanced tumor stage when these therapies are not possible. Although rarely curative, locoregional therapy with transarterial chemoembolization or radioembolization offers a survival benefit for those with liver-isolated HCC who are not amenable to curative therapies. Patients with metastatic disease or macrovascular invasion are treated with systemic therapy; however, median survival remains below 1 year. Patients with severe liver dysfunction or poor performance status should be treated with best supportive care given poor prognosis and no survival benefit for treatment. Lack of predictive and prognostic biomarkers in intermediate and advanced HCC tumors has hampered integration of clinical and molecular data to aid tailoring treatment decisions. However, with increasingly complex treatment decisions, optimal outcomes are achieved through multidisciplinary care.

### Network meta-analysis of adjuvant treatments for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after curative resection [^113rV2Hp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Resection is still one of the main strategies for the patients with early stage of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), and the expected survival of these patients could reach up to more than 5 years(Reig et al.). However, nearly 50% of the patients will develop recurrent HCC within 5 year after surgical resection(Tabrizian et al; Yao et al.), which decreases the overall survival(OS) in these patients and patients with unresectable or advanced stage indicate poor OS (Sun et al; Wang et al.) A study based on large scale of investigation and follow-up demonstrated that preoperative alpha-fetoprotein(AFP) level higher than 400 ug/L, tumor size greater than 5 cm, multiple tumors, satellites, microvascular invasion, cirrhosis and intraoperative blood transfusion were considered as risk factors of tumor recurrences(Yao et al.).

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) describes that a Technical Review Panel and a Guideline Panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and conducted an evidence review of systemic therapies in advanced-stage HCC using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework, and the Guideline Panel used the Evidence-to-Decision Framework to develop recommendations. The Panel agreed on 11 recommendations focused on systemic therapy for HCC in patients who are not eligible for locoregional therapy or resection, those with metastatic disease and preserved liver function, those with poor liver function, and one on systemic therapy as adjuvant therapy.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^115zhFCq]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — hepatic resection candidacy and alternatives are defined by liver function and tumor factors; hepatic resection is a potentially curative treatment option for patients with adequate liver function (C-P Class A and selected C-P Class B patients without portal hypertension), solitary mass without major vascular invasion, and adequate liver remnant, and resection or liver transplant are preferred options for patients with C-P Class A or C-P Class B (highly selected patients) liver function, no portal hypertension, suitable tumor location, adequate liver reserve, and suitable liver remnant; ablation may be considered in patients with tumors less than 3 cm in diameter who are not resection candidates due to age or comorbidity, the presence of extrahepatic metastasis is considered to be a contraindication for resection, and liver resection in patients with major vascular invasion should only be performed in highly selected situations by experienced teams.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma: current management and perspectives for the future [^1133JB2a]. Annals of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on current management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Background

Hepatocellular carcinoma represents one of the most common malignancies worldwide with a rising incidence in western countries. There have been substantial advances in the surgical and medical treatment of HCC within the past 2 decades.

Methods

A literature review was performed in the MEDLINE database to identify studies on the management of HCC. On the basis of the available evidence recommendations for practice were graded using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine classification.

Results

Advances in surgical technique and perioperative care have established surgical resection and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) as primary curative therapy for HCC in noncirrhotic and cirrhotic patients, respectively. Primary resection and salvage OLT may be indicated in cirrhotics with preserved liver function. Selection criteria for OLT remain debated, as slight expansion of the Milan criteria may not worsen prognosis but is limited by organ shortage and prolonged waiting time with less favorable outcome on intention-to-treat analyses. Strategies of neoadjuvant treatment before OLT require evaluation within prospective trials. Transarterial chemoembolization is the primary therapy in patients with inoperable HCC and compensated liver function. Although systemic chemotherapy is not effective in patients with advanced HCC, there is recent evidence that these patients benefit from new molecular targeted therapies. If these agents are also effective in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting is currently being investigated. Furthermore, selective intra-arterial radiation therapy represents a promising new approach for treatment of unresectable HCC.

Conclusions

Recent developments in the surgical and medical therapy have significantly improved outcome of patients with operable and advanced HCC. A multidisciplinary approach seems essential to further improve patients' prognosis.

EARLY STAGE HCC: SOLITARY TUMORS AND MULTIFOCAL DISEASE WITHIN TRANSPLANTATION CRITERIA

Surgical treatment, including partial hepatectomy and LT, offers long‐term survival with a good quality of life and is one of the only potentially curative treatments for HCC (Figures 2 and 3). Patients ideally suited for liver resection have localized HCC confined to the liver without radiographic evidence of invasion of the liver vasculature, preserved hepatic function, and no evidence of portal hypertension (although a minor resection could be considered in some patients who have portal hypertension). Although LT theoretically offers a better chance of cure over resection, several factors, including organ availability, limit its widespread use; thus liver resection remains the standard therapy for most patients who have resectable HCC.

Partial hepatectomy

Generally, liver resection is the treatment of choice among patients without cirrhosis. Unfortunately, less than one half of patients who are considered for hepatectomy are indeed resectable based on several patient‐specific and disease‐specific factors (Table 4). In noncirrhotic patients as well as those who have compensated cirrhosis, resection is recommended if HCC presents as a single tumor, regardless of size, assuming the patient has adequate liver remnant volume and preserved liver function (CTP class A with total bilirubin < 1.5 mg/dL; Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease [MELD] score, < 9) without clinically significant portal hypertension, and a good performance status.

TABLE 4
Key considerations in determining resectability (suitability for partial hepatectomy) of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Anatomic resection has been associated with improved recurrence‐free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with nonanatomic resection; however, nonanatomic resection is often appropriate to preserve parenchyma and mitigate the risk of postoperative hepatic insufficiency. There is currently a lack of strong evidence to support a clear magnitude of negative margin to be achieved during resection of HCC. Most observations come from retrospective studies, from which the conclusions may be affected by selection bias. The only RCTs available to date report a benefit in terms of local control within 2 years from surgery for wide anatomic margins (up to 2 cm) in patients who have a single HCC with preserved liver function.

### Advances in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma: an overview of the current and evolving therapeutic landscape for clinicians [^114J9yoF]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Contemporary advances in systemic and locoregional therapies have led to changes in peer-reviewed guidelines regarding systemic therapy as well as the possibility of downstaging disease that may enable some patients with advanced disease to ultimately undergo partial hepatectomy or transplantation with curative intent. This review focuses on all modalities of therapy for HCC, guided by modern-day practice-changing randomized data where available. The surgical management of HCC, including resection and transplantation, both of which have evolving criteria for what is considered biologically resectable and transplantable, as well as locoregional therapy (i.e., therapeutic embolization, ablation, radiation, and hepatic arterial infusion), are discussed. Historical and modern-day practice-changing trials evaluating immunotherapy with targeted therapies for advanced disease, as well as adjuvant systemic therapy, are also summarized. In addition, this article examines the critical dimension of toxicities and patient-oriented considerations to ensure a comprehensive and balanced discourse on treatment implications.

### Is there a standard for surgical therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma in healthy and cirrhotic liver? A comparison of eight guidelines [^116GDabf]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Liver resection (LR) and transplantation are the most reliable treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Aim was to compare different guidelines regarding indication for resection and transplantation because of HCC with and without underlying cirrhosis.

Methods

We compared the following guidelines published after 1 January 2010: American (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)), Spanish (Sociedad Espanola de Oncologia Medica (SEOM)), European (European Association for the study of liver-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EASL-EORTC) and European Society for Medical Oncology-European Society of Digestive Oncology (ESMO-ESDO)), Asian (Asian Pacific Association for the Study of Liver (APASL)), Japanese (Japan Society of Hepatology (JSH)), Italian (Associazione Italiana Oncologia Medica (AIOM)) and German (S3) guidelines.

Results

All guidelines recommend resection as therapy of choice in healthy liver. Guidelines based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system recommend resection for single HCC < 2cm and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis and for HCC ≤ 5cm with normal bilirubin and portal pressure, whereas transplantation is recommended for multiple tumours between Milan criteria and for single tumours ≤ 5cm and advanced liver dysfunction. Patients with HCC and Child-Pugh C cirrhosis are not candidates for transplantation. JSH guidelines recommend LR for patients with Child-Pugh A/B with HCC without tumour size restriction; APASL guidelines in general exclude patients with Child-Pugh A from transplantation. In patients with Child-Pugh B, transplantation is the second-line therapy, if resection is not possible for patients within Milan criteria. German and Italian guidelines recommend transplantation for all patients within Milan criteria.

Conclusions

Whereas resection is the standard therapy of HCC in healthy liver, a standard regarding the indication for LR and transplantation for HCC in cirrhotic liver does not exist, although nearly all guidelines claim to be evidence based. Surprisingly, despite European guidelines, Germany and Italy use their own national guidelines which partially differ from the European. Possible solutions of the problems are discussed.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^1172nw8V]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

NCCN hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) — surgery (partial hepatectomy) is described as potentially curative for carefully selected patients. Partial hepatectomy is a potentially curative therapy for patients with a solitary tumor of any size with no evidence of gross vascular invasion, and in well-selected patients can be performed with low operative morbidity and mortality (≤ 5%). Large retrospective studies have shown 5-year survival rates of greater than 50% after liver resection for HCC, and in selected patients with preserved liver function and early-stage HCC, liver resection is associated with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 70%.

### Current status of therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma [^111gQ1v7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing worldwide. A multi-disciplinary approach is required for its management. Screening high-risk patients allows for earlier diagnosis and the use of potentially curative therapies. Current recommendations for HCC screening for patients with cirrhosis are an abdominal ultrasound and serum alpha fetoprotein level every 6 to 12 months. Treatment choice depends on tumor stage, liver function and the patient's overall functional status. Curative therapies include surgical resection, liver transplantation (LT), transarterial chemoembolization, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Surgical resection, either primary resection or LT, is the treatment most likely to result in cure of HCC. Which option to pursue is based on multiple factors. LT has the potential benefit of treating both HCC and the underlying cirrhosis; however, long wait times incur the risk of tumor progression. Firm recommendations regarding the role of living donor LT for HCC are not yet possible because of conflicting data. HCC recurrence after LT is 8–11% and several adjuvant therapies have been investigated to reduce this. Bridging therapy and tumor downsizing are techniques that also may be considered to deal with long waiting periods and qualification for LT, respectively. If neither LT nor primary resection is possible, loco-regional therapies such as RFA and TACE should be considered. Systemic chemotherapies have proved disappointing for the treatment of HCC; however, newer targeted therapies such as sorafenib and cetuximab have provided new hope for the future.

### Nonsurgical treatment for localized hepatocellular carcinoma [^114DodB3]. Current Oncology Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The incidence and mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continues to increase worldwide and is the third leading cause of global cancer deaths. In the USA, HCC mortality has been rising steadily for more than two decades with no plateau seen. A dismal overall 5-year survival rate of only 5% is achieved, and more than 70% of patients present with advanced disease that cannot be approached with curative intent — i.e. transplantation, resection, or tumors < 3 cm that can be ablated.

The focus of this review is limited to treatment of the largest group of HCC patients seen worldwide — the approximately 70% who do not have curative options due to tumor size, number and/or location, and do not have metastatic disease. The most commonly employed approaches for control of HCC for the majority of patients therefore fall into two categories, which will be presented in depth: hepatic artery delivered therapies, and externally delivered radiation therapy.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — adjuvant and neoadjuvant systemic therapy recommendations: The optimal timing and duration of surveillance after surgical resection is unknown, although AASLD recommends indefinite surveillance (Level 5, Weak Recommendation). AASLD recommends use of adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor-based systemic therapy in patients at high risk of recurrence after liver resection or local ablation (Level 2, Strong Recommendation). AASLD advises post-progression treatment after adjuvant therapy based on pattern of recurrence (Level 4, Weak Recommendation).

### Neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors for hepatocellular carcinoma [^113iVYZT]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Surgery is still the main treatment for patients with resectable HCC, while further exploration into the use of neoadjuvant strategies in HCC resection is still needed. Immunotherapy is an emerging systemic treatment for solid tumors. Targeted drugs plus ICIs can achieve a tumor response rate of 30%and provide important treatment options for neoadjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy-based treatment prior to resection is feasible and is associated with high rates of pathologic responses and longer recurrence-free survival. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy has also been demonstrated to enhance antitumor immunity. Patients who are downstaged with systemic immunotherapies should be considered for resection. Larger randomized studies of neoadjuvant modern systemic therapy are warranted to determine whether this approach can improve HCC outcomes. The combination of immunotherapy and other treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, still require more evidence to demonstrate efficacy. Furthermore, examination of the TME following therapy provides valuable insight into mechanisms of response and may provide explanations for disease persistence in non-responders. Biomarker identification through these clinical trials has also given providers new tools to predict response and possibly relapse. This paper provides an objective and comprehensive evaluation of existing studies to evaluate neoadjuvant monotherapy or combined immunotherapy before liver resection or transplantation to decrease the risk of recurrence and convert unresectable disease into resectable disease. Efficacy and safety evaluations of neoadjuvant ICIs for resectable HCC are ongoing and offer promising results for the future development of standard neoadjuvant systemic HCC treatment protocols.

### AASLD practice guidance on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [^1139yLSs]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — surgical resection guidance: Surgical resection should be the treatment of choice for localized disease without cirrhosis, and in cirrhosis it should be considered for limited tumor burden with well-compensated cirrhosis, no clinically significant portal hypertension, and adequate future liver remnant (FLR). Minimally invasive liver resection may be performed in selected patients to enhance recovery and lower perioperative morbidity. Routine postoperative surveillance should be performed using contrast-enhanced multiphasic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 3–6 months after liver resection. Strength-of-evidence designations are "Level 2, Strong Recommendation" for first two statements, "Level 3, Weak Recommendation" for minimally invasive approaches, and "Level 3, Strong Recommendation" for surveillance.

### Evolving surgical options for hepatocellular carcinoma [^116DoknP]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgical resection and liver transplant remain the cornerstones of curative treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma. Determining the best treatment option for each patient is a complex decision based on degree of liver cirrhosis, extent of tumor, and overall patient performance status. A multidisciplinary approach is best. With widespread adoption, the role of laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma continues to expand. Long-term oncologic outcomes are similar for laparoscopic and open resection, with improved short-term results, mainly blood loss and hospital length of stay. Liver transplant remains the ideal treatment of cirrhotic patients with signs of portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma.

### Surgical resection of high-risk hepatocellular carcinoma: patient selection, preoperative considerations, and operative technique [^112sk1bm]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma remains a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. There are an increasing number of patients that do not meet traditional criteria for surgical resection as a result of historically poor outcomes. We define these oncologically high-risk patients as those with either one of these risk factors or a combination of them: large (> 5 cm) primary tumors, multinodular disease, and/or major vascular invasion. With appropriate selection and preparation, long-term survival is possible in this subset of patients after resection. This review focuses on the surgical treatment of these high-risk patients, focusing on our own institution's approach and methods as well as reviewing the literature pertinent to the support of our current practice.

### Pathological complete response after conversion therapy in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a retrospective study [^116h6Ja3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Although resection is the primary goal of conversion therapy, it is not the goal of treating patients with uHCC. MDT is needed when implementing conversion therapy and determining treatment strategies after conversion therapy. Maximizing patient benefits should be the sole goal of collaboration.

Post-operative adjuvant therapy aims to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. However, there is no high-level evidence for post-operative treatment after R0 resection, which means that the tumor is completely removed surgically and the margin is negative when viewed under the microscope. The choice of postoperative treatment regimen should be deliberated considering effectiveness and safety. Our adjuvant treatment included TKI and/or ICI, sometimes combined with TACE. And postoperative adjuvant therapy usually last for more than 6 months with a close observation every 2–3 months. If there are no signs of tumor recurrence and metastasis in two consecutive imaging examinations and the tumor markers (AFP, PIVKA-II), the adjuvant therapy can be suspended.

There were some limitations in our study. Firstly, it was a single-arm study, and the sample size was relatively small. Secondly, follow-up time is relatively short, which may not be very convincing to results. Thirdly, the effectiveness of different regimens of conversion therapy cannot be compared in detail. These are also the directions for our next research.

### Adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma [^116Hx3Fb]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver cancer is the sixth-leading cancer diagnosis and the third-leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, comprising 75–85% of cases. Advances in imaging and surveillance techniques have increased the number of patients who can be diagnosed at earlier stages, allowing them to potentially receive curative treatment. Surgical resection, transplantation, and ablation comprise current curative treatment options for patients with HCC. However, the risk of recurrence after curative treatment is high, with 5-year recurrence rates ranging from 40 to 70%. Furthermore, there are no FDA-approved treatments to decrease the risk of disease recurrence. Although there have been significant advances in the systemic treatment field for patients with advanced unresectable HCC, treatments for patients with resectable HCC are limited to physicians' discretion or clinical trials. This gap in knowledge has resulted in a significant unmet clinical need for this patient population.

Adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments have been utilized for many years in a variety of cancers, such as breast, colon, and pancreas. These treatments have been shown to reduce risk of disease recurrence and increase length of survival and are recommended treatment options by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Given the promising results demonstrated for adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment for patients with other types of resectable cancers, the role of adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment for patients with resectable HCC is a promising field of study.

In this review we report developments in adjuvant and neoadjuvant (including perioperative) treatment for patients with resectable HCC, with a focus on liver-directed treatments and systemic treatments. We conclude with a look at ongoing clinical trials that have the potential to improve outcomes for this patient population.

Adjuvant therapy in patients undergoing surgery with curative intent

Adjuvant therapy is not offered as a standard‐of‐care option, even for patients who remain at high risk for HCC recurrence after curative‐intent resection or ablation, although the incidence of recurrence may be as high as 88%. This remains an area of high unmet need because no beneficial therapies have been reported. Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which, until recently, was the first‐line treatment for advanced HCC, was explored as an adjuvant therapy in the STORM trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00692770). This large RCT, which that included 1114 patients (80% undergoing curative‐intent resection), reported no significant difference in median RFS compared with placebo (33.3 months in the sorafenib group vs. 33.7 months in the placebo group; HR, 0.940; 95% CI, 0.780–1.134; one‐sided, p = .26).

The phase 3 IMbrave050 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04102098) randomly assigned (1:1) high‐risk patients to receive adjuvant atezolizumab (1200 mg) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for 17 cycles (12 months) or active surveillance. Although the initial analysis of RFS suggested an improvement with adjuvant atezolizumab/bevacizumab, updated efficacy data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress 2024 suggested otherwise. RFS with atezolizumab/bevacizumab was 33.2 months versus 36 months with active surveillance (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.72–1.12). Furthermore, while OS data remain immature, there was no improvement with adjuvant atezolizumab/bevacizumab (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.85–1.87). Despite an acceptable safety profile, these data do not support the routine use of this adjuvant regimen for patients with high‐risk HCC who undergo hepatectomy or ablation.

Because of recent advances in surgical techniques and perioperative care, postoperative mortality after HCC resection among patients with cirrhosis is now < 5%, yet postoperative liver decompensation still ranges from 10% to 12%. Predictors of liver decompensation include the extent of liver resection, fibrosis, the presence of portal hypertension, and a MELD score > 9 or 10. In patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, resection should be considered on an individual basis, carefully weighing risks versus benefits and considering alternative treatment strategies (e.g. embolotherapies) because even a minor hepatectomy in this population can result in postoperative hepatic insufficiency and death. A large retrospective study evaluating the role of liver resection in patients with HCC and clinically significant portal hypertension was just completed (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT06245798) and is anticipated to clarify the role of surgery for this population.

### Advances in resection and transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma [^1131wFS1]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

It would be impossible to summarise all of the significant developments in the surgical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), even just over the past year, in a manuscript of this scope. Thus, we have selected topics for discussion that are the subject of current controversy and have attempted to present balanced points of view. Hepatic resection and transplantation are both mature modalities, and for the most part technical advances and improvements in candidate selection are incremental. The ability to readily cure hepatitis C stands out as the most impactful development in the field over recent years, especially in Western countries where hepatitis C has long been the chief aetiology underlying HCC and a predictor of poor outcomes after surgery, but its full implications remain to be clarified. The rising incidence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-related HCC and what it means with regard to surgical HCC management is an area of great current interest. With advancing technology, non-surgical locoregional treatments are gaining increasing application as potentially curative therapies. In addition, the advances in molecular and genomic assessment of HCC hold promise for personalising treatment and prognostication. The possible role of immunotherapy as an adjuvant to resection is being aggressively investigated. While liver surgery maintains an important role, the care of patients with HCC is more and more a team effort and needs to take place in the context of a well-integrated interdisciplinary programme to achieve the best outcomes for patients.

### Hepatic resection as the primary treatment method for hepatocellular carcinoma after orthotopic liver transplantation [^115iEMFQ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Liver transplantation (LT) is the treatment of choice for end-stage liver disease and certain malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Data on the surgical management of de novo or recurrent tumors that develop in the transplanted allograft are limited. This study aimed to investigate the perioperative and long-term outcomes for patients undergoing hepatic resection for de novo or recurrent tumors after liver transplantation.

Methods

The study enrolled adult and pediatric patients from 12 centers across North America who underwent hepatic resection for the treatment of a solid tumor after LT. Perioperative outcomes were assessed as well as recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) for those undergoing resection for HCC.

Results

Between 2003 and 2023, 54 patients underwent hepatic resection of solid tumors after LT. For 50 patients (92.6%), resection of malignant lesions was performed. The most common lesion was HCC (n = 35, 64.8%), followed by cholangiocarcinoma (n = 6, 11.1%) and colorectal liver metastases (n = 6, 11.1%). The majority of the 35 patients underwent resection of HCC did not receive any preoperative therapy (82.9%) or adjuvant therapy (71.4%), with resection their only treatment method for HCC. During a median follow-up period of 50.7 months, the median RFS was 21.5 months, and the median OS was 49.6 months.

Conclusion

Hepatic resection following OLT is safe and associated with morbidity and mortality rates that are comparable to those reported for patients undergoing resection in native livers. Hepatic resection as the primary and often only treatment modality for HCC following LT is associated with acceptable RFS and OS and should be considered in well selected patients.

### Liver-directed therapies: surgical approaches, alone and in combination with other interventions… [^116btM34]. ASCO (2014). Low credibility.

Liver Resection When feasible, surgical resection remains the best therapeutic option in patients with both primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. Hepatic surgery is based on the functional segmentation of the liver, which, in turn, is based on the principle that individual segments of the liver have independent vascular inflow, outflow, and biliary drainage. In general, the type of resection should be based on the location of the lesion and the goal of achieving clear surgical margins, while maintaining an adequate volume of functional liver parenchyma. Although the evidence suggests that oncologic outcomes for patients with colorectal liver metastasis treated with anatomic versus nonanatomic resection are equivalent, the effect on the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is more debated. 16In a separate study, Mavros et al reported on 251 patients who underwent hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastasis. 17In this study, the overall morbidity rate was 21.

9%, which was comparable to other reports in the literature. 12Complications, especially major complications, may affect both short- and long-term survival of patients. Possible approaches to synchronous colorectal liver metastases include either a staged or synchronous approach. Traditionally, a staged approach that involved two steps with resection of the primary tumor followed by liver resection was commonly utilized. More recently, a different staged approach known as the "liver-first" approach in which the liver disease is resected first followed by management of the colorectal primary at a later date, has been proposed. The overall median and 5-year survivals were 50. 9 months and 44%, respectively; long-term survival was the same regardless of the operative approach.

As such, the authors concluded that simultaneous and staged resections for synchronous colorectal liver metastases can be performed with comparable morbidity, mortality, and long-term oncologic outcomes. In general, tumor ablation should not be viewed as a replacement for hepatic resection but instead should serve as an adjunctive approach to resection. In some patients with extensive disease such as colorectal or neuroendocrine liver metastases, larger lesions can be resected, whereas smaller lesions can be targeted with ablation. The combination of ablative techniques and hepatic resection can sometimes extend the selection criteria of patients with secondary malignancies of the liver, because the remaining unresectable tumor can be ablated.

### Current approach to hepatocellular carcinoma [^114dn2LN]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 80% of all primary liver cancers and ranks globally as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. Partial hepatectomy remains the best treatment option for select patients with HCC without cirrhosis. Liver transplantation is well established as the gold standard for patients with HCC and cirrhosis in the absence of extrahepatic spread and macrovascular invasion. Local regional therapy is indicated in select patients who are not surgical candidates, and its role as adjuvant therapy remains to be clarified by prospective studies.

### Adjuvant sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma after resection or ablation (STORM): a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113jJ8ut]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no standard of care for adjuvant therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. This trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of sorafenib versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after surgical resection or local ablation.

Methods

We undertook this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with a complete radiological response after surgical resection (n = 900) or local ablation (n = 214) in 202 sites (hospitals and research centres) in 28 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 400 mg oral sorafenib or placebo twice a day, for a maximum of 4 years, according to a block randomisation scheme (block size of four) using an interactive voice-response system. Patients were stratified by curative treatment, geography, Child-Pugh status, and recurrence risk. The primary outcome was recurrence-free survival assessed after database cut-off on Nov 29, 2013. We analysed efficacy in the intention-to-treat population and safety in randomly assigned patients receiving at least one study dose. The final analysis is reported. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00692770.

Findings

We screened 1602 patients between Aug 15, 2008, and Nov 17, 2010, and randomly assigned 1114 patients. Of 556 patients in the sorafenib group, 553 (> 99%) received the study treatment and 471 (85%) terminated treatment. Of 558 patients in the placebo group, 554 (99%) received the study treatment and 447 (80%) terminated treatment. Median duration of treatment and mean daily dose were 12.5 months (IQR 2.6–35.8) and 577 mg per day (SD 212.8) for sorafenib, compared with 22.2 months (8.1–38.8) and 778.0 mg per day (79.8) for placebo. Dose modification was reported for 497 (89%) of 559 patients in the sorafenib group and 206 (38%) of 548 patients in the placebo group. At final analysis, 464 recurrence-free survival events had occurred (270 in the placebo group and 194 in the sorafenib group). Median follow-up for recurrence-free survival was 8.5 months (IQR 2.9–19.5) in the sorafenib group and 8.4 months (2.9–19.8) in the placebo group. We noted no difference in median recurrence-free survival between the two groups (33.3 months in the sorafenib group vs 33.7 months in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] 0.940; 95% CI 0.780–1.134; one-sided p = 0.26). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hand-foot skin reaction (154 [28%] of 559 patients in the sorafenib group vs four [< 1%] of 548 patients in the placebo group) and diarrhoea (36 [6%] vs five [< 1%] in the placebo group). Sorafenib-related serious adverse events included hand-foot skin reaction (ten [2%]), abnormal hepatic function (four [< 1%]), and fatigue (three [< 1%]). There were four (< 1%) drug-related deaths in the sorafenib group and two (< 1%) in the placebo group.

Interpretation

Our data indicate that sorafenib is not an effective intervention in the adjuvant setting for hepatocellular carcinoma following resection or ablation.

### Long term outcome and prognostic factors for large hepatocellular carcinoma (10 CM or more) after surgical resection [^1138yoiu]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical resection is the standard treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of surgery in treatment of large tumors (10 cm or more) is controversial. We have analyzed, in a single centre, the long-term outcome associated with surgical resection in patients with such large tumors.

Methods

We retrospectively investigated 166 patients who had undergone surgical resection between July 1995 and December 2006 because of large (10 cm or more) HCC. Survival analysis was done using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

Of the 166 patients evaluated, 80% were associated with viral hepatitis and 48.2% had cirrhosis. The majority of patients underwent a major hepatectomy (48.2% had four or more segments resected and 9% had additional organ resection). The postoperative mortality was 3%. The median survival in our study was 20 months, with an actuarial 5-year and 10-year overall survival of 28.6% and 25.6%, respectively. Of these patients, 60% had additional treatment in the form of transarterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation or both. On multivariate analysis, vascular invasion (P < 0.001), cirrhosis (P = 0.028), and satellite lesions/multicentricity (P = 0.006) were significant prognostic factors influencing survival. The patients who had none of these three risk factors had 5-year and 10-year overall survivals of 57.7% each, compared with 22.5% and 19.3%, respectively, for those with at least one risk factor (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Surgical resection for those with large HCC can be safely performed with a reasonable long-term survival. For tumors with poor prognostic factors, there is a pressing need for effective adjuvant therapy.

### Advances in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma: an overview of the current and evolving therapeutic landscape for clinicians [^114m9Ujg]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

Although current guidelines reserve partial hepatectomy for patients who have solitary tumors without macrovascular invasion and sufficient hepatic functional reserve, accumulating evidence suggests that it may be a reasonable option for highly selected patients who have multifocal (up to three tumors) HCC and/or macroscopic vascular invasion because they may achieve a survival benefit from surgery compared with TACE, systemic therapy, or radiation alone. This advantage is clearer in patients who have three or fewer tumors. No study has identified a cutoff value of the number of HCC foci beyond which resection is contraindicated. The limit of three nodules has been fixed in analogy with Milan criteria. Even if it is reasonable, results of surgery beyond this threshold are lacking. Also, there is ongoing debate about the definition of multifocal HCC because often it is a misclassification of satellite nodules (macroscopic or microscopic tumor foci situated close to the main tumor [≤ 20 mm] into the same segment, probably caused by HCC microscopic vascular invasion). Moreover, the distinction between multicentric and metastatic HCC deserves more attention: multicentric disease is the occurrence of multiple synchronous HCCs, while metastatic disease is the onset of a primary tumor with rapid development of intrahepatic metastases. Despite all of these limitations, these historical boundaries have been challenged. In 2008, Ishizawa et al. reported the first large retrospective series with favorable results for 126 patients who underwent resection of multifocal disease, which was associated with a 5‐year survival rate of 58%, although multivariable analysis revealed that the presence of multiple tumors was an independent risk factor for recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64). In 2013, Torzilli et al. analyzed more than 2000 patients undergoing liver resection for HCC worldwide, including 333 with multiple HCCs. Patients with BCLC stage B disease (including both large and multinodular HCCs) achieved a 57% 5‐year survival rate. Recently, Fukami et al. analyzed the Japanese nationwide registry, in which 1944 patients who had two or three HCCs underwent surgery were compared with 1302 patients who had a similar tumor burden and underwent chemoembolization. Patients in the resection group had better survival both in the whole series (5‐year survival, 59% vs. 42%; p < .001) and after propensity score matching (60% vs. 42%; p < .001), independent of HCC size (≤ 30 or > 30 mm). A recent retrospective study of 5000 patients with multinodular HCC, after a matching‐adjusted, indirect comparison, demonstrated that resection produced 1‐year, 3‐year, and 5‐year survival rates of 89.1%, 70.9%, and 56.4%, respectively, compared with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), which produced rates of 94.0%, 65.2%, and 39.9%, respectively, while TACE produced respective rates of 90.9%, 48.9%, and 29.2%. Multivariable Cox survival analysis in the weighted population demonstrated a survival benefit in patients undergoing resection over alternative treatments (RFA vs. liver resection: HR, 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–1.86; p = .01; TACE vs. liver resection: HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.29–2.68; p = .001).

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^111FnjUD]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

No randomised controlled trials have compared the outcome of treatments in patients eligible for both transplant and resection. Traditionally, liver transplant has been the preferred approach, certainly for patients with multifocal disease, as it is considered to provide the optimal oncological resection, treat the underlying cirrhosis and has excellent long-term outcomes, including overall and recurrence-free survival. Applicability of transplant may be limited by organ shortage. In the past decade, a number of studies have focused on the best approach for these patients. Two meta-analyses have evaluated this question. Postoperative morbidity and mortality, and short-term (1 year) OS were worse for those treated with a transplant. A comparison of pooled 5-year OS shows that transplant was associated with better outcomes (63% LT vs 58% LR and 61% LT vs 49% LR, respectively, for each study). It should be noted that recurrent disease after resection is high, with 5-year recurrence rates ranging from 18% to 72%.

The following points need consideration when considering optimal therapy for a patient. For multifocal disease within criteria, transplant probably offers superior survival to resection. Resection may be considered in patients not suitable for transplant. For a solitary nodule > 2 cm in diameter, transplant probably offers the best outcome long term, but resection is definitively a competitive treatment in carefully selected patients, with good short-term outcomes. The role for an individualised approach was emphasised in a study in which both treatment strategies were compared using a Markov model simulation and included sensitivity analysis-based factors such as patient age, liver function and waiting time for a transplant. Improved outcomes were reported for those receiving a transplant who had advanced liver disease (ie, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥ 10) and/or portal hypertension. However, equivalent survival outcomes for patients with well-compensated cirrhosis (MELD score < 10) and improved survival following liver resection for those with T1 lesions (solitary lesion without vascular invasion) were reported. These conclusions have been replicated in other studies.

### Neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma [^116aXFiM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatocellular carcinoma is a disease of great concern. Surgery is the treatment of choice, but there is still a high recurrence rate after resection.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies compared to surgery alone or surgery and placebo/supportive therapy after curative resection for operable hepatocellular carcinoma.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, Chinese Biomedical Database, and US National Cancer Institute's Physician's Data Query Trials Database until 2005. References of the identified trials were also searched for identifying further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared hepatocellular carcinoma patients who were given and not given neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy as a supplement to curative liver resection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two authors and discrepancies resolved by consensus. The survival and disease-free survival curves were compared using their one, two, three, four, and five-year survival rates, median survival times, and the result of the significance tests (P-values).

Main Results

A total of 12 randomised trials were identified, totaling 843 patients. The size of the randomised clinical trials ranged from 30 to 155 patients. Both preoperative (neoadjuvant) and postoperative (adjuvant), systemic and locoregional (± embolisation), chemo- and immunotherapy interventions were tested. Treatment regimens and patients selected were not comparable, so no pooling was done. Only one regimen using preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation with doxorubicin was similar in two trials. Four of the twelve trials reported survival benefit at five years when given adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. Disease-free survival was reported in nine trials, and the estimated hazard ratios show that disease-free survival was significant in two trials at five years. These two trials had not shown a survival advantage, but the recurrence was significantly lower in patients given adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. The highest toxicity rate was in a trial using oral 1-hexylcarbamoyl 5-fluorouracil which resulted in 12 out of 38 patients being withdrawn from the trial because of adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no clear evidence for efficacy of any of the adjuvant and neo-adjuvant protocols reviewed, but there is some evidence to suggest that adjuvant therapy may be beneficial offering prolonged disease-free survival. In order to detect a realistic treatment advantage, larger trials with lower risk of systematic error will have to be conducted.

Surgical resection

Surgery is the mainstay of potentially curative treatment for HCC. Surgical resection and liver transplantation achieve the best results in appropriately selected candidates (5-year survival 60% and higher).

Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for HCC occurring in a non-cirrhotic liver. This accounts for approximately 5% of cases in Western nations, and up to 40% in Asia. In non-cirrhotic patients, major liver resections can be performed with acceptable outcomes (5-year survival rates of up to 50%). Liver transplant might have a role in highly selected patients, such as those with recurrence after initial resection or with unresectable disease at presentation. Defining optimal candidates for resection of HCC in a cirrhotic liver involves a multiparametric assessment of liver function matched to the presence of portal hypertension, oncological staging of the tumour, extent of hepatectomy and future liver remnant after optimal resection, and the potential for a laparoscopic/minimally invasive approach. In addition, the projected outcome needs to be evaluated against other treatment modalities. In principle, resection should be considered for all those with non-metastatic disease and compensated cirrhosis without clinically significant portal hypertension. In practice, only in a minority of patients will this treatment be associated with acceptable perioperative and postoperative outcomes and equivalence or superiority to other treatments.

Initially, among cirrhotic patients in Western countries, the best candidates were defined as those with: a single tumour, bilirubin less than 1 mg/dL and without clinically significant portal hypertension (defined by hepatic venous pressure gradient < 10 mm Hg or platelet count more than 100 000/µL). In this situation, overall survival following resection was close to that observed after liver transplant (5-year OS of 74% for liver resection (LR) and 69% for LT).

The past two decades have seen an expansion of indications for resection. Most would accept the indication for resection in cases of a resectable solitary nodule without macrovascular invasion and extrahepatic spread regardless of nodule size. Some groups advocate resection as first-line treatment in patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis and resectable multifocal HCC within liver transplant criteria as well as for solitary nodules. In the East, all tumours without extrahepatic metastases are potentially resectable regardless of vascular invasion status, number and size of lesion(s).

### Expanding indications for surgical resection in hepatocellular carcinoma: what is the evidence? [^112uYEZj]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatic resection is one of the mainstays of curative therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The appropriate selection of resectable candidates requires careful consideration of a multitude of factors including tumor burden (size and number of nodules, presence of vascular involvement, extrahepatic spread), patient factors (performance status, underlying liver function), and availability of other therapies (access to transplantation, interventional procedures, immunotherapies). Historically, hepatic resection for HCC has been reserved for patients with solitary tumors without vascular invasion. However, in well-selected patients HCC tumors multifocal in nature or with vascular invasion should be considered for hepatic resection.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) adjuvant/neoadjuvant management — current standard and trials: Given the final results of IMbrave050, surveillance remains the current standard of care for management after resection/local ablation with the intention of cure. Surveillance for recurrence remains the current standard of care after resection/local ablation with the intention of cure, even in patients with a high risk of recurrence. There are currently no FDA-approved (neo)adjuvant therapies for HCC, and (neo)adjuvant therapies should be considered only in the context of a clinical trial. Several phase III adjuvant trials versus surveillance are ongoing, including pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-937), nivolumab (CheckMate-9DX), durvalumab plus bevacizumab (EMERALD-2), or camrelizumab plus apatinib. In the neoadjuvant setting, pathological responses rate after resection and recurrence-free survival is considered adequate endpoints, and phase II studies are exploring combinations such as atezolizumab+bevacizumab, nivolumab+ipilimumab, or lenvatinib+pembrolizumab.

Hepatocellular carcinoma arises in the setting of cirrhosis in most cases, requiring multidisciplinary input to define resectability. In this regard, more precise surgical management considers patient factors and anatomical states, including resection margins, tumour biology, and perioperative therapy. Together with advances in surgical techniques, this integrated approach has resulted in considerable improvements in patient morbidity and oncological outcomes. Despite this, recurrence rates in hepatocellular carcinoma remain high. As the systemic treatment landscape in hepatocellular carcinoma continues to evolve and locoregional options are increasingly used, we review current and future opportunities to individualise the surgical management of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of death in the world. With a 5-year survival of 18%, HCC is the second most lethal tumor in China by 2020. Only 5–10% of patients are ideal for resections, and the recurrence rate is still as high as 70% in five years postoperatively. Unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) represents a heterogeneous group of patients who are deemed unresectable due to tumor characteristics such as metastatic disease or invasion into the vasculature. Despite efforts to enhance screening accessibility, a significant number of patients in China are diagnosed with uHCC, which leads to a high incidence and mortality. Therefore, it is crucial to consider conversion therapy for these patients.

At present, conversion therapy can be divided into three main approaches. Firstly, for patients with poor liver function, efforts can be made to improve their liver function. Secondly, it is important to increase the remaining liver volume to meet the surgical requirements. Thirdly, the size of the tumor, the number of tumors, or the presence of metastasis could be reduced to down-stage HCC. Specific treatments are used, for example, transcatheter arterial embolization chemotherapy (TACE), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), portal vein embolization (PVE), systemic therapy like tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and other methods to make the tumors resectable. PVE is typically utilized to enhance the remaining liver volume. TACE and TKI/ICI may also be administered before the operation to reduce the tumor size or number. Surgical resection was performed after multi-disciplinary treatment. After surgery, some patients will receive TACE, TKI or ICI, which is defined as adjuvant therapy, to reduce the probability of recurrence and metastasis and improve survival time.

### Current approaches to the treatment of early hepatocellular carcinoma [^112c1Lfm]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

For patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), potentially curative treatment options exist, including liver transplantation, surgical resection, and ablation therapy. These treatments are associated with survival benefits, and outcomes are optimized by identification of appropriate patients. However, further studies are needed to definitively confirm optimal treatment approaches for all patients. Treatment patterns vary in different parts of the world as a result of geographic differences in the incidence and presentation of the disease. In particular, because of successful screening programs, a high proportion of tumors that are identified in Japan are amenable to curative treatments, which are appropriate in a smaller proportion of patients in the west, although screening is now widely carried out in industrialized countries. Differences in the applicability of transplantation are also evident between the west and Asia. Although existing treatments for early-stage HCC are supported by considerable evidence, there remain significant data gaps. For example, further data, ideally from randomized controlled trials, are needed regarding: the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy to decrease the rate of recurrence after resection or ablation, further investigation of the role of chemoprevention following resection, and prospective analysis of outcomes of living donor compared with deceased donor liver transplantation.

### Is there a standard for surgical therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma in healthy and cirrhotic liver? A comparison of eight guidelines [^116FRhhj]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Child-Pugh class C

According to AASLD, SEOMand EASL-EORTCguidelines, Child-Pugh C score defines an end-stage disease. Neither transplantation nor resection is recommended. According to the ESMO-ESDO guidelines, patients with poor liver synthetic function and tumour extent within the Milan criteria should not be denied the possibility of LT and are therefore not classified as terminal stage.

According to APASL guidelines, LT provides the best curative treatment within Milan criteria associated with Child C cirrhosis and without radiological evidence of venous invasion or distant metastasis.

In Japan, transplantation is recommended at this stage of cirrhosis for patients with HCC within Milan criteria and age ≤ 65, if disease control is not possible using other treatment methods. Tumour diameter, tumour number, tumour marker levels, extent of vascular invasion and degree of tumour differentiation are strong predictors of recurrence.

According to the AIOMand German S3-guidelines, LT is the treatment of choice for patients with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis within the Milan criteria. For Child C cirrhosis, no LR is recommended according to the Italian guidelines.

Figure 4 shows the comparison of the indications for LR and LT.

### An overview of clinical trials in the treatment of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma [^115pHzu2]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Partial hepatectomy, one of a few curative therapeutic modalities, is plagued by high recurrence rate of up to 70% at 5 years. Throughout the past 3 decades, many clinical trials have attempted to improve HCC recurrence rate following partial hepatectomy using adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment modalities such as antiviral therapy, brachytherapy, systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, transarterial chemoembolization and radioembolization, and radiotherapy. The goal of this review is to discuss the clinical trials pertaining to resectable HCC including surgical technique considerations, adjuvant, and neoadjuvant treatment modalities.

### Treatment of early hepatocellular carcinoma: towards personalized therapy [^116GeDmp]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

In recent years, the wide implementation of surveillance programs has led to diagnose HCC at earlier stages, when curative options can be applied. In order to obtain the best results, treatment indication should take into account the estimation of baseline life expectancy. Patients at an early stage are those with single HCC or up to three nodules < 3 cm with preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A-B) and no cancer related symptoms. These patients should be evaluated for any of the therapies that can offer complete responses with potential long-term cure, as reflected by a 5 years survival superior to 50–70%. These include surgical resection, liver transplantation and ablation. We briefly reviewed therapeutic management for early HCC, taking into account that any recommendation should be delivered in the clinical setting and based on an individualised evaluation of each patient.
