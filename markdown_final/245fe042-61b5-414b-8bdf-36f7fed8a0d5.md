## Question

Mycotoxins

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about mycotoxin exposure, mechanisms, health effects, diagnostics, and management, with careful attention to the strength of evidence and controversies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining mycotoxins and their major classes. Then, I should verify exposure pathways and which are most relevant clinically. Next, I will examine mechanisms of toxicity. After that, I need to review the strength of evidence for health effects across organ systems, including special populations. Then, I should appraise diagnostic approaches and their validity. Finally, I will outline management and prevention, and close with a balanced synthesis of the evidence and uncertainties, making sure I double-check claims against high-credibility sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and taxonomy. Mycotoxins are low–molecular-weight secondary metabolites of filamentous fungi that contaminate agricultural commodities and can persist through processing; the clinically important classes include aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, trichothecenes such as deoxynivalenol and T-2/HT-2, fumonisins, zearalenone, and patulin, with aflatoxins among the most potent genotoxins and carcinogens in humans [^113Y683C] [^114fc9ty] [^114EakcF].

> I need to check exposure pathways next. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about indoor air being a major source; authoritative statements consistently emphasize that diet is the predominant route of human exposure, whereas inhalation in residential or office settings contributes negligible dose compared with ingestion, and dermal absorption is not a recognized clinically meaningful route for mycotoxins in indoor environments [^111dTxxT] [^116EYhxS] [^114ERSr5]. Let me verify the dose contrast: modeling and empirical data indicate that even in moldy buildings, inhaled mycotoxin doses are orders of magnitude below thresholds associated with toxicity, and agricultural inhalation exposures are far higher than those in damp indoor spaces, reinforcing that diet dominates exposure in the general population [^113fMDgh] [^114ERSr5].

> Now, mechanisms of toxicity. I will now examine key pathways: aflatoxins undergo metabolic activation to an epoxide that binds DNA and proteins, causing genotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and hepatocarcinogenesis. Trichothecenes inhibit peptidyl transferase and ribosomal function, damage intestinal epithelium, and provoke proinflammatory cytokines. Fumonisins disrupt sphingolipid metabolism via ceramide synthase inhibition. Ochratoxin A induces oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and nephrotoxicity. Several mycotoxins modulate immune responses, including dendritic cell IL-12 suppression and Th1/Th2 skewing, with animal data showing adjuvant effects that exacerbate allergic airway inflammation [^114BBuBX] [^113LwaxM] [^112LnDtd] [^112Ccsxm] [^1139U2Cb].

> Next, I should review health effects and grade the evidence. For aflatoxins, there is strong evidence for hepatocellular carcinoma, acute hepatic failure with high-dose ingestion, and consistent associations with impaired growth in children. Mechanistic and observational data also link aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy to adverse fetal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction and possible prematurity, though causality remains to be proven in humans [^113Y683C] [^113b7kjH] [^1116hCYS] [^114wTboU] [^116saPD5]. For trichothecenes, acute high-dose ingestion causes gastrointestinal injury and hemorrhage; chronic low-level dietary exposure is plausibly linked to intestinal barrier dysfunction and growth effects, with emerging human data on deoxynivalenol and adverse birth outcomes, though confounding and co-exposures complicate inference [^113Y683C] [^113LwaxM] [^112fG5aD]. For fumonisins, animal data show multi-organ toxicity and carcinogenicity; human data are limited but concerning for growth and development in exposed populations [^114fc9ty]. For ochratoxin A, nephrotoxicity and carcinogenic potential are well described in animals; human relevance is supported by biomonitoring but remains less definitive for indoor inhalation claims [^112LnDtd] [^111dTxxT].

> But wait, what about indoor inhalation and so-called "toxic mold syndrome"? I should double-check the consensus. High-credibility toxicology positions conclude that mycotoxins are not volatile, indoor airborne concentrations are extremely low, and there is no validated dose–response or mechanistic plausibility for clinically significant inhalational mycotoxicosis in residential settings; reported symptoms are better explained by allergic reactions, irritant effects from mVOCs, or other causes, and there is no documented evidence that indoor inhalation exposure causes chronic toxic encephalopathy [^113fMDgh] [^114ERSr5] [^111LZWv2] [^112JpjnZ]. Hold on, I should verify the mVOC point: concentrations in buildings are typically in the microgram-to-nanogram per liter range, far below levels that produce sensory irritation, and their short half-lives make persistent neurocognitive symptoms weeks later an implausible attribution to mVOCs, so alternative etiologies should be pursued [^112JpjnZ].

> I will now examine special populations. Children in low- and middle-income countries have high dietary aflatoxin exposure and show dose-related associations with stunting and underweight. Mechanistic hypotheses include environmental enteric dysfunction and IGF-1 axis suppression, and a recent meta-analysis corroborates adverse growth effects, while a large cohort of severely ill children links higher aflatoxin biomarkers to mortality, highlighting clinical relevance in malnourished populations [^113b7kjH] [^1116hCYS] [^117CzzCD]. Pregnant women in endemic settings accumulate aflatoxin and DON, with biomarkers detected in maternal and neonatal samples and associations with impaired fetal growth; mechanistic frameworks implicate placental transfer, systemic inflammation, and enteropathy, though causality remains under study [^114wTboU] [^112fG5aD] [^113LwaxM].

> Next, I should review diagnostic approaches and their validity. Wait, let me verify the status of urine mycotoxin testing. There are no FDA-approved clinical tests for mycotoxins in urine, and CDC has warned that unvalidated urine mycotoxin assays can mislead patients and clinicians; low-level mycotoxins are commonly detected in healthy individuals, no disease-predictive thresholds exist, and results cannot be attributed to remote indoor inhalation exposure given short mycotoxin half-lives and lack of validated biomarkers for inhaled dose [^111KccLJ] [^117BHVJu] [^113fMDgh]. I should confirm the stance on antibody testing: ACMT states that mycotoxin antibody assays are not validated for exposure assessment, whereas fungal IgG/IgE can support diagnoses of allergic or hypersensitivity diseases but do not inform mycotoxin exposure magnitude or source [^112LByS7] [^116GiZs8]. For environmental assessment, direct mycotoxin quantification in air or dust is rarely informative in residential settings; instead, prioritize moisture control, visual inspection, and remediation of water damage, and avoid attributing symptoms to mycotoxins without a plausible exposure pathway and dose–response [^111dTxxT] [^114EwzX2].

> Management and prevention should align with exposure source and evidence strength. For dietary exposure, evidence-based interventions include agricultural and post-harvest practices to reduce contamination, regulatory monitoring, and nutrition strategies that may mitigate susceptibility; a Cochrane review suggests that farmer education and post-harvest technologies may modestly improve infant weight outcomes, though certainty is low and linear growth data are sparse, underscoring the need for better-quality trials [^1174M3W2]. For damp indoor spaces, the priority is moisture control, remediation of water damage, and standard allergy-focused care; there are no validated mycotoxin-specific therapies for indoor exposures, and public health responses should not be predicated on presumed mycotoxin inhalation risks in homes or offices [^114EwzX2] [^112tjsb6]. Let me reconsider supportive care: for patients with compatible ingestion histories or high-risk settings, standard supportive and symptomatic care applies, with attention to nutrition, liver function, and infection risk, while avoiding unproven "mold detox" regimens [^11494jhj].

> Finally, I should synthesize the evidence and uncertainties. The weight of evidence supports robust links between aflatoxin exposure and liver disease, growth impairment, and probable adverse pregnancy outcomes, with dose–response patterns emerging from biomarker studies. Trichothecene and fumonisin exposures are plausibly associated with intestinal injury and growth effects, particularly in children, though confounding remains a challenge. Ochratoxin A shows consistent nephrotoxic and carcinogenic signals in animals with supportive human biomonitoring data [^113b7kjH] [^1116hCYS] [^113LwaxM] [^112LnDtd]. In contrast, the evidence for clinically significant illness from indoor inhalation of mycotoxins is weak, with exposure modeling, environmental measurements, and toxicologic plausibility all arguing against meaningful dose or chronic toxicity in residential settings; thus, attributing nonspecific symptoms to "toxic mold" without a validated exposure–response is not supported [^113fMDgh] [^114ERSr5] [^113tmtb4]. I need to ensure I emphasize the key gaps: validated biomarkers for inhaled mycotoxin dose, prospective human data on multi-mycotoxin co-exposures, and randomized interventions to test causality for developmental outcomes remain priorities for research and policy [^111dTxxT] [^1174M3W2].

Mycotoxins are **toxic secondary metabolites** produced by molds that contaminate food and feed, posing significant health risks globally [^113Y683C]. The most clinically significant are aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, trichothecenes, and zearalenone, each linked to specific toxic effects such as hepatocarcinogenicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, immunosuppression, and reproductive toxicity [^113Y683C]. Exposure is primarily through ingestion of contaminated foods (grains, nuts, spices, dairy) [^116EYhxS], with inhalation of indoor mold-derived mycotoxins being a minor, debated route [^113fMDgh]. Diagnosis relies on validated biomarkers (e.g. aflatoxin–albumin adducts, urinary mycotoxins) [^116wujev] and environmental testing; routine clinical mycotoxin assays are not recommended [^111KccLJ]. Management is supportive, with prevention via good agricultural and storage practices, regulatory limits, and public health surveillance [^1174M3W2] [^114EakcF].

## Routes of exposure

- **Dietary ingestion**: Primary route via contaminated foods (grains, nuts, spices, dairy) [^116EYhxS].
- **Inhalation**: Minor route from indoor mold; evidence for significant health effects is limited and debated [^113fMDgh] [^114ERSr5].
- **Dermal exposure**: Rare and typically insignificant [^notfound].

---

## Populations at risk

- **Infants and children**: High susceptibility due to developing organ systems; risk of growth impairment and developmental effects [^113b7kjH] [^112TWfvE].
- **Pregnant women**: Exposure linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g. low birth weight, preterm birth) [^114wTboU] [^112fG5aD].
- **Immunocompromised individuals**: Increased risk of infections and severe health effects [^114EwzX2].
- **Occupational groups**: Farmers, grain handlers, and food industry workers with higher exposure risk [^113i6jfv].

---

## Diagnosis and detection

- **Biomarkers**: Aflatoxin–albumin adducts, urinary mycotoxins, and blood mycotoxin levels are used in research and some clinical settings [^116wujev].
- **Environmental testing**: Air and surface sampling for mycotoxins in indoor environments [^1126SSdx].
- **Clinical testing**: Routine clinical mycotoxin assays are not recommended due to lack of validation and clinical utility [^111KccLJ] [^112LByS7].

---

## Prevention and control

- **Good agricultural practices**: Pre-harvest and post-harvest management to prevent mold growth and mycotoxin contamination [^114L5obj].
- **Regulatory measures**: Establishment of maximum allowable mycotoxin levels in food and feed [^notfound].
- **Public health surveillance**: Monitoring and education programs to reduce exposure and health risks [^114EwzX2].

---

## Treatment and management

Treatment is primarily **supportive**, addressing symptoms and complications. Chelation therapy and antifungal medications are not effective for mycotoxin poisoning. Management focuses on **removal of the exposure source** and supportive care [^1117wLw3].

---

Mycotoxins are a significant public health concern, particularly in developing countries. Effective prevention, detection, and management strategies are essential to reduce their impact on human health [^1116hCYS].

INVESTIGATION OF EED AS A CAUSAL PATHWAY LINKING MYCOTOXINS TO STUNTING

We hypothesize that mycotoxin exposure will be associated with EED and that this is an important causal pathway through which mycotoxins mediate stunting. The biomarkers used in this analysis will evaluate multiple domains of EED, as described elsewhere. Our statistical approach will be the same as that described above for the outcome of stunting. We will additionally test whether EED, diarrhea, and decreased appetite mediate the association between mycotoxins and stunting.

We have estimated our power using the Vittinghoff method for sample size calculation for evaluating mediation. With 1000 infants, we will be able to detect an effect size of 30% of 1 standard deviation, with lactulose-mannitol ratio as our primary mediator.

Background

Aflatoxins are one family of mycotoxins, and are a naturally occurring toxic by-product, named after the genus of fungus that produces it (Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus). Aflatoxins are largely associated with agriculture commodities produced in the tropics & subtropics. Aflatoxin may enter the food supply by direct contamination of food products resulting from mould growth on food, or by indirect contamination through the use of contaminated ingredients in processed food or through use of animal products such as milk, milk products, eggs or meat. Pre- and post-harvest crop management has a significant influence on the accumulation of aflatoxin in dietary staples; thus populations highly reliant on these staples and with limited agricultural capacity and storage facilities are most frequently exposed through diets. The use of aflatoxin metabolites as biomarkers has been a common approach to understand individuals' dietary exposure to these toxins, but also uptake, toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of these toxins. Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) has been well established as a biomarker of exposure for the recent (24–72 hours) ingestion of Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and is the most frequently detected urinary aflatoxin.

In many parts of the developing world, exposure to aflatoxins at high levels remains a significant health burden. It is estimated that approximately 4.5 billion people, predominantly those living in developing countries, are at risk of exposure to aflatoxins. A study done in Northern Ethiopia by A. Ayelign et al (2016) among children aged 1 to 4 years, reported that aflatoxin M1 was found in 7% out of 200 urine samples analysed with a mean concentration of 0.064ng/ml. According to Partnership for Aflatoxin Control in Africa (PACA) report in 2014, children under-five remain particularly vulnerable to aflatoxin exposure significantly hindering children's growth and development while damaging their immunity. In Ethiopia, the prevalence of impaired growth is still worryingly high, where the proportion of stunting in children under 5 years is 38%. Moreover, animal studies provide evidence that chronic aflatoxin exposure retards growth and interferes with micronutrient absorption and utilization.

### Chemical exposure and alveolar macrophages responses:' the role of pulmonary defense mechanism in inhalation injuries' [^113t5Z32]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Lung inflammation is caused by various cell types, including alveolar macrophages (AMs), in response to airborne stimuli and inhaled toxins. AMs act as the first line of defence and play a vital role in coordinating the initiation and resolution of the inflammatory response in the lungs. Long-term exposure to external stimulation induces a severe immune response, leading to the release of cytokines and chemokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Exposure to PM leads to the production of ROS and enzymes, indicating oxidative stress as a common mechanism of damage. Both oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to respiratory diseases by causing alveolar destruction.

At present, there is no definite cure or effective treatment for severe lung inflammation caused by biotoxins. Some studies have summarised the lung inflammation following exposure to cigarette smoke, mycotoxins and ricin. However, to fully understand the effective mechanism of biotoxins on lung inflammation, more investigations are needed. The current review aimed to summarise the current state of knowledge regarding biological toxins. Investigating the effects of chemical exposures on the immune system's response through AMs can help find solutions for treating damages caused by toxic exposure. This approach can help identify common pathways, enabling the identification of therapeutic targets for anti-inflammatory treatments. Ultimately, this will lead to the design of effective strategies for successfully treating acute and chronic lung inflammation.

Inhalation toxins

Toxins, as defined in modern terms, are the metabolic products of poisons from bacteria, plants, animals and fungi that can be found in nature or produced through chemical/biotechnological means. Gases and vapours are commonly inhaled substances, while liquids and solids can be inhaled in the form of fine mist, airborne particles or dusts. This may cause irritated lung damage, suffocation or other systemic effects and acute inhalation damage. In this section, the absorption process of toxins, that cause lung damage through inhalation, was summarised.

### Adverse associations between maternal deoxynivalenol exposure and birth outcomes: a prospective cohort study in China [^111rdNCu]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Several limitations in the present study should be mentioned. First, though we performed a multivariate analysis model to adjust for potential confounders, there were unmeasured confounders that could affect exposure concentrations and infant birth outcomes. Second, we only measured DON in the urine but not in the blood. Studies have demonstrated that urinary DON biomarkers have been shown to be a good indicator of the body's burden to assess DON exposure. Third, pregnant women provided urinary in the second trimester were included for analyses in the present study. Dietary changes due to early trimester pregnancy symptoms may result in urinary DON levels that do not accurately reflect DON exposure during pregnancy. Finally, we focused on a single mycotoxin exposure without considering the potential effects of other mycotoxins exposure. Pregnant women may be exposed to multiple mycotoxins simultaneously by dietary, since similar environmental conditions could produce several mycotoxins in foods at the same time. Although a cohort study in Bangladesh reported that maternal dietary intake of ochratoxin A was associated with higher risk of having an LBW baby, it did not find a difference between exposure alone and combined exposure to other mycotoxins. Therefore, further epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate the complex effects of co-exposure of mycotoxins on the health risk in pregnant women.

### The myth of mycotoxins and mold injury [^113tmtb4]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

In recent years, mold has been blamed for many symptoms or a constellation of symptoms. These symptoms are usually vague and subjective and difficult or impossible to measure or quantify. Moreover, there is no scientific evidence that mold has anything to do with these symptoms. In particular, the concept of toxic mold syndrome has permeated the public consciousness, and mycotoxins have falsely been associated with autoimmune diseases and a variety of other conditions. In fact, there is no evidence that the presence of mycotoxins in the air is enough to cause any disease known to man. Molds legitimately can cause allergies and can be a trigger for asthma. Certain specific molds such as Aspergillus can be a cause of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In immunocompromised hosts, both dermatologic and systemic infections can result from various fungi and can be associated with significant morbidity or even mortality. However, the existence of toxic mold syndrome has been disproven, despite the numerous disreputable practices such as testing homes for mold spores, measuring "mycotoxins" in the urine, and testing patients for IgG to mold. In truth, none of these techniques have been validated, nor do they have any relevance to any clinical disease. All that these tests that are being performed by laboratories of disrepute does is to further propagate misinformation and inflict unnecessary and often exorbitant costs on patients desperate for a clinical diagnosis, right or wrong, for their constellation of maladies.

### ACMT position statement: medical toxicology considerations in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with concerns about mold-related inhalation exposures [^1117wLw3]. ACMT (2025). High credibility.

American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) position — mold-related inhalation exposures states that there are no medical toxicologically-based diagnostic laboratory or treatment modalities in the management of individuals exposed to damp indoor spaces that are supportive of inhalation contact with mycotoxins as a systemic toxicant associated with mold/fungi. The document clarifies that this is the position of the American College of Medical Toxicology at the time written, after a review of the issue and pertinent literature.

### Notes from the field: use of unvalidated urine mycotoxin tests for the clinical diagnosis of illness – United States, 2014 [^111KccLJ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

The laboratory mentioned its Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification on its reports and noted that the urine mycotoxin testing was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). CLIA regulations require any laboratory that performs testing on patient specimens to have an appropriate CLIA certificate and to meet applicable quality and analytic standards to ensure accurate and reliable test results. * CLIA regulations, however, do not address the clinical validity of testing (i.e. the accuracy with which the test identifies, measures, or predicts a patient's clinical status). † FDA clearance or approval of a test provides assurance that the test has adequate analytical and clinical validation and that it is safe and effective. § There is no FDA-approved test for mycotoxins in human urine.

During the past 10 years, CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has received many requests for workplace evaluations based on the results of unvalidated laboratory tests purported to diagnose occupational and environmental illnesses caused by exposure to fungi (including molds). Using unvalidated laboratory tests to diagnose work-related illness can lead to misinformation and fear in the workplace; incorrect diagnoses; unnecessary, inappropriate, and potentially harmful medical interventions; and unnecessary or inappropriate environmental and occupational evaluations.

Mycotoxins are metabolites of some fungi that can cause illness in humans and animals, primarily after ingestion of contaminated foods. Low levels of mycotoxins are found in many foods; therefore, mycotoxins are found in the urine of healthy persons. Mycotoxin levels that predict disease have not been established. Urine mycotoxin tests are not approved by FDA for accuracy or for clinical use.

CDC does not recommend biologic testing of persons who work or live in water-damaged buildings nor routine environmental sampling for mold. To identify possible mold contamination, visual inspection is the first step. To inspect the interior of walls and other difficult-to-examine spaces, a borescope can be inserted through a small hole. Moisture meters can measure moisture in building materials such as carpet, wallboard, wood, brick, and concrete. Identification and elimination of sources of moisture and cleaning or replacement of contaminated materials is essential.

Persons using direct-to-consumer laboratory tests that have not been approved by FDA for diagnostic purposes and their health care providers need to understand that these tests might not be valid or clinically useful. Additional information about molds and their health effects is available at.

### ACMT position statement: institute of medicine report on damp indoor spaces and health [^1133b2LH]. ACMT (2022). High credibility.

Organic Dust Toxic Syndrome (ODTS) — ODTS is described with microbial exposures in agricultural environments and includes fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, dyspnea, chest tightness, dry cough, and nausea; symptoms are transient and generally resolve within hours to days from acute exposure, and there is no documented evidence that inhalation exposure to fungi or mycotoxins in indoor environments causes a chronic toxic encephalopathy.

### Aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy, maternal anemia, and adverse birth outcomes [^11642n2X]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Recently, documented high prevalence of exposure during pregnancy has directed focus on aflatoxins as a potential harmful exposure during the first 1,000 days, — the developmentally sensitive period from conception to 2 years of age. There are no published randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a narrative review to evaluate the evidence for a potential role of aflatoxin exposure and anemia in intrauterine growth retardation, preterm birth, and pregnancy loss.

### Getting to the root of the matter: challenges and recommendations for assessing the safety of botanical dietary supplements [^115KJtJi]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

The National Toxicology Program's (NTP) mission is "to evaluate agents of public health concern, by developing and applying the tools of modern toxicology and molecular biology". Botanical dietary supplements (BDS) represent agents of public health concern due to widespread exposure to high doses, a lack of safety data for most products, variable quality, and reports of adverse events. This commentary will address lessons learned in NTP testing activities with BDS and recommendations for moving forward.

ACMT position statement — sources of human mycotoxin exposure notes that the diet is the most important source of human exposure to mycotoxins. It lists mycotoxins of known dietary importance including aflatoxins (in corn, ground nuts, and dairy products), trichothecenes (in corn, cereals and fermented beverages) and ochratoxins (in coffee, wine, and dried fruits), and states that risk assessment studies should be used as a benchmark for interpreting exposures from other sources and pathways in addition to dietary ingestion.

### The potential role of mycotoxins as a contributor to stunting in the SHINE trial [^112Ay5ia]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

MYCOTOXIN INVESTIGATIONS IN THE SHINE TRIAL

The overall objective of this substudy is to describe the risk factors contributing to mycotoxin exposure and to assess the potential role of mycotoxin exposure in the pathogenesis of stunting. Our overarching hypothesis is that AF exposure, alone or in combination with FUM and DON, contributes to EED and is an important cause of child stunting. Specifically, this substudy will assess the relationship between agricultural and harvest practices and mycotoxin exposure; assess the relationship between mycotoxin exposure and child stunting; and investigate EED as a potential pathway linking mycotoxin exposure to child stunting.

### Mycotoxins-FDA… [^113Y683C]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

As an individual consumer, you generally cannot control the presence of mycotoxins in your food. The fungi that produce mycotoxins generally grow during crop production and storage. The FDA has a monitoring program to help ensure that the foods available for you to buy are not contaminated with mycotoxins. The mycotoxins in human food that the FDA currently focuses on are aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, fumonisins, patulin, ochratoxin A, T-2 and HT-2 toxins, and zearalenone. The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine also monitors mycotoxins in animal food. Aflatoxins Aflatoxins are mycotoxins produced by certain Aspergillus molds. Several types of aflatoxins exist, but food contamination usually involves aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 for crops and M1 for milk. Regularly eating foods with aflatoxins can increase your risk of liver cancer, cause birth defects, and lead to kidney and immune system problems.

Eating food containing a large amount of aflatoxins at one time or for several days can lead to liver failure and even death. Because of these health risks, the FDA has published action levels for aflatoxin and regularly tests foods for the presence of aflatoxins. By using modern agricultural and processing techniques, companies can reduce the possibility of contamination in their products. T-2 and HT-2 Toxins T-2 and HT-2 toxins are mycotoxins produced by Fusarium molds. These toxins are found in contaminated grains, such as wheat, rye, oat, and barley. Contamination generally occurs when these foods are not stored and/or dried properly. T-2 and HT-2 can possibly cause health issues such as high fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and hemorrhage in humans. Other health effects have been demonstrated in animal studies, including disrupted ovulation and semen production. Zearalenone Zearalenone is a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium molds.

It has been found in contaminated grains, such as corn, oats, wheat, sorghum, and rice. Contamination generally occurs when these foods are not stored and/or dried properly. Zearalenone can possibly cause reproductive issues in both humans and animals.

### Spectrum of noninfectious health effects from molds [^1113D6BQ]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Molds are multicellular fungi that are ubiquitous in outdoor and indoor environments. For humans, they are both beneficial (for the production of antimicrobial agents, chemotherapeutic agents, and vitamins) and detrimental. Exposure to mold can occur through inhalation, ingestion, and touching moldy surfaces. Adverse health effects may occur through allergic, infectious, irritant, or toxic processes. The cause-and-effect relationship between mold exposure and allergic and infectious illnesses is well known. Exposures to toxins via the gastrointestinal tract also are well described. However, the cause-and-effect relationship between inhalational exposure to mold toxins and other untoward health effects (eg, acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage in infants and other illnesses and health complaints) is controversial and requires additional investigation. In this report we examine evidence of fungal-related illnesses and the unique aspects of mold exposure to children. Mold-remediation procedures are also discussed.

### Mycotoxins revisited: part I [^1147A6qz]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Mushrooms are ubiquitous in nature. They are an important source of nutrition; however, certain varieties contain chemicals that can be highly toxic to humans. Industrially cultivated mushrooms are historically very safe, but foraging for mushrooms or accidental ingestion of mushrooms in the environment can result in serious illness and death. The emergency department is the most common site of presentation for patients suffering from acute mushroom poisoning. Although recognition can be facilitated by identification of a characteristic toxidrome, the presenting manifestations can be variable and have considerable overlap with more common and generally benign clinical syndromes. The goal of this two-part article is to review the knowledge base on this subject and provide information that will assist the clinician in the early consideration, diagnosis and treatment of mushroom poisoning. Part I, presented in this issue of the Journal, reviews the epidemiology and demographics of mushroom poisoning, the physical characteristics of the most toxic varieties, the classification of the toxic species, and an overview of the cyclopeptide-containing mushroom class. Part II, to be published in the next issue of the Journal, will be focused on the presentation of the other classes of toxic mushrooms along with an up-to-date review of the most recently identified poisonous varieties.

### Systematic review: occupational illness in the waste and recycling sector [^113qZr8B]. Occupational Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

The literature search was conducted using Web of Science, Medline, Embase, Health and Safety Science Abstracts, OSH Update, elibrary and Google Scholar. Original research papers and case reports published in peer-reviewed journals between 1995 and 2015 were identified. The search strategies were developed by the authors to link the categories of population (such as 'worker'), with the environment (such as 'waste'), health (such as 'alveolitis') and exposure (such as 'mycotoxin'). To illustrate this, the search strategy for composting, biomass and green waste is shown in Table S1, available as Supplementary data at Occupational Medicine Online.

The titles and abstracts were reviewed separately by both authors. Systematic reviews, observational studies and case studies relevant to exposure, biological effect or occupational illness were identified. The full paper of those in English was sought. Figure 1 shows how the papers on compost, municipal and hazardous waste were identified.

### The potential role of mycotoxins as a contributor to stunting in the SHINE trial [^116wujev]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

ASSESSING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MYCOTOXIN EXPOSURE AND CHILD STUNTING

We will assess the longitudinal relationship between infant mycotoxin exposure and growth from 0–18 months, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–uninfected mother–infant dyads. Eligible infants will include all HIV-unexposed infants born from November 2014 through September 2015 (N = 1000), and will include approximately equal numbers of infants from the WASH and IYCF arms of the SHINE trial. Because HIV exposure affects postnatal growth independent of mycotoxins, we will exclude infants born to HIV-infected mothers to avoid this source of variation. Maternal HIV testing is undertaken at baseline and at 32 weeks of gestation; women testing negative at these time-points will be included in this substudy. There is little basis for sample size calculations; however, previous studies reporting positive associations between AF or FUM biomarkers and child growth have employed sample sizes ranging from around 100 to several hundred.

Serum AF-alb and urinary FUM and DON will be measured using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry; these parent mycotoxins and metabolites have a quantitative relationship with dietary intake of the toxin and therefore serve as useful quantitative exposure biomarkers. AF-alb adduct will be measured in all mothers at enrollment (median, 14 weeks' gestation) and around 32 weeks' gestation, and in infants at 12 and 18 months of age. All 3 mycotoxins (AF-alb adduct, urinary FB1, and urinary DON) will be measured in a subgroup of 200 infants at 6, 12, and 18 months. These multiple exposure analyses will be exploratory in nature but will be important findings because only 2 studies to date have evaluated FUM and DON biomarkers in African infants.

Our first step in the analysis will be to describe the prevalence and severity of mycotoxin exposures in Zimbabwean infants by age and by season. In the 200 infants with multiple mycotoxin assessments, we will describe the frequency, concentration, and covariance of the 3 exposures. We will test the association with stunting using multivariate regression models, with linear growth as the outcome variable and mycotoxin exposure as the independent variable. Linear growth will be modeled both as a continuous variable (attained height-for-age z score) using logistic regression and as a dichotomous variable (stunted vs not stunted), and using ordinal logistic regression with 3 levels (nonstunted, moderately stunted, and severely stunted). We will explore whether the mycotoxin–stunting relationships are independent of the SHINE WASH intervention, by examining these models for the WASH and non-WASH groups separately.

### Mycophenolic acid [^115QynBT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.3	Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Females of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and congenital malformations and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning.

Pregnancy Planning

For female patients taking mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets who are considering pregnancy, consider alternative immunosuppressants with less potential for embryo-fetal toxicity. Risks and benefits of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should be discussed with the patient.

Pregnancy Testing

To prevent unplanned exposure during pregnancy, females of reproductive potential should have a serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL immediately before starting mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. Another pregnancy test with the same sensitivity should be done 8 to 10 days later. Repeat pregnancy tests should be performed during routine follow-up visits. Results of all pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. In the event of a positive pregnancy test, consider alternative immunosuppressants with less potential for embryo-fetal toxicity whenever possible.

Contraception

Female Patients

Females of reproductive potential taking mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets must receive contraceptive counseling and use acceptable contraception (see Table 5 for Acceptable Contraception Methods). Patients must use acceptable birth control during entire mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets therapy, and for 6 weeks after stopping mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, unless the patient chooses abstinence (she chooses to avoid heterosexual intercourse completely).

Patients should be aware that mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets reduces blood levels of the hormones in the oral contraceptive pill and could theoretically reduce its effectiveness [see Patient Counseling Information (17), Drug Interactions (7.8)].

Male Patients

Genotoxic effects have been observed in animal studies at exposures exceeding the human therapeutic exposures by approximately 2.5 times. Thus, the risk of genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot be excluded. Based on this potential risk, sexually active male patients and/or their female partners are recommended to use effective contraception during treatment of the male patient and for at least 90 days after cessation of treatment. Also, based on the potential risk of genotoxic effects, male patients should not donate sperm during treatment with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and for at least 90 days after cessation of treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### A systematic review with meta-analysis of the relation of aflatoxin B1 to growth impairment in infants / children [^1116hCYS]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Aflatoxin exposure is common in developing countries, making it an issue of substantial public health importance. Overall, this meta-analysis indicated that there existed a negatively association between AFB1 exposure and growth indicators of children. Therefore, it is essential develop preventive approaches, such as implementing GAPs and improving proper storage methods to prevent fungal growth and contamination of crops, and thus reduce the burdens of aflatoxins on health.

### Agricultural and nutritional education interventions for reducing aflatoxin exposure to improve infant and child growth in low-and middle-income countries [^1174M3W2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Aflatoxins are carcinogenic mycotoxins that contaminate many food crops. Maize and groundnuts are prone to aflatoxin contamination, and are the major sources of human exposure to aflatoxins, due to their high intake as staple foods, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Observational studies suggest an association between dietary exposure to aflatoxins during pregnancy and early childhood and linear growth in infants and young children.

Objectives

To assess the effects on pre- and postnatal growth outcomes when agricultural and nutritional education interventions during the post-harvest period that aim to reduce aflatoxin exposure are compared to usual support or no intervention. We assessed this in infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women at the household or community level in LMICs.

Search Methods

In July and August 2019, we searched: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, Africa-Wide, LILACS, CAB Abstracts, Agricola, and two trials registers. We also checked the bibliographies of the included studies and contacted relevant mycotoxin organisations and researchers for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs of agricultural education and nutritional education interventions of any duration, at the household or community level, aimed at reducing aflatoxin intake by infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women, in LMICs during the post-harvest period, compared to no intervention or usual support. We excluded studies that followed participants for less than four weeks. We assessed prespecified prenatal (at birth) and postnatal growth outcomes (during infancy, childhood, and adolescence), with linear growth (as the primary outcome), infectious disease morbidity, and unintended consequences.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study eligibility using prespecified criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included RCTs. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE, and presented the main results in a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included three recent cluster-RCTs reporting the effects of agricultural education plus post-harvest technologies, compared to usual agricultural support or no intervention. The participants were pregnant women and their children, lactating women and their infants (< 6 months), women of childbearing age, and young children (< 59 months), from rural, subsistence maize-farming communities in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. Two trials randomised villages to the intervention and control groups, including a total of at least 979 mother-child pairs from 60 villages. The third trial randomised 420 households, including 189 mother-child pairs and 231 women of childbearing age. Duration of the intervention and follow-up ranged between five and nine months. Due to risk of attrition bias, the overall risk of bias was unclear in one trial, and high in the other two trials. None of the included studies addressed the effects of nutritional education on pre- and postnatal growth. One trial reported outcomes not prespecified in our review, and we were unable to obtain unpublished growth data from the second trial, even after contacting the authors. The third trial, in lactating women and their infants in Tanzania, reported on the infants' weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) after six months. This trial found that providing agricultural education aimed at changing farmers' post-harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure, by using demonstrations (e.g. handsorting, de-hulling of maize, drying sheets, and insecticides), may improve WAZ in infants from these farmers' households, on average, by 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.98; 1 study; 249 participants; very low-certainty evidence), compared to infants from households where the farmers received routine agricultural extension services. Another way of reporting the effect on WAZ is to compare the proportion of underweight infants (WAZ > 2 SD below the reference median value) per group. This trial found that the intervention may reduce the proportion of underweight infants in the intervention households by 6.7% (95% CI -12.6 to -1.4; 249 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared to control households. No studies reported on unintended effects of agricultural and nutritional education.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence on the effects on child growth in LMICs of agricultural or nutritional education interventions that reduce aflatoxin exposure was very limited; no included study reported on linear growth. Very low-certainty evidence suggested that agricultural education aimed at changing farmers' post-harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure by using demonstrations, may result in an increase in WAZ, when compared to usual or no education.

### Indoor air quality and health does fungal contamination play a significant role? [^1133efQm]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Fungal contamination in buildings can vary greatly, and their presence in a dwelling does not necessarily constitute exposure. Measurement of mold spores and fragments varies depending on the methodology and instruments used. Meaningful comparison of data is rarely possible. The presence of a specific immune response to a fungal antigen only connotes that exposure to one or more related species has occurred, but not that there is a symptomatic clinical state. The response of individuals to indoor bioaerosols is complex and depends on age, gender, state of health, genetic makeup, and degree and time of bioaerosol exposure. In general, mold contamination in buildings is associated with incursion of water or moisture, which should be remedied as efficiently as possible. When disease occurs, it more likely is related to transient annoyance or irritational reactions. Allergic symptoms may be related to mold proliferation in the home environment. Because molds are encountered both indoors and outdoors, it is difficult to determine where the sensitivity initially arose and if the response is solely provoked by either an indoor or outdoor source. As an indoor allergen, mold is considered to be an infrequent participant in the induction of allergic disease when compared with housedust mites, animal dander, and cockroach allergens. Infection in healthy individuals is rare and usually is caused by an outdoor source. Building-related disease caused by mycotoxicosis has not been proved in the medical literature.

ACMT position statement — laboratory testing cautions that in epidemiological studies of damp indoor spaces, "mycotoxin antibody testing" has been utilized; however, identification or measurement of antibodies to mycotoxins is not an accepted method to assess human exposure, has not been validated in well-designed epidemiological studies, and is not recommended for the assessment of human exposure to mycotoxins.

### Adverse associations between maternal deoxynivalenol exposure and birth outcomes: a prospective cohort study in China [^112fG5aD]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Although DON has been reported to increase the health risk of animals during pregnancy, its effects on human health are not well understood. Studies have shown that DON can cross the placental barrier in both animals and humans, maternal dietary exposure leads to fetal DON exposure. In pregnant sows, maternal DON exposure has been linked to growth retardation in offspring, with lower doses affecting growth more than appetite. Several studies using grain farming and weather conditions as surrogate indicators have found that occupational exposure to mycotoxins, including DON, was associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. While other mycotoxins, such as aflatoxin, have been suggested to impair intrauterine fetal growth and lead to lower birth weight, there are few studies on the effects of DON exposure during pregnancy. Collectively, it is worthwhile to explore the potential adverse effects of DON exposure in pregnant women on birth outcomes.

Thus, to obtain more extensive data on DON exposure in pregnant women and further understand its toxicity, we assessed the association between maternal DON exposure during pregnancy and birth outcomes in the Tongji Maternal and Child Health Cohort (TMCHC) in Wuhan, China.

### ACMT position statement: institute of medicine report on damp indoor spaces and health [^117HnN22]. ACMT (2022). High credibility.

ACMT position statement — exposure assessment for mycotoxins in damp indoor spaces states that it is important to distinguish exposure to mycotoxins from exposure to the fungi that are capable of producing them and that Toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins are not synonymous hazards. For epidemiological studies, exposure assessment methods should utilize validated techniques to detect and quantify mycotoxins directly in environmental samples, and the interpretation of such environmental measurements should consist of a plausible, complete exposure pathway and an assessment of the dose-response relationship.

### The potential role of mycotoxins as a contributor to stunting in the SHINE trial [^115JgtgG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

EVIDENCE THAT MYCOTOXINS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHILD STUNTING

It is estimated that approximately 4.5 billion people, predominantly those living in developing countries, are at risk of exposure to the dietary mycotoxin family of aflatoxins (AFs), with people in some regions experiencing chronic exposure at high levels. AFs have been most widely studied and demonstrated as a cause of liver cancer. AFs additionally inhibit protein synthesis and are cytotoxic, teratogenic, and immunotoxic. Epidemiologic evidence from multiple countries documents AF exposure in pregnant women, infant cord blood, and young children, suggesting that exposure to AF is widespread during early life. Gong et al found that serum aflatoxin-albumin (AF-alb) adducts were associated with stunting in children (aged 9–60 months) in rural Benin and Togo, and demonstrated a significant dose-response relationship with height-for-age and weight-for-age z scores. In a subsequent 8-month longitudinal study in rural Benin, infants (aged 16–37 months at recruitment) were on average 1.7 cm shorter in the highest quartile of AF-alb compared with the lowest quartile of exposure. In a separate study from The Gambia, maternal exposure during pregnancy was strongly inversely associated with infant growth velocity during the first 12 months of life, with a predicted 0.8-kg increase in weight and 2-cm increase in height, if measures of maternal AF exposure (AF-alb) were reduced from 110 pg/mg to 10 pg/mg. The range of exposure measures in these 3 regions was 3–1080 pg/mg. This height difference is meaningful and large in public health terms, compared to the effects of efficacious nutrition interventions.

### Assessment of the indoor environment: evaluation of mold growth indoors [^112fNYQw]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Much attention has been focused on indoor molds; resulting in modest amounts of new research. There is strong evidence of respiratory effects. Although mechanisms are disputed, some of the effect (but not all) is likely to be allergy related. There is some evidence that atopic individuals may be more affected, but many nonatopic individuals also are affected. This area needs more general research and specific research on exposure measures (such as what fungal components should be measured) and on health-effect mechanisms. It is worthwhile to emphasize the practical knowledge that is readily available. Buildings should be designed, built, operated, and occupied so that the buildings stay dry. When this situation does not occur, the environmental and clinical aspects that are observed by competent professionals should both be considered when determining causal relationships.

### Mycotoxin illness: recognition and management from functional medicine perspective [^114tCUSp]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Mold toxin exposure by inhalation and ingestion has significant health consequences for humans. In this article, we discuss the sources of these everyday toxins and their relevance to patient health. The effects of mycotoxins can present across all body systems, and the resulting symptoms can be acute, cumulative, and chronic. These effects can occur discretely, but they can also present alongside other clinical entities. It is important for the clinician to recognize the phenomenon of mycotoxin illness, because as a primary cause, it does not resolve with current standards of care for conditions secondary to it.

### Exposure to mycotoxins increases the allergic immune response in a murine asthma model [^112Ccsxm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

Epidemiological studies have shown that indoor molds are associated with increased prevalence and exacerbation of respiratory symptoms and asthma. Mycotoxins, secondary metabolites of molds, may contribute to these effects.

Objectives

To investigate the adjuvant activity of mycotoxins on allergic airway inflammation.

Methods

Balb/c mice were exposed via the airways to gliotoxin and via the intestine to patulin, sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA), and then analyzed in acute and chronic murine asthma models. In addition, the effect of mycotoxin exposure on dendritic cell (DC) function was investigated using murine bone marrow-derived DCs.

Measurements and Main Results

Exposure of mice to both mycotoxins enhanced dose-dependently airway hyperreactivity, eosinophilic lung inflammation, and OVA-specific IgE serum levels compared with mice that received only the antigen. These findings correlated with increased Th2 cytokine levels and decreased IFN-gamma production. Long-term mycotoxin exposure exacerbated chronic airway inflammation and airway remodeling. In vitro or in vivo mycotoxin exposure inhibited IL-12 production in maturing DCs and enhanced airway inflammation after adoptive DC transfer into Balb/c mice. Mycotoxin exposure enhanced OVA-induced lung lipid peroxidation and moderately increased isoprostane levels in naive mice. Treatment of mycotoxin-exposed DCs with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine or glutathione ethyl ester restored IL-12 secretion and pretreatment of exposed mice with N-acetylcysteine prevented the mycotoxin-induced increase of airway inflammation and AHR.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that gliotoxin and patulin increase the allergic immune response in mice by modulating the Th1/Th2 balance via direct effects on IL-12 secretion in DCs and by inducing oxidative stress.

### Procedures to assist health care providers to determine when home assessments for potential mold exposure are warranted [^112TfmdE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Drawing evidence from epidemiology and exposure assessment studies and recommendations from expert practice, we describe a process to guide health care providers helping their patients who present with symptoms that might be associated with living in damp housing. We present the procedures in the form of a guided 2-part interview. The first part has 5 questions that triage the patient toward a more detailed questionnaire that reflects features of housing conditions known to be reliably associated with exposures to mold and dampness contaminants. We chose the questions based on the conditions associated with moisture problems in homes across the United States and Canada. The goal is to facilitate the clinician's effort to help patients reduce exposure to environmental triggers that elicit symptoms to better manage their disease.

### Mycotoxins revisited: part II [^117ESgTF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Mushrooms are ubiquitous in nature. They are an important source of nutrition, however, certain varieties contain chemicals that can be highly toxic to humans. Industrially cultivated mushrooms are historically very safe, whereas foraging for mushrooms or accidental ingestion of mushrooms in the environment can result in serious illness and death. The emergency department is the most common site of presentation for patients suffering from acute mushroom poisoning. Although recognition can be facilitated by identification of a characteristic toxidrome, the presenting manifestations can be variable and have considerable overlap with more common and generally benign clinical syndromes. The goal of this two-part article is to review the knowledge base on this subject and provide information that will assist the clinician in the early consideration, diagnosis and treatment of mushroom poisoning. Part I reviewed the epidemiology and demographics of mushroom poisoning, the physical characteristics of the most toxic varieties, the classification of the toxic species, and presented an overview of the cyclopeptide-containing mushroom class. Part II is focused on the presentation of the other classes of toxic mushrooms along with an up-to-date review of the most recently identified poisonous varieties.

### Spectrum of noninfectious health effects from molds [^112b6Vur]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Molds are eukaryotic (possessing a true nucleus) nonphotosynthetic organisms that flourish both indoors and outdoors. For humans, the link between mold exposure and asthma exacerbations, allergic rhinitis, infections, and toxicities from ingestion of mycotoxin-contaminated foods are well known. However, the cause-and-effect relationship between inhalational exposure to mold and other untoward health effects (eg, acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage in infants and other illnesses and health complaints) requires additional investigation. Pediatricians play an important role in the education of families about mold, its adverse health effects, exposure prevention, and remediation procedures.

### ACMT position statement: institute of medicine report on damp indoor spaces and health [^115QShvy]. ACMT (2022). High credibility.

American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) position on damp indoor spaces and health — The ACMT has reviewed the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report and concurs that residences, schools, offices, and other buildings should be designed to prevent water intrusion, and that when water damage or chronic moisture is identified it should be remediated as soon as possible. The statement notes that damp indoor spaces present health risks to humans via allergic mechanisms involving fungi, dust mites, bacteria, cockroach, and possibly other antigens. It highlights ongoing misperceptions about mycotoxins in water-damaged buildings and states that study limitations and confounding have cast doubt on the causative role of inhaled mycotoxins for toxic health effects in indoor residential environments. It emphasizes that fungi and their mycotoxin products are ubiquitous in the outdoor environment and that human exposure to fungi can occur from soil and outdoor air where fungal spores are normally present in much higher concentrations than indoor environments, with seasonal variability. It advises that epidemiological studies of mold in indoor environments should include appropriate comparisons with outdoor air.

### Nanotechnology and health [^116Fm4TT]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There has been a considerable scientific, governmental, and public interest in potential adverse health effects associated with exposure to engineered or synthesized nanomaterials. Although such effects have not been reported in humans, there is accumulating evidence from animal studies that exposure to some nanomaterials may be harmful. There is sparse knowledge as to the likelihood, frequency, and intensity of exposures experienced by those working around engineered nanoparticles. Similarly, there is little knowledge regarding the potential existence, type, and dose dependence of adverse health effects, which might result from workplace exposures to engineered nanoparticles. This uncertainty, reflecting a relative lack of research, makes it difficult at present (and probably for the near future) to fully rely upon firm scientific evidence for the development of rational, preventive, and screening measures to protect against such potential effects. Recognizing this predicament, the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) has developed this guidance document for occupational medicine physicians and their colleagues. The purpose of the document is to offer current prudent preventive recommendations on the topics of exposure monitoring, exposure controls, and medical surveillance. This document will not attempt to review the rapidly evolving animal toxicology literature in detail, as any review would be quickly outdated, but general areas of concern will be discussed.

### The potential role of mycotoxins as a contributor to stunting in the SHINE trial [^115bnm56]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Children in developing countries experience multiple exposures that are harmful to their health, growth, and development, particularly during the critical first 1000 days, including nutrient deficiencies, recurrent infections, and exposure to human and animal feces. An emerging additional concern is frequent exposure to mycotoxins, which are toxic secondary metabolites of fungi that contaminate a wide range of staple foods such as maize and groundnuts. Recent developments in biomarkers now enable exposure measurement to 3 mycotoxins that may be important causes of poor child health and development: aflatoxin, fumonisin, and deoxynivalenol. This article describes the rationale and methods for the investigation of the potential role of mycotoxins as a contributor to stunting among children enrolled in the Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial in Zimbabwe.

The SHINE trial will evaluate the independent and combined effects of an integrated water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) intervention and an infant and young child feeding (IYCF) intervention on stunting and anemia in rural Zimbabwean infants through 18 months of age. We hypothesize that protection from fecal microbes will prevent environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) and systemic inflammation and thereby remove constraints on the growth hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis that governs linear growth. It is also possible that exposure to mycotoxins pre- and postnatally contributes to stunting, in part through common pathways of EED and IGF-1 suppression.

### -dependent transcriptome and its role in secondary metabolism, environmental stress, and virulence in… [^113jUWxV]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspergillus flavus is an opportunistic plant pathogen of great economic importance that infects oil seed crops such as maize, peanuts, cotton and certain treenuts, and in the course, produces potent mycotoxins, including the highly carcinogenic aflatoxins. Ingestion of aflatoxin contaminated crops can result in jaundice, edema of the limbs, pain, vomiting, necrosis, potentially acute liver failure and in rare cases death. Chronic exposure can lead to suppression of the immune system, stunting of growth and wasting in children and several types of cancers such as those affecting the liver, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. In developed nations, legislation regulates levels of aflatoxins in food and feed commodities to prevent adulterated crops from entering the market place, however in most developing nations lacking such guidelines or restrictions, exposures becomes more prevalent.

In the United States and other developed nations, the major impact of aflatoxin contamination of commodities is economic losses. It has been estimated that economic losses associated with aflatoxin contamination of maize can reach up to a billion dollars annually in the United States alone particularly in years with warm summers and drought.

In addition to its devastating effect on crops of economic importance, A. flavus is known to cause a deadly lung infection known as invasive aspergillosis. Although A. flavus is the second leading cause of IA after Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus is 100-fold more virulent than that of A. fumigatus.

Due to the adverse health and economic impacts associated with aflatoxin contamination and A. flavus, it is paramount to gain insight into its dispersal and survival mechanisms, as well as the regulatory pathways controlling its production of mycotoxins and its virulence. This knowledge could reveal novel genetic elements that could be used as possible targets to reduce the negative effects of this opportunistic pathogen of humans and plants.

### Aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy, maternal anemia, and adverse birth outcomes [^114FPzwi]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Interactions between aflatoxin exposure and maternal diet.

Pregnant women in developing countries have multiple overlapping risk factors for poor pregnancy outcomes, which may increase vulnerability to even low doses of aflatoxin. For example, when diets are deficient in vitamins A, C, or E, or selenium (all of which protect against the toxic effects of aflatoxin), the detoxifying system for aflatoxin may be impaired, increasing the production of epoxides. Populations at risk of frequent aflatoxin exposure are often those with poor dietary diversity and thus micronutrient insufficient is common. We did not identify animal studies designed to explore potential interactions between nutritional deficiencies and aflatoxin exposure.

Potential mechanisms linking aflatoxin exposure to adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Mechanistic studies suggest that maternal exposure to aflatoxin might cause adverse pregnancy outcomes through four primary pathways: 1) upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines,–; 2) induction of enteropathy characterized by intestinal inflammation and impaired barrier function, leading to systemic immune activation,–; 3) potential toxic effects on maternal organs causing systemic immune activation and impaired placental and fetal development; and 4) toxic effects on fetal organs causing fetal inflammation and impaired fetal development,–(Figure 1).

This framework offers numerous hypotheses suggested by the current literature, with proposed mechanisms drawing heavily on evidence from in vivo animal studies and in vitro studies. We highlight two necessary areas for future research to refine and test these hypotheses. First, there is a need for rigorous human studies on the relationship between maternal aflatoxin exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, using validated biomarkers. Although cross-sectional studies at delivery would be informative, stronger designs would investigate the longitudinal relationship of maternal exposure during pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes or experimentally intervene to reduce aflatoxin exposure in maternal diets. Second, research is needed to elucidate the mechanism by which aflatoxin mediates adverse pregnancy outcomes. For translational science in particular, studies are needed to understand the effects of aflatoxin on the placenta and fetus at modest dose and on a background of maternal dietary insufficiency, as this commonly co-occurs with aflatoxin exposure in human populations.

### Sampling for indoor fungi [^1126SSdx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A great deal of concern has arisen recently regarding the potential adverse effects of indoor fungi. Our understanding of this complex problem has been hampered by a lack of standardized protocols for performing an indoor assessment for fungi. Without such standards, it is difficult to compare results from one study with those from another or to measure the effect of indoor fungal contamination on a building and its occupants.

Methods

We reviewed the medical literature and here describe a hypothesis-driven approach to planning, sampling, and interpreting the results of indoor assessments for fungi.

Results

Fungi cause 3 primary adverse effects: (1) they can damage a building, (2) they can render a building unpleasant to live in by looking and smelling bad, and (3) they might cause adverse health effects in sensitive individuals. Sampling methods used to test hypotheses include air sampling for spores, measurement of allergens in house dust, and determination of microbially generated volatile organic compounds, ergosterols, glucans, and mycotoxins, as well as environmental conditions that lead to fungal contamination.

Conclusions

Standardized approaches for performing and reporting assessments of indoor fungi are essential if our understanding of this complex field is to improve.

### Yeasts, molds, and mycotoxins (April 2001 edition) [^112NRqc4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

www. fda. gov Bacteriological Analytical Manual Chapter 18: Yeasts, Molds, and Mycotoxins April 2001 Edition. several hundred species. The ability of these organisms to attack many foods is due in large part to their relatively versatile environmental requirements. Although the majority of yeasts and molds are obligate aerobes, their acid/alkaline requirement for growth is quite broad, ranging from pH 2 to above pH 9. Their temperature range is. They can invade and grow on virtually any type of food at any time; they invade crops such as grains, nuts, beans, and fruits in fields before harvesting and during storage. They also grow on processed foods and food mixtures. Their detectability in or on foods depends on food type, organisms involved, and degree of invasion; the contaminated food may be slightly blemished.

severely blemished, or completely decomposed, with the actual growth manifested by rot spots of various sizes and colors, unsightly scabs, slime, white cottony mycelium, or highly colored sporulating mold. Abnormal flavors and odors may also be produced. Occasionally, a food appears mold-free but is found upon mycological examination to be contaminated. Contamination of foods by yeasts and molds can result in substantial economic losses to producer, processor, and consumer. Several foodborne molds, and possibly yeasts, may also be hazardous to human or animal health because of their ability to produce toxic metabolites known as mycotoxins. Most mycotoxins are stable compounds that are not destroyed during food processing or home. D. Toxin analysis Appropriate mycotoxin standards are required for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of toxin.

Use either thin layer chromatography as described in references 16 or 17 or high performance liquid chromatography, as described in reference 15a, to determine mycotoxins extracted from mold cultures. Naturally occurring mycotoxins in foods or feeds can best be., since the added dichloran and rose bengal effectively slow down the growth of fast-growing fungi, thus readily allowing detection of other yeast and mold propagules, which have lower growth rates. Media containing rose bengal are light-sensitive; relatively short exposure to light will result in.

### Mycophenolate mofetil (Myhibbin) [^115xenST]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Females of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and congenital malformations and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning.

Pregnancy Planning

For patients who are considering pregnancy, consider alternative immunosuppressants with less potential for embryofetal toxicity whenever possible. Risks and benefits of MYHIBBIN should be discussed with the patient.

Pregnancy Testing

To prevent unplanned exposure during pregnancy, all females of reproductive potential should have a serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mlU/mL immediately before starting MYHIBBIN. Another pregnancy test with the same sensitivity should be done 8 to 10 days later. Repeat pregnancy tests should be performed during routine follow-up visits. Results of all pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. In the event of a positive pregnancy test, consider alternative immunosuppressants with less potential for embryofetal toxicity whenever possible.

Contraception

Female Patients

Females of reproductive potential taking MYHIBBIN must receive contraceptive counseling and use acceptable contraception (see Table 5 for acceptable contraception methods). Patients must use acceptable birth control during the entire MYHIBBIN therapy, and for 6 weeks after stopping MYHIBBIN, unless the patient chooses abstinence.

Patients should be aware that MYHIBBIN reduces blood levels of the hormones from the oral contraceptive pill and could theoretically reduce its effectiveness [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Male Patients Genotoxic effects have been observed in animal studies at exposures exceeding the human therapeutic exposures by approximately 1.25 times. Thus, the risk of genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot be excluded. Based on this potential risk, sexually active male patients and/or their female partners are recommended to use effective contraception during treatment of the male patient and for at least 90 days after cessation of treatment. Also, based on the potential risk of genotoxic effects, male patients should not donate sperm during treatment with MYHIBBIN and for at least 90 days after cessation of treatment [see Use in Special Populations (8.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1), Patient Counseling Information (17.9)].

### The FDA updates mycotoxins in domestic and imported… [^114EakcF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Constituent Update September 26, 2024 The U. S. Food and Drug Administration updated the Mycotoxins in Domestic and Imported Human Foods Compliance Program to include the monitoring of additional mycotoxins of regulatory interest in human foods, specifically T-2/HT-2 toxins and zearalenone. The updated compliance program also reflects the transition by FDA regulatory laboratories to a multi-mycotoxin method for analysis in human foods, which will allow the agency to obtain results for multiple mycotoxins in a single sample analysis. The new data gained by the compliance program update will support enforcement actions, risk assessments, and international activities, as well as provide information on mycotoxin incidence, extent of contamination, and co-occurrence. These changes do not affect the FDA's surveillance of mycotoxins in animal food. T-2/HT-2 toxins are mycotoxins produced by. Fusarium molds.

These toxins are found in contaminated grains, such as wheat, rye, oat, and barley. Contamination generally occurs when these foods are not stored and/or dried properly. If T-2 and HT-2 are found in foods, they may cause human health issues such as high fever, gastrointestinal problems, and hemorrhage. Zearalenone is a mycotoxin also produced by Fusarium molds. It has been found in contaminated grains, such as corn, oats, wheat, sorghum, and rice. Contamination generally occurs when these foods are not stored and/or dried properly. If zearalenone is found in food, it may cause reproductive issues in humans.

### Are indoor molds causing a new disease? [^115Nu4am]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Three mechanisms for disease caused by mold-infection, allergy, and toxicity-are established and well recognized by clinicians. In each case the corresponding diseases are specific to a particular fungus. The mechanisms involved include a recognized inflammatory pathology that leads to objective clinical evidence of disease. Recent widespread litigation has arisen out of an unproved assertion that exposure to indoor molds causes an ill-defined illness. This illness is characterized by the absence of objective evidence of disease and by the lack of a defined pathology. There is usually no specificity for the involved fungus purported to cause the illness. Those publications that claim such an illness are reviewed. They are found to lack scientific validity, often on the basis of faulty methodology and insufficient information. There is no coherent clinical description for the presumed illness. Recommendations are offered for published reports and studies to address this problem.

### The potential role of mycotoxins as a contributor to stunting in the SHINE trial [^111TEg2H]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

A HYPOTHESIZED PATHWAY THROUGH EED

All 3 mycotoxins may plausibly contribute to stunting through EED, a subclinical condition of the small intestine that impairs nutrient absorption and causes systemic immune activation. EED has most commonly been attributed to environmental contamination with fecal bacteria in disadvantaged settings, where sanitation, hygiene practices, and drinking water quality are frequently poor. However, there are multiple overlapping causes of enteropathies in developing countries, and the role of mycotoxins in mediating enteropathy has received little attention to date. Although the mycotoxins described here have distinct actions, they all mediate intestinal damage in experimental animal models through (1) inhibition of protein synthesis (AF, DON); (2) increased local and systemic proinflammatory cytokines (AF, DON); (3) inhibition of ceramide synthase (FUM) (reviewed in); and (4) tight junction protein expression (DON, FUM). AF and DON may also directly cause immunomodulation toward an inflammatory state, potentially interfering with the IGF-1 axis. In vitro models additionally support a role for mycotoxins disrupting intestinal cell monolayer integrity (AF). AF, FUM, and DON may therefore share a convergent pathway in which mucosal damage can lead to impaired nutrient absorption and/or increased intestinal permeability, pathology that resembles the changes seen in EED.

### Adverse human health effects associated with molds in the indoor environment [^115FxCPi]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Molds are common and important allergens. About 5% of individuals are predicted to have some allergic airway symptoms from molds over their lifetime. However, it should be remembered that molds are not dominant allergens and that the outdoor molds, rather than indoor ones, are the most important. For almost all allergic individuals, the reactions will be limited to rhinitis or asthma; sinusitis may occur secondarily due to obstruction. Rarely do sensitized individuals develop uncommon conditions such as ABPA or AFS. To reduce the risk of developing or exacerbating allergies, mold should not be allowed to grow unchecked indoors. When mold colonization is discovered in the home, school, or office, it should be remediated after the source of the moisture that supports its growth is identified and eliminated. Authoritative guidelines for mold remediation are available. Fungi are rarely significant pathogens for humans. Superficial fungal infections of the skin and nails are relatively common in normal individuals, but those infections are readily treated and generally resolve without complication. Fungal infections of deeper tissues are rare and in general are limited to persons with severely impaired immune systems. The leading pathogenic fungi for persons with nonimpaired immune function, Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Cryptococcus, and Histoplasma, may find their way indoors with outdoor air but normally do not grow or propagate indoors. Due to the ubiquity of fungi in the environment, it is not possible to prevent immunecompromised individuals from being exposed to molds and fungi outside the confines of hospital isolation units. Some molds that propagate indoors may under some conditions produce mycotoxins that can adversely affect living cells and organisms by a variety of mechanisms. Adverse effects of molds and mycotoxins have been recognized for centuries following ingestion of contaminated foods. Occupational diseases are also recognized in association with inhalation exposure to fungi, bacteria, and other organic matter, usually in industrial or agricultural settings. Molds growing indoors are believed by some to cause building-related symptoms. Despite a voluminous literature on the subject, the causal association remains weak and unproven, particularly with respect to causation by mycotoxins. One mold in particular, Stachybotrys chartarum, is blamed for a diverse array of maladies when it is found indoors. Despite its well-known ability to produce mycotoxins under appropriate growth conditions, years of intensive study have failed to establish exposure to S. chartarum in home, school, or office environments as a cause of adverse human health effects. Levels of exposure in the indoor environment, dose-response data in animals, and dose-rate considerations suggest that delivery by the inhalation route of a toxic dose of mycotoxins in the indoor environment is highly unlikely at best, even for the hypothetically most vulnerable subpopulations. Mold spores are present in all indoor environments and cannot be eliminated from them. Normal building materials and furnishings provide ample nutrition for many species of molds, but they can grow and amplify indoors only when there is an adequate supply of moisture. Where mold grows indoors there is an inappropriate source of water that must be corrected before remediation of the mold colonization can succeed. Mold growth in the home, school, or office environment should not be tolerated because mold physically destroys the building materials on which it grows, mold growth is unsightly and may produce offensive odors, and mold is likely to sensitize and produce allergic responses in allergic individuals. Except for persons with severely impaired immune systems, indoor mold is not a source of fungal infections. Current scientific evidence does not support the proposition that human health has been adversely affected by inhaled mycotoxins in home, school, or office environments.

### Aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy, maternal anemia, and adverse birth outcomes [^114wTboU]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Pregnant women and their developing fetuses are vulnerable to multiple environmental insults, including exposure to aflatoxin, a mycotoxin that may contaminate as much as 25% of the world food supply. We reviewed and integrated findings from studies of aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy and evaluated potential links to adverse pregnancy outcomes. We identified 27 studies (10 human cross-sectional studies and 17 animal studies) assessing the relationship between aflatoxin exposure and adverse birth outcomes or anemia. Findings suggest that aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy may impair fetal growth. Only one human study investigated aflatoxin exposure and prematurity, and no studies investigated its relationship with pregnancy loss, but animal studies suggest aflatoxin exposure may increase risk for prematurity and pregnancy loss. The fetus could be affected by maternal aflatoxin exposure through direct toxicity as well as indirect toxicity, via maternal systemic inflammation, impaired placental growth, or elevation of placental cytokines. The cytotoxic and systemic effects of aflatoxin could plausibly mediate maternal anemia, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal loss, and preterm birth. Given the widespread exposure to this toxin in developing countries, longitudinal studies in pregnant women are needed to provide stronger evidence for the role of aflatoxin in adverse pregnancy outcomes, and to explore biological mechanisms. Potential pathways for intervention to reduce aflatoxin exposure are urgently needed, and this might reduce the global burden of stillbirth, preterm birth, and low birthweight.

### Systematic review: occupational illness in the waste and recycling sector [^116UPKnb]. Occupational Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The waste and recycling sector is worth £12 billion per year to the UK economy. It employs 200000 people and is growing at the rate of 3–4% per year. It is driven mainly by European Union directives that contain the target of 50% of all household waste to be recycled by 2020. The fatal and non-fatal injury rate and the self-reported work-related illness rate of workers in the sector is higher than the industrial average with potential hazards to health that include heavy manual handling; bioaerosol (components of dust of biological origin such as bacteria and fungi) exposure from garden, domestic or food waste; and lead and mercury exposure from the recycling of batteries, fluorescent lights and electrical equipment.

Concern has been expressed by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) about inadequate risk assessments, the weakness of workplace controls, inadequate washing facilities and a lack of appropriate risk-based health surveillance as part of a quality management process at inspected workplaces in the UK. Some hazards are known, such as stooping and twisting while lifting and carrying heavy boxes of glass or paper or while loading sacks of refuse onto a wagon and are best controlled by limiting the weight of boxes or by substitution with wheelie bins.

Other hazards may be suspected, such as exposure to bioaerosols from biomass-fired power plants or on industrial composting sites where concentrations of bacteria and fungi up to 1000 times greater than in ambient air have been measured. Bioaerosols may comprise living or dead organisms; spores; substances released from cell walls when they rupture such as endotoxins and beta-glucans; or substances produced by organisms such as exotoxins and mycotoxins. All of these may cause toxic, irritant or allergic effects.

To what extent exposure should be controlled is uncertain. While exposure limits of 10 mg/m³ 8-h time-weighted average exist for total inhalable dust, there are no limits for the constituents of bioaerosols mainly because of the difficulty of establishing a dose–response effect and safe levels of exposure, although a Dutch Expert Committee has recommended health-based limits of 10⁴ cfu/m³ for bacteria in air and 90 EU/m³ (5 ng/m³) for endotoxins.

### ACMT position statement: medical toxicology considerations in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with concerns about mold-related inhalation exposures [^112LByS7]. ACMT (2025). High credibility.

ACMT position statement — laboratory testing for mycotoxin exposure assessment notes that "mycotoxin antibody testing" has been utilized in epidemiological studies of damp indoor spaces but states that identification or measurement of antibodies to mycotoxins is not an accepted method to assess human exposure, has not been validated in well-designed epidemiological studies, and is not recommended for the assessment of human exposure to mycotoxins. The document further clarifies that fungal immunoassay tests, including immunoglobulin testing for IgG and IgE, can be clinically useful for immunological conditions from exposure to fungal antigens but do not provide information about the source or magnitude of exposure to mycotoxins and therefore have no role in exposure assessment in this context.

### Next-generation biomonitoring of the early-life chemical exposome in neonatal and infant development [^114nTnAT]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

There are only a few defined critical threshold values concerning blood levels of chemical contamination. Current human biomonitoring values defined by the German HBM-Commission are based on epidemiological studies and animal experiments and are defined as the concentration below which no adverse health effects are expected. For PFOA and PFOS, these values are 2 and 5 ng mL⁻¹, respectively. The reference values were exceeded in the plasma samples from multiple infants. Although no maximum recommended dosages of parabens in blood have yet been proposed using epidemiological data; in a recent ExWAS, Agier et al. concluded that paraben exposure is a health risk during early life. Of five identified parabens, propyl-, methyl- and ethylparaben were contaminations in all premature babies. While previous assessments focused almost exclusively on urinary analyses of phthalates, ubiquitous contamination of blood was also observed in our data. As mentioned above, this matrix may be more amenable to elucidating the acute biologically-active burden of such short-lived compounds that causes a negative outcome. Consequently, quantitative data from blood analyses may also be more suitable for the discovery of associated biological effects (i.e. inflammation, oxidative stress and endocrine disruption) and the subsequent proposal of reference values.

Breast milk has been previously utilized to monitor early-life exposure of infants. This bio-fluid may act as a vehicle to transport unintended contaminants from mothers to offspring; who are particularly susceptible to adverse biological effects because of a less-developed immune systemand less effective drug detoxification capabilities. Our data clearly confirmed earlier findings that breast milk is a source of exposure for a child to endocrine disruptors and carcinogenic food contents during early life. Excluding the pyrrolizidine alkaloids, however, if single-chemical exposure is only considered, our estimated upper boundary for daily exposure levels should not pose a health risk for infants. Importantly, the longitudinal proof-of-principle study only included a single mother since this highly time-resolved sampling design is difficult to implement more broadly. While we focused on the potential contribution of breast milk toward the total xenobiotic burden of a neonate in this work, it must be clearly stated that low-level chemical exposure through breast milk must never be a factor to reduce or avoid breastfeeding. We recently demonstrated that alternatively consumed infant formula likely leads to higher mycotoxin exposure than the consumption of breast milk. This might be also true for other toxicant classes. Most importantly, the benefit of antibodies, growth factors and bioactive compounds including oligosaccharides in breast milk must be explicitly highlighted.

### A systematic review with meta-analysis of the relation of aflatoxin B1 to growth impairment in infants / children [^114BBuBX]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Produced by filamentous fungi, mycotoxins, are low-molecular-weight metabolites representing a public health concern worldwide. The global prevalence of mycotoxin contamination of food crops is estimated between 60 and 80%. Aflatoxins (AFs) are regarded as the most potent genotoxic and carcinogenic type of mycotoxins mainly produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. These toxic metabolites could mostly flourish in food products such as rice, maize, groundnuts, legumes, and other grains, especially in tropical and subtropical regions, when crops are under stress (e.g. drought) or poor storage conditions (e.g. humidity). There are four main aflatoxin chemotypes (B 1, B 2, G 1, and G 2), among which aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) is the most frequent and carcinogenic analog. Chronic exposure to AFB 1 could pose several adverse effects on the human body since upon its ingestion, AFB1 could convert to highly reactive metabolites i.e. exo-AFB1 8, 9-epoxide. If not detoxified, these compounds could bind to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or protein molecules such as albumin, leading to immune suppression, hepatocellular carcinoma, and childhood growth impairment. AFB1 can be measured using various analyses, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), and isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS).

### Aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy, maternal anemia, and adverse birth outcomes [^112EMZFv]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Although in vivo and in vitro studies have focused on a red cell lysis pathway, doses to cause such an effect are likely higher than levels experienced in human populations. It is more probable that chronic aflatoxin exposure could therefore cause anemia through three different mechanisms related to immune activation and enteropathy: a decreased capacity of the intestine to absorb essential nutrients such as iron; a decrease in erythropoiesis arising from chronic inflammation; and reduced availability of iron due to hepcidin upregulation (Figure 1

Figure 1.
(A) Conceptual framework for the effect of aflatoxin exposure on maternal-fetal health. Maternal exposure to aflatoxin might cause adverse pregnancy outcomes through three primary pathways: induction of environmental enteric dysfunction characterized by intestinal inflammation, impaired barrier function, and systemic immune activation; upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines; and potential toxic effects on maternal and fetal organs once absorbed causing systemic immune activation, and impaired placental and fetal development. Red arrows represent the transfer of aflatoxin from mother to placenta to fetus. Solid black arrows represent the hypothesized effects of aflatoxin exposure in the mother, placenta and fetus; dotted black arrows represent the hypothesized indirect effect of aflatoxin-induced maternal inflammation on the placenta and fetus. The few cross-sectional studies conducted in humans suggest that aflatoxin exposure impairs intrauterine growth and may be a cause of pregnancy loss. Although no conclusive studies have been conducted in humans, we have reviewed evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies that aflatoxin exposure may cause anemia, intestinal damage, and elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, animal studies indicate aflatoxin exposure results in impaired organ development. There are no studies investigating the effects of aflatoxin on the placenta, but given that the placenta metabolizes and transports aflatoxin, further investigations into its effects are warranted. This framework provides directions for future research investigating the effects of aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy.). IL-6 — which has shown to be upregulated by aflatoxin exposure — increases hepcidin production, which decreases iron absorption and iron release from macrophages. However, further human and animal studies are needed to test these hypotheses. In summary, although it is biologically plausible that aflatoxin exposure causes anemia, the doses used in animal studies are high and the results may not be relevant for human exposure. Although there is evidence that aflatoxin exposure can alter the inflammatory response, none of the studies reviewed explored aflatoxin exposure and inflammation-induced anemia.

ACMT recommendations on damp indoor spaces — The ACMT generally concurs with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) assessment of the relationship between damp indoor spaces and human health effects and recommends that public health responses be based upon what is known and generally accepted regarding association with allergic disease; public health responses should not be solely based upon the presence of fungi or mycotoxins because the available scientific evidence does not provide any compelling data to conclude that they pose significant health risks via inhalation in these settings, risks from inhalation are minimal compared with other sources and pathways including the diet, and the use of unapproved diagnostic studies and therapeutic modalities based on unproven infection or mold-related toxicity are medically inappropriate and costly.

### Human aflatoxicosis in developing countries: a review of toxicology, exposure, potential health consequences, and interventions [^1114cG7n]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Aflatoxins are well recognized as a cause of liver cancer, but they have additional important toxic effects. In farm and laboratory animals, chronic exposure to aflatoxins compromises immunity and interferes with protein metabolism and multiple micronutrients that are critical to health. These effects have not been widely studied in humans, but the available information indicates that at least some of the effects observed in animals also occur in humans. The prevalence and level of human exposure to aflatoxins on a global scale have been reviewed, and the resulting conclusion was that approximately 4.5 billion persons living in developing countries are chronically exposed to largely uncontrolled amounts of the toxin. A limited amount of information shows that, at least in those locations where it has been studied, the existing aflatoxin exposure results in changes in nutrition and immunity. The aflatoxin exposure and the toxic affects of aflatoxins on immunity and nutrition combine to negatively affect health factors (including HIV infection) that account for > 40% of the burden of disease in developing countries where a short lifespan is prevalent. Food systems and economics render developed-country approaches to the management of aflatoxins impractical in developing-country settings, but the strategy of using food additives to protect farm animals from the toxin may also provide effective and economical new approaches to protecting human populations.

### Aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy, maternal anemia, and adverse birth outcomes [^113bhYEz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Aflatoxin exposure is common in developing countries, making it an issue of substantial public health importance. Despite this, there are relatively few human studies investigating the effects of aflatoxin during pregnancy on the mother and fetus. Aflatoxin exposure assessment studies have been small and geographically scattered and the majority of human studies have focused on low birthweight. However, animal studies provide biological support for the hypothesis that aflatoxin exposure may mediate adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Given the enormous burden of aflatoxin exposure, anemia, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth in developing countries in the context of co-exposure to multiple environmental insults, further investigations into the effects of aflatoxin are strongly warranted. Research is needed to comprehensively evaluate the relationship and potential mechanisms linking aflatoxin with adverse health outcomes in pregnancy, so that novel pathways for intervention can be defined to mitigate aflatoxin exposure and reduce the global burden of stillbirth, preterm birth, and low birthweight.

### Studies of sick building syndrome. IV. mycotoxicosis [^114Yrrew]. The Journal of Asthma (2002). Low credibility.

There has been increasing public attention to the potential health risks of mold exposure, particularly in wet buildings. A variety of molds has been isolated from both damaged homes and businesses, including agents that secrete toxigenic materials. One area that is attracting particular notice is the relative toxigenic potential of mycotoxins. Although exposure to molds can produce significant mucosal irritation, there are very few data to suggest long-term ill effects. More importantly, there is no evidence in humans that mold exposure leads to nonmucosal pathology. In fact, many of the data on toxigenic molds are derived from animal toxicity studies, and these are based primarily, on ingestion. Although every attempt should be made to improve the quality of indoor air, including avoidance of molds, the human illnesses attributed to fungal exposure are, with the exception of invasive infections and mold allergy, relatively rare. In this review we discuss selected aspects of the microbiology of mycotoxin-producing molds and their potential role in human immunopathology with respect to wet building environments.

### Health effects of indoor fungi [^113dQcYu]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the nontoxic harmful effects that poor indoor air quality caused by fungi can have on health.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed for publications related to the various topics discussed in this review, and we relied on our knowledge of the field.

Study Selection

Where more than one publication was relevant, we attempted to identify a consensus of the reports and cited the most relevant articles. Priority was given to randomized controlled trials and expert reports when available, although much of the information herein relates to laboratory research.

Results

Actively growing fungal colonies can release volatile substances that have an unpleasant smell, leading to psychological responses in the occupants such as fatigue and nausea. Symptoms that are likely caused by indoor fungi include respiratory complaints that involve the nose and lungs, eye symptoms, and mucous membrane irritation. These adverse effects can occur by a variety of mechanisms, including IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, fungal infection, irritant reaction to spores or fungal metabolites, and possibly toxic reaction to mycotoxins.

Conclusions

Reduced fungal exposure can reasonably be expected to improve health. Removal of moisture from the indoors and proper maintenance of air filters can aid in prevention and elimination of fungi from the home environment. Small areas of present contamination can be cleaned with a dilute bleach solution, which kills viable colonies and removes their mycelia. If fungal contamination is not addressed early, substantial damage can occur, requiring professional remediation. Above all, the individual should not panic at the first sight of fungi growing in the home. Regular inspection and cleaning can prevent many fungus-related problems.

### A systematic review with meta-analysis of the relation of aflatoxin B1 to growth impairment in infants / children [^113b7kjH]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Aflatoxins are regarded as the most potent genotoxic and carcinogenic type of mycotoxins. This meta-analysis was performed to investigate a the relation of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) to growth measurements of infants/children, including wasting, underweight, stunting, as well as weight-for-age (WAZ), height-for-age (HAZ), and weight-for-height (WHZ) z-scores.

Methods

Electronic databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to identify related publications. Effect sizes for associations were pooled using the random effects analysis. Subgroup analysis by study design, method used to assess AFB1, and adjustment for covariateswas performed to detect possible sources of heterogeneity.

Results

Pooled analysis of available data showed that AFB1 exposure was negatively associated growth z-scores, including WHZ (β = -0.02, 95%CI = -0.07 to 0.03), with WAZ (β = -0.18, 95%CI = -0.33 to -0.02), and HAZ (β = -0.17, 95%CI = -0.30 to -0.03) in infants/children. There was a remarkable heterogeneity among studies on WAZ and HAZ (P ≤ 0.001). In prospective cohort studies, AFB1 exposure was found to be significantly associated with the elevated risk of underweight (OR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.03 to 1.40) and stunting (OR = 1.21, 95%CI = 1.11 to 1.33).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis highlighted the importance of AFB1 exposure as a potential risk factor for growth impairment in infants/children.

### The mycotoxins citrinin and gliotoxin differentially affect production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 [^1139U2Cb]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Microbial growth is considered one of the major causes of indoor air problems. Moulds have been associated with asthma, allergy and a wide range of diffuse indoor air-related symptoms. However, mechanisms of the adverse health effects are not well understood.

Objective

We hypothesized that the mycotoxins citrinin and gliotoxin could cause an imbalance between the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.

Methods

We investigated the influence of citrinin and gliotoxin on the human monocytic cell line Mono-Mac-6 (MM6) with and without lipopolysaccharide -stimulation. The levels of IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were analysed in cell culture supernatants by ELISA. Cell viability and cell apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry.

Results

The strongest inhibition of cytokine secretion was found for IL-10. IL-6 levels were found to decrease in a dose-dependent manner along with reduced cell viability. TNF-alpha levels increased with low gliotoxin exposure (less than 100 ng/mL), but decreased significantly at 375 ng/mL and higher along with increased cell apoptosis and reduced cell viability. TNF-alpha levels were not reduced by citrinin exposure.

Conclusion

We observed a cytokine imbalance with a more pronounced reduction of IL-10 concentrations compared with those of TNF-alpha and IL-6. We suggest that low exposure doses of citrinin and gliotoxin (corresponding to less than 100 ng/mL gliotoxin and less than 10 mug/mL citrinin) may inhibit IL-10 and lead to increased risk of an inflammatory response with relative overproduction of TNF-alpha and IL-6. The findings and their clinical implications must be verified by human studies. However, we speculate that the observed biological effects may be of importance as they may partly explain the occurrence of diffuse general indoor air-related symptoms as well as the worsening of asthmatic inflammatory reactions experienced in mouldy environments.

### What the primary care pediatrician should know about syndromes associated with exposures to mycotoxins [^115bXBBf]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2006). Low credibility.

Disease associated with exposure to mycotoxins is known as the "Great Masquerader" of the 21st century because of its complex natural history involving different tissues and resembling different diseases at each stage in its evolution. It can present with a variety of nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms such as rash, conjunctivitis, epistaxis, apnea, cough, wheezing, nausea, and vomiting. Some cases of vomiting illness, bone marrow failure, acute pulmonary hemorrhage, and recurrent apnea and/or "pneumonia" are associated with exposure to mycotoxins. Familiarity with the symptoms of exposure to the major classes of mycotoxins enables the clinician to ask pertinent questions about possible fungal exposures and to remove the infant or child from the source of exposure, which could be contaminated food(s), clothing and furniture, or the indoor air of the home. Failure to prevent recurrent exposure often results in recurrent illness. A variety of other conditions, including hepatocellular and esophageal cancer and neural tube defects, are associated with consumption of foods contaminated with mycotoxins. Awareness of the short- and long-term consequences of exposures to these natural toxins helps pediatricians to serve as better advocates for children and families.

### Aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy, maternal anemia, and adverse birth outcomes [^116A1WWk]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

We searched ISI Web of Knowledge and PubMed (with medical subject headings [MeSH] strings) using these search terms: preterm, low birthweight, fetal loss, fetal resorption, hemolysis, anemia, iron deficiency, and miscarriage, with mycotoxin or aflatoxin in the search, between the years 1970 and 2015. We identified additional relevant papers from related review articles identified in the primary search. A total of 27 studies (10 humans, 17 animals) assessing the relationship between aflatoxin exposure and adverse birth outcomes or anemia were identified. A second search was conducted to identify literature evaluating mechanisms that could mediate these adverse health outcomes, using these terms: placenta, cytokines, interleukin-1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α, insulin-like growth factor, intestine, inflammation, immune, and organ, with mycotoxin or aflatoxin in the search.

### The sanitation hygiene infant nutrition efficacy (SHINE) trial: rationale, design, and methods [^115Ez1QP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES OF OTHER EXPOSURES AND OUTCOMES WITHIN SHINE

Several observational studies are being pursued within the SHINE study population, drawing upon the infrastructure, dataset, and sample archive. Maternal schistosomiasis (assessed by urine microscopy) and maternal and infant biomarkers of mycotoxin exposure (see companion article) are being measured and will be analyzed in a longitudinal observational design as potential contributors to EED and inflammation.

We also will investigate the possibility that maternal EED and/or mycotoxin exposure during pregnancy contributes to adverse birth outcomes, including miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, fetal stunting, low birth weight, and neonatal death. Pregnancy losses are ascertained prospectively and data collected on risk factors and outcomes in a specific questionnaire. These studies are planned as case-control designs; the randomized interventions will be treated as covariates in analysis.

### Toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins in outdoor, recreational environments [^111xCH9R]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Some epidemiological studies of damp buildings have focused on health risks from indoor exposure to toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins. Most of these studies have not considered assessment of these hazards in outdoor environments. The purpose of this investigation was to assess for toxigenic fungal species in outdoor recreational environments through the microbial analysis of locations representing opportunities for human exposure. A screening assessment was also conducted using commercially available ELISA kits to assess for trichothecene mycotoxins in outdoor samples.

Methods

Ten swab and tape-lift samples were obtained from a city park. Swabs were cultured and identified by a trained mycologist. Bulk samples of grasses were screened for deoxynivalenol using a commercial ELISA assay. A pilot study of 6 bulk samples was screened for macrocyclic trichothecenes using a commercial ELISA assay.

Results

Tape-lift samples contained trace to moderate spores. Penicillium and Aspergillus-like spores were identified in 50% of tape-lift samples. 50% of swab samples contained potentially toxigenic species of Penicillium (P. citrinum, P. brevicompactum, P. chrysogenum). None of the bulk samples tested positive for deoxynivalenol. 3 of 6 (50%) bulk samples were positive for macrocyclic trichothecenes (> 0.2 ppb), however both negative control samples also tested positive.

Conclusions

Potentially toxigenic fungi were commonly encountered in an outdoor, recreational environment. Future epidemiological studies need to consider outdoor activities in hazard and exposure assessment. Further work is needed to define the accuracy of commercially developed ELISA kits that are being used for the detection of mycotoxins in environmental samples.

### The potential role of mycotoxins as a contributor to stunting in the SHINE trial [^111PLKNt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In summary, the analyses described in this article will provide foundations for future research by exploring the potential mechanisms linking mycotoxin exposure to child stunting, and will provide knowledge about relevant agricultural practices that could be targeted in the development of interventions to reduce mycotoxin exposure in vulnerable populations. This study will provide data on levels and frequencies of multiple mycotoxin exposures in our study population, thereby capturing typical exposure patterns within a region. The longitudinal assessment of mycotoxins will allow us to understand the effect of multiple interacting exposures in a well-characterized cohort of infants. To our knowledge, only 1 previous study has investigated multiple mycotoxin exposure in infants longitudinally, and no study has assessed the combined effects of multiple mycotoxins on stunting while testing a specific causal pathway through EED and the IGF-1 axis. Our additional data on agricultural and harvest practices associated with mycotoxin exposure will allow the direct translation of this work into the development of interventions targeting modifiable behaviors to prevent future exposure.

### Through its genoprotective, mitochondrial bioenergetic modulation, and antioxidant effects, fucoxanthin and its metabolite minimize ochratoxin A-induced nephrotoxicity in HK-2 human kidney cells [^112LnDtd]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicate that mycotoxin contamination impacts around 25% or more of food crops each year. It is essential to note that just a particular group of mycotoxins presents considerable issues to food safety. Among these mycotoxins, Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a potent and highly toxic compound generated by species of Aspergillus and Penicillium that contaminate agricultural products, causing substantial health concerns for humans. OTA commonly pollutes a wide variety of food commodities, such as cereals, coffee, cocoa, dried fruits, and spices. Many studies have demonstrated that OTA presents various toxic effects, including nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, teratogenicity, genotoxicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and carcinogenicity, primarily affecting renal function, and is classified as a possible human carcinogen (Group 2B). Several processes, such as lipid peroxidation, suppression of protein synthesis, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, contribute to its harmful adverse effects.

Natural products are mixtures and monomers derived from natural sources, such as animals, plants, and microorganisms. Natural ingredients have historically been used to cure and prevent numerous diseases. Many compounds found in natural products have exhibited significant benefits and high efficacy in inhibiting cell death, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Natural products can tackle cellular toxicity by utilizing their intrinsic bioactive compounds with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxifying attributes, potentially alleviating damage inflicted by deleterious chemicals or environmental stressors, thus providing a less toxic alternative to synthetic chemicals in cellular protection and repair mechanisms. Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the many biological functions these naturally occurring substances have demonstrated throughout thousands of years. Consequently, natural compounds may provide protective benefits for the kidneys. Even with these strategies, OTA remains a serious public health risk. The complexities of food product contamination necessitate comprehensive prevention, control, and management measures to minimize its negative consequences. Continued research and regulations have significance for protecting consumers and guaranteeing food safety.

### Aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy, maternal anemia, and adverse birth outcomes [^116saPD5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

AbstractPregnant women and their developing fetuses are vulnerable to multiple environmental insults, including exposure to aflatoxin, a mycotoxin that may contaminate as much as 25% of the world food supply. We reviewed and integrated findings from studies of aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy and evaluated potential links to adverse pregnancy outcomes. We identified 27 studies (10 human cross-sectional studies and 17 animal studies) assessing the relationship between aflatoxin exposure and adverse birth outcomes or anemia. Findings suggest that aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy may impair fetal growth. Only one human study investigated aflatoxin exposure and prematurity, and no studies investigated its relationship with pregnancy loss, but animal studies suggest aflatoxin exposure may increase risk for prematurity and pregnancy loss. The fetus could be affected by maternal aflatoxin exposure through direct toxicity as well as indirect toxicity, via maternal systemic inflammation, impaired placental growth, or elevation of placental cytokines. The cytotoxic and systemic effects of aflatoxin could plausibly mediate maternal anemia, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal loss, and preterm birth. Given the widespread exposure to this toxin in developing countries, longitudinal studies in pregnant women are needed to provide stronger evidence for the role of aflatoxin in adverse pregnancy outcomes, and to explore biological mechanisms. Potential pathways for intervention to reduce aflatoxin exposure are urgently needed, and this might reduce the global burden of stillbirth, preterm birth, and low birthweight.

### ACMT position statement: institute of medicine report on damp indoor spaces and health [^114ERSr5]. ACMT (2022). High credibility.

ACMT position statement — inhalation versus dietary exposure explains that with respect to mycotoxins in indoor air, exposure modeling studies have concluded that even in moldy environments, the maximum inhalation dose of mycotoxins is generally orders of magnitude lower than demonstrated thresholds for adverse health effects, and human studies show that in moldy environments inhalation exposure to mycotoxins results in a dose that is far less than what is normally encountered from dietary exposure. It adds that studies that quantify human exposure utilizing validated biomarkers as indicators of internal dose will provide additional information to assess cumulative exposure to mycotoxins, and the ACMT recommends that future studies utilize these methods in the assessment of the dose-response relationship.

### Indoor fungal exposure [^11649Yfu]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Fungi affect humans in complex ways and are capable of eliciting a number of disease responses, such as infectious, allergic, and irritant and toxic effects. Fungal exposure is unequivocally associated with exacerbations of asthma, although the role of fungi in causing the disease is yet to be determined. The association between home dampness and respiratory health effects is strong, and fungal exposure is suspected to be associated with this linkage. Fear of toxin exposures has generated debate over the possible toxic health effects of airborne fungi; however, several recent reviews discount the health impacts of mycotoxin through indoor exposures. Nevertheless, fungal contamination of indoor environments is undesirable. Knowledge of sources and characteristics of fungal spore release and dispersal are important for understanding the processes of exposure. Environmental monitoring for fungi and their disease agents are important aspects of exposure assessment, but few guidelines exist for interpreting their health impacts. Much work is needed in isolating, characterizing and standardizing fungal disease agents to properly assess the prevalence of fungal health effects.

### Effects of mycotoxins on neuropsychiatric symptoms and immune processes [^112s6U8r]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The effects of air pollutants have been receiving increased attention both clinically and in the media. One such pollutant is mold, fungal growth in the form of multicellular filaments known as hyphae. The growth of molds is omnipresent not only in outdoor settings but also in indoor environments containing excessive amounts of moisture.

Methods

PubMed was searched for relevant articles using terms such as mold, mycotoxins, fungi, immunity, inflammation, neurodevelopment, cognition, Alzheimer's, and autism.

Findings

Exposure to molds is most commonly associated with allergies and asthma. However, it is now thought to be associated with many complex health problems, since some molds, especially Trichoderma, Fusarium and Stachybotrys spp, produce mycotoxins that are absorbed from the skin, airways, and intestinal lining. People exposed to molds and mycotoxins present with symptoms affecting multiple organs, including the lungs, musculoskeletal system, as well as the central and peripheral nervous systems. Furthermore, evidence has recently implicated exposure to mycotoxins in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder. The effects of mycotoxins can be mediated via different pathways that include the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially from mast cells.

Implications

The information reviewed indicates that exposure to mold and mycotoxins can affect the nervous system, directly or through immune cell activation, thus contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder.

### The exposome and liver disease-how environmental factors affect liver health [^1167ib44]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and perspectives

The range of external factors that compose the liver exposome is extremely diverse and several of its components have been linked to liver diseases in clinical, epidemiological, and experimental studies (Fig. 4). Some important conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the impact of various exposures on liver diseases:

One exposure, several pathologies. The analysis of the contribution of the exposome to different liver diseases shows that several exposures are common to different liver pathologies, for example alcohol consumption, smoking, viral infections, and some chemical exposures. This is not surprising as these diseases are linked to each other, for example the progression from MAFLD or viral hepatitis to cirrhosis to HCC.
Combination of different exposures. Another important observation is that often a combination of different exposures is involved in disease development or progression, for example the combination of viral agents and chemicals for the progression of viral disease and HCC, or chemicals, dietary imbalance and dysbiosis for the progression of metabolic diseases and the likely contribution of multiple chemicals such as drugs, environmental and occupational chemicals in the progression of liver diseases. Indeed, it is likely that most liver disease results from a combination of multiple factors necessitating an exposome-based approach.
Systemic and liver-specific impacts. While some risk factors like smoking, air pollution or obesity display systemic effects at the organism level with liver pathology being one component of a larger disease, other factors such as hepatitis viruses, mycotoxins, certain drugs and chemicals, elicit a more specific liver disease. Obviously both types of stressors could have combined effects.

### Health effects of mold in children [^116mX6i8]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Mold is ubiquitous, and exposure to mold and its products of metabolism is unavoidable, whether indoors or outdoors. Mold can produce a variety of adverse health outcomes by four scientifically validated pathophysiologic mechanisms: hypersensitivity, toxicity, infection, and irritation. Some adverse health outcomes have been attributed to mold for which mechanisms of injury are not well defined or are implausible. This article discusses these adverse health outcomes, focusing predominantly on those for which valid associations have been established.

### Chemical contaminants… [^114fc9ty]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mycotoxins Mycotoxins are toxic metabolites of certain fungi that can grow on agricultural commodities in the field and during storage. The occurrence of these toxins on grains, seeds, and complete animal food is influenced by various environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall during growing, harvesting, and storage. When fungal growth occurs, mycotoxins are produced in commodities; some of which are used in animal food. The mycotoxins will then remain in the food throughout every phase of food production. Mycotoxins are difficult to eliminate because they are not destroyed by most of the processes used in animal food production. When consumed by animals or humans, the results can be detrimental, resulting in illness or even death. The effects of mycotoxins can manifest in a variety of ways, including neurologic impairment, liver, kidney, or heart failure. Aflatoxins Aflatoxins are produced by molds of the Aspergillus species.

Aflatoxins are among the most well-known mycotoxins due to their high level of toxicity in many animals and people. Aspergillus can grow on grains and seeds during growing season as well as after harvest during storage. The amount of fungal growth and the resulting aflatoxin level in food ingredients is influenced by the temperature and humidity and can vary from year to year. Fumonisin Fumonisins are toxins produced by various molds of the Fusarium genus that are common, natural contaminants of corn. Fumonisins can cause leukoencephalomalacia in horses and pulmonary edema in pigs. They have been linked to a variety of significant adverse health effects in other livestock and experimental animals. Fumonisin B1 is known to induce kidney tumors in male rats and liver tumors in female mice when they consume food containing 50 ppm fumonisin and above.

A wide variety of significant adverse animal health effects such as neurological symptoms, cardiopulmonary failures, and kidney failure have been associated with fumonisins. Horses are extremely susceptible to the harmful effects of fumonisins. Additional Information

### Fungi: toxic killers or unavoidable nuisances? [^117KDxMA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

This discussion is focused on the many roles of fungi in human health, and also to put the mycotoxin literature into perspective.

Data Sources

Data are derived from the literature referenced in PubMed from the National Library of Medicine, earlier references in the authors' reprint collection, and ongoing research. Studies for review were either selected from the peer-reviewed literature or from standard texts that are well recognized in the field.

Results

The review yielded many studies of the role of fungi in allergic disease, but none that systematically documented such a role for mycotoxins or fungal volatiles. Many case studies were found, but none of these unequivocally document a cause/effect relationship between mycotoxin exposure by inhalation and human disease in residential, school, or office settings.

Conclusions

The review led to the conclusion that that the primary result from fungal exposure is allergic disease, and that the evidence for inhalation disease resulting from mycotoxin exposure in residential and office settings is extremely weak.

### Environmental assessment and exposure reduction of rodents: a practice parameter [^115MQF9x]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Environmental assessment and exposure reduction of rodents — scope and professional roles indicate that the parameter "addresses health problems associated with exposure to these animals" and "focuses on involuntary exposure caused by rodent infestation of a home". "Rodent infestation of a home or building requires the help of professionals trained to identify the problems and take remedial action to eliminate the rodents and their residual debris". "Environmental assessment professionals are members of a relatively new field" trained "to identify the potential for exposure to indoor contaminants that are known to have potential adverse effects on health, with an emphasis on allergens, irritants, and safety hazards". The environmental health expert "should work closely with physicians and other health care professionals to determine which exposures are likely to cause health problems in building occupants", and "In that respect, the 2 fields are complementary, requiring cooperation and collaboration". "The goal with respect to rodents is to identify evidence of their presence and to recommend methods for elimination and long-term management". "Reduction of exposure to involuntary agents, such as rodents, requires a deeper understanding of how contaminants, such as allergens, are generated, where they are deposited, and how they are transported from sources and reservoirs to occupants", and "It is only by addressing all of these issues, in addition to their underlying causal factors, that exposure to contaminants, such as rodent allergens, can be reduced sufficiently to have a beneficial effect on health".

### Clinical use of immunoassays in assessing exposure to fungi and potential health effects related to fungal exposure [^116HCkbg]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and summarize current evidence regarding the proper role of immunoassays in clinical assessments of exposure to fungi and health effects related to fungal exposure.

Data Sources

We reviewed relevant scientific investigations and previously published reviews concerning this topic.

Study Selection

The authors' clinical, laboratory, and public health experiences were used to evaluate relevant data for scientific merit.

Results

Testing to determine the presence of IgE to specific fungi may be a useful component of a complete clinical evaluation in the diagnosis of illnesses that can be caused by immediate hypersensitivity such as allergic rhinitis and asthma. Detection of IgG to specific fungi has been used as a marker of exposure to agents that may cause illnesses such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis. However, the ubiquitous nature of many fungi and the lack of specificity of fungal antigens limit the usefulness of these types of tests in the evaluation of potential building-related illness and fungal exposure. Specific serologic tests (such as tests for cryptococcal antigen, coccidioidal antibody, and Histoplasma antigen) have been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of some fungal infections, but these are the exception not the rule.

Conclusions

There is currently not enough scientific evidence to support the routine clinical use of immunoassays as a primary means of assessing environmental fungal exposure or health effects related to fungal exposure. Health care providers who care for persons expressing concerns about the relationship of symptoms to potential exposure to fungi are advised to use immunoassay results with care and only as an adjunct to a comprehensive approach to patient care.

### The medical effects of mold exposure [^111DvhoH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Exposure to molds can cause human disease through several well-defined mechanisms. In addition, many new mold-related illnesses have been hypothesized in recent years that remain largely or completely unproved. Concerns about mold exposure and its effects are so common that all health care providers, particularly allergists and immunologists, are frequently faced with issues regarding these real and asserted mold-related illnesses. The purpose of this position paper is to provide a state-of-the-art review of the role that molds are known to play in human disease, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, sinusitis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In addition, other purported mold-related illnesses and the data that currently exist to support them are carefully reviewed, as are the currently available approaches for the evaluation of both patients and the environment.

### The effects of exposures to mycotoxins on immunity in children: a systematic review [^112TWfvE]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The majority of childhood deaths occur in low-income countries, with vaccine-preventable infections contributing greatly. Of the many possible environmental factors that could hamper a child's immune response, mycotoxins rank among the least studied in spite of the high exposure in vulnerable populations. Aflatoxin crosses the placenta, is secreted in breast milk and is consumed widely in weaning diets by children with developing organ systems. This review describes the effects of mycotoxin exposure on immunity in children that may contribute to sub-optimal vaccine effectiveness. We searched electronic databases and references of identified articles for relevant studies on the effects of mycotoxins on the immune system in children. Geographical location, publication year, study design, sample selection, sample size, mean age, route of exposure were extracted on a standard template. Quality was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute tool for appraisal of systematic reviews for prevalence studies. Our analyses and reporting were conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Out of 806 articles screened, 5 observational studies met criteria for inclusion for review. The definition of exposures to mycotoxins and outcomes varied across the studies. Exposure to mycotoxins was positively associated with low birth weight and concentration of antibodies to asexual malaria parasites and hepatitis B surface antigen, and negatively associated with death and sIgA, antibodies to pneumococcal antigen 23. Despite the far-reaching clinical and public health effects of mycotoxin exposure among children, studies on the effects of mycotoxin exposure on immunity in children were few, small and mostly of low quality. There is an urgent need for carefully designed prospective studies in this neglected field to inform policy interventions for child health in settings where exposure to mycotoxins is high.

### The potential role of mycotoxins as a contributor to stunting in the SHINE trial [^113apoas]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Children in developing countries experience multiple exposures that are harmful to their growth and development. An emerging concern is frequent exposure to mycotoxins that contaminate a wide range of staple foods, including maize and groundnuts. Three mycotoxins are suspected to contribute to poor child health and development: aflatoxin, fumonisin, and deoxynivalenol. We summarize the evidence that mycotoxin exposure is associated with stunting, and propose that the causal pathway may be through environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) and disturbance of the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis. The objectives of this substudy are to assess the relationship between agricultural and harvest practices and mycotoxin exposure; to evaluate associations between mycotoxin exposure and child stunting; and to investigate EED as a potential pathway linking mycotoxin exposure to child stunting, to inform potential areas for intervention.

### Mold prevention strategies and possible health effects in the aftermath of hurricanes and major floods [^114EwzX2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Extensive water damage after major hurricanes and floods increases the likelihood of mold contamination in buildings. This report provides information on how to limit exposure to mold and how to identify and prevent mold-related health effects. Where uncertainties in scientific knowledge exist, practical applications designed to be protective of a person's health are presented. Evidence is included about assessing exposure, clean-up and prevention, personal protective equipment, health effects, and public health strategies and recommendations. The recommendations assume that, in the aftermath of major hurricanes or floods, buildings wet for < 48 hours will generally support visible and extensive mold growth and should be remediated, and excessive exposure to mold-contaminated materials can cause adverse health effects in susceptible persons regardless of the type of mold or the extent of contamination. For the majority of persons, undisturbed mold is not a substantial health hazard. Mold is a greater hazard for persons with conditions such as impaired host defenses or mold allergies. To prevent exposure that could result in adverse health effects from disturbed mold, persons should 1) avoid areas where mold contamination is obvious; 2) use environmental controls; 3) use personal protective equipment; and 4) keep hands, skin, and clothing clean and free from mold-contaminated dust. Clinical evaluation of suspected mold-related illness should follow conventional clinical guidelines. In addition, in the aftermath of extensive flooding, health-care providers should be watchful for unusual mold-related diseases. The development of a public health surveillance strategy among persons repopulating areas after extensive flooding is recommended to assess potential health effects and the effectiveness of prevention efforts. Such a surveillance program will help CDC and state and local public health officials refine the guidelines for exposure avoidance, personal protection, and clean-up and assist health departments to identify unrecognized hazards.

### ACMT position statement: medical toxicology considerations in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with concerns about mold-related inhalation exposures [^113fMDgh]. ACMT (2025). High credibility.

ACMT position statement — mycotoxins in indoor air and exposure magnitude states that mycotoxins in indoor air are large, complex molecules that are not volatile and their concentrations in indoor and outdoor air are exceedingly low, and exposure modeling indicates that even in moldy environments the maximum inhalation dose is generally orders of magnitude lower than demonstrated thresholds for adverse health effects. Human studies in agricultural environments are described as demonstrating that in moldy environments inhalation exposure results in a dose far less than what is normally encountered from dietary exposure. ACMT recommends that future studies utilize validated biomarker methods as indicators of internal dose to assess cumulative exposure and the dose-response relationship, bearing in mind the variably short elimination half-life of most mycotoxins, and states that it is inappropriate to attribute identification of mycotoxins in urine to postulated remote inhalation exposure.

### Aflatoxin exposure and mortality in acutely ill children: results from the CHAIN network cohort [^117CzzCD]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

SUMMARY BOX

It is known that acute high dietary exposure to aflatoxin causes severe disease and may be fatal.
It has not been shown whether lower levels of aflatoxin may contribute to mortality in severely ill malnourished children.
This study has found that in severely ill children admitted to hospital, higher levels of aflatoxin exposure are associated with mortality, although severe malnutrition makes a bigger contribution.
This highlights the need to reduce aflatoxin exposure in children and consider exposure as a risk factor for mortality in severely ill children in sub-Saharan Africa.

In February 2014, CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health received a request for a health hazard evaluation from a union representative in an office building. A female employee reported the onset of symptoms involving multiple organ systems upon returning to work after a prolonged absence. The employee searched the Internet for descriptions of symptoms matching hers, found a laboratory offering "toxic mold testing" direct to consumers, and submitted a urine sample, despite the absence of musty odors and signs of fungal growth in her office. The laboratory reported "positive" concentrations of two mycotoxins: ochratoxin at 2.8 parts per billion (ppb) and tricothecenes at 0.4 ppb. The laboratory cutoff for "positive" was ≥ 2.0 ppb for ochratoxin and ≥ 0.2 ppb for tricothecenes. The interpretation accompanying the laboratory report said the results "revealed that you have an unusual level of that mycotoxin(s) present in your body".

### Adverse associations between maternal deoxynivalenol exposure and birth outcomes: a prospective cohort study in China [^113LwaxM]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Currently, only one cohort study has evaluated the association between serum DON levels and adverse birth outcomes in 483 pregnant women at 8–24 weeks of gestation in rural Ethiopia. However, this study did not find a statistically significant association. The serum DON levels were relatively low, detected in only 38.7% of the population, with concentrations ranging from 0–2.4 ng/mL. In Nanjing, China, Fan et al. detected multiple mycotoxins in paired plasma and urine samples and found that the detection rate and mean concentration of DON in urine were higher than those in plasma. Therefore, a larger sample size and higher detection levels in our study may contribute to finding statistically significant associations between urinary DON levels and adverse birth outcomes.

Our findings reveal that dietary DON exposure during pregnancy may lead to the exposure of DON in early life, resulting in fetal growth retardation. Smaller size or relative thinness at birth and during infancy have been associated with increased rates of coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, adiposity, metabolic syndrome, and osteoporosis in adult life. So given this reality, it is important to be concerned about the relationship between maternal DON exposure and their offspring. In addition, more research is needed to determine the safe threshold for DON exposure in pregnant women, and stricter policies should be developed to strengthen food safety.

There are several possible biological mechanisms that may explain the effect of DON on growth faltering. The first is that DON may interfere with the nutritional efficiency of maternal intestinal absorption, which could affect fetal weight gain. Even at low doses, chronic consumption of DON-contaminated food can induce intestinal inflammation and damage the intestinal mucosa. The toxicity of DON is mainly through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathway and the expression of genes that alter essential physiological and immune functions of tissues, which reduces the expression of tight junction proteins such as claudins and decreases intestinal barrier permeability. In addition, studies have shown that dietary DON exposure may affect intestinal health by destroying the balance and diversity of commensal microbiota, leading to ecological imbalance. Another potential mechanism may be related to changes in growth hormone levels controlled by insulin-like growth factors, which are mainly produced in the liver. Thus, DON-induced hepatotoxicity may be a crucial determinant of growth and development.

### ACMT position statement: medical toxicology considerations in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with concerns about mold-related inhalation exposures [^111dTxxT]. ACMT (2025). High credibility.

ACMT position on mold-related inhalation exposures — mycotoxins and exposure assessment states that these issues have cast doubt on the causative role of inhaled mycotoxins for any toxic health effects in the indoor residential environment; epidemiological studies of mold in indoor environments should include appropriate comparisons with outdoor air, and studies should be designed to consider our aggregate and cumulative exposure to fungi and mycotoxins from indoor and outdoor environments; ACMT emphasizes the importance of distinguishing exposure to mycotoxins from exposure to the fungi that are capable of producing them, noting that toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins are not synonymous hazards and that the isolation of a toxigenic fungal species in the environment does not necessarily indicate that mycotoxins are also present, or that they are present at doses that pose health risks from environmental exposure; if epidemiological studies of damp indoor spaces are to include hypotheses relating to mycotoxins, then exposure assessment methods should utilize validated techniques to detect and quantify mycotoxins directly in environmental samples, and the interpretation of such environmental measurements should consist of a plausible, complete exposure pathway and an assessment of the dose-response relationship; ACMT further emphasizes that the diet is the most important source of human exposure to mycotoxins, and notes that mycotoxins of known dietary importance include aflatoxins (in corn, ground nuts, and dairy products), trichothecenes (in corn, cereals and fermented beverages) and ochratoxins (in coffee, wine, and dried fruits), with the vast majority of scientific data on the adverse health effects of mycotoxins derived from their presence as natural and unavoidable contaminants of foods and beverages.

### The potential role of mycotoxins as a contributor to stunting in the SHINE trial [^114L5obj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

INVESTIGATION OF AGRICULTURAL AND HARVEST PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH MYCOTOXIN EXPOSURE

Pre- and postharvest crop management has a significant influence on the accumulation of AF in maize and groundnuts. Smallholder farming practices are shaped by the ecological and social context, and information is scarce about farmers' practices and how their decisions affect household-level exposure to mycotoxins. With a view to increasing local knowledge and informing future preventive intervention strategies, we seek to understand the drivers of AF exposure in rural Zimbabwe.

We found no precedent in the literature for a survey module designed to assess mycotoxin risk according to agricultural practices by smallholder farmers. We therefore designed a survey module comprising closed-ended questions regarding pre- and postharvest practices relevant to maize and groundnuts. This module was translated, pilot-tested among rural households, and revised for clarity before implementation within the SHINE baseline survey. The baseline survey includes additional modules related to household wealth, land ownership, food security, infant feeding practices, and dietary diversity, which complement the mycotoxin risk module.

These data will be analyzed to provide a description of relevant agricultural practices, including a summary mycotoxin risk indicator. In addition, we will describe the association between mycotoxin risk and household characteristics (eg, wealth, land ownership), geographic locale, season, year, and rainfall. Last, we will ascertain the extent to which overall mycotoxin risk (measured as a summary score) and/or specific practices are associated with biomarkers of mycotoxin exposure in SHINE mothers and infants.

### Can low level exposure to ochratoxin – A cause parkinsonism? [^116JuN4X]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Mycotoxins are fungal metabolites with pharmacological activities that have been utilized in the production of antibiotics, growth promoters, and other classes of drugs. Some mycotoxins have been developed as biological and chemical warfare agents. Bombs and ballistic missiles loaded with aflatoxin were stockpiled and may have been deployed by Iraq during the first Gulf War. In light of the excess incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in veterans from Operation Desert Storm, the potential for delayed neurotoxic effects of low doses of mycotoxins should not be overlooked. Ochratoxin-A (OTA) is a common mycotoxin with complex mechanisms of action, similar to that of the aflatoxins. Acute administration of OTA at non-lethal doses (10% of the LD₅₀) have been shown to increase oxidative DNA damage in brain up to 72 h, with peak effects noted at 24 h in midbrain (MB), caudate/putamen (CP) and hippocampus (HP). Levels of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in the striatum (e.g. CP) were shown to be decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The present study focused on the effects of chronic low dose OTA exposure on regional brain oxidative stress and striatal DA metabolism. Continuous administration of low doses of OTA with implanted subcutaneous Alzet minipumps caused a small but significant decrease in striatal DA levels and an upregulation of anti-oxidative systems and DNA repair. It is possible that low dose exposure to OTA will result in an earlier onset of parkinsonism when normal age-dependent decline in striatal DA levels are superimposed on the mycotoxin-induced lesion.

### Cumulative lifetime burden of cardiovascular disease from early exposure to air pollution [^115csu5b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

In this contemporary review, we have focused primarily on the effects of ambient air pollution, especially components of PM and PAHs. Although sufficient data are available to support preventive action, it is yet unclear how the different components of pollution — carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, ozone, ambient PM, and lead — each affect the cardiovascular system.

Of the different pollution components, fine PM is known to be highly toxic to the cardiopulmonary system. However, we still do not fully understand whether all types of PM (eg, wildfire smoke versus diesel exhaust) are equally toxic or which specific components determine toxicity. The most studied particle matter is PM 2.5, which is especially harmful because they can penetrate into the pulmonary alveoli where they can induce a local inflammatory response. Ultrafine particles, a component of PM 2.5, can penetrate the alveolar‐capillary barrier and enter the bloodstream. Several studies have established that PM induces inflammatory effects 211, 212, 213 and oxidative stress, 212, 214 yet it is not yet clear to what extent such effects are different for PM collected at different locations or from different sources. 215 The proinflammatory and oxidative potential of PM may be influenced by variations in PM chemical and physical composition. 216, 217 PM composition is determined by whether the emissions originate from cars, trucks, industry, or agricultural activities, and emissions are further affected by variations in temperature and meteorological conditions through atmospheric changes. 218 As such, although much research has concentrated on the effects of PM in animals and humans, we still have limited information on PM chemical components from different sources and locations. 219 PM, especially PM 10, includes biological components such as fungal spores and endotoxins, elemental carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, metal compounds, and complex hydrocarbons such as PAH. 10 Some of these PM components have been shown to induce systemic inflammation. For example, endotoxin and PAH initiate monocyte inflammatory responses mediated by reactive oxygen species, 124, 220, 221 and transition metals (iron, manganese, chromium, copper) induce cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. 222 While some studies indicate a degree of differential toxicity from such components as endotoxin, specific metals, PAH, and elemental carbon, 218 current knowledge does not allow us to precisely quantify the health effects of individual PM components or PM from different sources. To better inform regulatory strategies in the future, we must more fully understand the health effects of various PM components from different sources, which will allow us to identify the causal agents. This will help formulate more targeted strategies for harm reduction. It will also help us to appropriately lower the current annual ambient air quality standards, considering the more susceptible populations, especially our children. Collaborating with rapidly developing countries, where extremely unhealthy air quality level is a daily concern, will help us to develop impactful research that will be applicable in both the United States and throughout the world.

### Cross-shift study of exposure-response relationships between bioaerosol exposure and respiratory effects in the Norwegian grain and animal feed production industry [^113i6jfv]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Grain dust exposure may induce respiratory symptoms in grain handlers, and measures for reducing the dust exposure have constantly attention in the grain industry. Employees at grain elevators and compound feed mills may be exposed to large amounts of grain dust, frequently leading to symptoms from the airways and pulmonary functional changes such as asthma. Acute and short-term effects, such as cross-shift lung function decline and toxic pneumonitis, have been observed during a workday, and long-term exposure may lead to permanently decreased lung function, although results are not always consistent.

The pathological response to grain dust exposure suggests inflammatory and allergic pathways, although exact mechanisms are under debate. The cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria, endotoxin, has potential to exert several of the observed health effects caused by grain dust exposure, and many studies from the grain industry include endotoxin measurements. On the basis of in vitro studies, animal experiments and epidemiological studies, endotoxin has been proposed as a target for measurements of occupational health hazards related to grain dust exposure. However, grain dust also contains several other components, such as mycotoxins, tannins, lectins, lymphocyte mitogens and β-1,3-d-glucans, that may induce immunological, allergic or toxic responses, and interact with the effects of endotoxin.

The dose–response patterns between grain dust exposure and inflammatory response or changes in respiratory function are contradictory between studies, possibly due to a differential effect of the individual grain dust components. Furthermore, the microbial composition of the dust will vary between crop types, years/weather conditions, geographic regions, companies and job groups. This exposure variability may dilute and even bias exposure–response patterns, and should therefore be considered. Few exposure studies in the grain and animal feed industry have included microbial components, and studies of lung function have been conducted without exposure measurements. Only few exposure–response studies have assessed exposure simultaneously with health examinations. To the best of our knowledge, no study has reported exposure–response associations of other exposure components than grain dust and endotoxins. Thus, information on exposure–response associations with other bioaerosol components is needed to understand health effects after grain dust exposure.
