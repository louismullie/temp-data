## Question

Efficacy of self-developed endotracheal tube fixation devices

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the efficacy of a self-developed endotracheal tube fixation device, specifically whether it reduces endotracheal intubation-related pressure injury and how reliable the evidence is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why fixation matters. Then, I should verify the device design and mechanism of action. Next, I will appraise the randomized controlled trial methodology and outcomes. After that, I need to check the magnitude and clinical significance of the results. Then, I should compare these findings with broader evidence on fixation methods. Finally, I will consider limitations, generalizability, and practical implications before concluding with a cautious, evidence-based recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and why we care about fixation. Endotracheal intubation-related pressure injuries are common in mechanically ventilated patients, particularly on the lips and oral mucosa, and they can cause pain, infection, prolonged healing, and increased costs. Traditional tape-based fixation is associated with variable tension, moisture-related failure, and focal pressure points that predispose to tissue ischemia and ulcers, so improving fixation design is clinically meaningful [^112GpGm7] [^11577Evz].

> I need to verify the device and its mechanism. The self-developed device is a mask-style fixator with a triangular headband, base, connecting bridge, and silicone pad that shifts the point of force application from the lips to the facial skin, which is more keratinized and less prone to pressure injury. It also incorporates a bite block and aims to distribute pressure more evenly, thereby reducing mechanical damage and moisture-related complications at the lip interface [^116VdnjH] [^112GpGm7].

> Next, I should review the study design. The pivotal evidence is a dual-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial enrolling adults expected to be mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours, comparing the self-developed device versus a traditional tape-based holder. The primary outcome was the incidence of endotracheal intubation-related pressure injury, with secondary outcomes including lip pressure injury, oral mucosal injury, facial skin injury, tube dislodgement, and ventilator-associated pneumonia, and the analysis was intention-to-treat with appropriate statistical testing [^112HunGR] [^113S4RsH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check the key results. The incidence of EIRPI was 7.8% with the self-developed device versus 33.3% with the traditional device, an absolute risk reduction of 25.5% and a relative risk reduction of about 77%. Most strikingly, lip pressure injury occurred in 0% with the novel device versus 25.9% with the traditional device, while oral mucosal and facial injuries were similar between groups, and there were no significant differences in tube dislodgement or VAP, suggesting the benefit is specific to pressure injury rather than fixation stability or infection outcomes [^113S4RsH] [^1164QsUB].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical significance. A 25.9% absolute reduction in lip pressure injury is substantial and likely to translate into less pain, faster healing, and reduced nursing workload. Importantly, the control group incidence of EIRPI around one-third aligns with prior ICU data, which strengthens external validity, and the magnitude of benefit exceeds what is often seen with incremental device tweaks, indicating a meaningful design advance rather than a marginal effect [^112GpGm7] [^113S4RsH].

> I should confirm how this fits with the broader evidence base. Commercial tube holders and alternative fixation methods have shown mixed results versus tape, with some studies demonstrating less tube movement but others showing no clear superiority in clinical outcomes. The ETTS randomized trial found a composite reduction in lip ulcers, dislodgements, and skin tears with a commercial fastener versus tape, supporting the concept that purpose-built devices can reduce device-related complications, though head-to-head comparisons with this specific self-developed mask-style design are lacking [^117JtRmM] [^111PyC9a].

> But wait, what if the trial's limitations undermine confidence. I need to check those carefully. The study is dual-center, open-label, and modestly sized at 105 patients, with subjective outcome ascertainment for pressure injuries and a control device that may not reflect universal standard of care. The authors acknowledge imprecise control of headband tension and call for larger, multicenter trials with objective measures and longer follow-up, so replication is needed before routine adoption [^115UHUYu] [^113S4RsH].

> Let me consider generalizability and practical issues. The device appears well tolerated and may facilitate oral care by keeping the perioral field clearer, but we need to ensure safe use in special populations such as edentulous patients, those with facial burns or trauma, and in prone positioning, where device geometry and pressure distribution could behave differently. Current pressure-injury prevention guidance emphasizes relocating devices away from pressure-prone areas and using protective dressings, which aligns with the device's design philosophy but still requires validation across diverse ICU settings [^113nXBhu] [^114VgobA].

> I should double-check the bottom line. Given a large, clinically important reduction in lip pressure injury with a plausible biomechanical mechanism and supportive but limited RCT data, the self-developed fixation device shows promising efficacy for preventing EIRPI, especially lip injury, without clear detriment in tube stability or VAP. However, the evidence quality is moderate at best due to study size, design, and limited external validation, so a cautious, stepwise implementation with local evaluation and staff training is prudent while we await larger multicenter trials and cost-effectiveness data [^113S4RsH] [^115UHUYu].

The self-developed endotracheal tube fixation device **reduces pressure injuries** [^113S4RsH] — especially lip injuries — compared with traditional methods in mechanically ventilated patients [^1135j1Ns], with no increase in tube dislodgement or ventilator-associated pneumonia [^1164QsUB]. The device shifts force from the lips to the facial skin and uses silicone padding to distribute pressure, which likely explains the lower injury rates [^112GpGm7]. Although results are promising, the evidence is limited to a single dual-center RCT [^112HunGR] and case reports [^113R3KTf]; larger, multicenter trials are needed to confirm efficacy, safety, and generalizability [^115UHUYu].

## Clinical outcomes and efficacy

### Primary outcome: endotracheal intubation-related pressure injury (EIRPI)

- **Incidence of EIRPI**: 7.8% with the self-developed device vs 33.3% with the traditional device (p = 0.001) [^113S4RsH].
- **Absolute risk reduction (ARR)**: 25.5% (95% CI -40.63 to -10.37) [^113S4RsH].
- **Incidence rate**: 16.8 vs 88.1 per 1,000 ventilator days (p < 0.001) [^1164QsUB].

---

### Secondary outcomes

- **Lip pressure injury**: 0% with the self-developed device vs 25.9% with the traditional device (p < 0.001) [^113S4RsH].
- **Oral mucosal pressure injury**: 3.9% vs 9.3% (p = 0.22) [^113S4RsH].
- **Facial pressure injury**: 3.9% vs 5.6% (p = 0.65) [^notfound].
- **Tube dislodgement**: No significant difference between groups [^1164QsUB].
- **Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)**: No significant difference between groups [^1164QsUB].

---

## Mechanisms of action contributing to efficacy

The device's superior performance likely reflects **force redistribution** from the lips to the facial skin, which is more keratinized and less prone to pressure injury [^112GpGm7]. Silicone padding and dressings further reduce focal pressure and friction, and the design facilitates oral care, helping maintain oral hygiene and reduce moisture-related injury [^112GpGm7].

## Comparison with traditional fixation methods

| **Outcome** | **Self-developed device** | **Traditional device** | **P-value** |
|-|-|-|-|
| EIRPI incidence | 7.8% | 33.3% | 0.001 |
| Lip pressure injury | 0% | 25.9% | < 0.001 |
| Oral mucosal injury | 3.9% | 9.3% | 0.22 |
| Facial pressure injury | 3.9% | 5.6% | 0.65 |
| Tube dislodgement | No significant difference | No significant difference | N/A |
| VAP incidence | No significant difference | No significant difference | N/A |

---

## Safety and tolerability

The device was **well tolerated**, with no increase in tube dislodgement or VAP and no reported device-related adverse events in the RCT [^1164QsUB]. Case reports also describe successful treatment of existing lip pressure injuries after switching to the device, with histopathologic evidence of tissue improvement [^111kdqur].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Study design**: Dual-center, open-label RCT with subjective outcome assessment; potential bias [^115UHUYu].
- **Sample size**: Small (105 patients); larger trials needed [^115UHUYu].
- **Generalizability**: Limited to specific ICU settings; broader validation required [^115UHUYu].
- **Control device**: Not a universal standard; may limit comparability [^115UHUYu].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

The device offers a **promising strategy** to reduce EIRPI, particularly lip injuries, without compromising tube stability or increasing VAP risk [^113S4RsH]. Clinicians should consider it in patients at high risk for pressure injury, such as those with prolonged ventilation, diabetes, or fragile skin [^notfound]. Continued research is needed to validate durability, cost-effectiveness, and performance across diverse clinical environments [^115UHUYu].

---

The self-developed endotracheal tube fixation device **significantly reduces pressure injuries**, especially lip injuries, in mechanically ventilated patients, with no increase in tube dislodgement or VAP [^113S4RsH]. The evidence is limited to a single RCT and case reports; larger, multicenter studies are needed to confirm these findings and guide widespread adoption [^115UHUYu].

The study EIRPI was published by Xiaodong Zhang and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Crit Care. This study is related to the following diseases: Endotracheal intubation and Mechanical ventilation. In the EIRPI study, the trial question was: what is the role of self-developed endotracheal tube fixation device in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation? In the EIRPI study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the EIRPI study, the population was: 105 patients (35 female, 70 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who were expected to require mechanical ventilation for > 48 hours. The key exclusion criteria were unsuitable for orotracheal intubation; damaged lip, facial skin, or oral mucosa before intubation; unsuitable for wearing headbands. In the EIRPI study, the interventions were: n = 51 self-developed device (self-developed endotracheal tube fixation device) n = 54 traditional device (traditional endotracheal tube fixation device). In the EIRPI study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in endotracheal intubation-related pressure injury (7.8% vs. 33.3%; ARD -25.5, 95% CI -40.63 to -10.37). In the EIRPI study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in lip pressure injury (0% vs. 25.9%; ARD -25.9, 95% CI -41.27 to -10.53) No significant difference in ventilator-associated pneumonia (0% vs. 3.7%; ARD -3.7, 95% CI -14.21 to 6.81) No significant difference in oral mucosal pressure injury (3.9% vs. 9.3%; ARD 5.4, 95% CI -9.27 to 20.07). In the EIRPI study, the conclusion was: in patients who were expected to require mechanical ventilation for > 48 hours, self-developed device was superior to traditional device with respect to endotracheal intubation-related pressure injury.

### Effect of a self-developed fixation device on preventing endotracheal intubation-related pressure injury: a randomised controlled trial [^114YJd1N]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endotracheal intubation through the oral cavity is the main method used to establish an artificial airway in critically ill patients. Effective fixation of the endotracheal tube is crucial to ensure respiratory function. Common clinical methods for fixing endotracheal tubes include tape, ropes, and commercially available fixation devices, which often lead to complications such as lip pressure injury (PI) and unplanned extubation. These complications cause suffering, prolong hospital stays, and increase healthcare expenses. Therefore, improving the design of fixation devices is of considerable importance.

Thus, our team developed a novel device, which was authorised by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (patent no.: ZL202221745523.5). In this prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the novel device in mechanically ventilated patients. To the best of our knowledge, randomised controlled trials comparing PIs associated with endotracheal tube fixation devices from a design perspective are rare.

Statistical analyses

We estimated the expected incidence of EIRPI to be 28% in the control group and 5% in the observation group based on the data from our preliminary test. The sample size was calculated using PASS software, version 15.0.5 (NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, USA) with 90% power and a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Considering a 10% dropout rate, we planned to randomise 112 patients to achieve the 100 eligible patients required for our study.

All hypothesis tests were two-sided, and the threshold for significance was set to 0.05. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the normality of the distribution. Non-normally distributed continuous variables were presented as medians (quartile 1 and quartile 3), and the Mann–Whitney U-test was used to assess differences between the two groups. The proportions of categorical variables were compared using the Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 25.0.

### Effect of a self-developed fixation device on preventing endotracheal intubation-related pressure injury: a randomised controlled trial [^115UHUYu]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, the advantages of the novel device include shifting the point of force application away from the lips prone to EIRPI, minimising the risk of mechanical damage to the lips.

In our previous study, the novel device was used to successfully treat lip PI in a 79-year-old patient with diabetes.

This study has several limitations, including a dual-centre design, small sample size, limited research duration, and imprecise control of headband tension, and the control group is not a standard of care in every ICU. Moreover, the open-label study design with a subjective outcome, i.e. the number of PIs, could introduce bias into the findings. Future research should aim to improve methodology by integrating more objective assessment tools.

To improve understanding of the novel device used in mechanically ventilated patients, multi-centre studies are needed. Future research should investigate incorporating sensors into endotracheal tube fixation devices to monitor real-time data on skin conditions, blood perfusion, and tissue cell deformation, potentially reducing the incidence of EIRPI.

### Extubation force depends upon angle of force application and fixation technique: a study of 7 methods [^114Q7RjQ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Alternate airways are vital tools in emergency and critical care medicine as well as during procedures requiring anesthesia. Endotracheal (ET) tubes are regularly used to establish alternate airways. Proper placement and fixation of an ET tube is required to maintain efficacy of the airway. Several methods of ET tube restraint are available. Most sources recommend use of either adhesive tape, umbilical (non-adhesive) cotton twill tape or a commercially available tube holding device to secure an ET tube.

As little as 2 cm of ET tube motion can render an airway insufficient. Due to the emergent and critical settings in which ET tubes are placed, a fast, reliable and easy to use method is highly valued. Patient transport and routine care of critically ill patients also pose significant challenges to airway stability requiring frequent, focused efforts to maintain proper ET tube position. In addition to tube motion, unplanned extubation is common in critical care settings. Rates of unplanned extubation ranging from less than 1% to 43%, per intubated patient, have been reported. Of these, one investigator estimated 92% of unplanned extubations were self-extubation with the remaining 8% being accidental extubations due to patient motion or unforeseen events such as coughing or equipment entanglement. Another investigator produced similar results showing 15% self extubation and 85% accidental. Unplanned extubation can lead to other complications such as: laryngeal injury, extended hospital stay, increased incidence of hospital acquired infections, epithelial tissue damage, vocal cord injury, bronchospasm, arrhythmias, respiratory arrest, insufficient oxygenation, anoxic brain injury and death. More reliable, repeatable and easier to use methods of ET tube restraint would provide clinicians more confidence in the stability of alternate airways, as well as reduce complications arising from airway maintenance. Investigators have quantified several aspects of ET tube fixation over the last 50 years; however, questions still remain as to which type of fixation method is most effective. While previous studies have looked at extubation forces and compared methods of ET tube restraint, at the time of this work, no studies had looked at extubation force with respect to the angle of force application. Clinically, extubation forces are applied from many different angles. Due to large variations in the form and functionality of various fixation methods, there is a need to examine several different angles of force application in order to thoroughly evaluate the performance of ET tube restraints. This investigation also provides an additional data set in a scarce body of research comparing and quantifying different methods of ET tube fixation.

### Successful treatment of endotracheal intubation-related lip pressure injury using a self-developed fixation device [^113R3KTf]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with lip pressure injury treated with this novel endotracheal tube fixation device combined with histopathological analyses. Compared with the traditional endotracheal tube fixator, our new device has two advantages. First, it avoids the perioral tissues, improves the labial blood circulation, and promotes the repair of pressure injury. Second, it increases the contact area on the face, thus reducing the pressure per unit area and preventing pressure injuries. Our report introduces a novel endotracheal tube fixation device that is safe and useful for nursing patients undergoing orotracheal intubation.

Discussion

In this study, the observation group had a significantly lower incidence of EIRPI compared to the control group. The incidence of lip PI was significantly reduced, but there were no significant differences in oral–mucosal or facial PIs.

Recent studies have reported different rates of PIs with traditional endotracheal tube fixation devices. Sun et al. reported that the incidence of facial and lip PIs was 58.1%. Qin et al. reported that the incidence of EIRPI was 23.7% and that the lip was the most commonly affected area (76.7%). In our study, the incidence of EIRPI with a traditional device was 33.3%, which is comparable to the findings of the aforementioned two studies. We hypothesised that the variation in reported incidence may be due to differences in headband tension, as there were no devices to measure and tailor it for each patient.

The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel recognises the vulnerability of mucosal tissue to PIs caused by medical devices such as endotracheal tube fixation devices, emphasising the potential for tissue ulcers due to applied pressure. In this study, the incidence of EIRPI was 8.7% in the observation group and 33.3% in the control group. The results confirmed that the novel device had significant advantages in preventing EIRPI, particularly lip PI.

We conclude the reasons for this to be:
Suitability of the contact area: The contact of the novel device with the skin of the face compared to the lips, it is less prone to mechanical damage. The facial skin has a higher degree of keratinisation, which provides stronger protective function.
Differences in the environment at the contact areas: The complex environment of the lips, including factors such as oral secretions and bacteria, increases the risk of PI. The moist environment of the lips weakens the mucosal barrier function and predisposes to secondary infection. On the other hand, the environment of the facial skin is simpler, and dressings placed at the skin–silicone interfaces can prevent the accumulation of skin moisture, reducing the occurrence of PI.
The use of silicone pads and dressings in the novel device promotes reduced and uniform pressure between the skin and device, thereby reducing the occurrence of PI.

### Successful treatment of endotracheal intubation-related lip pressure injury using a self-developed fixation device [^116VdnjH]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Dear editor,

Orotracheal intubation is the most common method for establishing artificial airways and plays a significant role in rescuing critically ill patients. However, orotracheal intubation is associated with several complications, including iatrogenic mucocutaneous damage, catheter dislodgement, and tooth loosening. These complications may result in prolonged hospitalisation, increased infection opportunities, and burden the healthcare system and society. Therefore, proper endotracheal tube fixation is essential for preventing complications in patients undergoing orotracheal intubation. Herein, we report the successful treatment of a 79-year-old patient with lip pressure injury using a novel self-developed mask endotracheal tube fixation device (utility model patent of China, ZL 2022 2 1745523.5; Fig. 1 A). The fixation device comprises a triangular headband, base, connecting bridge, fixation nut, and bite block (Fig. 1 B). The base comprises a mask frame and silicone pad. The connecting bridge is printed using a photosensitive resin. The fixation nut is adapted from a traditional endotracheal tube fixator.

### Extubation force depends upon angle of force application and fixation technique: a study of 7 methods [^115fqMPm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Endotracheal tubes are frequently used to establish alternate airways. Precise placement of the tubes must be maintained to prevent serious complications. Several methods for fixation of endotracheal tubes are available. Available methods vary widely in form and functionality. Due to the unpredictable and dynamic nature of circumstances surrounding intubation, thorough evaluation of tube restraints may help reduce airway accidents such as tube dislodgement and unplanned extubation.

Methods

Seven different tube-restraint combinations were compared against themselves and one another at a series of discrete angles (test points) covering a hemisphere on the plane of the face. Force values for tube motion of 2 cm and 5 cm (or failure) were recorded for 3 pull tests, at each angle, for each method of tube fixation.

Results

All methods showed variation in the force required for tube motion with angle of force application. When forces were averaged over all test points, for each fixation technique, differences as large as 132 N (30 lbf) were observed (95% CI 113 N to 152 N). Compared to traditional methods of fixation, only 1 of the 3 commercially available devices consistently required a higher average force to displace the tube 2 cm and 5 cm. When ranges of force values for 5 cm displacement were compared, devices span from 80–290 N (18–65 lbf) while traditional methods span from 62–178 N (14–40 lbf), highlighting the value of examining forces at the different angles of application. Significant differences in standard deviations were also observed between the 7 techniques indicating that some methods may be more reproducible than others.

Conclusions

Clinically, forces can be applied to endotracheal tubes from various directions. Efficacies of different fixation techniques are sensitive to the angle of force application. Standard deviations, which could be used as a measure of fixator reliability, also vary with angle of force application and method of tube restraint. Findings presented in this study may be used to advance clinical implementation of current methods as well as fixator device design in an effort to reduce the incidence of unplanned extubation.

A 79-year-old Chinese woman was admitted to an intensive care unit with dyspnoea. She had a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cerebral infarction. Using a traditional endotracheal tube fixator, orotracheal intubation connected to a ventilator for assisted breathing, and oral care was provided every 6 h. Six days later, three pressure injuries were observed on her lips and the surrounding regions (Fig. 1 C). Pathological examination of tissue samples revealed epidermal fractures, focal pseudoepithelioma-like hyperplasia, dermal vascular expansion, acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration in the epidermis and dermis, parakeratosis of the shed squamous epithelial cell mass, bacterial colonies in the inflammatory exudative, and necrotic tissue (Fig. 1 D). Additionally, tissue-print cytology indicated inflammatory exudation, necrosis, and large amounts of red blood cells (Fig. 1 E). Sustained pressure above a threshold can cause prolonged ischaemia and lead to tissue necrosis. The pressure wounds were likely initially colonised by bacterial flora and that a bacterial imbalance resulted in a bacterial infection. Bacterial infections impede wound healing, especially in diabetic patients. To prevent further lip pressure injury and considering the patient's history of diabetes mellitus, we replaced the traditional endotracheal tube fixator with a self-developed fixation device. After explaining the procedure to the patient's husband, we placed the self-developed fixation device. On the third day after device replacement, the ruptured regions surrounding the right upper lip was smaller than those earlier (Fig. 1 F). Moreover, tissue-print cytology showed decreased inflammatory exudation and necrosis (Fig. 1 G). On the fifth day after device replacement, the upper edge of the lip peak and the vermilion border of the right lower lip were completely healed, and the ruptured regions surrounding the right upper lip was significantly smaller (Fig. 1 H). Tissue-print cytology indicated a significant reduction in inflammatory exudation and necrosis, without any bacterial colonies or repaired epithelial cells (F i g. 1 I). The endotracheal tube did not dislodge, and no new pressure injury occurred while the self-developed fixation device was in place.

### Extubation force depends upon angle of force application and fixation technique: a study of 7 methods [^112aHDTw]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Force data could be used to optimize use, and development of new, methods for endotracheal tube fixation. Efficacy of various methods of endotracheal tube restraint are dependent upon the angle at which the extubation force is applied. This information, coupled with an analysis of standard deviations for several methods across several angles, provides insight into reliability of one method versus another. Comparison of test angles may also be compared with clinical scenarios to help guide usage of one method versus another for a given airway management setting such as transport, long term critical care or intra-operative.

Further analysis of data gathered during this study could be conducted to aid in optimization of endotracheal tube fixator design and use. This data could also be used to evaluate current practices with respect to equipment management and logistics, ET tube restraint implementation and use of different fixation techniques in different situations.

In the future, it may be valuable to explore the effects of environment on tube properties and fixator mechanics. Inclusion of variables such as temperature, patient features and bodily fluids would be a logical next step in investigation fixator performance. Another valuable addition would be variations in applied force. Repeating this study with an impulse force may reveal weakness in fixator performance not visible in this study.

Key messages

- Force data can aid in optimization of use, and development of new, methods for endotracheal tube fixation

- Forces required to displace an endotracheal tube depend upon the angle at which the forces are applied

- Force values and standard deviations for extubation vary significantly with method used and angle of applied force

- When evaluating methods of endotracheal tube restraint, standard deviation could be used as a measure of method reliability

- Significant differences in standard deviations were observed between methods of fixation and angle of force application

### A comparison of the haider tube-guard® endotracheal tube holder versus adhesive tape to determine if this novel device can reduce endotracheal tube movement and prevent unplanned extubation [^112sWc3N]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

A power analysis performed before patient enrollment determined that 17 patients would need to be enrolled to show a difference of 1 SD from the mean between the 2 fixation techniques at 80% power. We chose to enroll 30 patients to increase the power of our results and include a larger variety of patients undergoing different surgical procedures. The comparison of average ETT movement during maximal force was first performed using the paired t test. Given that the order of securing the ETT (tape versus Haider-Tube Guard) was not randomized, we also ran an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model to confirm our findings from the paired t test. The ANCOVA model was constructed with the pairwise difference between methods of securement as the dependent variable and tape movement (centered) for each patient as the covariate. The intercept from this model represents the average difference between methods, and the slope represents the expected difference for each 1-cm increase in tape movement. The slope from this model was estimated to be 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86–1.11; P < 0.001), indicating that for each 1-cm increase in tape movement, the expected difference between methods of securement increased by 0.98 cm.

The absolute movement values were then dichotomized into clinically relevant thresholds (> 1 cm and > 4 cm). The rate of patients exceeding these thresholds was compared between the 2 ETT securing methods using the McNemar test for paired proportions. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).

### Methods for securing endotracheal tubes in newborn infants [^115mWW2w]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Securing the endotracheal tube is a common procedure in the neonatal intensive care unit. Adequate fixation of the tube is essential to ensure effective ventilation of the infant whilst minimising potential complications secondary to the intervention. Methods used to secure the endotracheal tube often vary between units and sometimes even between healthcare providers in the same nursery.

Objectives

To compare the different methods of securing the endotracheal tube in the ventilated neonate and their effects on the risk of accidental extubation and other potential complications that can result from an unstable endotracheal tube.

Search Methods

A literature search of MEDLINE (from 1966 to June 2013), CINAHL (from 1982 to June 2013) and CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library was conducted to identify relevant trials to be analysed.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of infants who were intubated for mechanical ventilation in a neonatal intensive care nursery where methods of stabilising the endotracheal tube were being compared.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were collected from individual studies to determine the methods being compared, the methodology of the trial, and whether there were areas of bias that could significantly affect the results of the studies. In particular, studies were assessed for blinding of randomisation and allocation, blinding of the intervention, completeness of follow up, blinding of outcome assessments and selective reporting.

Main Results

Five randomised controlled trials were identified and included for review. Accidental extubation was the most common outcome measured (five studies). None of the studies reported on the need for re-intubation or the rate of tube malposition, however one study did report on endotracheal tube slippage. A variety of other adverse effects were reported including mortality, incidence of perioral skin trauma and tube re-taping. All five studies were of poor methodological quality, small size, contained significant risks of bias and compared methods of securing the endotracheal tube that were too dissimilar for the data to be collated or included in a meta-analysis. We have not reported these further.

Authors' Conclusions

This review highlighted the need for further well designed and completed studies to be conducted for this common neonatal procedure. Evidence is lacking to determine the most effective and safe method to stabilise the endotracheal tube in the ventilated neonate.

### Extubation force depends upon angle of force application and fixation technique: a study of 7 methods [^1169iYwd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

It was hypothesized that forces required for ET tube displacement and extubation vary not only with method of fixation, but also with angle of force application. This study was designed to compare a given ET tube restraint to itself, over a series of angles, as well as compare different methods of ET tube restraint to one another. This study was designed to maintain consistency in test conditions and configuration across all methods of fixation and all angles by minimizing the number of variables controlled. Replication of clinical conditions such as body temperature and presence of saliva or perspiration would have introduced too many confounding factors for accurate comparisons across the methods and angles. By focusing on uniformity of fixator application and mannequin head position, this data set is suited to provide a starting point for ET tube restraint use and design optimization. Force values required for significant displacements, from different angles, can be combined with qualitative observations of failure modes to analyze performance of different tube fixation methods. This type of analysis can then be applied to the use of current techniques and devices as well as aid in the design of next generation ET tube restraints.

### Extubation force depends upon angle of force application and fixation technique: a study of 7 methods [^112feW78]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Forces required to displace an ET tube were measured at a series of discrete angles, encompassing nearly a full hemisphere, on the plane of the face. Angles were chosen to simulate possible extubation scenarios such as self-extubation, patient motion (neck flexion/extension, rolling), and equipment entanglement. All angles tested, along with possible clinical scenarios, are summarized in Figure 1. Three test pulls at each of the 13 angles (test points) were chosen for 2 reasons, material costs and statistical power. Initial testing performed by an independent lab on behalf of Securisyn Medical, LLC, revealed a sample size of 3 would provide enough data for comparisons to expose statistical significance where true differences in extubation force values were present.

Figure 1
Depiction and description of the thirteen different angles tested along with potential clinical scenarios that could generate the given force vectors.

Angles at each of the 13 test points were achieved and maintained using a custom fixture designed to interface with a load frame and is shown in Figure 2. All testing was performed on a Laerdal intubation mannequin (Difficult Airway Trainer, Model 485-261-00101). Seven methods of ET tube restraint were tested using 2 different ET tubes. Currently, the most widely used method is adhesive tape. For this study, the Lillehei method of applying adhesive tape was used to create a stabilization harness around the mannequin's head. This method was tested on a traditional, cuffed ET tube (Mallinckrodt Hi-Lo Oral/Nasal Endotracheal Tube, cuffed 7.5 mm) as well as on a new, pre-market, Securisyn ET tube designed for use with a new fixation device, the SolidAIRity® system (Securisyn Medical, LLC). Another common stabilization technique uses umbilical (non-adhesive) cotton twill tape tied into a clove hitch knot around the ET tube. Both aforementioned methods of fixation were tested using both types of ET tubes. Significant differences between the Mallinckrodt and Securisyn tubes, such as radius of curvature and surface features, prompted testing both types of tubes with traditional tape and twill methods as observed differences could provide insight into the effects of tube geometry on ET tube restraint performance.

### Removal of the endotracheal tube-2007 revision&update [^111zHfEa]. AARC (2007). Medium credibility.

Assessment of outcome after removal of the endotracheal tube — Removal of the endotracheal tube should be followed by adequate spontaneous ventilation through the natural airway, adequate oxygenation, and no need for re-intubation. Clinical outcome may be assessed by physical examination, auscultation, invasive and noninvasive measurements of gas exchange, and chest radiography. Quality of the procedure can be systematically assessed by monitoring extubation complications and the need for reintubation. The success of removal of the endotracheal tube can be monitored by examining the frequency of reintubation and frequency of complications. When a patient experiences an unplanned self-extubation and does not require reintubation, this suggests that planned extubation should have been considered earlier. Some patients may require postextubation support or intervention to maintain adequate gas exchange independent of controlled mechanical ventilation.

BACKGROUND:

Endotracheal tube security is a critical safety issue. We compared the mobility of an in situ endotracheal tube secured with adhesive tape to the one secured with a new commercially available purpose-designed endotracheal tube-holder device (Haider Tube-Guard ®). We also observed for the incidence of oropharyngeal or facial trauma associated with the 2 tube fixation methods.

METHODS:

Thirty adult patients undergoing general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade were prospectively enrolled. Immediately after intubation, a single study author positioned the endotracheal tube tip in the distal trachea using a bronchoscope. Anesthesiologists caring for patients secured the tube in their normal fashion (always with adhesive tape). A force transducer was used to apply linear force, increasing to 15 N or until the principal investigator deemed that the force be aborted for safety reasons. The displacement of the endotracheal tube was measured with the bronchoscope. Any tape was then removed and the endotracheal tube secured with the Haider Tube-Guard device. The linear force was reapplied and the displacement of the endotracheal tube measured. The Haider Tube-Guard device was left in place for the duration of the case. The patient's face and oropharynx were examined for any evidence of trauma during surgery and in the recovery room. On discharge from the postanesthesia care unit, the patient answered a brief survey assessing for any subjective evidence of minor facial or oropharyngeal trauma.

RESULTS:

Under standardized tension, the endotracheal tube withdrew a mean distance of 3.4 cm when secured with adhesive tape versus 0.3 cm when secured with the Haider Tube-Guard (P < 0.001). Ninety-seven percent of patients (29/30) experienced clinically significant endotracheal tube movement (> 1 cm) when adhesive tape was used to secure the tube versus 3% (1/30) when the Haider Tube-Guard was used (P < 0.001). Thirty percent of patients (9/30) were potentially deemed a high extubation risk (endotracheal tube movement > 4 cm) when the endotracheal tube was secured with tape versus 0% (0/30) when secured with the Haider Tube-Guard (P = 0.004). Six patients with taped endotracheal tubes required the traction to be aborted before 15 N of force was achieved to prevent potential extubation as the tape either separated from the face or stretched to allow excessive endotracheal tube movement. None of the patients appeared to sustain any injury from the Haider Tube-Guard device.

CONCLUSIONS:

The Haider Tube-Guard significantly reduced the mobility of the endotracheal tube when compared with adhesive tape and was well tolerated in our observations.

The goal of this study was to compare ETT mobility when securing the ETT with the Haider Tube-Guard versus adhesive tapes, our current standard of practice. We hypothesized that the Haider Tube-Guard would provide more secure ETT attachment in adults undergoing general endotracheal anesthesia when compared with tapes and adhesives. The primary objective of the study was to quantify the movement of the ETT caused by a standardized force of dislodgement, comparing the Haider Tube-Guard with adhesive tape. The secondary objective of the study was to determine whether the Haider Tube-Guard device was well tolerated during routine clinical use.

### Extubation force depends upon angle of force application and fixation technique: a study of 7 methods [^113apZ3G]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Traditional methods of ET tube fixation required similar extubation forces as commercially available devices with one exception. Generally speaking, the SolidAIRity® system requires the largest force to displace the tube. Interestingly, the highest recorded force value (240 N) was measured at test point 11 using the Securisyn tube and twill tape. This is likely due to the clove hitch knot being in an ideal position, with respect to the force vector, to maintain tension. Conversely, standard deviation's were higher for traditional methods when compared to devices, perhaps speaking to the ease of device use, application and repeatability with respect to things like bodily fluids and patient position.

Evaluating a fixation method across a series of angles provides a quantitative framework with which fixation techniques may be optimized and weaknesses identified. Standard deviation could be used as a measure of fixator reliability. For example, some methods, such as adhesive tape, twill tape and the Thomas™ tube holder, are difficult to secure the same way every time. It is easier to ensure consistency in a laboratory setting, so one may expect standard deviations to be higher in a clinical setting. Devices offer faster application, with less steps, leading to more reproducible application and arguably more reliability.

Figure 2.
Results summary. This graph highlights the study results. Every patient is represented by a number and plotted on the x-axis. Endotracheal tube (ETT) movement during applied traction is plotted for each patient on the y-axis in centimeters. Movement distance is denoted by blue diamonds during fixation with adhesive tape and red squares during fixation with the Haider Tube-Guard. Individual patients have both symbols shown because each patient served as his or her own control. Horizontal green lines highlight 2 clinically relevant categories: (1) > 1-cm ETT movement and (2) > 4 cm of ETT movement.

Ninety-seven percent of patients (29/30) experienced clinically significant ETT movement (> 1 cm) when adhesive tape was used to secure the tube versus 3% (1/30) when the Haider Tube-Guard was used (P < 0.001). Thirty percent of patients (9/30) experienced ETT movement > 4 cm (potential high extubation risk) when the ETT was secured with tape versus 0% (0/30) when secured with the Haider Tube-Guard (P = 0.004). Six patients required that traction be aborted before 15 N of force was achieved to prevent extubation because the tape either completely separated from the face or stretched enough to allow for significant ETT excursion. Three of these 6 patients had short facial hair, and despite significant efforts to tape and glue the ETT, in 2 cases, the tape disconnected under load. Five of the 6 patients with tape disconnects experienced ETT movement > 4 cm and were categorized into the high extubation risk group, whereas the sixth (who had a short mustache) was not because the ETT excursion was only 4.0 cm at the time the force was aborted. The details of the patients deemed potentially high extubation risk are summarized in Table 1.

### Endotracheal tube fixation methods for optimal stability: a comparison of adhesive tape, suture, and tape-suture fixation [^117Hj253]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Accidental extubation of an intubated patient is a serious consideration in the surgical patient. Adequate fixation in the intubated patient is essential to prevent potentially life-threatening complications. Several methods of endotracheal tube fixation have been described in the literature. In this study, we examine 3 common methods of fixation: adhesive tape alone, suture, and tape-suture. Testing occurred in a laboratory setting with 2 fresh cadavers. Endotracheal tubes were inserted, using the methods of fixation in question. We subjected each fixation technique to progressively increasing weight to determine which technique is most resistant to accidental removal. We found that fixation of the tube by combining tape around the tube with a suture through the tape is the best noninvasive technique of the 3 methods evaluated in cases where movement of the head is anticipated.

### A comparison of the haider tube-guard® endotracheal tube holder versus adhesive tape to determine if this novel device can reduce endotracheal tube movement and prevent unplanned extubation [^1169AGtH]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Endotracheal intubation is a common procedure performed in both the operating room and the intensive care unit. The inadvertent movement of the endotracheal tube (ETT) is potentially life-threatening. For this reason, the American Heart Association's 2005 Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines recommend securing the ETT with either a tape or a commercial device. In current clinical practice, there is wide variability of methods used to secure the ETT including (1) adhesive tape, (2) cloth tape ties, and (3) commercial ETT holders. Prior studies have demonstrated diverging expert opinions on the optimum method for securing an ETT. – The ideal method would minimize movement of the ETT, be quick and easy to apply, and have a low risk of injury to the oropharyngeal structures.

The Haider Tube-Guard ® is a new, commercially available device designed to optimally secure an ETT. The device is composed of a "clamshell"-like silicone body that wraps around and attaches onto the ETT via an adjustable, one-size-fits-all plastic clamp (Fig. 1 A). The device plus ETT combination rests between the upper and the lower teeth, using the immobility of the maxilla for rigid fixation of the ETT to the patient (Fig. 1 B). A Velcro neck strap (Posey foam/Velcro tie, Arcadia CA) is then attached for extra security. The Haider Tube-Guard device also incorporates a built-in soft bite block and, according to the company, is engineered to be gentle on the oropharyngeal and facial soft tissues during clinical use.

### Effectiveness of continuous endotracheal cuff pressure control for the prevention of ventilator-associated respiratory infections: an open-label randomized, controlled trial [^114st4Ss]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We report the largest pragmatic clinical trial to date evaluating the effectiveness of continuous CPC in preventing VARI. We found that continuous CPC did not result in a reduction or delay in VARI compared with intermittent CPC. Furthermore, we did not observe a difference in mortality, time on a ventilator, time in ICU, and antimicrobial use or costs nor did we see any difference in VAP, a more commonly used endpoint in other studies. Subgroup analysis did not identify groups where there was a benefit from the intervention. No adjustment was made for multiplicity of testing so results of secondary, safety, and exploratory analyses should be interpreted with this caveat.

Our intervention appeared effective in producing CPC consistently within the target range in the continuous group compared to the intermittent group and overall period prevalence for VAP (17%) was similar to results of a meta-analysis for lower middle-income (13.3%) and upper middle-income countries (15.4%), with similar microbiology.

Reasons for differences in our results compared to previous studies may lie in differences between study designs and contexts. Our study was designed as a pragmatic study in LMIC ICUs and therefore aimed to evaluate the intervention against the standard of care. As a result, we did not fully standardize infection control procedures, VARI prevention bundles, clinical management or equipment across sites. Spontaneous breathing trials are not routine in our hospital sites and furthermore are contraindicated in those with tetanus. Although head of bed elevation is routine in our study sites, a formal randomized controlled trial at our sites failed to show efficacy in VAP prevention. Subgroup analysis by site did not show significant differences in primary outcomes and our study design should reduce differences between intervention groups, however it remains possible that allocations may have influenced routine practice.

Of potential importance, we used locally manufactured endotracheal tubes, which may be subject to structural irregularities and reliability issues not encountered in previous studies as tracheal sealing quality may vary by brand, size, and material. This may reflect genuine product quality issues or may reflect changes in pressure within the system occurring as a result of connecting a hand-held manometer. It is also possible that our choice of CPC device was important, as it has been suggested that rapid pressure correction with electronic versus pneumatic control devices may interfere with self-sealing processes.

### Effects of saline submersion at body temperature on airway supportive devices including a novel nasopharyngeal device produced using 3D-printing [^1162TjvY]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study investigated dimension changes of various nasopharyngeal airways, including a novel self-supporting device, after saline submersion at body temperature to simulate in-vivo use. Dimension changes over time may reduce efficacy during long-term use and require sizing adjustments or limits on duration of use.

Materials and Methods

Cuffless Covidien endotracheal tubes, pediatric Rusch fixed flange polyvinyl chloride nasal airway tubes, pediatric Rusch Robertazzi style Mediprene nasal airway tubes, and novel silicone elastomer self-supporting nasopharyngeal airways were fully submerged in 0.9% normal saline solution incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 15 days. All devices had tube length and wall thickness measured after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 15 days. The 95% confidence intervals of tube dimensions at each date were compared with the 95% confidence intervals at day 0.

Results

The Covidien ET tube, Rusch PVC NPA, and ssNPA tube lengths and wall thicknesses did not change significantly over 15 days. The Rusch Mediprene NPAs had a statistically significant increase in length starting at day 1 and wall thickness at day 2.

Conclusions

The novel ssNPA did not expand in the in-vitro environment, supporting its safety for extended use. The PVC NPA and ET tube dimensions also remained stable. However, the Rusch Mediprene NPAs had significant length expansion after 1 day of submersion, indicating a considerable risk of expansion during extended use with potential implications for patient care. Silicone and PVC NPA dimensions remained stable when saturated, indicating these materials may be more appropriate for extended use.

### A comparison of the haider tube-guard® endotracheal tube holder versus adhesive tape to determine if this novel device can reduce endotracheal tube movement and prevent unplanned extubation [^115v5ii3]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

METHODS

After approval by our institutional review board and obtaining written informed consent, 30 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and neuromuscular blockade were prospectively enrolled in this study. The trial was registered with the clinicatrials.gov registry (NCT02347488; PI: Nir N. Hoftman, January 8, 2015). A careful history and physical examination were performed preoperatively; patients with loose or missing teeth, temporomandibular joint disease, severe asthma, and immunosuppression and patients undergoing surgery of the oropharynx or surgery who required the prone position were excluded from the trial.

Immediately after endotracheal intubation with a standard adult (6.5–8.0 mm ID) ETT (Mallinckrodt™; Covidien, Mansfield, OH), a single-study author with > 10 years' experience in thoracic anesthesia positioned the ETT tip in the distal one-third of the trachea using a bronchoscope. The exact distance from the carina to the ETT tip was measured and recorded, and the ETT was then secured at the discretion of the anesthesiologist caring for the patient. A force transducer (IWS V2-30, Jennings, Vancouver, BC, Canada) accurate to within 0.1 N was then attached to the ETT assembly and linear force applied parallel to the ETT such that it would pull the tube from the trachea if the tube was not adequately secured. While securing the head in a neutral position to prevent unwanted movement, we increased the force over approximately 5 seconds until the target of 15 N was reached or until the principal investigator deemed that the force be aborted to prevent possible tracheal extubation. Based on our previous mannequin testing, we selected a 15-N force because it could reliably displace inadequately secured ETTs. This force was at least an order of magnitude less than that generated during routine mastication and less than half the force routinely used during the application of cricoid pressure. We thus thought that this force would be safe in all patients, but as a precaution, we excluded any patients with actual or perceived loose teeth or any temporomandibular joint pain or disease. The change in ETT tip position caused by this force was then measured with the indwelling bronchoscope, rounded up to the nearest 5 mm, and recorded. After removal of the adhesive tape, the ETT was repositioned in the distal trachea, and the Haider Tube-Guard device was inserted and used to secure the ETT as recommended by the manufacturer. The linear force was reapplied as before, and the change in ETT tip position caused by the force was recorded. Linear force was aborted at the discretion of the investigators if tracheal extubation was deemed likely to occur without intervention. In such cases, the greatest achievable force was recorded along with the ETT displacement distance at the time of force abort. The bronchoscope was then removed and the Haider Tube-Guard device left in place for the duration of the case. Any conditions that would interfere with tape adhesion such as facial hair, sweating, and oily or flaky skin were documented. During the intraoperative portion as well as at admission and discharge from the postanesthesia care unit, an anesthesiologist who was part of the study team thoroughly examined the patient's face and oropharynx for any evidence of minor tissue trauma. On discharge from the postanesthesia care unit, the patient also answered a brief survey assessing any subjective evidence of minor facial or oropharyngeal tissue trauma.

### Modifying endotracheal tubes to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia [^115T2LTU]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The endotracheal tube (ETT) is the main avenue leading to airway contamination and subsequent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) during mechanical ventilation. A number of modifications to the ETT are available, aimed at reducing the incidence of VAP. We review here available systems and devices, and clinical data regarding their efficacy.

Recent Findings

Three main modifications of ETTs have been developed: coating with antimicrobials, adding a suction channel for the removal of oro-pharyngeal secretions, and modifying the design of the cuff. Each of these interventions has been shown to limit bacterial colonization of the distal airways and to decrease the incidence of VAP. Data on their ultimate effect on related clinical outcomes are still lacking.

Summary

Modifications of ETTs aimed at decreasing the onset of VAP show promising results. However, the lack of a significant effect on outcomes prompts us to use caution before recommending their widespread use.

### The effect of adhesive tape versus endotracheal tube fastener in critically ill adults: the endotracheal tube securement (ETTS) randomized controlled trial [^114tZFen]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics

Of 500 patients randomized, 162 were deemed excluded from the analysis due to the duration of mechanical ventilation less than 24 h and 40 had missing outcome data, leaving 298 in the analysis. One hundred fifty-three were randomized to the tube fastener and 145 were randomized to adhesive tape (Fig. 1). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the patients assigned to receive tube fastener and those assigned to receive adhesive tape (Table 1). The most common indication for intubation among both groups was respiratory failure (45.7% versus 53.1%, respectively). Total ventilation time for all 153 patients in the tube fastener group was 590 days (mean duration 3.9 ± 3.0 days) compared to 570 days for the 145 patients in the tape group (mean duration 3.9 ± 3.4 days) (p = 0.75).

### The effect of adhesive tape versus endotracheal tube fastener in critically ill adults: the endotracheal tube securement (ETTS) randomized controlled trial [^115i9Sns]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The trial has limitations. Conduct at a single academic center limits generalizability. For obvious reasons, the trial was open-label and not blinded, with investigators and clinical personnel aware of the allocation group. However, endpoints were objective and strictly defined, thus limiting the subjectivity of the evaluation. In addition, the composite outcomes of the primary endpoint were independently confirmed by either the quality nurse associate or study personnel. Despite this, it remains possible that some events (skin tears, lip ulcers, ETT dislodgement) may have gone undocumented by the bedside nurse or respiratory therapist and missed by the independent quality nurse associate or study personnel adjudicators. While the securement device may have obscured some lip ulcers or skin tears while it was being used, all patients were assessed for these complications both daily and when the securement device was ultimately removed. Finally, while the overall follow-up was excellent, the pragmatic nature resulted in 40 randomized patients being excluded due to missing primary outcome data. This 0.8% loss to follow-up rate was considerably less than anticipated when calculating the sample size needed to power the study and is unlikely to have significantly altered the results. The composite endpoint would have needed to occur in almost 20% of the 16 patients randomized to tube fastener with missing envelopes, a rate almost three times higher than that occurred in the other patients enrolled in the tube fastener arm of the study.

This trial also has several strengths. It is the first large, pragmatic, randomized trial of different endotracheal tube securement techniques focusing on the complications throughout the duration of mechanical ventilation and clinical outcomes during the ICU stay. The trial was led by an advanced practice provider and run by respiratory therapists. The pragmatic nature of the trial allows for the enrollment of a heterogeneous population of consecutive critically ill patients, and the pragmatic design, without artificially regulating routine endotracheal tube position changes, reflects actual clinical practice, rendering the results more generalizable to the care of critically ill patients in general.

### Extubation force depends upon angle of force application and fixation technique: a study of 7 methods [^113d5JP7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Failure modes

Each method of fixation had a unique failure mode. For the purpose of this discussion, failure is defined as either failure of fixator integrity or failure of the fixation technique to prevent 5 cm of ET tube displacement. The SolidAIRity® system failed by either the tube ribs slipping through the stabilizer ribs or due to fracture of the stabilization device. Thomas™ tube holders would allow tubes to slip to the side of the clamp while Anchor Fast devices consistently failed at the attachment point of the sliding member to the bar, either by fracture of the clips or sliding off of the bar. Adhesive tape tore either between the cheek and tube or at the tube-tape interface while the knot used for twill tape fixation tended to loose tension.

Failure analysis serves to aid in evaluating the underlying mechanics of each method. Understanding failure modes may assist in determining which method of fixation may be most effective in a particular patient care setting. A summary of the failure modes is provided in Table 4.

Table 4
Observed failure modes for all methods of fixation

Description of failure modes for all methods of ET tube fixation.

It should also be noted that the devices (as opposed to tradition tape and twill methods) tended to provoke occlusion events prior to extubation at the more extreme test angles (test points 10 and 13). For example, when forces were applied laterally, rigid forms of stabilization (devices) caused the tube to bend and occlude while traditional methods were observed to undergo larger lateral deviaitons. Due to the nature of fixation being more of a point on the tube rather than immobilization of a segment of the tube, traditional methods allow for rotation while, at extreme angles of force application, devices do not.

### A secure method of nasotracheal tube fixation using an infant feeding tube [^114oQBiC]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

A well secured endotracheal tube is very essential for the safe conduct of anesthesia. In maxillofacial surgeries, providing secure fixation of the nasotracheal tube has always been a problem. We have used an infant feeding tube that goes around the nasal septum for the fixation of the nasal endotracheal tube. This method of securing the nasotracheal tube does not hinder the surgical access, is well tolerated by patients, and is safe.

### Quality improvement project to reduce unplanned extubations in a paediatric intensive care unit [^113b17wU]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Methods

This is a quality improvement project that uses the Improvement Model methodology of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to test and implement change strategies. It was conducted in a PICU of a private hospital with a quaternary level with approximately 3000 hospitalisations/year. All patients admitted to the PICU who used invasive mechanical ventilation between October 2018 and August 2019 were included, and any UE was UE, regardless of the need for reintubation. Tracheostomised patients were excluded from the study.

The UE was defined as any unexpected or UE due to patient agitation or patient handling by the team.

Formulation of the multidisciplinary team

We formed a multidisciplinary team composed of nurses, nursing technicians, physical therapist, physicians and specialists in quality and health economics. The project team identified which causes were related to the increase in UE in the PICU through the fishbone diagram (online supplemental figure), then reviewed the current process and opportunities for improvement, identified key processes where changes were needed and created a guiding diagram (figure 1), with the main ideas for change being innovation in the endotracheal tube fixation model, evaluation of endotracheal tube positioning, good practices of physical restraint, sedation monitoring, family education and engagement and checklist for prevention of UE.

Guiding diagram with the main change ideas named the primary drivers and the change ideas describing the actions that were tested. ICU, intensive care unit.

Interventions

The main interventions (ideas for change) that were implemented after the tests (Plan–Do–Study–Act, PDSA) are described below.

Innovation in the endotracheal tube fixation model

Initially, a search was made in the market for new endotracheal tube fixation devices available that did not present effective fixation alternatives for the paediatric population.

We then introduced a new orotracheal endotracheal tube fixation technique with Tensoplast (no latex free) following the model of the Rainbow Babies and Children Hospital, replacing the 'H fixation' method (online supplemental figure), which reduced the detachment of the endotracheal tube fixation, increased the fixation durability on average from 24 hours to 7 days and reduced the number of fixation changes. The idea of the new fixation model was approved in the tests and adopted, and the entire physical therapist and nursing team was trained to perform the new fixation method (online supplemental figure).

For patients transferred from other services, the fixation was changed as soon as the patient was admitted to the unit.

### Repositioning for preventing pressure injuries [^113nXBhu]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Medical devices — remove any lines or devices that are no longer required; avoid positioning the individual on medical devices, where possible; relocate medical devices away from pressure loading surfaces if possible, for example place electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG) leads on the individual's back and rotate clamps/locks on tubing so they are not underneath the individual; use medical devices according to manufacturer's instructions, for example some ET fixation devices are not approved for use in the prone position; note that ET tube securement devices may create additional pressure in prone position and consider taping ET tube in place rather than using a securement device designed for safety in supine position; consider repositioning the ET tube from side-side and validate the insertion depth is maintained when repositioning the ET tube; secure tubes and devices away from the skin, regularly evaluate and manage tubes and other medical devices and consider using preventive dressings under devices.

### Shifts in endotracheal tube position due to chest compressions: a simulation comparison by fixation method [^116gvHc8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Endotracheal tube placement during resuscitation is important for definite tracheal protection. Accidental extubation due to endotracheal tube displacement is a rare event that can result in severe complications.

Objective

This study evaluated how endotracheal tube displacement is affected by tape vs. tube holder fixation using a manikin and auto-chest compression machine simulation.

Methods

The endotracheal tube was placed in either a shallow or a deep position, with the tube cuff at the center of the glottis or 26 cm from the incisors in an advanced lifesaving simulator. Trials were performed five times in each setting with: no fixation; Durapore® tape fixation; Multipore® tape fixation; and Thomas tube holder® fixation. After 10 min of automated chest compressions, endotracheal tube shift was measured. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way repeated analysis of variance or χ² test, with p < 0.05 considered significant.

Results

In the shallow setting, endotracheal tube extubation occurred in all trials with no fixation, Durapore, and Multipore. In contrast, no extubation occurred in the Tube holder trials (p < 0.05). In the deep setting, no extubation was confirmed in any trial. Relative to no fixation (0.56 ± 0.11 cm), endotracheal tube shift was significantly less in the Durapore tape, Multipore tape, and Tube holder groups (p < 0.05). Of the three fixation methods, Tube holder (0.04 ± 0.05 cm) showed significantly less shift (p < 0.05) relative to Durapore (0.28 ± 0.04 cm) and Multipore (0.32 ± 0.08 cm).

Conclusion

Endotracheal tube displacement occurs less with Tube holder fixation than with Durapore tape or Multipore tape during simulation of continuous chest compressions.

### Extubation force depends upon angle of force application and fixation technique: a study of 7 methods [^11577Evz]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Photograph of intubation mannequin in the test fixture/load frame assembly. Setup corresponds to test point 7.

Common methods of ET tube fixation, such as adhesive tape or twill, can be cumbersome and time consuming to apply. Also, adhesive tape can lead to skin irritation and damage. Bodily fluids are present in critical care and emergent situation leading to difficulty when trying to use the more common, traditional methods of tube fixation. Commercially available fixation devices aim to reduce time associated with ET tube restraint application and maintenance while increasing repeatability and reliability of fixator installation and performance. Thomas™ tube holders and Anchor Fast (Hollister) devices were both tested using Mallinckrodt ET tubes while the SolidAIRity® system was tested using Securisyn tubes. All devices were placed on the mannequin according to manufacturer's instructions. Forces were measured using a 2 kN load cell (MTS Model #569327–08) in an MTS 5 kN load frame and rubber-faced clamp grip (MTS Part # 121–001). Once secured in the grip, ET tubes were displaced vertically at a rate of 7.62 cm/min (3 in/min). Force values were manually recorded at 2 cm and 5 cm displacement or device failure. Displacement was determined by observing markings made on the ET tube relative to the mannequin's lower incisors. Markings were made on the tube by first marking the initial placement level (18 cm) as measured along the length of the tube from the distal end. Next, marks were made at 16 cm and 13 cm, representing 2 cm and 5 cm displacement respectively. Both tubes and all fixation methods are pictured in Figure 3.

Figure 3
Endotracheal tubes and restraints used to create 7 different fixation combinations.

Stabilization devices and tape lengths were controlled by measuring and marking tensioning devices and tape lengths. All ET tubes and stabilizers were marked and placed by a single investigator using a laryngoscope (Welch Allyn 69504). All measurements were observed and recorded by a single operator. After placement, all ET tube cuffs were inflated with 15 cc of air using a 20 cc syringe. New tubes and devices were used for every pull test. A total of 3 pulls were performed, using each stabilization technique, at each angle. To ensure positioning consistency, the test fixture was set into position for a given test point then remained undisturbed until all pulls, for all methods, were completed.

### Endotracheal tube fixation time: a comparison of three fixation methods in a military field scenario [^111Lh3HF]. BMJ Military Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Endotracheal intubation is required in many emergency, trauma and prehospital scenarios. Endotracheal tube (ETT) fixation must be stable and quick to apply to enable rapid evacuation and patient transport. This study compares performance times of three common ETT securement techniques which are practical for out-of-hospital and combat scenarios.

Methods

We compared the time required by military medics to complete ETT fixation in three techniques-fixation of a wide gauze roll wrapped twice around the head and tied twice around the ETT (GR), using a Thomas Tube Holder (TH) and using a pre-tied non-adhesive tape (PT). 300 military medics were randomised to apply one technique each on a manikin, and time to completion was recorded.

Results

300 ETTs were successfully fixated by 300 military medics. Median times to complete ETT fixation by PT and TH techniques were 24s (IQR (19 to 31) and (IQR 20 to 33), respectively). Both were significantly shorter to apply than the GR technique, with a median time of 57s (IQR 47 to 81), p < 0.001.

Conclusions

In time critical situations such as combat, severe trauma, mass casualties and whenever rapid evacuation might improve the clinical outcome, using a faster fixation technique such as Thomas Tube Holder or a pre-tied non-adhesive tape might enable faster evacuation than the use of traditional endotracheal tube fixation techniques.

### Removal of the endotracheal tube-2007 revision&update [^1171snoC]. AARC (2007). Medium credibility.

AARC Clinical Practice Guideline — indications, environment, and special situations specify that when the airway control afforded by the endotracheal tube is deemed to be no longer necessary for the continued care of the patient, the tube should be removed, and the endotracheal tube should be removed in an environment where the patient can be physiologically monitored and emergency equipment and providers with airway management skills are immediately available; to maximize successful extubation the patient should be capable of maintaining a patent airway and generating adequate spontaneous ventilation, generally with adequate central inspiratory drive, respiratory muscle strength, cough strength to clear secretions, laryngeal function, nutritional status, and clearance of sedative and neuromuscular blocking effects; acute airway obstruction of the artificial airway due to mucus or mechanical deformation mandates immediate removal, with reintubation or other appropriate techniques (ie, surgical airway management) used to maintain effective gas exchange, and patients with an explicit declaration of futility may have the endotracheal tube removed despite failure to meet the above indications.

### Continuous control of endotracheal cuff pressure and tracheal wall damage: a randomized controlled animal study [^116vNWP2]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Device for control of endotracheal cuff pressure

The Nosten ® device (Leved, St-Maur, France) is amechanical appliance that does not require a power supply (Figure 1). Asterile single-use 200 mL cylindrical cuff encased in arigid compartment is connected to the endotracheal cuff with plastic tubing (internal diameter 3 mm, length 2 m). Aweight mounted on an articulated arm constantly exerts pressure on this cuff. This pressure can be adjusted by moving another weight along the arm to modulate the corresponding force, allowing the user to obtain the desired cuff pressure. Any variation is immediately cancelled out by the disproportion between the volumes of the two cuffs. The device provides effective continuous control of endotracheal cuff pressure in mechanically ventilated ICU patients.

### A soft robotic device for rapid and self-guided intubation [^116RE7UN]. Science Translational Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Endotracheal intubation is a critical medical procedure for protecting a patient's airway. Current intubation technology requires extensive anatomical knowledge, training, technical skill, and a clear view of the glottic opening. However, all of these may be limited during emergency care for trauma and cardiac arrest outside the hospital, where first-pass failure is nearly 35%. To address this challenge, we designed a soft robotic device to autonomously guide a breathing tube into the trachea with the goal of allowing rapid, repeatable, and safe intubation without the need for extensive training, skill, anatomical knowledge, or a glottic view. During initial device testing with highly trained users in a mannequin and a cadaver, we found a 100% success rate and an average intubation duration of under 8 s. We then conducted a preliminary study comparing the device with video laryngoscopy, in which prehospital medical providers with 5 min of device training intubated cadavers. When using the device, users achieved an 87% first-pass success rate and a 96% overall success rate, requiring an average of 1.1 attempts and 21 s for successful intubation, significantly (P = 0.008) faster than with video laryngoscopy. When using video laryngoscopy, the users achieved a 63% first-pass success rate and a 92% overall success rate, requiring an average of 1.6 attempts and 44 s for successful intubation. This preliminary study offers directions for future clinical studies, the next step in testing a device that could address the critical needs of emergency airway management and help democratize intubation.

### The effect of adhesive tape versus endotracheal tube fastener in critically ill adults: the endotracheal tube securement (ETTS) randomized controlled trial [^111KwXd3]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There are many potential complications during endotracheal tube intubation, including laryngeal trauma, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypoxemia, airway perforation, and vertebral column injury. Following intubation for mechanical ventilation, other potential complications may occur, including the development of lip ulcers or skin tears, endotracheal tube dislodgement or advancement, or endotracheal tube plugging or malfunction. Several techniques are utilized in current clinical practice to secure the endotracheal tube, in order to maintain a patent airway and prevent complications. Lip ulcers and facial skin tears are infrequent complications of endotracheal tube securement, but each is associated with increased financial burden and potentially increased length of stay. As hospital-acquired pressure injuries, treatment of these complications is not reimbursed. Endotracheal tube dislodgement sometimes resulting in unplanned extubation, bronchospasm, or tracheal injury is another more common complication of suboptimal tube securement. Additionally, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Proper oral hygiene is essential in decreasing the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Utilizing an endotracheal tube securement technique that enables providers to perform oral hygiene is imperative. Different endotracheal tube securement techniques may have different effects on these complications.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of endotracheal tube securement techniques, we performed a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of adhesive tape versus endotracheal tube fastener on complications including lip ulcers, facial skin tears, endotracheal tube dislodgement, and ventilator-associated pneumonia among critically ill adults requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation for at least 24 h.

### The effect of adhesive tape versus endotracheal tube fastener in critically ill adults: the endotracheal tube securement (ETTS) randomized controlled trial [^117JtRmM]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal securement method of endotracheal tubes is unknown but should prevent dislodgement while minimizing complications. The use of an endotracheal tube fastener might reduce complications among critically ill adults undergoing endotracheal intubation.

Methods

In this pragmatic, single-center, randomized trial, critically ill adults admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and expected to require invasive mechanical ventilation for greater than 24h were randomized to adhesive tape or endotracheal tube fastener at the time of intubation. The primary endpoint was a composite of any of the following: presence of lip ulcer, endotracheal tube dislodgement (defined as moving at least 2cm), ventilator-associated pneumonia, or facial skin tears anytime between randomization and the earlier of death or 48h after extubation. Secondary endpoints included duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU and in-hospital mortality.

Results

Of 500 patients randomized over a 12-month period, 162 had a duration of mechanical ventilation less than 24h and 40 had missing outcome data, leaving 153 evaluable patients randomized to tube fastener and 145 evaluable patients randomized to adhesive tape. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. The primary endpoint occurred 13 times in 12 (7.8%) patients in the tube fastener group and 30 times in 25 (17.2%) patients in the adhesive tape group (p = 0.014) for an overall incidence of 22.0 versus 52.6 per 1000 ventilator days, respectively (p = 0.020). Lip ulcers occurred in 4 (2.6%) versus 11 (7.3%) patients, or an incidence rate of 6.5 versus 19.5 per 1000 patient ventilator days (p = 0.053) in the fastener and tape groups, respectively. The endotracheal tube was dislodged 7 times in 6 (3.9%) patients in the tube fastener group and 16 times in 15 (10.3%) patients in the tape group (p = 0.03), reflecting incidences of 11.9 and 28.1 per 1000 ventilator days, respectively. Facial skin tears were similar between the groups. Mechanical ventilation duration and ICU and hospital mortality did not differ.

Conclusion

The use of the endotracheal tube fastener to secure the endotracheal tubes reduces the rate of a composite outcome that included lip ulcers, facial skin tears, or endotracheal tube dislodgement compared to adhesive tape.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome measure was a composite of any of the following: development of lip ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia, endotracheal tube dislodgement, or facial skin tears from the time of randomization to the earlier of death or 48 h after extubation. Secondary outcome measures included each of the individual components of the primary composite outcome (i.e. presence of lip ulcer, endotracheal tube dislodgement, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or facial skin tears), duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU and hospital mortality.

Statistical analysis

Sample size determination

We estimated the expected incidences of tube dislodgement and lip ulcer development to be 20 and 1.1 per 1000 ventilator days, respectively, based on the data from the previous 12 months. Using the sum of these overall incidences (i.e. 21.1 per 1000 ventilator days) and a standard deviation of 15 per 1000 ventilator days, PS software calculated a need for 142 evaluable patients in each arm to detect a clinically meaningful change of 5 episodes per 1000 ventilator days with 80% power at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. To account for the loss of patients not ventilated for 24 h and a 5.6% dropout or loss to follow-up rate, we planned to enroll 500 patients to achieve the 284 eligible patients needed for the study.

Analysis principles

The primary analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis (patients with protocol violations were analyzed per the assigned treatment arm). All hypothesis tests were two-sided, with an α of 0.05 unless otherwise specified. The primary endpoint was the continuous variable of incidences of lip ulcers, tube dislodgement, or ventilator-associated pneumonia per 1000 ventilator days. The differences between the two groups were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. We conducted an unadjusted analysis examining the treatment effect of endotracheal tube securement method on each of the pre-specified secondary and tertiary outcomes. Continuous outcomes were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test and categorical variables with the chi-square or Fisher exact test as appropriate. Due to the differences in age in baseline demographics, a post hoc ordinal regression was undertaken with age and randomization group as independent variables and rate of composite endpoint per 1000 ventilator days as the dependent variable. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0. Armonk, NY).

### A comparison of the haider tube-guard® endotracheal tube holder versus adhesive tape to determine if this novel device can reduce endotracheal tube movement and prevent unplanned extubation [^113xEeoY]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

This clinical study had several methodological advantages when compared with previous ETT-holding device trials. We conducted the trial in the operating room on patients undergoing surgery with each patient serving as his or her own control for a true comparison of the Haider Tube-Guard versus adhesive tape. Many previous studies were performed on human cadavers or plastic simulation mannequins, limiting the generalizability of the results. – Also, our protocol used bronchoscopy to measure the distance between the ETT tip and the carina, thus defining the actual ETT movement within the airway. Other studies used only indirect surrogates of ETT airway movement such as distance from the incisor or lip. Finally, all patients in the study received neuromuscular blockade during data collection to eliminate any baseline intrinsic jaw muscle tone, ensuring that only the device's inherent grip was being measured.

Our study did have several limitations that should be noted. First, we introduced the force in a crescendo pattern, building to maximal force over about 5 seconds, and then held the force during bronchoscopy measurements. This was necessary to allow for accurate distance measurements and also to ensure patient safety by carefully controlling the force. Such prolonged forces may not represent all forces encountered clinically, some of which may be fast, jerking motions. Second, we applied the force in the same linear direction in all patients, whereas real-life forces encountered in clinical medicine may be multidirectional and rapidly changing. Third, we excluded edentulous patients or patients with loose teeth from the study. Further studies should be performed to assess the Haider Tube-Guard device in patients with poor dentition because this could possibly lead to reduced device grip. Fourth, our study was not blinded to the treatment group, but given the nature of the device, we thought that blinding would not be possible. Furthermore, constant observation of the ETT–face interface was required during application of force to ensure safety, making blinding impossible. Finally, although our study demonstrated that the Haider Tube-Guard was well tolerated, it was not statistically powered to determine device safety.

In conclusion, the Haider Tube-Guard was superior to adhesive tape in securing the ETT. The device significantly reduced ETT movement and may prevent unplanned patient extubation. Larger studies would need to be conducted to demonstrate utility in diverse clinical settings and to establish a patient safety record.

### A comparison of the haider tube-guard® endotracheal tube holder versus adhesive tape to determine if this novel device can reduce endotracheal tube movement and prevent unplanned extubation [^113xHwoJ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Nearly one-third (n = 9) of the study population experienced ETT movement > 4 cm when adhesive tape was used to affix the ETT and could have been highly vulnerable to extubation under normal, uncontrolled circumstances. In a tenth patient (with a mustache), whose force was aborted at 4 cm, ETT movement because of tape disconnect could have been included in the high extubation risk category; we chose not to include this patient to stay true to our original definition in the protocol. In all 10 of these patients, securing the ETT with the Haider Tube-Guard mitigated this extubation vulnerability by eliminating excessive ETT movement. Our definition of high extubation risk (movement > 4 cm) was quite conservative, and the actual population at risk in this study may have been higher. – Reported rates of unintentional extubation range from 0.03% to 2.5% depending on the clinical setting. – Undeniably, unintentional extubation can lead to increased patient morbidity and even mortality. – In fact, 12% of all airway cases in the anesthesia closed claims analysis were caused by unintentional extubation. Several commercial devices have been introduced into clinical practice over the years with the aim of mitigating this risk. Clinical trials comparing various commercial ETT holders to traditional adhesive tape have shown mixed results; traditional tape was found to be superior to these devices in some but not all trials. – These findings, combined with the perceived extra cost of the commercial devices, have slowed their adoption into clinical practice. The Haider Tube-Guard's superior and unequivocal performance versus traditional tape may indicate improved design compared with other available commercial devices, although head-to-head testing should be performed to determine any such benefit. The Haider Tube-Guard may prove beneficial in clinical settings prone to ETT motion including (1) emergency transport (civilian and military) of trauma patients, (2) prone and lateral positioning, and (3) extensive head and neck surgery. Blood, sweating, oral and facial secretions, and burns can make securing the ETT in these cases even more challenging, and further studies using the Haider Tube-Guard in such scenarios are warranted.

### Extubation force depends upon angle of force application and fixation technique: a study of 7 methods [^112GkTro]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Also, a high force value for displacement is not the sole indication of an effective method. For example, the highest force value recorded using twill tape and a Securisyn tube prevented displacement, but the knot had so much tension that the tube was occluded, preventing air flow. Body mechanics also play a role in the force values. For example, motion of the mandible in response to a certain device may induce large displacements relative to the incisors, but not to the vocal cords. Motion of the mandible can absorb rotations and displacements, as well as shift locations of fulcrums, resulting in variations of fixator performance not only across angle of force application, but when compared to other methods in similar loading conditions.

Comparison between methods offers insight into the mechanics of ET tube fixation. Using adhesive tape and the Lillehei method, the tube is allowed to rotate in all axes about the point of tape application while the SolidAIRity® system secures the tube along a length of approximately 3.81 cm (1.5 in), allowing tube rotation only about the long axis of the tube. This fundamental difference in design translates into differences in force, and moment, distributions and ultimately measured force values for a given displacement. Specifically, at test points 3 and 5, 2 cm of motion was observed at a relatively lower force value for the SolidAIRity® system due to the fact that the entire device had to rotate about the mouth. After initial displacements and rotations it took much more force, relative to other test points, to displace the tube 5 cm. Conversely, at test points 3 and 5, using the Lillehei method with adhesive tape required an unremarkable force to reach 2 cm displacement but a relatively low force for 5 cm displacement due to the fact that the tape was seeing stresses at approximately 45°, producing maximum shear stress values resulting in tape failure.

Table 1 presents mean force values and standard deviations for all methods of fixation at each test point, as well as an average of test point means for each method. Generally speaking, traditional methods of securing the tube required similar forces for displacing the tube as the commercially available devices, with exception of the SolidAIRity® system. For clinically significant displacement (2 cm) adhesive and twill tape methods required approximately 82 N while the SolidAIRity®, Thomas™ and Anchor Fast systems required 165 N, 67 N and 74 N respectively. Force values at each angle provide insight into strengths and weakness of each method's unique mechanics, further addressed in the discussion section.

*Indicates fixator failed before 2 cm displacement was reached.

It is interesting to note the Lillehei method of taping the tube failed before 2 cm displacement at test points 10–13, using the Mallinckrodt tube, and test points 10–12 using the Securisyn tube. This means that the tape tore before the tube underwent significant displacement. From this data, it can be reasoned that adhesive tape is particularly effective at limiting tube motion against forces in the lateral direction, given force are below a certain threshold of around 60–100 N (see Table 1).

### Extubation force: tape versus endotracheal tube holders [^111U2YCA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Tape is the standard method for securing endotracheal tubes to prevent extubation. This study examines the force required to extubate endotracheal tubes from cadavers with either tape or one of 4 commercially available endotracheal tube holders.

Methods

Newly deceased, unembalmed cadavers were intubated with standard tracheal intubation techniques. The endotracheal tube was secured with either tape or one of 4 commercially available endotracheal tube holders. The endotracheal tube was then connected to a force-measuring device and pulled until the cuff was removed from the trachea. The largest force recorded on the device was then marked as the "extubation force" for that trial.

Results

When tape was used to secure the endotracheal tube, it required a significantly larger force to extubate than 3 of 4 off-the-shelf endotracheal tube holders. Only the Thomas Tube Holder secured the endotracheal tube better than tape.

Conclusion

Although the Thomas Tube Holder had the greatest holding force in this study, tape was shown to be the least expensive and outperformed 3 other commercially available devices used to secure endotracheal tubes.

### NCT06848010 | TRacheal cuff PRessure evaluation study… [^113p33Zh]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Randomized clinical trial in mechanically ventilate critically ill patients. The study will evaluated the efficacy of a continous endotracheal tube cuff pressure controller compared to manual monitoring and inflation. Patients intubated, from at least 24 hours and with a predicted duration of invasive mechanical ventilation longer than 72 hours, will be randomized to the use of TRACH FLUSH versus nurse operated analogic cuff pressure controller q8. Endotracheal intubation is an effective method of providing rapid and safe airway patency and respiratory support in the intensive care unit. Endotracheal intubation effectively isolates the trachea by inflating the endotracheal tube cuff just below the vocal cords: this ensures airway patency and positive pressure ventilation. The pressure of the endotracheal tube cuff should be between 20–30 cmH2O to ensure airway isolation.

The literature reports that overinflation of the endotracheal cuff causes hoarseness, sore throat, inadequate swallowing of secretions, tracheal stenosis, tracheal wall damage, and ischemia due to decreased mucosal capillary blood flow: these changes can occur even if a high Pcuff is maintained for a short period of time. In contrast, inadequate inflation results in ventilation-associated pneumonia due to ineffective ventilation and microaspiration of gastric and/or oropharyngeal secretions into the lungs. Risk factors for microaspiration include patient-related factors, factors related to endotracheal tube type, performance of invasive procedures such as enteral nutrition through a nasogastric or orogastric tube, and mechanical ventilation.

The methods found in ICUs to control Pcuff and keep it within safe ranges are about a dozen and range from manual external palpation of the inflation balloon, to assessment of inspiratory/expiratory volume loss to continuous monitoring with appropriate instrumentation. Despite the known Pcuff-related complications of ETT, there is a paucity of national or international guidelines on the optimal pressure value, frequency of pressure measurement, and measurement methods: however, some studies performed show that the use of an automated device that continuously monitors Pcuff significantly decreases gastric microaspirations.

### Early fixation versus conservative therapy of multiple, simple rib fractures (fixCon): protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^115miZUz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Secondary outcome measures

The secondary outcome measures are:
Need and duration of mechanical ventilation in days. The number of days of invasive mechanical ventilation (by endotracheal tube or tracheostomy) from intubation until successful weaning will be determined. The need for mechanical ventilation will be evaluated based on arterial blood gas analysis and clinical performance of the patient. The duration of mechanical ventilation will be calculated from the dates of intubation and extubation. Re-intubation within 30 days will be recorded as well.
Level of thoracic pain (NRS) and analgesics use. Thoracic pain will be determined using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in which 0 implicates no pain and 10 the worst possible pain. Five thoracic pain levels will be analyzed: pain in rest, at night, during daily activities (e.g. work or hobbies), during maximal inspiration, and during self-care. Analgesics use during admission will be extracted from the medical files. After discharge, analgesics use will be asked for during the follow-up visits. Daily narcotic requirement will be calculated using an equivalence scale for 30 mg/day oral morphine.
(Recovery of) pulmonary function. The parameters tidal volume (TV), forced vital capacity (FVC), inspiratory capacity (IC lung), and forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV₁) will be determined using spirometry. Spirometry will be done by a member of the research team. During the spirometry, the patient has to inhale actively and exhale with maximum force possible. The mean of three tests will be calculated.
Hospital length of stay expressed in days. This will be calculated as the time between admission and discharge from the hospital. Re-admission within 30 days will be added. Re-admission for thoracic reasons after 30 days and up to 12 months will be counted separately.
ICU length of stay expressed in days. This will be calculated similarly to the hospital length of stay.
Thoracic injury-related complications and mortality. The occurrence of thoracic injury-related complications will be recorded from the medical charts during clinical admission and each follow-up visit. Complications will be categorized for level of severity and treatment necessity according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Complications will include empyema (as diagnosed on CT scan, in presence of fever or positive cultures in the drained fluid), (retained) hydrothorax (a heterogeneous fluid collection with Hounsfield unit readings of 35–70 and evidence of pleural thickening), nonunion (diagnosed on CT scan or operatively, at least 6 months after trauma), and other (all other complications as judged by the treating physician). If mortality is caused by the thoracic injury or complication of thoracic injury, it will be counted in rates of mortality. Death caused by other reasons will be noted but excluded in this calculation.
Surgery-related complications. The ORIF group can also develop hardware-related complications or failure. Hardware-related complication is superficial and deep wound infection which is defined as redness, tenderness, and warmth surrounding and in direct contact with the postoperative wound. Superficial infection leads to oral or IV antibiotics, and deep infection leads to surgical activity such as stitch removal of exploration of the wound. Hardware failure is defined as loosening of the plate, secondary dislocation of fixation material, malposition of hardware, and broken plates or splints.
Secondary interventions to resolve complications. Secondary interventions within 12 months after trauma to relieve pain, treat infection, or other rib fracture-related problems will include the following: antibiotic therapy (both oral and intravenous), additional surgical interventions (e.g. surgical stabilization of nonunion, evacuation of hematoma, evacuation of empyema, removal of failed hardware, symptomatic hardware removal, and treatment of infection), and additional percutaneous interventions (e.g. for persistent bleeding intercostal artery, intraparenchymal bleeding, drainage of infection, and drainage of pleural fluid).
Health-related quality of life measured using the Short Form-12 (SF-12) and EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaires. The SF-12 analyzes global health status, functional scale, and symptom scale. The score will be calculated based on eight domains and summarized into a Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Data will be reported as utility score, ranging from 0 to 1 with a higher value indicating better quality of life. As a reference, the US population of 1998 will be used. The EQ-5D is the most commonly used quality of life instrument for (rib) fracture patients. The EQ-5D is recommended for assessment of quality of life in trauma patients, especially for economic evaluation. The EQ-5D-5 L descriptive system consists of five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each with five possible answers. The patients' health states will be converted into a utility score using the Dutch tariff. Utility scores range from 0 to 1 with lower scores indicating poorer quality of life.
Cost-effectiveness and health care consumption. Economic evaluations will be done from a societal perspective. The validated Medical Consumption Questionnaire (iMCQ) and Production Consumption Questionnaire (iPCQ) will be used. iMCQ details medical specialist care, physical therapy, hospitalization, nursing home, home care, and other costs directly associated with diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. iPCQ comprises work resumption and production losses. Health care costs and lost productivity until 1 year after trauma will be measured in accordance with economic guidelines.

### A comparison of the haider tube-guard® endotracheal tube holder versus adhesive tape to determine if this novel device can reduce endotracheal tube movement and prevent unplanned extubation [^1146dTBw]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The Haider Tube-Guard significantly outperformed all types and combinations of adhesive tape because it affixes to the patient in a far more secure fashion. Whereas adhesive tape attaches to the facial surface, the Haider Tube-Guard anchors to the maxilla and mandible. Forces applied to a taped ETT distort and pull on mobile facial tissues, allowing for significant ETT movements to occur even in the absence of an adhesive failure. An ETT secured with the Haider Tube-Guard on the contrary is pinned between rigid bony structures that do not move under such loads. This lack of reliance on a tape–skin interface explains why the Haider Tube-Guard functioned well in notoriously difficult settings such as in patients with facial hair.

The Haider Tube-Guard all but eliminated ETT movements > 1 cm under maximal load, in contrast to adhesive tapes, which failed to prevent such movements in all but 1 patient. The Haider Tube-Guard may prove especially useful in cases using specialty ETTs such as double-lumen endobronchial tubes or electromyography tubes, where small movements can dislodge the bronchial balloon or electrode interface, respectively. Further studies should be conducted in such scenarios as well as in patients not undergoing neuromuscular blockade to determine whether in fact the Haider Tube-Guard reduces unwanted intraoperative coughing by eliminating such small ETT movements. Of note, in one patient with a very large mouth opening, the Haider Tube-Guard separated from the teeth under load, but the Velcro neck strap served as a backup and kept the ETT from moving beyond 3 cm. The control method of taping in this patient, which included 5 different tapes and adhesives, faired no better by allowing 3 cm of movement under load.

RESULTS

Thirty patients successfully completed the protocol, and no patients had to be excluded once they were recruited. Surgical case mix included neurological, vascular, gynecological, colorectal, thoracic, and oncological surgery. The mean surgical time and, therefore, dwell time of the Haider Tube-Guard was 189 minutes (range 65–410 minutes). All patients were positioned supine for the duration of surgery.

The Haider Tube-Guard significantly reduced the mobility of the ETT when compared with adhesive tape. Under standardized traction, the ETT withdrew a mean distance of 3.4 cm (SD ± 1.8) when secured with adhesive tape versus 0.3 cm (SD ± 0.6) when secured with the Haider Tube-Guard (average difference = 3.1 [SD ± 1.8; 95% CI, 2.88–3.32; P < 0.001; ANCOVA]). The paired t test results were similar to the ANCOVA with the average difference of 3.1 (95% CI, 2.41–3.79; P < 0.001). The ETT displacement distances measured with each of the securing methods for every patient are shown graphically in Figure 2.

Evaluation of endotracheal tube positioning

Alternative ways to monitor the endotracheal tube depth were suggested, especially in situations where the number of fixations presented in the endotracheal tube was illegible. The method used to evaluate the external measurement of the endotracheal tube from the lip to the end of the endotracheal tube was tested and adopted, without considering the connector, as well as standardising the medical records for monitoring. Another idea of change was to insert the positioning number of the tracheal endotracheal tube in the digital image of the X-ray. The idea was tested by inserting the abbreviation LS (upper lip), followed by the number corresponding to the endotracheal tube fixation in the X-ray. This action facilitated the evaluation of the positioning with the corresponding number, optimising the decision making for possible adjustments in the positioning of the endotracheal tube. A standard medical evolution was also developed to validate the positioning of the endotracheal tube. The entire physical therapist and nursing team was trained to perform the evaluate the external measurement of the endotracheal tube.

Good practices of physical restraint

Restrictive alternatives were developed in partnership with a national company, whose model consists of gloves and limb restraints (online supplemental figure) that limit movement, as alternatives to physical restraint or the use of limb restraint (online supplemental figure) unavailable in the Brazilian territory, in a safe and comfortable way, as they do not tie the patient to the bed. These new restrictors were developed from the benchmarking conducted with international companies. After testing and approval of the new devices, the product was registered in the National Health Surveillance Agency (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária), and commercial negotiation was conducted to ensure the coverage of the new restrictors by the agreements. In addition, the electronic medical records of mechanical restraint and monitoring of restraint were standardised in the electronic medical record to ensure the surveillance, quality and safety of minimally contained patients, in accordance with good practices in PICUs and the legislation of the Regional Nursing Council. The quality of the restriction process was constantly monitored, and all employees received feedback regarding good restriction practices.

Monitoring of sedation

A form for monitoring compliance of sedation goals was established, tested and implemented in the medical prescription through the COMFORT-B scale(goal between 11 and 22). In addition, we sought to achieve nursing monitoring every 2 hours of the COMFORT-B scale and corrections when necessary, both recorded in medical records.

### Comparison of commercial and noncommercial endotracheal tube-securing devices [^113hDNEW]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tracheal intubation is used to establish a secure airway in patients who require mechanical ventilation. Unexpected extubation can have serious complications, including airway trauma and death. Various methods and devices have been developed to maintain endotracheal tube (ETT) security. Associated complications include pressure ulcers due to decreased tissue perfusion. Device consideration includes ease of use, rapid application, and low exerted pressure around the airway.

Methods

Sixteen ETT holders were evaluated under a series of simulated clinical conditions. ETT security was tested by measuring distance displaced after a tug. Nine of the 16 methods could be evaluated for speed of moving the ETT to the opposite side of the mouth. Sensors located on a mannequin measured applied forces when the head was rotated vertically or horizontally. Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance, with P < .05.

Results

Median displacement of the ETT by the tug test was 0 cm (interquartile range of 0.0–0.10 cm, P < .001). The mean time to move the ETT from one side of the mouth to the other ranged from 1.25 ± 0.2 s to 34.4 ± 3.4 s (P < .001). Forces applied to the face with a vertical head lift ranged from < 0.2 newtons (N) to a maximum of 3.52 N (P < .001). Forces applied to the face with a horizontal rotation ranged from < 0.2 N to 3.52 N (P < .001). Commercial devices produced greater force than noncommercial devices.

Conclusions

Noncommercial airway holders exert less force on a patient's face than commercial devices. Airway stability is affected by the type of securing method. Many commercial holders allow for rapid but secure movement of the artificial airway from one side of the mouth to the other.

Securing an endotracheal tube in a child with a facial burn is crucial but often challenging. The traditional method of using a facial apparatus or tape tied around the lower face is not suitable in the setting of open facial wounds as it limits wound care and, if necessary, skin grafting. We describe a straightforward, quick method to secure the endotracheal tube by means of a modified ivy loop in a pediatric patient.

### The effect of adhesive tape versus endotracheal tube fastener in critically ill adults: the endotracheal tube securement (ETTS) randomized controlled trial [^11792S9i]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The endotracheal tube securement (ETTS) study was a pragmatic, single-center, open-label, randomized trial comparing the effect of adhesive tape versus endotracheal tube fastener (Hollister® AnchorFast Guard) among critically ill adults requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation for at least 24 h (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03760510). Both adhesive tape and endotracheal tube holder were being used in the MICU according to the clinician's choice prior to initiating the study. The study was approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board with a waiver of consent.

Study participants

Patients admitted to the MICU from May 17, 2017, to April 14, 2018, who were deemed by their clinical team to require endotracheal intubation and fulfill the inclusion criteria without meeting the exclusion criteria were enrolled and randomly assigned to adhesive tape versus endotracheal tube fastener. If patients were intubated within 12 h of admission to the MICU, they were eligible for inclusion in the study. Patients had to be enrolled in the study for a minimum of 24 h to be included in the analysis to ensure a reasonable amount of time for complications to occur. Patients were excluded if they (1) were intubated greater than 12 h prior to admission to the MICU, (2) had oral mucosa or facial skin breakdown prior to enrollment, (3) required nasotracheal intubation, (4) had a documented allergy to tape, (5) were pregnant, or (6) were prisoners.

Randomization

Patients were randomized to endotracheal tube holder or tape in a 1:1 ratio using random permuted computer-generated blocks of 2, 4, and 6. Prior to initiation of the study, randomization assignments were placed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes, which remained sealed until the decision was made to enroll a patient in the study. Once it had been determined by the treating team that a patient was eligible for the study (i.e. intubated less than 12 h), the operator opened the envelope and followed the assignment of either adhesive tape or endotracheal tube fastener.

### The effect of adhesive tape versus endotracheal tube fastener in critically ill adults: the endotracheal tube securement (ETTS) randomized controlled trial [^113Ma3t5]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrated that endotracheal tube fasteners reduced the incidence of lip ulcers, skin tears, and tube dislodgement compared to adhesive tape. Although both tube fasteners and adhesive tube have been used to secure endotracheal tubes in patients in clinical practice for several years, few trials have directly compared the effects of these different securement techniques on patient safety and clinical outcomes. While many respiratory therapists may have a personal preference towards one particular securement technique, usually due to ease of use, superiority of one technique over another with regard to outcomes has not previously been demonstrated. Prior studies investigating different endotracheal securement techniques are not generalizable to patients mechanically ventilated in an ICU. In 2007, Carlson et al. examined the force required to extubate endotracheal tubes from cadavers with either tape or endotracheal tube fastener. Results showed that tape required a significantly larger force to extubate the cadavers compared to fastener. However, given this study was undertaken in cadavers, it is unclear if these results translate to adult patients in the ICU. Additionally, in 2014, Mohammed and Hassan demonstrated that securement with twill decreased endotracheal tube slippage in the first 120 min post intubation compared to tape and tube fastener. Failure to evaluate the performance of the securement technique beyond 2 h limits the interpretation of these data into critical care environments where the average duration of mechanical ventilation is measured in days or weeks.

In the current trial, the use of a tube fastener resulted in 7.2% fewer patients developing complications compared to adhesive tape. Overall, using the tube fastener resulted in 19.3 fewer complications per 1000 ventilator days than using adhesive tape. These results suggest that the use of an endotracheal tube fastener rather than adhesive tape will result in fewer lip ulcers, endotracheal tube dislodgements, and facial skin tears. While there was no difference between the groups in clinical outcomes, including duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU or hospital mortality, reducing the rate of lip ulcers, endotracheal tube dislodgements, and facial skin tears will improve patient safety and experience in the ICU and also likely decrease the cost of care. In addition, lip ulcers and skin tears are considered "never events" by payer sources, meaning that treatment of these complications is not reimbursed as part of patient care costs.

### Quality improvement project to reduce unplanned extubations in a paediatric intensive care unit [^111fcHeG]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Thus, we surpassed the established goal of the improvement project, which was a 66% reduction in the extubation rate (from 2.02 to 0.7 per 100 ventilated/day), and the results were sustained in the postintervention period. In 2021, two events of UE were reported, and in both cases, there was no need for reintubation. These events were related to low surveillance in the direct care of the professional in the extubation planning stage (figure 3).

Figure 3
Days between accidental extubation events in the paediatric ICU from February 2017 to December 2021 presented by a graph presented by a TChart graph. ICU, intensive care unit; PDSA, Plan–Do–Study–Act.

In the preintervention period, the mean number of days between UE events in the PICU was 59 days. In the intervention phase, the six change ideas were implemented, and the mean number of days between UE events corresponded to 108 days. As of January 2019, concomitant with the implementation of the new endotracheal tube fixation model, there was no sustained UE event during the 2-year period, reaching a total of 784 days without any UE event in the postintervention phase, and in the postintervention phase, the mean number of days between UE events corresponded to 288 days. Therefore, comparing the preintervention and postintervention periods, there was a 488% increase in the number of days between events (figure 3).

The process indicators did not reach the goal of 95%, and the best percentages were monitoring of the endotracheal tube depth, endotracheal tube fixation and family education, reaching average adherence of 75.8%, 77.4% and 76, 1%, respectively. Regarding adherence to the monitoring of the sedation scale and good practices of physical restraint, compliance was between 35% and 40% (online supplemental figure).

The balance indicator evaluated the occurrence of adverse events and late clinical complications related to UE as well as the costs related to reintubation. During the intervention period, in June 2019, an adverse event related to a lesion caused by pressure of the labial mucous membrane associated with the endotracheal tube was identified, and the laser was applied with temporary damage reversal. The professionals were revalidated in the new treatment about method of fixation and implanted checklist of safe prone positioning with repositioning of the endotracheal tube for pressure relief. No skin lesions related to the adhesive or latex of the tensoplast were observed.

### Tolerability and performance of BIP endotracheal tubes with noble metal alloy coating – a randomized clinical evaluation study [^114Usub9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We compared tolerability and functional performance between a new, coated endotracheal tube (BIP ETT) and a standard endotracheal tube (ETT), and found minor differences during short-term use, 3 to 8 h of intubation. The differences were observed only in 2 of 8 symptoms - in coughing, p = 0.022 and possibly in dry mouth (p = 0.014, but with presence of statistical confounders), while there was no difference in adverse events and no mucosal damage. The results should be treated with caution due to a small study size. Further, the current study had too short intubation periods and too small sample sizes to detect differences in the reduction of bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation due to large inter-individual variability in the results. In summary, the study shows that the BIP ETT is well tolerated and has good performance. Studies of larger sample sizes and longer intubation periods (> 24 h) in the ICU-setting can now be planned for the evaluation of the possible efficacy of the BIP ETT in reducing bacterial colonisation and prevention of VAP.

Key messages

Healthcare associated infections continue to play a major role in complicating hospital care. The surface of various devices can be modified in order to reduce bacterial colonization and subsequent infection. We compared new surface-coated endotracheal tubes to standard devices during elective surgery for 3–8 h, and found insignificant differences in tolerability and performance. Only larger studies with longer exposure times in special patient populations (ICU) could demonstrate possible benefits of the surface coating in reduction of VAP and produce experience supporting extrapolation of conclusion on safety from this limited study into general patient population.

### The effect of adhesive tape versus endotracheal tube fastener in critically ill adults: the endotracheal tube securement (ETTS) randomized controlled trial [^112EwmYu]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Study treatments

Prior studies investigating endotracheal tube securement techniques require that the endotracheal tube be repositioned and re-taped every 24 h. However, due to the pragmatic design and intent of this protocol, the endotracheal tube was not repositioned as part of the study protocol in either group. In both groups, the tube was repositioned as needed according to ICU policy or protocols or at the discretion of the provider, bedside nurse, or respiratory therapist, per usual practice. For both groups, oral hygiene was performed every 12 h and oral moistening every 2 h based on ICU policy.

Data collection

Data were collected prospectively at the time of intubation and from the medical record in order to determine the effect of the assigned intervention on short- and long-term outcomes. All data were collected non-invasively and were already a part of clinical data obtained in usual ICU care at the bedside or in the medical record. Due to the pragmatic nature of the trial, no additional data were collected that were not observed at the bedside or obtained from the medical record.

Age, gender, height, weight, race, active medical problems at the time of intubation, active comorbidities complicating intubation, indication for intubation, whether a reintubation, and whether the face was soiled during the intubation were all collected at the time of intubation. Depth of the tube as measured at the lip line and position in the mouth (i.e. 22 cm at the lip, midline) at time of securement was also recorded. The following in-hospital outcomes were recorded via electronic medical record review: days on mechanical ventilation, and vital status at the time of ICU and hospital discharge. Oral mucosa assessment, facial skin integrity assessment, frequency of endotracheal tube repositioning, and endotracheal tube dislodgements — defined as either complete dislodgement of the endotracheal tube (i.e. accidental extubation) or needing to reposition the endotracheal tube at least 2 cm (i.e. need to pull ETT back > 2 cm or move it down > 2 cm) — were all collected in duplicate using bedside sheets completed by nursing and respiratory therapy and electronic medical record review. In addition, as per usual practice in our ICU, facial skin tears and lip ulcers were independently assessed and confirmed by the nursing quality improvement associate, who was not part of either the patient care or the study team. Endotracheal tube dislodgements were retrospectively confirmed by a study personnel via manual chart review.

### Intraoral fixation of endotracheal tubes using a suture in edentulous patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery [^113LtsTw]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Securing an endotracheal tube in completely edentulous patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery can pose difficulties. In this report, a readily available and easy method of securing the endotracheal tube to gums of the teeth using the suture in such a circumstance is described. This technique has been used successfully in more than 100 patients at our institutions. Our experience suggests that it can provide reliable tube fixation and does not hinder surgical access.

### Patient draping and endotracheal tube positioning during facelift surgery [^117AqWd4]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

A comprehensive approach to facial rejuvenation often requires facelift surgery combined with ancillary facial procedures. This may require prolonged operating time under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. When general anesthesia is used, secure endotracheal tube fixation and ready access to the face is essential. We describe an anesthetic technique that assures secure tube placement, rapid intubation, and ready access to the entire face. A fiber-reinforced tube is placed orotracheally, wired to the mandibular dentition, and brought over the head in the fashion similar to a nasotracheal tube. The reinforced nature of the tube prevents kinking and allows rapid repositioning inferiorly to allow access to the upper face. In over 400 rhytidectomies, this technique has allowed rapid intubation and surgical preparation. There have been no airway-related problems or other related complications. This is a safe, effective, and rapid means of securing orotracheal intubation during facial esthetic surgery allowing ready access to the face.

### The effect of adhesive tape versus endotracheal tube fastener in critically ill adults: the endotracheal tube securement (ETTS) randomized controlled trial [^111PyC9a]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome

The primary endpoint, a composite of presence of lip ulcer, endotracheal tube dislodgement, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or facial skin tears from the time of randomization to the earlier of death or 48 h after extubation, occurred 13 times in 12 (7.8%) patients in the tube fastener group and 30 times in 25 (17.2%) patients in the adhesive tape group (p = 0.014). The overall rates of the development of the composite endpoint were 22.0 (95% CI 16.3 to 27.7) versus 52.6 (95% CI 47.4 to 57.8) per 1000 patient ventilator days (p = 0.020) in the tube fastener and adhesive tape groups, respectively (Table 2; Fig. 2). Univariate analysis demonstrated an OR of 2.33 (95% CI 1.13–4.83; p = 0.022) for the development of the composite endpoint when adhesive tape compared to tube fastener was used for endotracheal tube securement. Multivariate analysis including age as a covariate demonstrated no independent association between age and development of the composite endpoint (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98–1.02; p = 0.84) and similar OR for the development of the composite endpoint in adhesive tape versus tube fastener (OR 2.32; 95% CI 1.11–4.76; p = 0.026).

### The use of the intubating laryngeal mask endotracheal tube with intubating devices [^1126AFpq]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Implications

Despite adequate visualization of the vocal cords using specialized airway devices, anatomical factors and the physical characteristics of the tube may cause difficulty when performing endotracheal intubation. The endotracheal tube designed for use with the intubating laryngeal mask airway may facilitate intubation in these circumstances.

### A comparison of the haider tube-guard® endotracheal tube holder versus adhesive tape to determine if this novel device can reduce endotracheal tube movement and prevent unplanned extubation [^113jxn9Q]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

ETT movements > 1 cm were defined as clinically significant because they could lead to patients' coughing or moving. Furthermore, specialty ETTs such as double-lumen endobronchial tubes or electromyography tubes could become dislodged and malfunction with such movements. ETT movements > 4 cm were defined as "potentially high risk for extubation" based on the dimensions of standard ETT cuffs and presumed positioning of the tube cuff in the proximal third of the trachea. Given that the average human trachea is 10 to 12 cm in length, movements > 4 cm in such a positioned ETT would be highly likely to displace the majority of the balloon cuff beyond the vocal cords, risking imminent tracheal extubation. Our protocol was designed with safety nets in place to eliminate any chance of extubation during the study period. First, the ETT was positioned in the distal trachea to increase the margin of safety. Second, the principal investigator continuously ensured in real time that the ETT was well within the trachea during the data collection period using the indwelling bronchoscope. Third, a second study anesthesiologist and the clinical provider anesthesiologist not participating in the study were both constantly observing the patient to ensure proper ETT placement. Any of those providers had overriding power to request that the force be aborted should safety concerns arise. Finally, the bronchoscope was left in the trachea during the entire data collection period to act as a guide for reintubation in the extremely unlikely event that the ETT was pulled out of the trachea.

### Extubation force depends upon angle of force application and fixation technique: a study of 7 methods [^111N6rMq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Testing done on a mannequin at room temperature omits certain effects present in a living patient such as temperature gradients, gender, facial hair, perspiration and saliva. Material properties, and subsequent force responses, may change significantly when exposed to a temperature gradient. This could translate into increased ET tube or fixator deformation and/or weakening of tube-restraint interfaces, as well as interfaces internal to the fixator. Significant differences between genders are also present in the facial area. Factors such as bone and skin structure or the presence/absence of facial hair are not accurately represented by an intubation mannequin. On the other hand, the mannequin is useful for controling the external factors mentioned above leaving the study less prone to confounding factors. Perspiration is certainly present on some patients, particularly those in the ICU or ED. An absence of saliva or perspiration may also effect fixator performance. These effects would likely not be consistent across devices, or even angles of force application, so relativistic observations made in this study may not necessarily hold true in the clinical setting.

Clinically, the nature of the force will also vary widely from impulse forces to long term, constant pressures. Materials and fixation mechanisms could behave differently under different loading conditions. Material properties could also change significantly after exposure to long term loading, deformation and temperature gradients. Application of ET tube restraints may also vary significantly between patients, particularly for the adhesive and twill tapes, as the fixators are essentially constructed on, versus applied to, the patient.

It is likely that there is also human error present in the displacement readings. Motion of the mandible, with respect to the tube and mannequin, was not consistent across all methods or test points. It is possible errors were induced determining alignment of the ET tube markings with the incisors. All markings were made by hand, so there may also be some error inherent in the tube markings.

### Endotracheal tube extubation force: adhesive tape versus endotracheal tube holder [^112MhGvK]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Adhesive tape is commonly used to secure the endotracheal tube (ETT) in anesthesia and intensive-care settings.

Objective

To determine the force required to extubate when the ETT is secured with adhesive tape or commercially available ETT holders.

Methods

We orally intubated a simulation manikin with a standard 8.0-mm inner-diameter ETT, inflated the cuff to 20 cm H₂O, and measured the force required to extubate with the ETT secured in several ways. We tested 3 brands of tape (Durapore, Multipore Dry, and Wardel) with 6 methods, and 2 commercially available ETT holders (LockTite and Thomas) with one method. We also tested a bite block (Universal Bite Block) with 2 methods. We used a releasable cable tie with the bite block and/or ETT holder. We connected the ETT to a digital force gauge and pulled perpendicular to the oral cavity, until the entire cuff was removed from the trachea. In each trial we considered the largest force recorded the extubation force.

Results

One of the conventional tape methods (with wider tape and longer tape strips) required the largest force to extubate.

Conclusions

With tape strips of sufficient length and width, a conventional tape method was superior to the 2 tested commercial ETT holders in holding the ETT in place in the manikin.

### Are specialized endotracheal tubes and heat-and-moisture exchangers cost-effective in preventing ventilator associated pneumonia? [^116PAL73]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common and serious complication of mechanical ventilation via an artificial airway. As with all nosocomial infections, VAP increases costs, morbidity, and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). VAP prevention is a multifaceted priority of the intensive care team, and can include the use of specialized artificial airways and heat-and-moisture exchangers (HME). Substantial evidence supports the use of endotracheal tubes (ETTs) that allow subglottic suctioning; silver-coated and antiseptic-impregnated ETTs; ETTs with thin-walled polyurethane cuffs; and HMEs, but these devices also can have adverse effects. Controversy still exists regarding the evidence, cost-effectiveness, and disadvantages and risks of these devices.

### Anesthesia management of complex head and face injury caused by bear bite: a case report [^1118yytA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The airway was initially secured via awake orotracheal intubation using a reinforced endotracheal tube under the guidance of VL, based on a preoperative airway assessment revealing Mallampati grade IV. The patient subsequently underwent tracheostomy under aseptic conditions. The orotracheal tube was electively removed after confirming proper placement and fixation of the tracheostomy tube.

Endotracheal intubation remains the gold standard for airway management in operations, with extensive evidence supporting its safety and efficacy. In difficult airway scenarios, VL has been shown to improve first-pass success rates. Conversely, supraglottic airway devices (SADs) offer distinct advantages in emergency settings, including rapid placement, reliable short-term ventilation, and higher success rates in unanticipated difficult airways. However, despite their integration into difficult airway algorithms, SADs present limitations such as risks of pharyngeal discomfort and positional displacement. In the present case, the patient was scheduled for subsequent tracheostomy, wherein SAD use could increase the risk of device dislodgement and occupy critical oropharyngeal space, potentially interfering with the surgical procedure. For patients with facial trauma, VL or fiberoptic intubation may be employed to facilitate intubation. Notably, in ATI for patients with combined visual and linguistic barriers (e.g. absence of the left globe and right globe prolapse + monolingual Tibetan speaker), VL demonstrates advantages over fiberoptic intubation: it reduces patient cooperation time, eliminates the need for respiratory coordination, and minimizes language dependence.

### Development of an improved LASER-resistant endotracheal tube [^112yqsDT]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Surgical fires, particularly within Otolaryngology, remain a surprisingly frequent and devastating complication of laser-related surgery in the oropharynx and airway; Current estimates suggest anywhere from 200 to 600 surgical fires per year in the United States, with 20%-30% of these occurring as a complication of laser surgery and 90%-95% of these occurring in the head and neck region. Unfortunately, the complications of laser surgery in the airway may include respiratory failure, airway burns with stenosis, and may result in mortality. The most commonly utilized endotracheal tube for protection against inadvertent laser strikes, the Laser-Shield II tube (Medtronic), was removed from the commercial marketplace in 2016 after cases of airway fires were reported as a result of feature deficiencies in the product (FDA MAUDE Database review). Since the demise of the Laser-Shield II tube, alternatives such as the Mallinckrodt laser tube and handmade reinforced tubes have been utilized, although shortcomings in design and features have made these options less appealing to practicing Otolaryngologists. Creating a laser-safe endotracheal tube is critical for safe upper airway surgery. This paper evaluates new technologies, materials, and technical innovations in endotracheal tubes that may advance patient safety in laser-assisted Otolaryngology procedures.

Study Type

This paper evaluates new technologies, materials, and technical innovations in endotracheal tubes that may advance patient safety in laser-assisted Otolaryngology procedures.

Methods

First, this article reviews the background of laser surgery in Otolaryngology and the consequent risk of surgical fire with resultant development of laser-resistant endotracheal tubes and commercial availability. Next, a review of claims and national database review of product failures related to previous laser-resistant endotracheal tubes is performed through the FDA MAUDE database. This includes an evaluation of cases: review of techniques in laser airway surgery including spontaneous ventilation, decreased O₂ concentration, currently available endotracheal tubes including "handmade" fixes for perceived safety risks, and determination of failure points for previous laser-resistant endotracheal tubes. Third, the paper reviews the requested features of an "ideal" laser-resistant endotracheal tube. Finally, the paper reviews failure testing from an initial, unsuccessful attempt at material development and the consequent development of alternative technologies that address failure points from previous endotracheal tubes and addresses requested features with a detailed analysis of FDA-approval required testing. Extensive lab testing of the new tube predicts a significant reduction of risk in vivo with inability to perforate the shaft or cuff of the tubes under standard working conditions.

Results

While no iteration of a laser-resistant endotracheal tube is entirely laser safe, advances in technology can improve the safety profile of these devices. The new tube contains a double cuff, a soft and flexible shaft to minimize laryngeal insertion trauma, a smooth external surface, a tight-to-shaft balloon, and methylene blue dye in the cuff to alert the user to inadvertent penetration. These characteristics were the most requested by laryngologists in the development of a new laser-resistant tube. The newest endotracheal tube brings the features most requested by Otolaryngologists in a laser-resistant tube, and improves the safety profile over previous tubes.

Conclusion

Development of a new endotracheal tube represents an advancement in safety for the Otolaryngologist in laser airway surgery. Understanding the previous history and the science behind surgical fire formation is essential in advancing safety for patients in the future.

### Evaluating multifaceted strategies to prevent nasoenteral tube complications and achieve significant cost savings in critically ill patients: the ENHANCE-CRIT trial [^113yMt8p]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Outcomes measured

The study used a combination of outcome, process and balancing indicators to assess the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing NET complications. Complications monitored included accidental dislodgement, tube malpositioning and the need for tube repositioning, which in some cases required endoscopic assistance for proper placement. The balancing indicators accounted for the safety of the interventions, ensuring that they did not lead to unintended adverse outcomes such as pressure injuries. This comprehensive approach allowed for a thorough evaluation of both the effectiveness and safety of the implemented strategies.

Primary outcomes

The primary outcome was the reduction in the incidence of complications related to the use of NETs. The outcome indicator measured the rate of complications associated with NETs, including both the procedure for tube placement and its maintenance. Data collection for this outcome was performed monthly, with the indicator being calculated as the number of complications related to NETs divided by the total number of NETs inserted each month.

Process indicators

Process indicators were used to evaluate the compliance and effectiveness of the implemented changes. Data were collected through bedside audits conducted by one of the study nurses. Key monitored processes included the adequacy of NET fixation, which was assessed based on adherence to established protocols for securing the tube. This evaluation considered the type of fixation used and verification that it remained intact throughout the duration of tube placement. Improvement in this indicator was measured by comparing the rates of adequate fixation over time through our bedside audits.

Additionally, the use of mechanical restraints in patients with delirium was monitored to evaluate compliance with best practices in managing this condition. Delirium was diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method, a validated tool for identifying delirium in clinical settings.

Balancing indicators

Balancing indicators were used to assess potential unintended consequences or clinical complications that could arise from the changes introduced to reduce NET-related complications. These indicators aimed to ensure that the changes made to decrease complications did not inadvertently create new issues.

Secondary outcomes

A secondary outcome focused on cost reduction through economic analysis. This analysis was conducted retrospectively, comparing patients matched for similar demographic and clinical characteristics. The aim was to calculate the incremental hospital costs attributed to adverse events and assess the potential financial benefits of reducing these complications through the intervention.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113poLvS]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Clinical conditions impacting on cough mechanics — glottis, airways devices, and cough peak flow (CPF): Although glottic closure enhances the compressive phase of coughing, it is not essential for an effective cough; individuals with a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube can produce an effective cough by performing a huffing maneuver with an open glottis, and therefore in patients with endotracheal tubes in place, a tracheostomy need not be performed to just improve cough effectiveness. Cough efficacy is determined by factors including the lung volume at cough initiation, compression phase duration and development of tracheal pressure, CPF rate, acceleration to CPF, and sustained airflow after the peak, requiring tight coordination of inspiratory, expiratory, laryngeal, pharyngeal, and oral musculature. Of these, CPF is thought to be one of the most crucial and well-studied indicators of cough intensity, with most data focusing on voluntary cough; decreased CPF is associated with increased risk of atelectasis and pneumonia, and CPF has now become a global measure of voluntary cough.

Qualitative analysis was based on confocal microscopy, we described visually the distribution of microbial colonization. However, we did not report numerical value because the confounding factors.
- Endotracheal tube colonization
- Discarded ETTs will be collected after extubation and sent for quantitative and qualitative microbiological analysis after silver ion inactivation
- Microbiological Colonization of Distal Airways.
- Investigators will keep track of patient data regarding ETT-related infections as well as data about ICU clinical outcomes. Several studies have suggested that biofilm formation inside the ETT plays a pivotal role in VAP development and drug-resistance induction. Silver-coated ETT have proven effective in delaying but not in preventing ETT colonization and biofilm formation, due to a barrier effect of biofilm and accumulated debris. Advanced ETT cleaning devices are able to remove debris and biofilm and reduce the total ETT microbial load to a certain extent. They plan to achieve this result by analyzing the tubes of each enrolled patient after it has been removed, either because the patient does not need it anymore due to his/her better clinical conditions, or because there is a need of tracheostomy or because he/she dies.

Specifically they will analyze how the endOclear cleaning maneuver affects microbial colonization in the inner layer of the ETT and how this can determine distal airway inoculation and, ultimately, VAP development. Specific AIM #3: Investigators will test the hypothesis that prevention of ETT biofilm development will reduce drug resistance rates found in ETT and distal airways isolates The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial on 40 patients intubated with silver-coated ETT and randomized to receive standard ETT cleaning vs cleaning with the endOclear device.
