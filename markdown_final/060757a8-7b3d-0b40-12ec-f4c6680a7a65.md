## Question

A 58-year-old woman presents for follow-up after recovering from her first episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, which was managed conservatively. She is concerned about the risk of recurrence and has read online about medications that might help prevent another episode. She asks specifically about mesalamine (an aminosalicylate) and whether she should take it to reduce her risk of future diverticulitis.

Based on current guideline recommendations, how should you counsel this patient regarding the use of mesalamine (aminosalicylate) for secondary prevention of diverticulitis recurrence?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether mesalamine (5-ASA) should be used to prevent recurrence after a first episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, and how to counsel the patient based on current guidelines and evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and the exact question we are answering. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines from major societies recommend. Next, I will review the randomized controlled trial data and meta-analyses to confirm efficacy and safety. After that, I need to check for any conflicting or lower-quality evidence that might suggest benefit. Finally, I will translate this into practical counseling and outline evidence-based alternatives for recurrence prevention, including when to consider surgery or colonoscopy follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. This is a 58-year-old woman with a first episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis managed conservatively, asking about mesalamine for secondary prevention of recurrence. The key question is whether mesalamine reduces recurrence risk, not whether it helps chronic symptoms or symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, which are different entities and should not be conflated with acute diverticulitis recurrence prevention [^115ZwXdP] [^1121j1jn].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check multiple societies for consistency. The American College of Physicians (ACP) issues a strong recommendation against mesalamine to prevent recurrent diverticulitis, citing high-certainty evidence of no benefit and higher discontinuation rates due to adverse effects [^115ocBmf] [^114KiEuT]. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) likewise recommends against mesalamine after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, stating that available evidence does not show efficacy in reducing recurrence, pain, or surgery, and includes mesalamine among agents not to use for recurrence prevention [^115ZwXdP] [^1121j1jn]. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) advises not to offer mesalamine to reduce recurrence risk, though it may be considered for chronic symptoms in a different context, which is not the issue here [^115mX633] [^112GRyib]. The European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP) similarly recommends not offering mesalamine for prevention of recurrent diverticulitis or persistent complaints after an episode [^111kKoxH]. I should double-check that these positions are current; yes, these are 2020–2022 guidelines reflecting contemporary evidence [^115mX633] [^115ocBmf] [^111kKoxH].

> Now, I will examine the randomized trial data underpinning these recommendations. The pivotal PREVENT1 and PREVENT2 phase 3 trials, each around 590 patients, found mesalamine was not superior to placebo in preventing recurrence at 104 weeks, with recurrence-free rates of roughly 53–69% on mesalamine versus 65–68% on placebo, and no difference in time to recurrence or surgery rates [^111akT8r]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and direction; indeed, point estimates favored placebo in some analyses, reinforcing lack of efficacy [^111akT8r]. A 2017 Cochrane review of 7 RCTs with 1805 participants found no evidence that mesalamine reduces recurrence versus control, with very low certainty of evidence and substantial risk of bias across trials [^111RBTNX]. Additional meta-analyses align with this, showing no reduction in recurrence and, in some analyses, a signal toward higher recurrence at higher doses, which is hypothesis-generating but not definitive [^112hsD8o] [^117RJrVj]. I should confirm that these syntheses included the PREVENT trials; yes, they did, strengthening the conclusion [^111RBTNX] [^112hsD8o].

> But wait, what if there are subgroup signals or lower-quality studies suggesting benefit? Let me consider that carefully. Some earlier or smaller studies, and meta-analyses focused on symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease rather than recurrence after acute diverticulitis, have suggested symptom improvements with mesalamine, yet these results do not translate into reduced recurrence of acute diverticulitis and are not the target outcome here [^1172d5rX] [^113h2ZWR]. Observational and nonrandomized comparisons, including those mixing mesalamine with rifaximin, are confounded and should not override randomized data and guidelines, so I should not rely on them for recurrence prevention counseling [^112tbaLB] [^112Sfuqw]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines explicitly distinguish SUDD from post-diverticulitis recurrence; they do, reinforcing that mesalamine is not indicated for the latter [^115mX633] [^111kKoxH].

> I need to ensure we address safety and tolerability, because harm matters even when benefit is absent. High-certainty evidence shows mesalamine increases discontinuations due to adverse effects versus placebo, with absolute risk differences around 7% and common effects including epigastric pain, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, rash, and rare renal or hepatic impairment; this risk–benefit profile further argues against routine use for recurrence prevention [^115ocBmf] [^115kJquV]. I should confirm that serious adverse events are not increased, which is correct, but the higher discontinuation rate is clinically meaningful and supports avoiding unnecessary therapy [^115ocBmf].

> Next, I should review what to recommend instead for secondary prevention. Lifestyle measures are the most consistently endorsed strategy: maintain a high-quality diet with adequate fiber, achieve or maintain normal BMI, engage in regular physical activity, avoid smoking, and minimize regular NSAID use except for cardioprotective aspirin, as these steps are associated with lower recurrence risk, albeit with variable certainty of evidence [^115yxekC] [^112onW6f] [^11698gGS]. I should double-check that guidelines align on NSAID counseling; yes, AGA and primary care guidance advise avoiding routine NSAIDs after diverticulitis when possible, balancing cardiovascular indications for aspirin [^115yxekC] [^11698gGS]. Let me reconsider whether fiber is definitively proven to prevent recurrence; evidence is mixed, but fiber is reasonable for general health and may modestly reduce risk, so I will frame it as a lifestyle measure with potential benefit and no harm [^115yxekC] [^11698gGS].

> I will now examine when colonoscopy or surgery enter the discussion, so I do not miss important modifiers. Colonoscopy after an episode is not universally required; it is generally suggested after complicated diverticulitis or after a first uncomplicated episode if the patient has not had a recent high-quality colonoscopy, to exclude misdiagnosed neoplasia, and timing should be delayed 6–8 weeks after resolution unless alarm features arise [^117UFmn4] [^117S415c]. Elective surgery is not indicated after a single uncomplicated episode; it becomes a conditional consideration after recurrent or persistent disease, or after complicated diverticulitis, and decisions should be individualized via shared decision-making given trade-offs in recurrence, quality of life, and operative risks [^117UFmn4] [^114fnBwK]. I should confirm that these are guideline-based positions; yes, ACP and AGA align on deferring routine surgery after a first uncomplicated episode and on selective colonoscopy strategies [^117UFmn4] [^117S415c].

> Putting this together, I should deliver a clear, reference-aligned recommendation. Mesalamine should not be used to prevent recurrence after a first episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, because high-certainty evidence shows no reduction in recurrence and an increased risk of discontinuation due to adverse effects, and this is reflected in strong recommendations from ACP, AGA, ASCRS, and ESCP against its use for this indication [^115ocBmf] [^115ZwXdP] [^115mX633] [^111kKoxH]. Instead, emphasize lifestyle measures and reserve pharmacologic prevention discussions for investigational contexts or different clinical entities like SUDD, where evidence remains limited and inconsistent for mesalamine's role [^115yxekC] [^113h2ZWR].

> Finally, I should confirm the practical counseling points and safety context. Explain that the baseline recurrence risk after a first uncomplicated episode is about 20% at 5 years, with most recurrences early, which helps set expectations and underscores why ineffective prophylaxis should be avoided [^112MFdEi]. Review mesalamine's potential adverse effects and the lack of benefit so the patient can make an informed decision aligned with her values; importantly, public panel input to ACP showed a strong preference for management without mesalamine, which can guide shared decision-making [^115ocBmf] [^115kr9WU]. Reassure her that current evidence-based prevention focuses on diet, weight, activity, smoking cessation, and judicious NSAID use, and that we will monitor for red flags and consider colonoscopy or surgical consultation only if indicated by disease course or patient preferences [^115yxekC] [^117UFmn4].

Mesalamine is **not recommended** for preventing recurrent diverticulitis after a first uncomplicated episode [^115ocBmf] [^115ZwXdP]. High-quality evidence shows **no reduction in recurrence** with mesalamine versus placebo, and guidelines from ACP, AGA, and ASCRS advise against its use for this purpose [^115ocBmf] [^1121j1jn] [^115mX633]. Mesalamine may cause gastrointestinal side effects and is not indicated for diverticulitis prevention; instead, counsel on diet, weight, activity, and avoiding NSAIDs, and reserve mesalamine for symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease if considered [^115yxekC] [^115mX633].

## Evidence on mesalamine for preventing recurrent diverticulitis

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have evaluated mesalamine for **secondary prevention of diverticulitis**:

- **PREVENT 1 and PREVENT 2 trials**: Two large, identical, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (total 1,182 patients) found mesalamine (1.2–4.8 g/day) did not reduce recurrence at 104 weeks compared with placebo (53–63% vs 65% in PREVENT 1; 59–69% vs 68% in PREVENT 2) [^111akT8r].

- **Cochrane review (2017)**: Seven RCTs (1,805 patients) found no significant difference in recurrence with mesalamine vs control (31.3% vs 29.8%; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.43–1.09; very low-quality evidence) [^111RBTNX].

- **Meta-analyses**: Multiple meta-analyses confirm no benefit, with some showing higher recurrence at higher doses (> 2 g/day) (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02–1.62) [^111bnco7] [^117RJrVj].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Major societies provide **consistent guidance against mesalamine** for recurrence prevention:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American College of Physicians (ACP) 2022 | Strong recommendation against mesalamine to prevent recurrent diverticulitis (high-certainty evidence) [^115ocBmf] [^114KiEuT] |
| American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) 2021 | Do not use mesalamine to prevent recurrent diverticulitis [^1121j1jn] |
| American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) 2020 | Do not offer mesalamine to reduce recurrence risk; consider only for chronic symptoms [^115mX633] [^112GRyib] |
| European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP) 2020 | Do not offer mesalamine for prevention of recurrent diverticulitis [^111kKoxH] |

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Mesalamine is generally well tolerated, but **adverse effects are common** and can lead to discontinuation:

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Epigastric pain, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort are frequent [^115ocBmf].

- **Discontinuation**: Higher rates of discontinuation due to adverse effects vs placebo (23% vs 16%; ARD 7.1%, 95% CI 1.5–13.9%) [^115ocBmf] [^115kJquV].

- **Rare serious events**: Hepatic and renal impairment can occur, though serious adverse events are uncommon [^115ocBmf].

---

## Alternative strategies for preventing recurrence

Given the lack of benefit from mesalamine, **evidence-based strategies** include:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: High-quality diet, normal BMI, regular physical activity, smoking cessation, and avoidance of regular NSAID use (except cardioprotective aspirin) [^115yxekC] [^112onW6f] [^116J9tGy].

- **Colonoscopy**: Consider after an episode of complicated diverticulitis or if no recent high-quality colonoscopy, to exclude malignancy or other pathology [^117UFmn4] [^117S415c].

- **Elective surgery**: Discuss for patients with persistent or frequently recurrent uncomplicated diverticulitis, or complicated diverticulitis, individualized to patient preferences and risk profile [^117UFmn4] [^114fnBwK].

---

## Clinical scenarios where mesalamine may be considered

Mesalamine may be considered for **symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD)** — chronic abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits without acute inflammation — where some guidelines allow consideration for symptom control, though evidence is limited and inconsistent [^115mX633] [^112GRyib] [^113h2ZWR].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Mesalamine is **not recommended** for preventing recurrent diverticulitis after a first uncomplicated episode because high-quality evidence shows no benefit and guidelines consistently advise against its use. Counsel on lifestyle measures and reserve mesalamine, if at all, for symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease rather than recurrence prevention.

### Mesalamine (5-ASA) for the prevention of recurrent diverticulitis [^111RBTNX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diverticular disease is a common condition that increases in prevalence with age. Recent theories on the pathogenesis of diverticular inflammation have implicated chronic inflammation similar to that seen in ulcerative colitis. Mesalamine, or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), is a mainstay of therapy for individuals with ulcerative colitis. Accordingly, 5-ASA has been studied for prevention of recurrent diverticulitis.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of mesalamine (5-ASA) for prevention of recurrent diverticulitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 8), in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE (from 1950 to 9 September 2017); Ovid Embase (from 1974 to 9 September 2017); and two clinical trials registries for ongoing trials - Clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform database (9 September 2017). We also searched proceedings from major gastrointestinal conferences - Digestive Disease Week (DDW), United European Gastroenterology Week (UEGW), and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Annual Scientific Meeting - from 2010 to September 2017. In addition, we scanned reference lists from eligible publications, and we contacted corresponding authors to ask about additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy of 5-ASA versus placebo or another active drug for prevention of recurrent diverticulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as defined by Cochrane. Three review authors assessed eligibility for inclusion. Two review authors selected studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality independently. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for prevention of diverticulitis recurrence using an intention-to-treat principle and random-effects models. We assessed heterogeneity using criteria for Chi 2 (P < 0.10) and I 2 tests (> 50%). To explore sources of heterogeneity, we conducted a priori subgroup analyses. To assess the robustness of our results, we carried out sensitivity analyses using different summary statistics (RR vs odds ratio (OR)) and meta-analytical models (fixed-effect vs random-effects).

Main Results

We included in this review seven studies with a total of 1805 participants. We judged all seven studies to have unclear or high risk of bias. Investigators found no evidence of an effect when comparing 5-ASA versus control for prevention of recurrent diverticulitis (31.3% vs 29.8%; RR 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 1.09); very low quality of evidence). Five of the seven studies provided data on adverse events of 5-ASA therapy. The most commonly reported side effects were gastrointestinal symptoms (epigastric pain, nausea, and diarrhoea). No significant difference was seen between 5-ASA and control (67.8% vs 64.6%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.06; P = 0.63; moderate quality of evidence), nor was significant heterogeneity observed (I 2 = 0%; P = 0.50).

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of 5-ASA on recurrence of diverticulitis are uncertain owing to the small number of heterogenous trials included in this review. Rates of recurrent diverticulitis were similar among participants using 5-ASA and control participants. Effective medical strategies for prevention of recurrent diverticulitis are needed, and further randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials of rigorous design are warranted to specify the effects of 5-ASA (mesalamine) in the management of diverticulitis.

### Mesalamine did not prevent recurrent diverticulitis in phase 3 controlled trials [^111akT8r]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

No therapy has been proven to prevent the recurrence of diverticulitis. Mesalamine has shown efficacy in preventing relapse in inflammatory bowel disease, and there is preliminary evidence that it might be effective for diverticular disease. We investigated the efficacy of mesalamine in preventing recurrence of diverticulitis in 2 identical but separate phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (identical confirmatory trials were conducted for regulatory reasons).

Methods

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of multimatrix mesalamine vs placebo in the prevention of recurrent diverticulitis in 590 (PREVENT1) and 592 (PREVENT2) adult patients with ≥ 1 episodes of acute diverticulitis in the previous 24 months that resolved without surgery. Patients received mesalamine (1.2 g, 2.4 g, or 4.8 g) or placebo once daily for 104 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of recurrence-free patients at week 104. Diverticulitis recurrence was defined as surgical intervention at any time for diverticular disease or presence of computed tomography scan results demonstrating bowel wall thickening (> 5 mm) and/or fat stranding consistent with diverticulitis. For a portion of the study, recurrence also required the presence of abdominal pain and an increase in white blood cells.

Results

Mesalamine did not reduce the rate of diverticulitis recurrence at week 104. Among patients in PREVENT1, 53%-63% did not have disease recurrence, compared with 65% of those given placebo. Among patients in PREVENT2, 59%-69% of patients did not have disease recurrence, compared with 68% of those given placebo. Mesalamine did not reduce time to recurrence, and the proportions of patients requiring surgery were comparable among treatment groups. No new adverse events were identified with mesalamine administration.

Conclusions

Mesalamine was not superior to placebo in preventing recurrent diverticulitis. Mesalamine is not recommended for this indication. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00545740 and NCT00545103.

Preventing recurrence of diverticulitis (secondary prevention)

Rifaximin

Rifaximin is a poorly absorbed drug that provides antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory benefits in the gut. No systematic review or meta-analysis has been published on the topic of rifaximin for diverticulitis since 2011, when it was demonstrated that rifaximin significantly reduced symptoms of diverticulitis at 1 year. Rifaximin is more commonly used in Europe, but its cost is often prohibitive in the United States. Recent studies have again attributed symptomatic and quality-of-life benefits to rifaximin following an episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis, but its role in secondary prevention and appropriate dosing (continuous vs. cyclic) have yet to be defined.

Mesalamine

A 2017 Cochrane review of 7 RCTs attempted to investigate the efficacy of mesalamine in the secondary prevention of diverticulitis. They did not identify a difference in the outcome of recurrent diverticulitis with the use of mesalamine, but noted that the data to support this conclusion is very low quality and the studies were significantly heterogeneous. Though several additional systematic reviews with conflicting evidence exist, just one reports a benefit from the use of mesalamine when compared to placebo or other interventions.

Probiotics

The presumptive purpose of probiotics is to restore healthy intestinal microbiota and prevent a plethora of gastrointestinal diseases. Based on the results of a systematic review published in 2016, there is insufficient evidence to recommend their use in diverticulitis. However, some studies show trends towards improvement in symptoms and recurrence following symptomatic diverticular disease. No additional endpoints have been studied. No societies yet endorse the use of probiotics, and further studies are warranted on this subject.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — mesalamine for prevention of recurrent diverticulitis states that ACP recommends against clinicians using mesalamine to prevent recurrent diverticulitis (strong recommendation; high-certainty evidence). High-certainty evidence shows that mesalamine (dose range, 1.2 to 4.8 g/d) resulted in no difference in risk for recurrent diverticulitis compared with placebo, and low-certainty evidence showed that mesalamine may not improve symptoms. Evidence showed that mesalamine compared with placebo probably results in no difference in urinary tract infection requiring antibiotics (moderate certainty) or serious adverse events (low certainty), but high-certainty evidence showed higher risk for discontinuation due to adverse events. There are no demonstrated clinical benefits but known harms associated with mesalamine therapy, such as epigastric pain, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, rash, and renal and hepatic impairment.

Mesalazine/mesalamine

Mesalamine [also known as mesalazine or 5-aminosalycylic acid (5-ASA)] is a common therapy among patients with ulcerative colitis. Because AD is an inflammatory process and resolution may still leave a low-grade inflammatory status including cryptitis, crypt abscesses, and other architectural changes, mesalamine has been proposed to reproduce its effects in ulcerative colitis to prevent or reduce recurrence of AD disease. Several double-blind and open RCTs have assessed the role of mesalamine in the prevention of AD recurrence. Most of them showed inconclusive results compared with placebo. – A recent Cochrane review revised the efficacy of mesalamine for the prevention of recurrent AD and included 1805 patients in seven studies judged to have unclear or high risk of bias. The results showed no significant difference for mesalamine compared with placebo (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.91–1.06; p = 0.63). In addition, an American Gastroenterological Association review on acute diverticular disease analyzed six included clinical trials and found that mesalamine probably does not reduce recurrence risk and could in fact increase the risk of surgery (RR 1.82; 95% CI 0.47–7.03), suggesting that 5-ASA usage should be applied with caution until consistent and quality evidence is available.

NSAID and aspirin treatment

No studies have evaluated the effect of NSAIDs or aspirin on patients with prior history of AD, but indirect evidence suggests that these drugs increase the risk of AD. These indirect conclusions can be drawn from data from a long cohort study of 47,000 patients without a history of AD. The results showed that NSAIDs increased the risk of diverticulitis recurrence [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.72; 95% CI 1.40–2.11] and complicated diverticulitis (adjusted HR 2.55; 95% CI 1.32–4.95). Aspirin usage was also studied and increased the risk of AD by up to 20% (adjusted HR 1.2; 95% CI 1.05–1.47). These data, however, must be considered with caution because aspirin use in patients with prior history of cardiovascular events must be maintained, regardless of a history of AD events.

8 Recurrence and Secondary Prevention

Risk of recurrence after an initial diverticulitis episode managed medically ranges between 11% and 36%. Recurrence risk increases with each episode, with an estimated risk of 20%–55% after a second recurrence. Identifying strategies to prevent recurrent diverticulitis is an active area of investigation. Studies of medications such as mesalamine, rifaximin, and probiotics have had disappointing results. The only strategy shown to reduce risk of recurrent diverticulitis is surgical resection of the affected colon. Three randomized trials comparing elective surgery to medical management demonstrated that diverticulitis 5 year recurrence risk after surgery is ~4%–10% compared to ~30%–60% with medical management. Observational studies have demonstrated similar recurrence rates.

Age may play a role in risk of diverticulitis recurrence. A population‐based study of 8606 patients with diverticulitis demonstrated a strong association between increasing age at index episode and recurrence. In this study, for every 10 years of increased age at the index episode, risk of recurrence nearly doubled. Another study using Medicare claims data found a negative association between increasing age and risk of recurrence when considering only patients older than age 65. A single institution prospective study of 686 inpatients with diverticulitis found no difference in recurrence when comparing three age groups (< 45 years, 46–70 years and > 70 years). Due to different patient populations and statistical methods, the association between age and recurrence is not yet clear. Factors that contribute to the interplay between age and recurrence warrant further investigation.

Case example part 3: This patient goes on to have three additional episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis over the next year, two of which require inpatient hospitalization due to symptom severity. She now has been experiencing chronic, mild left lower quadrant discomfort for months. She experiences more fatigue and has trouble walking her dog and difficulty leaving the house to spend time with her grandchildren. She is worried about another unexpected hospitalization and feels frustrated by her persistent symptoms. She asks if there is anything she can do to find relief.

Prevention of recurrence following an episode of AD

After one episode of AD, 15–30% of patients will develop a recurrent episode, although a recent large population-based cohort study reported a lower 11.2% recurrence rate of hospital admission, lower than previously reported, which seems greater in women and younger people. The second episode carries another 30% risk of having a third event, but the first episode seems the most severe. Patients also present often chronic abdominal pain after an AD event that may be difficult to manage. Although quality evidence is still insufficient to identify the best preventive treatment, several secondary prevention strategies have been suggested and include a high-fiber diet, cyclic antibiotic treatment with rifaximin, probiotics, mesalazine treatment, and avoiding NSAIDs. The role of surgery is discussed below (Table 4).

Although some studies evaluating mesalamine in preventing SUDD showed superiority over placebo, the majority of randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses do not demonstrate efficacy in preventing recurrence, and a recent meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials showed no difference between mesalamine and placebo for recurrent diverticulitis (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.96–1.50; p = 0.11).

### Colonoscopy for diagnostic evaluation and interventions to prevent recurrence after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^115kJquV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Interventions to prevent recurrence after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — critical outcomes for mesalamine vs placebo in adult patients with recent episode(s) are reported with certainty ratings and event rates per 100 people. Recurrence was 26 people per 100 with placebo vs 28 people per 100 with mesalamine (Certainty of evidence HIGH). Serious adverse events were 10 people per 100 with placebo vs 11 people per 100 with mesalamine (Certainty of evidence LOW). Discontinuation due to adverse events was 16 people per 100 with placebo vs 23 people per 100 with mesalamine (Certainty of evidence HIGH). Evidence suggests that symptom scores may not differ between mesalamine and placebo (Certainty of evidence LOW). Urinary tract infections were 8 people per 100 with placebo vs 7 people per 100 with mesalamine (Certainty of evidence MODERATE). Background notes that recurrence occurs in about 8% to 36% of patients, and evidence was very uncertain (insufficient) for other adverse events (sepsis, acute myocardial infarction) and for surgery for recurrent acute diverticulitis; interventions evaluated included pharmacologic interventions vs. placebo or alternative pharmacologic intervention, nonpharmacologic interventions vs. usual care or alternative nonpharmacologic interventions, and elective surgery vs. no or deferred elective surgery.

### Colonoscopy for diagnostic evaluation and interventions to prevent recurrence after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112hsD8o]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to prevent recurrence of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 4 publications compared mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) with placebo in acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis, with an additional single-group harms study at 4.8 g/day. All outcomes were rated as critical. High-certainty evidence showed that mesalamine results in no difference in risk for recurrence when compared with placebo at 9 to 24 months of follow-up (absolute risk difference [ARD], 2.7% [CI, −1.6% to 7.5%]), and low-certainty evidence showed that there may be no differences in symptom scores. High-certainty evidence showed an increase in discontinuation of mesalamine due to adverse events (ARD, 7.1% [CI, 1.5% to 13.9%]), whereas moderate-certainty evidence showed that mesalamine probably results in no difference in serious adverse events (rates ranged between 0% and 1% across mesalamine groups; ARD, 1.1% [CI, −2.0% to 5.2%]). Evidence was very uncertain (insufficient) for rifaximin, probiotics, combinations with mesalamine, and burdock tea, and was very uncertain about the effect of mesalamine on other specific adverse events and on surgery for recurrent acute diverticulitis.

Table 3 — Population details for studies of interventions to prevent recurrence after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis include the following representative data. For mesalamine vs placebo, 6 RCTs in 4 publications (1898) enrolled patients with no previous episodes: 45%-100% or 1 previous episode: 47%-60%, with mean age 55–62 y and 31%-54% male. For elective surgery RCTs, 2 RCTs in 4 publications (216) reported mean number of previous episodes 3.1–4.1 and abscess 42%-58%, with mean age 53–57 y and 28%-63% male. Observational cohorts included 1 observational study (7072) with ≥ 1 previous episode: 10%-16% and median age 56–58 y with 46%-52% male, and 16 observational studies, single-group case series (337 748) with uncomplicated 76%-89%, 100%, or 0% and complicated 11%-24%, 0%, or 100%, and mean age 29–74 y with 29%-63% male.

### Treatment of diverticular disease with aminosalicylates: the evidence [^1166P66X]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Colonic diverticulosis is an increasingly common condition in Western industrialized countries. About 20% of patients develop symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, changes in bowel habits, and, eventually, diverticulitis or other complications. The management of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) and the prevention of acute diverticulitis remains a challenge for the clinician. The rationale for the use of aminosalicylates, such as mesalazine, is based on the assumption of low-grade inflammation in SUDD and symptoms generation, whereas an overt inflammation may induce diverticulitis in patients with diverticular disease. Clinical scenarios in which the efficacy and safety of mesalazine have been studied include SUDD, prevention of diverticulitis, and of recurrent diverticulitis. Data from uncontrolled studies suggest a benefit of mesalazine on patients with SUDD, whereas data from randomized controlled trials showed some evidence of improvement of symptoms, although contrasting results are reported. The largest study so far published on the efficacy of mesalamine in the prevention of recurrence of diverticulitis showed that mesalamine was not superior to placebo. At this time, the role of mesalazine in the prevention of acute diverticulitis remains to be defined with many issues open and unresolved.

### Diverticular disease: evolving concepts in classification, presentation, and management [^115RuJLi]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diverticular disease is the most commonly reported finding at the time of colonoscopy and one of the most common gastrointestinal indications for hospitalization. Much of our previous understanding of diverticular disease has recently been challenged.

Recent Findings

There is emerging evidence that the long-accepted hypothesis of diverticulosis as a consequence of fiber deficiency may be more complex than commonly thought, with recent evidence suggesting that high-fiber diet and frequent bowel movements are associated with a greater and not lower prevalence of diverticular disease. There is also emerging support for the concept of low-grade inflammation in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD), and the role of anti-inflammatory treatment with mesalamine is being actively investigated. Additionally, elective 'prophylactic' surgery after diverticulitis, previously considered after a second confirmed diverticulitis episode, is being increasingly deferred.

Summary

The pathogenesis of diverticular disease is likely multifactorial and complex. More studies are needed to evaluate the role of fiber in the pathogenesis and treatment of diverticular disease. The search for an effective medical therapy for SUDD and to prevent recurrent diverticulitis is being actively investigated. The efficacy of mesalamine does not appear to be strong data supported.

### Evaluation and management after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a systematic review [^1153ntBS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The value of interventions used after acute colonic diverticulitis is unclear.

Purpose

To evaluate postdiverticulitis colonoscopy and interventions to prevent recurrent diverticulitis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from 1 January 1990 through 16 November 2020.

Study Selection

Comparative studies of interventions of interest reporting critical or important outcomes, and larger single-group studies to evaluate prevalence of colonoscopy findings and harms.

Data Extraction

6 researchers extracted study data and risk of bias. The team assessed strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

19 studies evaluated colonoscopy. Risk for prevalent colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with the general population is unclear. Based on low-strength evidence, long-term CRC diagnosis is similar with or without colonoscopy. High-strength evidence indicates that risk for prevalent CRC is higher among patients with complicated diverticulitis and colonoscopy complications are rare. Based on high-strength evidence, mesalamine does not reduce recurrence risk (6 randomized controlled trials [RCTs]). Evidence on other nonsurgical interventions is insufficient. For patients with prior complicated or smoldering or frequently recurrent diverticulitis, elective surgery is associated with reduced recurrence (3 studies; high strength). In 19 studies, serious surgical complications were uncommon.

Limitations

Few RCTs provided evidence. Heterogeneity of treatment effect was not adequately assessed.

Conclusion

It is unclear whether patients with recent acute diverticulitis are at increased risk for prevalent CRC, but those with complicated diverticulitis are at increased risk. Mesalamine is ineffective in preventing recurrence; other nonsurgical treatments have inadequate evidence. Elective surgery reduces recurrence in patients with prior complicated or smoldering or frequently recurrent diverticulitis, but it is unclear which of these patients may benefit most.

Mesalazine

A systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration published in 2017 included 7 randomized trials (RCTs) with a total of 1805 participants. All seven studies had an uncertain or high risk of bias. The authors found no evidence of an effect when comparing mesalazine versus control for the prevention of recurrent diverticulitis (31.3% versus 29.8%; RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.43–1.09; very low quality of evidence).

In a further meta-analysis by Kahn et al.RCTs comparing the effect of mesalazine versus placebo on diverticulitis recurrence in patients with symptomatic DD were included. Six RCTs enrolling a total of 1918 patients were identified. There was no difference in diverticulitis recurrence between mesalazine and placebo groups (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.96–1.50, p = 0.11). There was a low level of heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 9%, p = 0.36). When the mesalazine dose was ≤ 2 g/day, there was no difference in the relapse rate between the two groups (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.79–1.54, p = 0.58). When the mesalazine dose was > 2 g/day, the risk of relapse was higher in the mesalazine group (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.02–1.62, p = 0.04). The authors concluded that mesalazine does not prevent the recurrence of diverticulitis.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^111AXjEz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

An expert panel composed of six gastroenterologists with long-lasting experience in DD was involved in the identification of the major open questions regarding the medical management of DD. In a face-to-face meeting, chaired by a panel moderator experienced in facilitating group discussions and criteria development, the experts were asked to generate relevant clinical questions using the Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) format (Table 1). Based on the PICO questions identified, a detailed and broad literature search was performed from inception to 12 April 2023, without language restriction, following the modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Studies selected included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies assessing the role of lifestyle interventions or medical treatment, that is, rifaximin and mesalazine (often prescribed in patients with SUDD or with a previous episode of diverticulitis, even if not approved in any jurisdiction), and probiotics. When available, results of meta-analyses or systematic reviews were utilized as the primary source of information/data. References of the papers selected were also checked to identify additional papers of potential interest. The final list of references was also evaluated by the panel experts, who were asked to check for any lack of relevant studies. Discordance regarding the pertinence of the study to address each PICO was resolved in a face-to-face meeting.

### Colonoscopy for diagnostic evaluation and interventions to prevent recurrence after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117UFmn4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on the role of colonoscopy for diagnostic evaluation of colorectal cancer (CRC) after a presumed diagnosis of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis and on the role of pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and elective surgical interventions to prevent recurrence after initial treatment of acute complicated and uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis. This guideline is based on the current best available evidence about benefits and harms, taken in the context of costs and patient values and preferences.

Methods

The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) based these recommendations on a systematic review on the role of colonoscopy after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis and pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and elective surgical interventions after initial treatment. The systematic review evaluated outcomes rated by the CGC as critical or important. This guideline was developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with recent episodes of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis.

Recommendation 1

ACP suggests that clinicians refer patients for a colonoscopy after an initial episode of complicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in patients who have not had recent colonoscopy (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends against clinicians using mesalamine to prevent recurrent diverticulitis (strong recommendation; high-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP suggests that clinicians discuss elective surgery to prevent recurrent diverticulitis after initial treatment in patients who have either uncomplicated diverticulitis that is persistent or recurs frequently or complicated diverticulitis (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision whether or not to undergo surgery should be personalized based on a discussion of potential benefits, harms, costs, and patient's preferences.

Values and preferences for post-diverticulitis management — values and preferences may vary by patient. No literature was identified that assessed patient values and preferences for pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic treatments after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis. One study surveyed preferences for elective surgery and reported that shared decision making, well-formulated patient values, and feeling informed and supported were associated with lower risk for treatment choice regret and greater patient satisfaction. Feedback from the CGC Public Panel showed a strong preference for management without mesalamine, and no trends in preferences were observed for management with elective surgery.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^112D4FZ4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Another relevant outcome, acute diverticulitis prevention, has been scarcely studied. This would be an important issue since several epidemiological studies showed increasing acute diverticulitis incidence especially in Western countries.– At now, there are still no shared pharmacologic approaches for primary and secondary prevention of acute diverticulitis. Treatment interventions for reducing the risk of an acute episode are crucial, especially in the first 2 years after the acute event because of the greater incidence of recurrence registered in that period. While for mesalazine the existing literature shows proof of non-efficacy, for rifaximin there is evidence to suggest a hypothetical benefit. Thus, the management of patients with previous diverticulitis is still an important unmet need, as no clear conclusions can be drawn on treatment options in this context, due to the low quality and scarce evidence available.

Evidence suggesting the protective role of dietary and lifestyle factors (i.e. high-fiber diet, smoking cessation, body weight reduction, and physical activity promotion), on the risk of complicated DD comes only from epidemiological studies. Intervention studies assessing lifestyle factors in DD patients, an important area of interest, are currently unavailable. Since studies evaluating the effect of a high-fiber diet on pain reduction are of low quality and heterogeneous, it is not possible to draw a solid conclusion on the potential benefit of dietary or supplementary fiber in SUDD patients. Although there is a lack of intervention studies evaluating the effect of dietary and lifestyles, it is reasonable to believe that they may still be useful suggestions for preventing disease complications. However, the scarcity of solid evidence supporting dietary fiber and the lack of intervention studies evaluating lifestyle habits on DD certainly are among the unmet needs linked to SUDD management.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^116FWaGC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

Diverticular disease (DD) represents a common gastrointestinal condition that poses a heavy burden on healthcare systems worldwide. A high degree of uncertainty surrounds the therapeutic approaches for the control of symptoms in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) and primary and secondary prevention of diverticulitis and its consequences.

Objectives:

To review the current knowledge and discuss the unmet needs regarding the management of SUDD and the prevention of acute diverticulitis.

Eligibility criteria:

Randomized trials, observational studies, and systematic reviews on lifestyle/dietary interventions and medical treatment (rifaximin, mesalazine, and probiotics) of SUDD or prevention of acute diverticulitis.

Sources of evidence:

The literature search was performed from inception to April 2023, without language restriction, following the modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. References of the papers selected were checked to identify additional papers of potential interest. The final list of references was evaluated by a panel of experts, who were asked to check for any lack of relevant studies.

Charting methods:

Information on patient population, study design, intervention, control group, duration of the observation, and outcomes assessed was collected by two authors independently.

Results:

The review shows a high degree of uncertainty about therapeutic interventions, both dietary/lifestyle and pharmacological, in patients with SUDD, because of the scarcity and weakness of existing evidence. Available studies are generally of low quality, heterogeneous, and outdated, precluding the possibility to draw robust conclusions. Similarly, acute diverticulitis prevention has been seldom investigated, and there is a substantial lack of evidence supporting the role of dietary/lifestyle or pharmacological approaches to reduce the risk of diverticulitis.

Conclusion:

The lack of robust evidence regarding therapeutic options for gastrointestinal symptoms in SUDD patients and for primary and secondary prevention of acute diverticulitis remains an important unmet need in the management of DD.

### Effect of mesalazine on recurrence of diverticulitis in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease: a meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111bnco7]. Colorectal Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

he aim was to investigate the effect of mesalazine on the recurrence of diverticulitis in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD).

Methods

We performed a systematic review and conducted a search of electronic information sources to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of mesalazine on the recurrence of diverticulitis in patients with SUDD. We used the Cochrane tool to assess the quality of included studies. Random effects models were applied to calculate pooled outcome data. Trial sequential analysis was performed to assess the possibility of type I or II errors and to compute the information size required for conclusive meta-analysis.

Results

We identified six RCTs which enrolled a total of 1918 patients. There was no difference in the recurrence of diverticulitis between the mesalazine and placebo groups (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.96–1.50, P = 0.11). A low level of heterogeneity among the studies existed (I 2 = 9%, P = 0.36). When the mesalazine dose was ≤ 2 g/day, there was no difference in recurrence rate between the two groups (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.79–1.54, P = 0.58). When the mesalazine dose was > 2 g/day, the risk of recurrence was higher in the mesalazine group (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02–1.62, P = 0.04). The information size was calculated as 2461 patients. Trial sequential analysis showed that the meta-analysis was conclusive and the risk of type II error was minimal.

Conclusions

Mesalazine does not prevent the recurrence of diverticulitis in patients with SUDD. Further studies are required to investigate the role of mesalazine as an adjunct to other medical agents in the prevention of diverticulitis in patients with SUDD.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^112tbaLB]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

A more recent systematic review summarized the evidence deriving from studies that tested the effectiveness of mesalazine in preventing the recurrence of acute diverticulitis episodes. Authors identified six randomized trials comparing treatment with mesalazine in various doses and schedules of administration versus placebo, for a total of 1898 participants. The meta-analysis of the six RCTs found a summary OR of 1.15 (95% CI: 0.92–1.44) for diverticulitis recurrence with mesalazine. No dose–effect relationship was documented. In the same systematic review, four RCTs reported time to relapse, but with conflicting results. Parente et al. reported worse outcomes with mesalazine: patients treated with mesalazine 1.6 g/day (10 days per month) had a shorter mean time to relapse than patients treated with placebo [MD, −151 days (95% CI: −366 to −66 days)]. The other three studies found no statistically significant differences between mesalazine and placebo.

The role of mesalazine in the prevention of recurrence of diverticulitis was also investigated in a few non-randomized studies.

The two observational studies previously discussed comparing mesalazine versus rifaximin, produced conflicting results.

In another study on 218 patients, the combination of mesalazine and rifaximin (109 patients treated with rifaximin 400 mg bid plus mesalazine 800 mg bid for 7 days, followed by rifaximin 400 mg bid plus mesalazine 800 mg bid for 7 days/month) was shown to be more effective than rifaximin alone (109 patients treated with rifaximin 400 mg bid for 7 days, followed by rifaximin 400 mg bid for 7 days/month) in relieving symptoms (absence of symptoms at 12 months: 86% versus 49%; p < 0.0005) and in preventing the recurrence of diverticulitis (12-month recurrence rate of 2.8% versus 18.0%).

Despite non-randomized studies suggesting a possible benefit of mesalazine in preventing the recurrence of diverticulitis, this is not confirmed by double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The high risk of selection bias in non-randomized studies represents a major methodological flaw limiting the interpretation of the results.

### Sigmoid diverticulitis: a systematic review [^1111HB3U]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Diverticulitis is a common disease. Recent changes in understanding its natural history have substantially modified treatment paradigms.

Objective

To review the etiology and natural history of diverticulitis and recent changes in treatment guidelines.

Evidence Review

We searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for English-language articles pertaining to diagnosis and management of diverticulitis published between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2013. Search terms applied to 4 thematic topics: pathophysiology, natural history, medical management, and indications for surgery. We excluded small case series and articles based on data accrued prior to 2000. We hand searched the bibliographies of included studies, yielding a total of 186 articles for full review. We graded the level of evidence and classified recommendations by size of treatment effect, according to the guidelines from the American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.

Findings

Eighty articles met criteria for analysis. The pathophysiology of diverticulitis is associated with altered gut motility, increased luminal pressure, and a disordered colonic microenvironment. Several studies examined histologic commonalities with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome but were focused on associative rather than causal pathways. The natural history of uncomplicated diverticulitis is often benign. For example, in a cohort study of 2366 of 3165 patients hospitalized for acute diverticulitis and followed up for 8.9 years, only 13.3% of patients had a recurrence and 3.9%, a second recurrence. In contrast to what was previously thought, the risk of septic peritonitis is reduced and not increased with each recurrence. Patient-reported outcomes studies show 20% to 35% of patients managed nonoperatively progress to chronic abdominal pain compared with 5% to 25% of patients treated operatively. Randomized trials and cohort studies have shown that antibiotics and fiber were not as beneficial as previously thought and that mesalamine might be useful. Surgical therapy for chronic disease is not always warranted.

Conclusions and Relevance

Recent studies demonstrate a lesser role for aggressive antibiotic or surgical intervention for chronic or recurrent diverticulitis than was previously thought necessary.

### Management of colonic diverticular disease in the third millennium: highlights from a symposium held during the United European Gastroenterology week 2017 [^111FcVz3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Prevention of recurrence of acute diverticulitis is a clear objective after recovery, but the best therapy has yet to be definedand several options (including, high-fiber diet, poorly absorbed antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, probiotics and surgery) have been proposed. An open-label, proof-of-concept studycompared 3.5 g of high-fiber supplementation twice daily (b.i.d.), with or without 1 week per month of rifaximin (400 mg b.i.d.) for 1 year. Recurrences occurred in 10.4% of patients given rifaximin plus fibers versus 19.3% of patients receiving fiber alone. Mesalazine has also been tested in the prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis. Most studies (including the two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trials,) and a very recent meta-analysisfailed to show a positive effect with mesalazine. In a small, retrospective, observational, long-term study, treatment with rifaximin (800 mg daily, 10 days a month) was more effective than mesalazine (2.4 g daily, 10 days a month) in preventing recurrence of acute diverticulitis.

It is worthwhile to emphasize that the treatment of diverticular disease relies mainly on data from uncontrolled studies, whose methodological quality is suboptimal. Indeed, only one long-term double-blind placebo-controlled study could be identified in the literature. Therefore, while the available studies show some evidence of symptom improvement with pharmacologic treatments, the best approach to SUDD (and especially to the primary and secondary prevention of acute diverticulitis) remains to be established.

### New strategies for the management of diverticular disease: insights for the clinician [^112NVX7g]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Diverticulosis is one of the most common gastrointestinal conditions affecting the general population in the Western world. It is estimated that over 2.5 million people are affected by diverticular disease in the United States. The spectrum of clinical manifestations of diverticulosis ranges from asymptomatic diverticulosis to complicated diverticulitis. Treatment for symptomatic diverticular disease is largely based on symptoms. Traditional therapy includes fiber, bowel rest, antibiotics, pain control and surgery for selected cases. This review discusses recent advances in the medical treatment of diverticular disease such as the use of mesalamine, rifaximin and probiotics as our understanding of the disease evolves.

Goals of therapy in diverticular disease should be to improve symptoms and to prevent recurrent attacks in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, and to prevent the complications of disease such as diverticulitis. Inflammation seems to play a key role in all forms of the disease. This is the rationale for the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as mesalazine. Inflammation in such diseases seems to be generated by a heightened production of proinflammatory cytokines, reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced intramucosal synthesis of nitric oxide. The mechanisms of action of mesalazine are not yet well understood. It is an anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits factors of the inflammatory cascade (such as cyclooxygenase) and free radicals, and has an intrinsic antioxidant effect. Some recent studies confirm the efficacy of mesalazine in diverticular disease both in relief of symptoms in symptomatic uncomplicated forms and in prevention of recurrence of symptoms and main complications.

### Efficacy of 5-ASA in the treatment of colonic diverticular disease [^112CdTKh]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the therapeutic efficacy of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in patients with colonic diverticular disease performing a systematic review of the literature.

Data Sources

Cochrane Trial Register (until Issue 4, 2008), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (1966 to October 1, 2008), Excerpta Medica Database (1980 to October 1, 2008), and abstracts from the major US, European, and Asian gastroenterology conferences. Expert opinions sought and reference lists of identified studies and any relevant published reviews checked.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trial (RCT) or a controlled clinical trial with a parallel group design using 5-ASA as 1 treatment arm.

Results

Six RCTs enrolling 818 patients were found: 3 were performed in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis, and the remaining in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease. The results of these studies showed that patients treated with 5-ASA had significantly better outcomes and that also mesalazine scheduled daily was superior to cyclic administration to prevent relapse of diverticular disease. However, several of these studies have not included an endoscopy at the start of the study and when patients had recurrences.

Conclusions

From this systematic review, it seems that 5-ASAs may have a role in patients with colonic diverticular disease. However, high-quality well-designed RCTs are necessary to confirm these initial observations.

### Colonoscopy for diagnostic evaluation and interventions to prevent recurrence after acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^115kr9WU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Values and preferences — diverticulitis follow-up and recurrence management: No systematic reviews were identified assessing patient values and preferences for follow-up colonoscopy or for treatments after recurrence; a survey analyzed responses from 133 adult patients treated for uncomplicated or complicated diverticulitis with conservative management or elective surgery between 2014 and 2019 and found that shared decision making, well-formulated values, and feeling informed and supported were associated with lower treatment choice regret and greater satisfaction, although the study had a high risk of response bias (14%). Feedback from the CGC Public Panel showed a preference for follow-up colonoscopy after initial treatment of acute complicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis and an even stronger preference for management of postacute left-sided colonic diverticulitis without mesalamine, with no trend observed for preferences regarding planned elective surgery versus conservative treatment or observation.

### Mesalazine for the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease of the colon and for primary prevention of diverticulitis: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^1172d5rX]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) is a common gastrointestinal disease, because it affects about one fourth of the patient harboring colonic diverticula.

Goal

To assess the effectiveness of mesalazine in improving symptoms (namely abdominal pain) and in preventing diverticulitis occurrence in patients with SUDD.

Study

Only randomized clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) that compared mesalazine with placebo or any other therapy in SUDD were evaluated. The selected endpoints were symptom relief and diverticulitis occurrence at maximal follow-up. Absolute risk reduction (ARR, with 95% confidence interval) and the number needed to treat were used as measures of the therapeutic effect.

Results

Six randomized clinical trials enrolled 1021 patients: 526 patients were treated with mesalazine and 495 with placebo or other therapies. Symptom relief with mesalazine was always larger than that with placebo and other therapies. However, absolute risk reduction was significant only when mesalazine was compared with placebo, a high-fiber diet, and low-dose rifaximin. The incidence of diverticulitis with mesalazine was lower than that observed with placebo and other treatments, being significant only when compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Mesalazine is effective in achieving symptom relief and primary prevention of diverticulitis in patients with SUDD.

The AGA suggests that colonoscopy be performed after resolution of acute diverticulitis in appropriate candidates to exclude the misdiagnosis of a colonic neoplasm if a high-quality examination of the colon has not been recently performed. The AGA suggests against elective colonic resection in patients with an initial episode of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, and states that the decision to perform elective prophylactic colonic resection in this setting should be individualized. The AGA suggests a fiber-rich diet or fiber supplementation in patients with a history of acute diverticulitis. The AGA suggests against routinely advising patients with a history of diverticulitis to avoid consumption of seeds, nuts, and popcorn. The AGA suggests against routinely advising patients with a history of diverticulitis to avoid the use of aspirin. The AGA suggests advising patients with a history of diverticulitis to avoid the use of nonaspirin NSAIDs if possible. The AGA recommends against the use of mesalamine after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The AGA suggests against the use of rifaximin after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The AGA suggests against the use of probiotics after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The AGA suggests advising patients with diverticular disease to consider vigorous physical activity.

### Colonic diverticular disease: medical treatments for acute diverticulitis [^113jEd23]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diverticula (mucosal outpouchings through the wall of the colon) are rare before the age of 40 years, after which prevalence increases steadily and reaches over 25% by 60 years. However, only 10% to 25% of affected people will develop symptoms such as lower abdominal pain. Recurrent symptoms are common, and 5% of people with diverticula eventually develop complications such as perforation, obstruction, haemorrhage, fistulae, or abscesses.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of medical treatments for acute diverticulitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 193 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 75 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 37 studies and the further review of 38 full publications. Of the 38 full articles evaluated, four systematic reviews and one RCT were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for two PICO combinations

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for one comparison based on information about the effectiveness and safety of medical treatment (mesalazine, antibiotics [any] only) versus placebo or no treatment.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^113h2ZWR]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Mesalazine

Mesalazine has been proposed as a treatment for low-grade inflammation of the colonic mucosa in SUDD. To date, three meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on mesalazine treatment have been published, – one of which included only studies in patients with previous diverticulitis.

The meta-analysis by Iannone et al. included both studies on SUDD and studies on acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Regarding SUDD, only one RCT (123 patients) evaluated the remission of symptoms using mesalazine (3000 mg/day for 6 weeks) versus placebo, without showing a benefit for mesalazine use [odds ratio (OR): 1.04; 95% CI: 0.8–1.34]. As for symptomatic relapses, two RCTs conducted in SUDD patients were identified, for a total of 216 patients. Treatment with mesalazine (1600 mg/day for 12 months) was associated with a significant reduction (48%) in the risk of symptomatic relapse (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.28–0.97). There was a reduction in diverticula-related symptoms with mesalazine compared to control interventions (placebo, rifaximin, or Lactobacillus casei sub-species DG) in four of six studies of symptomatic uncomplicated DD.– In the analysis of two studies of SUDD patients reporting a global symptom score, a lower mean score was found with mesalazine (800 or 1600 mg/day for 10 days/month for 6–12 months) compared to control interventions at maximum follow-up (2 studies, 326 participants, SMD = −1.01, 95% CI: −1.51 to −0.52). However, the global symptom score included also upper GI symptoms, thus reducing the clarity of these results.

Medical treatment in patients with previous diverticulitis with or without GI symptoms

Rifaximin

The role of rifaximin in the prevention of recurrent diverticulitis has been evaluated in a few studies, most of them non-randomized. In a multicenter, randomized open-label study conducted on 165 patients with a recent diagnosis of acute diverticulitis, the combination of rifaximin (400 mg twice a day for 7 days a month) and fibers (3.5 g/day) was demonstrated to be more effective than fibers alone in preventing recurrence at 48 weeks (10.4% versus 19.0%). In multivariable analysis, the risk of relapse for the fiber supplement-only group compared with supplement + rifaximin was 2.64 (HR; 95% CI: 1.08–6.46; p = 0.033). Regarding gastrointestinal symptoms, no improvements were shown at 48 weeks in either group.

In a retrospective study on patients with a previous acute diverticulitis episode, 72 subjects treated with rifaximin were compared with 52 subjects treated with mesalazine. During a median follow-up of 15 months, the risk of diverticulitis recurrence was 73% lower (HR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.10–0.72) with rifaximin, administered at a dose of 400 mg twice a day for 10 days per month.

In another controlled, non-randomized study, patients with an acute episode of diverticulitis, once remission was achieved, were treated with mesalazine 1.6 g/day (59 patients) or with rifaximin 800 mg/day for 7 days a month (52 patients). The probability of maintaining clinical remission at 24 months was significantly higher in the mesalazine group (p = 0.002).

The paucity of RCTs and the major methodological flaws related to the risk of selection bias in non-randomized studies prevent any clear conclusion regarding the treatments for patients with previous diverticulitis. In this respect, the treatment for the prevention of diverticulitis is crucial, especially in the first 2 years after the acute event because of the greater incidence of recurrence registered in this period. Therefore, in patients with previous diverticulitis, this represents an important unmet need.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^113wdFDF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Based on the hypothesis that diverticular disease may reflect a dysbiosis (see above), probiotics are also being studied in SUDD, although evidence is lacking to support their use routinely and guidelines do not currently recommend then. – Modification of the microbiome combining rifaximin and probiotics in the long term may be worth exploring as a target.

Additional medical therapies for SUDD, such as mesalazine, are controversial. Mesalazine was suggested as potentially effective in the treatment of SUDD in a way similar to its effects on inflammatory bowel disease, based on the pathogenic hypothesis that a low-grade level of inflammation is present in the colonic mucosa of patients with SUDD. Only the Polish guidelines suggest that mesalazine can be used long term in SUDD. However, available individual studies do not confirm that this approach with mesalazine is effective in the treatment of SUDD or in diverticulitis prevention. – A recent meta-analysis did show that mesalazine administration achieves symptomatic relief and reduces diverticulitis occurrence in a larger proportion of patients with SUDD. However, the absolute risk reduction was statistically significant only when mesalazine was compared with placebo, a high-fiber diet and low-dose rifaximin. Mesalazine seems to be effective in preventing diverticulitis occurrence from SUDD, but not in preventing secondary diverticulitis recurrence. The difference between these entities could be because SUDD can be linked to mucosal inflammation, whereas AD is characterized by transmural inflammation, leading to fibrosis, which may be the key feature explaining mesalazine effectiveness in SUDD but not in diverticulitis.

Finally, anticholinergic and antispasmodic agents have been tested concerning the pathogenic presence of hypermotility of the colon in patients with diverticulosis; however, there is no adequate evidence documenting a benefit. –

### Diverticulitis, AAA, multiple sclerosis, iron deficiency… [^11698gGS]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

What lifestyle recommendations should be provided to patients to prevent diverticulitis and recurrent diverticulitis. Consumption of popcorn, nuts, or seeds is not a risk factor for developing diverticulitis. A high-fiber diet is associated with a lower incidence of diverticular disease, but evidence about whether it prevents the recurrence of diverticulitis is lacking. Tobacco cessation, reduced meat intake, physical activity, and weight loss are recommended interventions to decrease the risk of recurrence. Do all patients with diverticulitis require treatment with antibiotics. No. Select patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis can be treated without antibiotics. A meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials with 2, 505 patients showed that those treated without antibiotics had shorter hospital stays than those treated with antibiotics, and there was no difference in complication or readmission rates. Who should be screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The U.

S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends one-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men 65 to 75 years of age who have ever smoked and selective screening with ultrasonography in men 65 to 75 years of age with risk factors for AAA who have never smoked, rather than routinely screening all men in this group. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA in women 65 to 75 years of age who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA. Are intravenous steroids more effective than oral steroids in treating acute relapses of multiple sclerosis. There is no difference in effectiveness between oral and intravenous steroids in treating acute relapses of multiple sclerosis. A higher dosage of steroids, such as 1, 000 mg per day of methylprednisolone for three days, is recommended.

Is intravenous iron infusion superior to oral iron for avoiding blood transfusion in adults with iron deficiency anemia. Intravenous iron administration does not reduce the need for blood transfusion compared with oral iron supplementation, based on multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials. What clinical signs and scoring system can help identify testicular torsion. The Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion scoring system should be used if testicular torsion is suspected. Clinical parameters include testicular swelling, hard testicle, absent cremasteric reflex, nausea or vomiting, and high-riding testicle. If the score is 5 or greater, the risk of torsion is highly likely. Additional Online Only AFP Clinical Answers Are epidural steroid injections effective for low back pain. Treatment with epidural steroid injections in the lower spine is not effective for reducing pain and disability.

The injections may be more effective than placebo at short-term follow-up, but the effects are not clinically meaningful. What are first-line medications for generalized anxiety disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are recommended as first-line medications for treating generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Benzodiazepines are not more effective than antidepressants for anxiety disorders and should not be used as first-line therapy. When should secondary causes be evaluated in patients who present with a headache. Patients with a headache and red flags in their history or physical examination warrant further investigation for secondary causes of headache.

Treatment with mesalazine, rifaximin or probiotics has not been found to prevent recurrent episodes of diverticulitis or even control persistent symptoms after an episode of AD. An increase in dietary fibre or supplemental fibre is widely accepted to be of benefit for general health and should be recommended, but there is little evidence that it reduces current symptoms or recurrence of symptoms. Patients should be provided with written advice on discharge.

Question 1.8

Which patients with acute diverticulitis should be considered for laparoscopic lavage?

Recommendation: Laparoscopic lavage is currently not recommended for treatment of complicated acute diverticulitis but may be an acceptable alternative to avoid major resection in high risk patients provided its limitations are communicated to patients.

Level of evidence: I

Grade of recommendation: A

Consensus: 100% (SA 55.6%, A 44.4%)

Perforation associated with AD represents 75% of diverticular emergencies requiring surgery. Complementary to estimates of inflammatory parameters and CT findings, good decision‐making and clinical judgement determine the need for surgery, depending upon the patient's clinical status, comorbidities, immunosuppression, signs of peritonitis and sepsis.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^112VMKPv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This scoping review shows a high degree of uncertainty about therapeutic interventions, both lifestyle and pharmacological, in uncomplicated DD patients because of the scarcity and weakness of existing evidence. It is even more surprising, considering the high DD prevalence, its impact on quality of life, and its heavy burden on healthcare systems.

Regarding SUDD, even if a standardized diagnostic criterion is not yet available, chronic abdominal symptoms attributable to diverticula influenced significantly the quality of life. In fact, in an observational multicenter study, it has been shown that the quality of life of SUDD patients is similar to patients with a previous episode of diverticulitis, likely suggesting that the presence of troublesome recurrent abdominal symptoms is perceived as a full disease similarly to patients who have experienced a diverticular complication.

Unfortunately, as shown in this literature review, since all existing evidence regarding SUDD is of low quality, heterogeneous, and outdated, there are still no clearly agreed therapeutic approaches for improving GI symptoms and preventing acute diverticulitis in this condition. We evaluated the three most common medical treatments utilized in SUDD management such as rifaximin, mesalazine, and probiotics. Particularly, rifaximin associated with fiber appears to be effective in improving GI symptoms (NNT = 3), but a very high NNT (NNT = 57) was found when prevention of acute diverticulitis was considered. However, based on these data, we can conclude that evidence supporting the use of rifaximin for the primary prevention of acute diverticulitis is scarce and probably not cost-effective. In fact, the only RCT showing a positive effect is now dated and no longer replicated. With regard to mesalazine, non-randomized studies suggest a possible benefit of mesalazine in both outcomes considered, but substantial methodological flaws limit the interpretation of the results. On the other hand, the evidence supporting the role of probiotics in SUDD similarly has a low and heterogeneous quality of evidence.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: expert review [^111PGekX]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Colonic diverticulitis is a painful gastrointestinal disease that recurs unpredictably and can lead to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastroenterologists commonly care for patients with this disease. The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide practical and evidence-based advice for management of diverticulitis. We reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies to develop 14 best practices. In brief, computed tomography is often necessary to make a diagnosis. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis. Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course. In patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively rather than routinely in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. At the same time, patients should understand that genetic factors also contribute to diverticulitis risk. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first presentation. An elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of episodes. Instead, a discussion of elective segmental resection should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits.

Three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have also recently assessed the role of mesalazine in treating those patients. The first trial investigated the efficacy and safety of mesalazine granules 3 g/day vs. placebo in patients with lower abdominal pain as a symptom of SUDD. Change in lower abdominal pain to week 4 (baseline defined using pain score from 7 days pre-treatment) was significantly lower in the mesalazine group (P = 0.05) in the per-protocol (PP) but not on intention-to-treat (P = 0.374) population. Post hoc adjustment for confounding factors resulted in P = 0.005 (PP). Safety was comparable. The second trial assessed the effectiveness of mesalazine, with or without probiotic, vs. placebo in maintaining remission in SUDD patients. Four groups were randomly enrolled: Group M (active mesalazine 1.6 g/day plus Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) subsp. DG placebo), Group L (active L. casei subsp. DG 24 billion/day plus mesalazine placebo), Group LM (active L. casei subsp. DG 24 billion/day plus active mesalazine), Group P (L. casei subsp. DG placebo plus mesalazine placebo). SUDD recurred in none (0%) of the patients in group LM, in 7 (13.7%) patients in group M, in 8 (14.5%) patients in group L, and in 23 (46.0%) patients in group P (LM group vs. M group, P = 0.015; LM group vs. L group, P = 0.011; LM group vs. P group, P = 0.000; M group vs. P group, P = 0.0001; L group vs. P group, P = 0.0001). No adverse events were recorded during the study. Another double-blind, placebo-controlled trial not yet published assessed the efficacy of mesalazine in controlling abdominal pain in SUDD as a secondary endpoint. Patients with SUDD underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsies at baseline and after 12-week treatment, completing diaries of pain and bowel habits. Patients were randomized to receive mesalazine 3 g/day (group M) or placebo (group P) for 12 weeks with follow-up visits at 2 and 4 weeks. In Group M but not in Group P there was a significant reduction in the duration of abdominal pain (P = 0.0413). Controlled studies of mesalazine use in such patients are reported in Table 3.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis — conclusions state that colonic diverticulitis is a painful disease that occurs unpredictably; although most patients never experience a perforation or abscess, uncomplicated recurrences are a burden to patients and many worry about recurrence, perforation, and need for surgery. Gastroenterologists can alleviate many of these concerns by making an accurate diagnosis, addressing chronic sequelae, and educating patients on risk factors, prognosis, and indications for surgery. Although the advice in this document is based on low- to moderate-quality evidence, research is ongoing and has the potential to eventually identify better options for diverticulitis treatment and prevention.

### Interventions for prevention of post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease [^117R5niX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrence of Crohn's disease is common after intestinal resection. A number of agents have been studied in controlled trials with the goal of reducing the risk of endoscopic or clinical recurrence of Crohn's disease following surgery.

Objectives

To undertake a systematic review of the use of medical therapies for the prevention of post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched to identify relevant studies. References from selected papers and abstracts from Digestive Disease Week were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that compared medical therapy to placebo or other medical agents for the prevention of recurrence of intestinal Crohn's disease were selected for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors reviewed all abstracts containing search terms, and those meeting inclusion criteria were selected for full data abstraction. Dichotomous data were summarised using relative risk and 95% confidence intervals. A fixed-effects model was used, and sensitivity analysis performed.

Main Results

Twenty-three studies were identified for inclusion. Probiotics were not superior to placebo for any outcome measured. The use of nitroimidazole antibiotics appeared to reduce the risk of clinical (RR 0.23; 95%CI 0.09 to 0.57, NNT = 4) and endoscopic (RR 0.44; 95%CI 0.26 to 0.74, NNT = 4) recurrence relative to placebo. However, these agents were associated with higher risk of serious adverse events (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.7). Mesalamine therapy was associated with a significantly reduced risk of clinical recurrence (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94, NNT = 12), and severe endoscopic recurrence (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.84, NNT = 8) when compared to placebo. Azathioprine/6MP was also associated with a significantly reduced risk of clinical recurrence (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92, NNT = 7), and severe endoscopic recurrence (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.92, NNT = 4), when compared to placebo. Neither agent had a higher risk than placebo of serious adverse events. When compared to azathioprine/6MP, mesalamine was associated with a higher risk of any endoscopic recurrence (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.06), but a lower risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.89). There was no significant difference between mesalamine and azathioprine/6MP for any other outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient randomised controlled trials of infliximab, budesonide, tenovil and interleukin-10 to draw conclusions. Nitro-imidazole antibiotics, mesalamine and immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine/6-MP or infliximab all appear to be superior to placebo for the prevention of post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The cost, toxicity and tolerability of these approaches require careful consideration to determine the optimal approach for post-operative prophylaxis.

### Consensus statement regarding the management of acute diverticulitis… [^1162JtU6]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Importance This Delphi study provides consensus related to many aspects of acute diverticulitis and identifies other areas in need of research. Objective To generate an international, expert-based, consensus statement to address controversies in the management of acute diverticulitis. Design, Setting, and Participants. Interventions The Delphi study used 3 rounds of questions, after which the consensus statement was collated. Main Outcomes and Measures A consensus statement related to the management of acute diverticulitis. Results. Twenty items were selected for inclusion in the consensus statement following 3 rounds of questioning. A clear definition of uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis is provided. In uncomplicated diverticulitis, consensus was reached regarding appropriate laboratory and radiological evaluation of patients as well as nonsurgical, surgical, and follow-up strategies.

A number of important topics, including antibiotic treatment, failed to reach consensus. In addition, consensus was reached regarding many nonsurgical and surgical treatment strategies in complicated diverticulitis. Conclusions and Relevance Controversy continues internationally regarding the management of acute diverticulitis. This study demonstrates that there is more nonconsensus among experts than consensus regarding most issues, even in the same region. It also provides insight into the status quo regarding the treatment of acute diverticulitis and provides important direction for future research. The management of acute diverticulitis has evolved significantly during the past decade. 1–3 This evolution has been driven by a greater understanding of the disease process and has ultimately led to improved patient outcomes. However, there remain many contradictory views as to how to manage both uncomplicated and complicated episodes of acute diverticulitis. 4, 5.

The diversity in practice paradigms appears to be caused by a lack of high-level evidence regarding best practice. This observation is reflected in international guidelines, which are mainly based on low levels of antiquated evidence. However, advances have been made in many aspects of acute diverticulitis management, including antibiotic therapy, surgical techniques, and the setting in which acute diverticulitis can be treated. 6 However, embracing many of these advances into standard practice for acute diverticulitis has been slow. The contents of the study questionnaire were generated using statements that reflected recent published guidelines. The format of the statements was edited and agreed on by senior study authors. The questionnaire was divided into 2 parts. The first part contained statements related to the management of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

The second part contained statements related to the management of complicated diverticulitis. The importance of each statement was assessed using a 9-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating definitely not important; 5, undecided; and 9, definitely important. Fifteen statements had 2 levels of consensus in round 1, with a median score of 7 or greater and an agreement percentage of 80% or more. Fifteen statements had a median score of 3 or less and an agreement percentage of less than 80% and were discarded. Controversies surround almost every aspect of the management of uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis. This Delphi study demonstrates this diversity of opinion clearly by the fact that more than two-thirds of the Delphi statements ultimately failed to reach consensus. However, we do provide 20 statements whereby diverticulitis management can be practiced in line with expert opinion.

Discussion

SUDD is a clinical entity under active debate, since little is known about its clinical and epidemiological aspects. For example, it is estimated that about 20–25% of people having diverticulosis may develop symptoms ranging from abdominal pain to change in bowel habits: what are they suffering from: IBS or SUDD? Some authors still challenge the existence of SUDD because they found no histological inflammation or changes in laboratory tests in people with diverticulosis who reported symptoms. However, the occurrence of symptoms is not enough to classify a patient as suffering from SUDD, because SUDD has specific clinical, histological, laboratory and microbiological/metabolomic characteristics. To overcome the limits of the current debate on the pathophysiology and epidemiology of SUDD, we enrolled only patients with clear evidence of SUDD.

While the pathophysiology is under debate, and the real epidemiology of SUDD is still unknown, there is also a lack of knowledge about the outcomes of the disease. Only 3 studies investigated the outcomes of SUDD in terms of occurrence of acute diverticulitis and its complications, but none of them lasted longer than 5 years. The first study, performed by Salem et al in 2007, assessed 167 SUDD patients during a 5-year follow up. Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis occurred in only 2 patients (1.7% of cases) and only a single patient underwent a sigmoid colectomy for recurrent symptoms. The second study was a prospective, open-label study that compared SUDD patients taking either 800 mg of mesalamine b.i.d. for 10 days every month or no mesalazine. Gatta et al reported acute diverticulitis occurrence in 8 SUDD patients (10.4%) not taking mesalazine during a 5-year follow up. The third was a double-blind placebo-controlled study assessing the role of mesalazine, with or without probiotics, in maintaining remission in SUDD patients during a 1-year follow up. The authors found that acute diverticulitis occurred in 3.5% of patients. This was the first long-term study ever conducted in SUDD patients, and it showed that the risk of acute diverticulitis was higher and more severe than previously reported. We found that acute diverticulitis occurred in a significant percentage of patients and that half of them required surgery. Moreover, the diverticulitis risk in SUDD patients tends to decrease during long-term follow up and disappears after 10 years from the diagnosis of SUDD. These data are significantly worse than the ones reported by Salem et al and by our prior experience, and seems to be similar to that reported by Gatta et al during a shorter follow up. A possible explanation of our results may be that we selected patients using more stringent criteria. Taking all the data together, the risk of acute diverticulitis occurrence in SUDD seems to be significantly higher than the risk in people who have simple diverticulosis, in whom acute diverticulitis occurs in 4.3% of cases. Finally, our results suggest that SUDD also has a significant risk of complications, with a non-negligible risk of death.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^115N6jz9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colonic diverticulosis represents one of the most frequent findings during colonoscopyand diverticular disease (DD) represents a common gastrointestinal condition that poses a heavy burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Over 50% of people over the age of 60 and over 60% of people over age 80 have colonic diverticula.

DD encompasses several clinical scenarios, ranging from asymptomatic diverticulosis to symptomatic uncomplicated or complicated DD (i.e. acute diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding). Although most subjects with DD remain asymptomatic for life (diverticulosis), approximately 15% experience chronic, recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain and/or discomfort, alteration of bowel movements, and bloating in the absence of macroscopic signs of colonic inflammation), a condition termed as symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) that may be difficult to differentiate from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In fact, it is a matter of debate whether SUDD could be considered a disease of its own or whether it represents the coexistence of IBS in patients with colonic diverticula. However, the high prevalence of this condition and the significant impact on quality of life require therapies for the relief of chronic symptoms. About 1–4% of DD patients developed acute diverticulitis (e.g. acute symptoms/signs as fever, acute abdominal pain, and leukocytosis) in its uncomplicated or complicated form (with the presence of abscesses, perforation, fistulas, stenosis, or peritonitis), that can recur in approximately one-third of patients.–

Despite the clinical relevance, the high prevalence of DD, and its impact on quality of life, a high degree of uncertainty surrounds the therapeutic approaches for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in patients with SUDD and primary and secondary prevention of diverticulitis and its consequences.

This scoping review of the literature aims to summarize the current knowledge and discuss the unmet needs regarding the management of SUDD and the prevention of acute diverticulitis.

Concluding remarks

From honing in on specific dietary and genetic associations to refining surgical techniques, the complex landscape of diverticulitis is ever-changing. At a glance, there are more publications on quality of life and cost-effectiveness outcomes. These matters are particularly important as we attempt to become less aggressive in our care, so that we do not inadvertently promote chronic symptoms and recurrent disease in the name of "doing less". Patterns of treatment and societal guidelines remain significantly heterogeneous worldwide. We look forward to the longer-term results of trials from the last decade and ongoing innovation in the field.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^114xqfjA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonabsorbable antibiotics

The only antibiotic proposed for this condition is rifaximin, so far. The suggested dose regimen is 400 mg twice a day over the first week of the month. The role of cyclic rifaximin in preventing AD recurrence has been revisited in three systematic reviews with inconclusive findings of benefit from rifaximin use. – A limited proof-of-concept trial including 165 patients evaluated the effect of 3.5 g fiber supplementation with or without rifaximin 400 mg taken for 1 week per month for 1 year. Recurrences occurred in 10.4% of patients taking rifaximin plus fiber versus 19.3% of patients taking fiber alone. Patients with a prior history of diverticulitis diagnosed at least 1 year from receiving rifaximin also had a lower incidence of recurrence (10% versus 67%). Therefore, although findings are promising, more quality data are needed to strongly recommend the systematic use of cyclic rifaximin for primary and secondary prevention of AD. The multicenter international ROAD trial, which will compare rifaximin versus placebo in the prevention of diverticulitis after a first episode of AD, will be the first to address this question (EudraCT number: 2017–002708).

Probiotics

Bacterial dysbiosis has been proposed as a mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of AD, which suggests that selected probiotics could have a role in recurrence prevention. The first observational study that suggested a possible role of probiotics evaluated the effect of Lactobacillus plus rifaximin in 79 patients with post-diverticulitis colonic stenosis. They found that 88% of patients remained asymptomatic after 12 months of treatment. One small trial of 83 patients evaluated the effect of a high-fiber diet alone versus an Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris suspension plus a high-fiber diet for 2 weeks every month, within the first 3 months after an event of AD. Investigators suggested that probiotic use could reduce by 63% the risk for a second AD relapse (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.08–1.81). One systematic review of 11 studies (four of them on complicated AD) evaluated the efficacy of probiotics in diverticular disease in terms of symptom remission and prevention of AD. A meta-analysis on the efficacy of probiotics in diverticular disease could not be performed because of the poor quality of retrieved studies, and the authors concluded that further investigation is required to assess systematic usage.

### Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid for maintenance of surgically-induced remission in Crohn's disease [^115V4n42]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. 5-Aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) are locally acting, anti-inflammatory compounds that reduce inflammation of the colonic mucosa with release profiles that vary among various commercially available formulations. This updated Cochrane review summarizes current evidence on the use of 5-ASA formulations for maintenance of surgically-induced remission in CD.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of 5-ASA agents for the maintenance of surgically-induced remission in CD.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 16 July 2018. We also searched references, conference abstracts, and trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included participants with CD in remission following surgery and compared 5-ASAs to no treatment, placebo or any other active intervention with duration of at least three months were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome was clinical relapse. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic recurrence, radiologic and surgical relapse, adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events.

Main Results

Fourteen RCTs (1867 participants) were included in the review. Participants (15 to 70 years) were recruited from gastroenterology hospitals and medical clinics in Europe and North America and followed up between 3 and 72 months. The risk of bias was assessed as 'low' in one study, 'unclear' in seven and as 'high' in six. At 12 months, 36% (20/55) of participants in the 5-ASA group experienced clinical relapse compared to 51% (28/55) in the no treatment control group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.10; low certainty evidence). Moderate certainty evidence suggests that 5-ASAs are more effective for preventing clinical relapse than placebo. During a follow-up period of 12 to 72 months, 36% (131/361) of 5-ASA participants relapsed compared to 43% (160/369) of placebo participants (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). At 12 months, 17% (17/101) of the 4 g/day mesalamine group relapsed compared to 26% (27/105) of the 2.4 g/day group (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.13; moderate certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in clinical relapse rates when 5-ASA compounds were compared to purine antimetabolites. At 24 months, 61% (103/170) of mesalamine participants relapsed compared to 67% (119/177) of azathioprine participants (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.07; I² = 28%; low certainty evidence). During 24 months, 50% (9/18) of 5-ASA participants had clinical relapse compared to 13% (2/16) of adalimumab participants (RR 4.0, 95% CI 1.01 to 15.84; low certainty evidence). The effects of sulphasalazine compared to placebo on clinical relapse rate is uncertain. After 18 to 36 months, 66% (95/143) of participants treated with sulphasalazine relapsed compared to 71% (110/155) in the placebo group (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.38; I² = 38%; low certainty evidence). The effect of 5-ASA drugs on safety was uncertain. During 24 months follow-up, 4% (2/55) of 5-ASA participants experienced adverse events compared to none (0/55) in the no treatment control group (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 101.81; very low certainty evidence). An equal proportion of 5-ASA participants (10%; 23/241) and placebo (9%; 20/225) groups experienced an adverse event during a follow-up of 3 to 72 months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.91; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Adverse event rates were similar in the 5-ASA and purine analogues groups. However, serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events were more common in participants who received purine analogues than 5-ASA. At 52 weeks to 24 months, 52% (107/207) of 5-ASA participants had an adverse event compared to 47% (102/218) of purine analogue participants (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.27, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Four per cent (6/152) of 5-ASA participants had a serious adverse event compared to 17% (27/159) of purine analogue participants (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.80; very low certainty evidence). Eight per cent (17/207) of 5-ASA participants withdrew due to an adverse event compared to 19% (42/218) of purine analogue participants (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.83; low certainty evidence). Adverse event rates were similar in high and low dose mesalamine participants. After 12 months, 2% (2/101) of 4 g/day mesalamine participants had an adverse event compared to 2% (2/105) of 2.4 g/day participants (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.24; low certainty evidence). The proportion of participants who experienced adverse events over a 24 month follow-up in the mesalamine group was 78% (14/18) compared to 69% (11/16) of adalimumab participants (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.71; very low certainty evidence). None (0/32) of the sulphasalazine participants had an adverse event at 18 months follow-up compared to 3% (1/34) of the placebo group (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.38; very low certainty evidence). Commonly reported adverse events in the included studies were diarrhoea, nausea, increased liver function tests, pancreatitis, and abdominal pain.

Authors' Conclusions

5-ASA preparations are superior to placebo for the maintenance of surgically-induced clinical remission in patients with CD (moderate certainty). The number needed to treat to prevent one relapse was 13 patients. The evidence for endoscopic remission is uncertain. The sulphasalazine class of 5-ASA agents failed to demonstrate superiority against placebo, 5-ASAs failed to demonstrate superiority compared to no treatment (very low and low certainty). The efficacy of two different doses of the same 5-ASA and the efficacy of 5-ASA compared to purine antimetabolites (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) in maintaining surgically-induced remission of CD remains unclear. However, purine analogues lead to more serious adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events. There is a low certainty that 5-ASA is inferior for maintaining surgically-induced remission of CD compared to biologics (anti TNF-ɑ). 5-ASA formulations appear to be safe with no difference in the occurrence of adverse events or withdrawal when compared with placebo, no treatment or biologics.

### Adalimumab is more effective than azathioprine and mesalamine at preventing postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease: a randomized controlled trial [^116Pjj3R]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Postsurgical recurrence of Crohn's disease (CD) is very frequent and, to date, only infliximab has been shown to be useful in preventing it. The efficacy of adalimumab (ADA) is poorly known. We evaluated whether the administration of ADA after resective intestinal surgery reduces postoperative CD recurrence.

Methods

We randomly assigned 51 patients with CD who had undergone ileocolonic resection to receive after 2 weeks from surgery ADA at the dose of 160/80/40mg every two weeks, azathioprine (AZA) at 2mg/kg/day, or mesalamine at 3g/day, and they were followed up for 2 years. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with endoscopic and clinical recurrence. Secondary end point was the assessment of quality of life by means of a previously validated questionnaire.

Results

The rate of endoscopic recurrence was significantly lower in ADA (6.3%) compared with the AZA (64.7%; odds ratio (OR) = 0.036 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.004–0.347)) and mesalamine groups (83.3%; OR = 0.013 (95% CI 0.001–0.143)). There was a significantly lower proportion of patients in clinical recurrence in the ADA group (12.5%) compared with the AZA (64.7%; OR = 0.078 (95% CI 0.013–0.464)) and mesalamine groups (50%; (OR = 0.143 (95% CI 0.025–0.819)). The quality of life was higher in the ADA (202) than in the AZA (90; OR = 0.028 (95% CI 0.004–0.196)) and mesalamine groups (98; OR = 0.015 (95% CI 0.002–0.134)).

Conclusions

The administration of ADA after intestinal resective surgery was greatly effective in preventing endoscopic and clinical recurrence of CD. Further larger studies are necessary to confirm the therapeutic advantage and to show the economic implications of biologic therapy in this field.

The objectives of therapy in patients who develop acute diverticulitis include the treatment of symptoms, the colonic infection, the prevention of complications and the recurrence of the condition(Table 3). Based on the severity of symptoms, ability to tolerate oral intake, presence of comorbidities and adequate outpatient support, the decision on whether patients should be hospitalized or receive ambulatory care should be carefully considered. Treatment of complications may require interventional radiology or surgery.

### Current management of patients with diverticulosis and diverticular disease: a survey from the 2nd international symposium on diverticular disease [^117CFZE3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Management of diverticular disease (DD) remains a point of debate.

Goals

To investigate the current opinion of participants of the 2nd International Symposium on Diverticular Disease, on real-life management of patients with DD of the colon.

Study

Twelve questions were aimed at the diagnosis, treatment, and management options for diverticulosis and symptomatic DD.

Results

In total, 115 surveys from 8 European Countries were filled out. High fiber diet was widely prescribed in diverticulosis (59.1%). Probiotics (25%) were the most frequent prescribed drug, whereas 29.8% of participants did not prescribe any treatment in diverticulosis. Colonoscopy was frequently prescribed in symptomatic patients (69.3%), whereas 72.9% of participants did not prescribe any instrumental tool in their follow-up. Rifaximin, probiotics, and mesalazine were the most frequent prescribed drugs both in symptomatic patients (28.1, 14.9%, and 11.4%, respectively) and to prevent recurrence of the disease (42.5%, 12.4%, and 28.2%, respectively). With respect to laboratory exams, 57.9% of participants prescribed them during follow-up. The majority of participants (64.9%) managed suspected acute diverticulitis at home. Rifaximin, probiotics, and mesalazine were the most frequent prescribed drugs to prevent recurrence of the disease (32.2%, 13.2%, and 11.4%, respectively), whereas 25.4% of participants did not prescribe any drugs. Finally, no differences were found among gastroenterologists, surgeons, and general practitioners in managing this disease.

Conclusions

This surveys shows that current management of DD is similar between different medical specialities, generally in line with current literature.

### Management of colonic diverticular disease in the third millennium: highlights from a symposium held during the United European Gastroenterology week 2017 [^114ZvYz6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

What are the aims of treatment?

As mentioned above, the clinical spectrum of colonic diverticular disease is wide and ranges from asymptomatic diverticula to SUDD, uncomplicated diverticulitis and eventually, complicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the management, and the therapeutic approach are different, depending on the severity of the disease. Overall, prevention of progression, treatment of active disease and prevention of recurrence are the three key aims of treatment in any clinical manifestation of diverticular disease.

Asymptomatic diverticulosis does not need any pharmacologic treatment. However, healthy lifestyle (regular physical exercise, maintaining ideal body weight, abstention from smoking) and high-fiber diet are recommended to prevent its progression to SUDD and its complications. Most people with diverticulosis will not progress to symptomatic disease. The proportion of subjects with diverticulosis that eventually develop SUDD or acute diverticulitis is unknown. Consensus papers and reviews, state that 80–85% of subjects with diverticulosis will remain asymptomatic throughout their life, whereas 15–20% of symptomatic patients will suffer from diverticular disease without inflammation, while the remainder will have diverticulitis. However, estimates of progression need to be based on more reliable studies. One studyidentified 2222 patients with baseline diverticulosis. Over an 11-year follow-up period, 95 patients developed diverticulitis (4.3%; 6 per 1000 patient-years). The median time to event was 7.1 years.

Pharmacological treatment of SUDD should reduce intensity and frequency of symptoms and prevent the progression to diverticulitis, (Table 2). Most symptoms in SUDD are mild to moderate but they impair the patients' quality of life. Typical symptoms of SUDD include pain (in the lower or left lower quadrant of the abdomen), bloating and changes in bowel habits, symptoms also observed in patients with IBS; a differential diagnosis between these two clinical entities should therefore be attempted.

Table 2.
Aims of therapy in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease.

Progression to diverticulitis is uncommon and often benign. One prospective, long-term study, assessing the development of complications in patients with SUDD, pointed out that 97% of patients had mild or no symptoms after a median follow-up of 66 months. Acute diverticulitis appeared in only 2.5% of cases.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 12 (complicated disease risk and recurrence): Patients should be educated that complicated diverticulitis is most often their first presentation of diverticulitis, and the risk of complicated diverticulitis decreases with recurrences. In a population-based cohort study, patients with a history of recurrent diverticulitis had a reduced risk of complicated diverticulitis (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.98), and in another study among 386 patients with complicated diverticulitis, 286 (74%) had no history of prior diverticulitis. Individuals with diverticulitis are at risk of recurrence, with approximately 20% having 1 or more recurrent episodes within 10 years, including approximately 8% within the first year and 20% within 10 years after an incident episode; after a second episode, this risk is 18% at 1 year and 55% at 10 years, and after a third episode it is 40% at 3 years. The risk of recurrence is higher after complicated diverticulitis treated successfully without surgery, with a large retrospective cohort showing a 25% recurrence within 5 years after an episode with an abscess successfully managed without surgery.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: expert review [^117S415c]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Colonic diverticulitis — whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course; colonoscopy is advised after an episode of complicated diverticulitis and after a first episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis, but can be deferred if a recent (within 1 year) high-quality colonoscopy was performed, and after an acute episode of diverticulitis, colonoscopy should be delayed by 6–8 weeks or until complete resolution of the acute symptoms, whichever is longer, with colonoscopy considered sooner if alarm symptoms are present; patients with recurrent uncomplicated diverticulitis should follow routine colorectal cancer screening and surveillance intervals unless alarm symptoms are present; supporting data include a meta-analysis of 31 studies and 50,445 patients reporting a colon cancer prevalence of 1.9% among patients with diverticulitis, higher in complicated diverticulitis (7.9%) vs uncomplicated (1.3%), with advanced adenomas 4.4% and adenomas 14.2%, and a randomized trial in which 1.2% patients were diagnosed with colon cancer within 3 months of randomization.

### Italian guidelines for the diagnosis and management of colonic diverticulosis and diverticular disease [^112zpn9H]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Colonic diverticulosis and diverticular disease are among the most common gastrointestinal disorders encountered in clinical practice. These Italian guidelines focus on the diagnosis and management of diverticulosis and diverticular disease in the adult population, providing practical and evidence-based recommendations for clinicians. Experts from five Italian scientific societies, constituting a multidisciplinary panel, conducted a comprehensive review of meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, and observational studies to formulate 14 PICO questions. The assessment of the quality of the evidence and the formulation of the recommendations were carried out using an adaptation of the GRADE methodology. The guidelines covered the following topics: i) Management of diverticulosis; ii) Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease: diagnosis and treatment; iii) Acute diverticulitis: diagnosis and treatment; iv) Management of diverticular disease complications; v) Prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis; vi) Interventional management of diverticular disease.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^114KMZrF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diverticulitis is a common gastrointestinal disease that still garners significant attention and study because of its heterogeneity in presentation and outcome. We provide a review of the newest and most controversial topics in diverticulitis. Recent discoveries on the influence of diet and other environmental risk factors are discussed, showing how the epidemiology of the disease process is shifting away from what was previously felt to be a disorder primarily limited to older western populations. Interestingly, as has long been suspected, genetic mutations and variations associated with the development of diverticulitis are being discovered and are summarized here. The data for non-operative and outpatient management of diverticulitis are reviewed, as are pharmacologic agents studied for use in the secondary prevention of diverticulitis. Lastly, we present controversies in the surgical treatment of diverticulitis. This review will provide a synopsis of the last 5 years of literature relating to diverticulitis.
