## Question

Indications for surgery in septic endocarditis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for surgery in septic endocarditis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching framework for surgical indications. Then, I should verify timing categories and urgency definitions. Next, I will differentiate left-sided from right-sided disease. After that, I need to integrate neurological complications and their impact on timing. I will then examine microbiological triggers and prosthetic valve nuances. Finally, I should appraise real-world evidence gaps and synthesize a pragmatic, algorithmic approach while double-checking that each step aligns with major guidelines and key studies [^116bkdBm] [^11388Rx5] [^113rXE2H].

> Let me first confirm the core framework for surgical indications in infective endocarditis: all major societies align on three pillars — heart failure/hemodynamic compromise, uncontrolled infection despite appropriate antibiotics, and prevention of embolic events; urgency is categorized as emergency, urgent, or non-urgent based on clinical severity and hemodynamic tolerance, which applies to both native and prosthetic valve disease, and this triad remains the backbone for decision-making across ESC 2023 and ACC/AHA guidance [^116bkdBm] [^11388Rx5].

> Now, I should verify emergency indications and not miss life-threatening physiology; emergency surgery within 24 hours is warranted for left-sided NVE or PVE with severe acute regurgitation, obstruction, or fistula leading to refractory pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock — this is a "don't wait" scenario given imminent hemodynamic collapse, and I need to ensure the team is ready to operate immediately once the diagnosis and anatomy are secured [^116bkdBm] [^116n3riS].

> Next, I will examine what constitutes urgent surgical indications over the ensuing days; hold on, I should verify each subcategory precisely: locally uncontrolled infection (abscess, false aneurysm, fistula, enlarging vegetation, prosthetic dehiscence, new AV block), severe valve dysfunction with symptomatic heart failure or echocardiographic signs of poor hemodynamic tolerance, persistent infection with positive cultures beyond approximately one week or ongoing sepsis despite source control, and high-risk microbiology such as fungi, multidrug-resistant organisms, and certain PVE pathogens including staphylococci and specific HACEK organisms — each of these should move the clock to days, not weeks, to limit irreversible damage and systemic complications [^113usTyt] [^116Wuizu] [^111EqLoj] [^112vh3te] [^11788AJP] [^116Y3i6p] [^116UTuaR] [^116FLbNw] [^113qad6E].

> Wait, let me verify the prophylactic embolic-prevention threshold because I recall older guidance used 15 mm; the 2023 ESC guideline indeed lowers the class IIb consideration threshold to vegetations ≥ 10 mm on the aortic or mitral valves when surgical risk is low and without severe valve dysfunction or prior embolism — so my prior 15 mm memory was from 2015 and needs updating to 10 mm in 2023, which reflects a move toward earlier risk mitigation albeit at lower evidence levels [^111k37SH] [^116oqWuc] [^113wpNNE].

> I will now distinguish left- from right-sided IE because this materially changes triggers; for right-sided IE (typically tricuspid), urgent surgery is considered for right heart failure from severe TR refractory to medical therapy, persistent large vegetations (> 20 mm) particularly with recurrent septic pulmonary emboli or respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support, simultaneous left-sided involvement, or persistent bacteremia/sepsis despite a week of appropriate therapy, with tricuspid repair favored over replacement whenever feasible to minimize prosthesis-related complications — let me confirm those thresholds and preferences are consistent with ESC and AHA statements, which they are [^115q2aPV] [^114Jytrd] [^113Lux8k] [^117WzdGr].

> But wait, neurological complications can complicate timing, so I need to check the balance between cardiac urgency and neuro risk; surgery should not be delayed when there is heart failure, uncontrolled infection, abscess, or persistent high embolic risk, provided the patient is not comatose and intracranial hemorrhage has been excluded by CT/MRI, whereas in hemodynamically stable patients with major ischemic stroke with severe deficits or documented intracerebral hemorrhage, a delay of about 4 weeks is generally advised; after TIA, proceed without delay if otherwise indicated — this triage requires meticulous neuroimaging and multidisciplinary coordination to avoid catastrophic hemorrhagic transformation while not missing the cardiac window [^113Q97Qk] [^111LkUm7] [^116Qp81g] [^112QY7Qf] [^112JG5g5] [^115ZYmw2].

> Let me consider pathogen-specific triggers because these often push us toward earlier surgery; early surgery is recommended or strongly considered for S. aureus left-sided disease, fungal endocarditis, and infections due to highly resistant organisms, as well as for staphylococcal prosthetic valve infections — these microbiologic profiles correlate with destructive lesions, persistent bacteremia, embolic burden, and poor response to medical therapy alone, and I should confirm that these are aligned across ACC/AHA and ESC, which they are [^114D2ofy] [^116UTuaR] [^116FLbNw] [^113qad6E].

> Next, I should review prosthetic valve endocarditis nuances because the threshold for surgery is lower; early PVE (within 6 months) generally warrants surgery with aggressive debridement and new prosthesis when feasible, any prosthetic dehiscence mandates prompt intervention, persistent bacteremia beyond about a week despite adequate therapy triggers urgent surgery, and embolic prevention thresholds are more permissive (vegetation ≥ 10 mm plus embolic events) in PVE — repair is less often possible, so I need to ensure explant and reconstruction planning is in place [^1161F9Q8] [^116Wuizu] [^116Y3i6p] [^1158b6zN].

> I should double-check real-world gaps because indications do not always translate to operations; large registries and meta-analyses show roughly one-third of patients with a class I indication are not operated and that this group has substantially higher in-hospital and 1-year mortality, while pooled analyses suggest a robust survival advantage with surgery when an indication exists, though selection bias remains and most recommendations are Level B/C; one randomized trial supports early surgery to prevent embolic events, but overall timing data are limited, so I must keep a cautious, evidence-informed stance and involve the endocarditis team early to mitigate preoperative deaths and delays [^113wHeWY] [^113eFLq9] [^116y5TB5] [^111pDSEX] [^111aqq6N] [^1143oSP9].

> Hold on, I should verify system-level best practices to operationalize this; guidelines emphasize early transfer or co-management at a heart valve center, immediate involvement of an endocarditis team, and heart team decision-making for timing and strategy, which consistently improves process metrics and likely outcomes by expediting imaging, pathogen-directed therapy, and surgical readiness — this coordination is not ancillary, it is central to delivering guideline-concordant care [^11459C2t] [^115zBmBZ] [^11388Rx5].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical algorithm and ensure internal consistency: confirm the diagnosis and anatomy rapidly (Duke criteria and expedited TTE/TEE), assess the three core indications systematically (heart failure/hemodynamic instability, uncontrolled infection or persistent bacteremia after appropriate therapy and source control, embolic risk tied to vegetation size/mobility and embolic events), assign urgency (emergency vs urgent vs non-urgent) based on hemodynamics, local extension, microbiology, and embolic profile, integrate neuroimaging to exclude ICH when stroke is present and proceed without delay if HF/uncontrolled infection/ongoing high embolic risk exist, quantify operative risk but avoid letting high risk eclipse class I indications without multidisciplinary consensus, favor repair over replacement when feasible (especially tricuspid), and, once the indication and timing are established, execute without avoidable delay because postponement increases mortality [^116bkdBm] [^114s5oXN] [^117WzdGr].

Surgery in septic endocarditis is indicated for three main reasons: **heart failure from severe valve dysfunction** [^116bkdBm] (acute regurgitation [^111EqLoj], obstruction [^112vh3te], or fistula causing pulmonary edema or shock [^116n3riS]); **uncontrolled infection** [^113usTyt] (abscess, fistula, enlarging vegetation, prosthetic dehiscence, new AV block [^116Wuizu], or persistent bacteremia/sepsis [^11788AJP] despite appropriate antibiotics [^116Y3i6p]); and **prevention of embolic events** [^111k37SH] [^116MRw3x] (vegetations ≥ 10 mm with prior embolism [^111Zujim] or ≥ 15 mm with high embolic risk). Additional indications include **infection with fungi or multidrug-resistant organisms [^116UTuaR] [^114D2ofy], prosthetic valve endocarditis [^113qad6E], and right-sided IE** [^115q2aPV] with large vegetations or persistent sepsis. Surgery should be performed urgently or emergently based on hemodynamic stability, infection control, and embolic risk [^1143oSP9], with timing individualized by a multidisciplinary endocarditis team [^11459C2t] [^11388Rx5] [^115zBmBZ].

## Indications for surgery in septic endocarditis

### Heart failure due to severe valvular dysfunction

In heart failure due to severe valvular dysfunction, **emergency surgery** [^116bkdBm] is warranted for a fistula [^116n3riS], **acute severe regurgitation** [^111EqLoj], or **obstruction** [^112vh3te] causing refractory pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock in native or prosthetic valves [^113rXE2H]. Early surgery is also recommended for **severe valve dysfunction with heart failure symptoms** [^114MJZ3o].

---

### Uncontrolled infection

- **Locally uncontrolled infection**: Urgent surgery is indicated [^113usTyt] for abscess [^113rXE2H], false aneurysm, fistula, enlarging vegetation, prosthetic dehiscence, or new AV block [^116Wuizu].

- **Persistent bacteremia or sepsis**: Surgery is indicated [^11788AJP] for persistent bacteremia or sepsis despite appropriate antibiotics and control of metastatic foci [^116Y3i6p].

- **Fungal or multidrug-resistant organisms**: Urgent or non-urgent surgery is recommended [^116UTuaR] for IE caused by fungi or multidrug-resistant organisms [^116FLbNw], tailored to hemodynamic status [^114D2ofy] [^117Teqmf].

---

### Prevention of embolic events

Large vegetations with embolic risk warrant **urgent surgery** [^116MRw3x] — ≥ 10 mm with prior embolic events [^111Zujim] or ≥ 15 mm with high embolic risk. Persistent vegetations after embolic events also warrant **urgent surgery** when vegetations ≥ 10 mm persist after embolic events despite antibiotics [^111Zujim] [^1158b6zN].

---

### Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE)

In prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), **early PVE** (within 6 months of valve surgery) should be managed with surgical valve replacement and complete debridement [^1161F9Q8] [^112vh3te]. Relapsing PVE warrants **surgery** when prosthetic valve IE recurs without other identifiable infection sources [^114ji8VU].

---

### Right-sided infective endocarditis

- **Severe tricuspid regurgitation**: Surgery is indicated [^115q2aPV] for right heart failure from severe tricuspid regurgitation unresponsive to medical therapy [^113Lux8k].

- **Large tricuspid vegetations**: Surgery is indicated [^115q2aPV] for persistent vegetations > 20 mm after septic pulmonary emboli [^113Lux8k].

- **Persistent bacteremia or sepsis**: Surgery is indicated [^114Jytrd] for persistent bacteremia or sepsis after ≥ 1 week of appropriate antibiotics [^113rXE2H].

---

## Timing of surgical intervention

- **Emergency surgery**: Immediate surgery [^116bkdBm] for refractory pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock [^114s5oXN], or uncontrolled infection.

- **Urgent surgery**: Within days [^111EqLoj] for severe valve dysfunction [^1143oSP9], persistent infection, or high embolic risk.

- **Elective surgery**: After stabilization for less acute indications or high surgical risk [^114s5oXN].

---

## Contraindications and considerations

Neurological complications warrant delaying surgery by ≥ 4 weeks [^1125JqCn] for **major ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage** if stable [^116Qp81g] [^115ZYmw2]. High surgical risk requires **individualized decisions** based on comorbidities, hemodynamics, and infection control [^1143oSP9].

---

## Multidisciplinary team approach

An **endocarditis team** [^11459C2t] and early management in heart valve centers with surgical facilities improve outcomes [^115zBmBZ]. The **heart valve team** should make timing decisions [^11388Rx5] [^113LSTDH].

---

Surgery in septic endocarditis is indicated for **heart failure from severe valve dysfunction, uncontrolled infection, and prevention of embolic events** [^116bkdBm], with timing individualized by a multidisciplinary team.

### Early surgery to prevent embolic events in patients with infective endocarditis: A comprehensive review [^111aqq6N]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a dangerous and lethal illness with high mortality rates. One of the main indications for surgery, according to the guidelines, is the prevention of embolic events. However, uncertainty remains concerning the timing of surgery and the effect of early surgery in combination with antibiotic therapy versus antibiotic therapy alone in IE patients with a vegetation size greater than 10 mm.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive review by searching the PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMbase databases. Titles and abstracts were screened, and studies of interest were selected for full-text assessment. Studies were selected for review if they met the criteria of comparing surgical treatment combined with antibiotic therapy to antibiotic therapy alone in patients with vegetations greater than 10 mm.

- **Results**: We found 1,503 studies through our database search; nine of these were eligible for review, with a total number of 3,565 patients. The median age was 66 years (range: 17–80), and the median percentage of male patients was 65.6% (range: 61.8–71.4%). There was one randomised controlled trial, one prospective study, and seven retrospective studies. Seven studies found that surgery combined with antibiotic therapy was associated with better outcomes in patients with IE and vegetations greater than 10 mm, one of them being the randomised trial [hazard ratio = 0.10; 95% confidence interval 0.01–0.82]. Two studies found that surgery combined with antibiotic therapy was associated with poorer outcomes compared with antibiotic therapy alone.

- **Conclusion**: Overall, data vary in quality due to low numbers and selection bias. Evidence is conflicting, yet suggests a trend toward improved outcomes with combined surgical and antibiotic treatment in specific cohorts.

### Surgical management of mitral valve infective endocarditis [^114bKkfU]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Active mitral valve infective endocarditis is a challenging clinical problem with a high rate of mortality. Surgery is currently performed in more than 40% of patients, and selecting those patients who will benefit from surgical intervention and performing a technically sound operation at the proper time are keys to optimizing outcomes.

Moderate-to-severe and severe mitral regurgitation, large mobile vegetations, paravalvular abscess, embolic events, failure of antibiotic therapy, and infection with a fungal organism are indications for prompt operation. The use of computed tomography imaging is important to determine whether there are noncardiac sources of infection, and transesophageal echocardiography is essential to delineate valvular dysfunction, identify paravalvular abscesses, rule out involvement of other valves, and plan operative therapy. In most cases, surgery should not be delayed because of cerebrovascular emboli.

Mitral valve repair is favored over replacement whenever possible, is associated with superior short- and long-term outcomes, and should be possible in most cases. Operative mortality is 80%.

### Current best practices and guidelines. Assessment and management of complications in infective endocarditis [^117Eeea1]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The most important complications of endocarditis are congestive heart failure, paravalvular abscess formation, and embolism, especially stroke. Additionally, endocarditis may lead to septic arthritis, vertebral osteomyelitis, pericarditis, metastatic abscesses, and a variety of renal issues, ranging from immune-complex glomerulonephritis to renal abscesses. Adverse reactions associated with the medical treatment of endocarditis can also result in significant complications, such as ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, skin rashes, and serum sickness. This review focuses on the cardiac, embolic, neurologic, and renal complications of endocarditis and discusses how these complications influence the clinical management of individual cases in daily practice.

### Rationale, design, and methods for the early surgery in infective endocarditis study (ENDOVAL 1): A multicenter, prospective, randomized trial comparing the state-of-the-art therapeutic strategy versus early surgery strategy in infective endocarditis [^115BM8Es]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

The prognosis of infective endocarditis is poor and has remained steady over the last four decades. Several nonrandomized studies suggest that early surgery could improve prognosis.

- **Methods**: ENDOVAL 1 is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study designed to compare the state-of-the-art therapeutic strategy (as advised by international societies in their guidelines) with the early-surgery strategy in high-risk patients with infective endocarditis. Patients without an indication for surgery will be included if they meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) early-onset prosthetic endocarditis; (2) Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis; (3) periannular complications; (4) new-onset conduction abnormalities; (5) new-onset severe valvular dysfunction. A total of 216 patients will be randomized to either of the two strategies. Stratification will be done within three days of admission. In the early surgery arm, the surgical procedure will be performed within 48 hours of randomization. The primary event of interest will be death within 30 days. The study will be extended to one year. In the follow-up substudy, death and a new episode of endocarditis will be regarded as events.

- **Conclusion**: ENDOVAL 1, the first randomized study on endocarditis, will provide crucial information regarding the potential benefit of early surgery over the state-of-the-art therapeutic approach in high-risk patients with infective endocarditis.

### Current best practices and guidelines indications for surgical intervention in infective endocarditis [^115kM9vc]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The optimal diagnosis and management of patients with infective endocarditis require sound clinical judgment based on extensive experience. This is especially important regarding the indications and timing for surgery. To achieve the best possible outcomes, surgical intervention during treatment is required in 25% to 30% of patients with infective endocarditis. Heart failure and progressive left-sided valvular dysfunction are the most common indications for operation. Valve repair should be considered as an alternative to valve replacement whenever feasible, especially in younger patients. Successful management of perivalvular abscesses and prosthetic valve infections requires the radical removal of infected tissue followed by reconstructive procedures performed by experienced surgeons. Emergency or urgent surgery should seldom be delayed.

### Conservative versus surgical therapy in patients with infective endocarditis and surgical indication-meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data [^116y5TB5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

The survival data of 3003 patients (conservative: 922, 30.7%; surgery: 2081, 69.3%) with a median follow-up of 7.6 months (interquartile range, 1.08–12.03) were pooled. The analysis shows that patients with an indication for surgery who received a surgical intervention had a significantly lower risk of mortality compared with patients who received only conservative treatment (HR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.24–0.31], P < 0.001).

Overall survival at 1, 6, and 12 months in patients with conservative treatment was 57.6%, 34.6%, and 32.7%, respectively. In contrast, survival rates in patients undergoing surgical management for the treatment of infective endocarditis (IE) were 87.6%, 74.7%, and 73.3% at 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Figure 2 depicts the pooled Kaplan–Meier curve for the cumulative risk of mortality in patients with surgical indications for the treatment of IE undergoing either conservative treatment or surgical intervention.

Standard meta-analysis using fixed- and random-effect analysis demonstrated comparable summary estimates (HR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.17–0.33] and HR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.24–0.31], respectively) and moderate heterogeneity (I² = 57%, P = 0.072).

### Surgical management of infective endocarditis: Early predictors of short-term morbidity and mortality [^11133YF1]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge that ultimately requires surgical intervention in 20% of all cases. Early determinants of morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population are not well described. The aim of this study was to determine preoperative clinical, microbiological, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic variables that predicted the need for permanent pacemaker implantation and in-hospital death in a surgical cohort of patients with active infective endocarditis.

We identified 91 patients (61 males and 30 females, mean age 58 ± 16 years) who underwent surgical intervention for active culture-positive infective endocarditis as defined by the Duke criteria. Native valve infective endocarditis was present in 78 (85.7%) cases and prosthetic valve endocarditis in 13 (14.3%) cases. The aortic valve was infected in 61 (67.0%) patients, the mitral in 35 (38.5%) patients, and multiple valves in 8 patients (8.8%). The most common indication for surgical intervention was intractable heart failure.

Twenty-two patients (24.2%) required pacemakers, while there were 14 (15.4%) in-hospital deaths. In age-adjusted and gender-adjusted analyses, the presence of left bundle branch block on preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) and presence of depressed left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction [EF] < 50%) predicted the need for permanent pacemaker implantation, while the presence of depressed left ventricular function predicted in-hospital mortality.

### Current recommendations and uncertainties for surgical treatment of infective endocarditis: A comparison of American and European cardiovascular guidelines [^1143oSP9]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Surgery is an effective therapy in the treatment of left-sided infective endocarditis (IE) in patients for whom antibiotic treatment alone is unlikely to be curative or may be associated with an ongoing risk of complications. However, the interplay between the indication for surgery, its risk, and timing is complex, and there continue to be challenges in defining the effects of surgery on disease-related outcomes. Guidelines published by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology provide recommendations for the use of surgery in IE, but these are limited by a low level of evidence related to predominantly observational studies with inherent selection and survival biases. Evidence to guide the timing of surgery in IE is less robust and predominantly based on expert consensus. Delays between IE diagnosis and recognition of an IE complication as a surgical indication, and transfers to surgical centres, also impact surgical timing. This comparison of the two guidelines exposes areas of uncertainty and gaps in evidence for the use of surgery in IE across different indications, particularly related to its timing and consideration of operative risk.

### Clinical practice of surgical treatment for left-sided infective endocarditis: Nationwide data from the NIDUS registry [^113wHeWY]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Surgery is an essential treatment for selected patients with infective endocarditis (IE). Despite the indications for surgery, not all patients undergo the procedure. Most previous IE cohorts have examined a selected group of patients from primary tertiary centers. Thus, the aims of this study were to describe the use of surgery by indication and to assess mortality in a nationwide cohort of patients with left-sided IE.

- **Methods**: This observational cohort study included patients with left-sided IE from the National Danish Endocarditis Studies (2016–2021). Patients were categorized according to the presence of surgical indications defined as a Class I indication for surgery according to the 2015 European guidelines or a vegetation ≥ 10 mm on the diagnostic echocardiography, and whether surgery was performed. One-year mortality was assessed with the 1-Kaplan-Meier estimator and multivariable Cox regression models.

- **Results**: Among 3017 patients, 662 (21.9%; median age, 66.9 years) underwent surgery, 655 (21.6%; median age, 75.9 years) had surgical indications but received conservative treatment, and 1700 (56.5%; median age, 76.0 years) had no surgical indications. Surgical patients had fewer comorbidities and more streptococci, whereas nonsurgical patients had more comorbidities and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients with surgical indications who did not undergo surgery had the highest in-hospital (31.8% versus 12.5% versus 15.7%; P < 0.001) and 1-year (50.5% versus 17.0% versus 33.5%, P < 0.001) mortality compared with surgical patients and those without indications.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^1144hyvU]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

The scoping exercise for this guideline revision identified new questions concerning the optimal delivery of care for patients with infective endocarditis (IE). The first questions were: (1) how should IE services be delivered; (2) what outpatient follow-up should be provided; and (3) what information should be given to patients. After excluding duplicates, 16,231 papers relating to IE were identified, of which 20 were related to the delivery of IE services and met the inclusion criteria. The findings of these papers were categorized into broad themes: endocarditis teams, infrastructure and support, referral processes, patient follow-up and information, and governance. Eight studies involved adults only, and 12 did not state age inclusion or exclusion criteria. No study explicitly included children.

Results of the risk of bias assessment are shown in the online supplemental file 2.

### Surgical management of infective endocarditis complicated by embolic stroke: Practical recommendations for clinicians [^113Axvjr]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

There has been an overall improvement in surgical mortality for patients with infective endocarditis (IE), presumably due to improved diagnosis and management centered around a more aggressive early surgical approach. Surgery is currently performed in approximately half of all cases of IE. Improved survival in surgically treated patients is correlated with a reduction in heart failure and the prevention of embolic sequelae.

It is reported that between 20% and 40% of patients with IE present with stroke or other neurological conditions. For these IE patients, the timing of surgical intervention remains a point of considerable discussion and debate. Despite evidence of improved survival in IE patients with earlier surgical treatment, a significant proportion of patients with IE and preexisting neurological complications either undergo delayed surgery or do not have surgery at all, even when surgery is indicated and guideline endorsed.

Physicians and surgeons face a common conundrum where the urgency of the heart operation must be balanced against the real or perceived risks of neurological exacerbation. Recent data suggest that the risk of neurological exacerbation may be lower than previously believed. Guidelines reflect a shift toward early surgery for such patients, but there continue to be important areas of clinical equipoise. Individualized clinical assessment is of major importance for decision-making, and we emphasize the need for the functioning of an endocarditis team, including cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, and infectious disease specialists.

Pooled Kaplan–Meier curves are accompanied by their respective HRs with 95% CI. HR indicates hazard ratio, and IE, infective endocarditis.

Possibly due to the high-risk profile of this population, which can present a different spectrum of prognosis over time, and the fact that the test for violation of the proportional hazards assumption was statistically significant (P = 0.013), a sensitivity analysis was performed.

- **Landmark analysis**:

	- Figure 3 shows the landmark analysis, designating 1 month (the point where the HR seems to stabilize; Figure 3B) as the landmark time. During the first month of follow-up, patients undergoing surgical intervention had a significantly lower risk of mortality (HR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.26–0.37], P < 0.001). Likewise, the landmark analysis beyond the first month after diagnosis of IE demonstrated a significantly lower risk of mortality for patients with surgical management (HR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.20–0.28], P < 0.001).

### Conservative versus surgical therapy in patients with infective endocarditis and surgical indication-meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data [^1116DYnY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Interestingly, the most commonly cited reasons also encompass hemodynamic instability and sepsis, both of which align with surgical indications as per the guidelines. Of course, it cannot be ruled out that there were other factors besides these that influenced the risk–benefit ratio. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that heart failure complicating IE is independently associated with poor in‐hospital and 1‐year survival, and surgical treatment is the only effective treatment that is associated with improved survival. Likewise, surgery is associated with a significant reduction in early and 1‐year mortality for patients with IE and septic shock.

Chu et al. in their cohort of patients with persistent bacteremia and S. aureus pathogenesis were associated with a lower likelihood for surgery. This occurs despite guidelines explicitly recommending surgical intervention for patients with "prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by staphylococci" and "persisting positive blood cultures despite appropriate antibiotic therapy". They proposed that a combination of patient‐related factors and clinical complications leads to a lower rate of surgery among patients with S. aureus endocarditis. In line with this, the median Society of Thoracic Surgeons IE score for patients with S. aureus was higher compared with patients without S. aureus (32 versus 24, P < 0.001). Furthermore, sepsis, which was more commonly cited as a reason for the lack of surgery in S. aureus IE, may result in hemodynamic or end‐organ complications that increase surgical risk.

### Conservative versus surgical therapy in patients with infective endocarditis and surgical indication-meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data [^113eFLq9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Our results, for the first time, quantify the risk of mortality in patients with infective endocarditis (IE) who have an indication for surgical therapy but did not receive surgery, using reconstructed time-to-event data from various studies. Our analysis indicates that approximately one-third of patients with an indication for surgical therapy did not undergo the recommended surgical intervention. Compared with those who underwent surgery, these individuals experienced significantly worse short-term and long-term survival.

One reason for surgery not being performed is the occurrence of patient death before surgery could take place. Indeed, this was a key reason for withholding appropriate surgery in the European Infective Endocarditis (EURO-ENDO) registry for patients with a surgical indication (22.5% of cases). This finding emphasizes the importance of early consultations with surgeons within the IE team, aligning with recommendations from the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. To account for these early deaths, we performed a landmark analysis using 1 month as the landmark. This analysis showed that patients who did not undergo surgery and survived the first month after IE diagnosis experienced worse survival compared to those who underwent surgical intervention.

The reasons for patients not undergoing surgery, despite guideline recommendations, are multifaceted. They often involve multiple factors rather than a single reason.

### Outcome of patients requiring valve surgery during active infective endocarditis [^1156W5N8]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The optimal timing of cardiac operations in patients with infective endocarditis continues to be debated. This observational study analyzed the profile and outcome of patients with active infective endocarditis undergoing operations.

- **Methods**: Between June 2000 and June 2006, 95 surgically treated patients with definite infective endocarditis by the modified Duke criteria were included.

- **Results**: Fifty-eight patients were operated on within the first 7 days after diagnosis of infective endocarditis, and 37 were operated on more than 7 days after diagnosis, up to immediately after completion of antibiotic treatment. Staphylococci predominated and were significantly associated with embolism, abscess, and septic shock. The most frequent indication for operation was severe regurgitation with heart failure. The 6-month mortality was 15%. Early operation showed a trend towards increased mortality compared to late operation. In univariable analysis, factors associated with 6-month mortality included staphylococci and septic shock. Multivariable analysis revealed that septic shock predicted 6-month mortality. Despite early operations in patients experiencing septic shock, 57% died. No patients without heart failure died after undergoing procedures for severe regurgitation, regardless of whether the operation was early or late.

- **Conclusions**: The prognosis in surgically treated patients was determined by the occurrence of septic shock. The outcome in patients who underwent late operations was favorable compared to the early group. This difference was probably not due to the timing of the surgical intervention but to the severity of infection.

### Early surgery to prevent embolic events in patients with infective endocarditis: A comprehensive review [^116oGm6W]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The remaining two studies found that surgery combined with antibiotic therapy, in patients with embolic risk reduction as the only surgical indication, is not beneficial when compared to antibiotic therapy alone [210 patients]. A single-centre study identified 71 patients with no surgical indications other than prevention of embolism, with 59 patients undergoing surgery. Using Cox regression, the study found that surgery was independently associated with increased mortality rates [HR 3.9 (95% CI 0.9–16.6)].

The second study identified 70 patients who underwent surgery with no other indication and 69 who received only antibiotic therapy. The surgery plus antibiotic therapy group had a 90-day survival probability of 81.4% compared to 88.4% in the antibiotic therapy alone group.

The initial patient assessment and management are best performed by a multidisciplinary team. Future investigations should focus on identifying surgical candidates early and the outcomes affected by replacement valve choice in both native and prosthetic valve endocarditis.

Infective endocarditis represents a life-threatening disease with high mortality rates. A fraction of patients receives exclusively conservative antibiotic treatment due to their comorbidities and high operative risk, despite fulfilling criteria for surgical therapy. The aim of the present study is to compare outcomes in patients with infective endocarditis and indications for surgical therapy in those who underwent or did not undergo valve surgery.

- **Methods and results**: Three databases were systematically assessed. A pooled analysis of Kaplan–Meier-derived reconstructed time-to-event data from studies with longer follow-up comparing conservative and surgical treatment was performed. A landmark analysis to further elucidate the effect of surgical intervention on mortality was carried out. Four studies with 3003 patients and median follow-up time of 7.6 months were included. Overall, patients with an indication for surgery who were surgically treated had a significantly lower risk of mortality compared with patients who received conservative treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.27 [95% CI, 0.24–0.31], P < 0.001). The survival analysis in the first year showed superior survival for patients who underwent surgery when compared with those who did not at 1 month (87.6% versus 57.6%; HR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.26–0.37], P < 0.01), at 6 months (74.7% versus 34.6%), and at 12 months (73.3% versus 32.7%).

### Cardiac surgery during the acute phase of infective endocarditis: Discrepancies between European Society of Cardiology guidelines and practices [^115NH2HT]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Indications for surgery in acute infective endocarditis (IE) are detailed in guidelines, but their application is not well known. We analyzed the agreement between the patient's attending physicians and European Society of Cardiology guidelines regarding indications for surgery. We also assessed whether surgery was performed in patients who had an indication.

From the 2008 prospective population-based French survey on IE, 303 patients with definite left-sided native IE were identified. For each case, we prospectively recorded:

- **Indication for surgery according to the attending physicians**: Surgery was indicated in 194 (65%) patients.
- **Indication for surgery according to guidelines**: Surgery was indicated in 221 (73%) patients, while 139 (46%) underwent surgery.

Agreement was moderate between attending physicians and guidelines (kappa 0.41–0.59) and between indication according to guidelines and the performance of surgery (kappa 0.38). Of the 90 (30%) patients not operated despite indication, contraindication to surgery was reported by attending physicians in 42 (47%), and indication was not identified in 48 (53%).

One-year survival rates were as follows:

- 76% in patients with indication and surgery performed (n = 131),
- 69% in patients without indication and no surgery (n = 74),
- 56% in patients with identified indication and contraindication to surgery (n = 42),
- 60% in patients with no identified indication (n = 48; P = 0.059).

In conclusion, cardiac surgery during acute IE was recommended in almost three out of four patients.

### Heart failure presentation thirty years after tricuspid valvectomy for infective endocarditis [^114HXHz8]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Low credibility.

Surgical intervention for infective endocarditis is indicated in patients who do not respond to initial IV antibiotic treatment, develop heart failure, have embolic events, or residual tricuspid insufficiency. However, debate over the best surgical intervention for right-sided endocarditis has persisted over the last several decades and included valve repair, replacement, and valvectomy. Recent analyses and consensus guidelines from the American Association for Thoracic Surgery recommend vegetation debridement and repair of the valve when possible, although recent studies suggest replacement remains the most commonly performed procedure.

Given concern for the high rates of recidivism and lack of social and financial support in this patient population, tricuspid valvectomy with delayed replacement until completion of a drug treatment program had remained a practical option in this cohort. While previous reports have demonstrated long-term survival of patients without a tricuspid valve, particularly in those with normal pulmonary artery hemodynamics, more than 25% of these patients are not able to tolerate tricuspid insufficiency and require subsequent replacement. In addition, this cohort may often be difficult to follow clinically, given high recidivism and difficulty of follow-up. We report what we believe to be the lengthiest delay to tricuspid valve replacement following tricuspid valvectomy (30 years) for IV drug abuse after loss to follow-up in the literature.

Optimal surgical management is paramount to ensuring superior outcomes in this cohort.

- **Infrastructure and location of care for patients with IE**: What are the relative benefits and risks of caring for patients with IE in a local hospital without the facilities of a heart center on site, such as the availability of transoesophageal echocardiography or cardiac surgical support?

- **Patient follow-up**: What is the most clinically and cost-effective timing, nature, and frequency of follow-up after an episode of IE?

- **Patient information**: What information would patients prefer and how is this best provided?

- **People who inject drugs**: What are the clinical and cost-effective benefits of substance misuse teams to support people who inject drugs (PWID) who also have IE?

- **IE registry**: Would an IE registry improve benchmarking and research? Can local data be linked to central NHS Digital or other relevant databases to report on patient outcomes?

- **Children**: How are IE services best delivered for children?

### Timing of surgery in infective endocarditis [^114s5oXN]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Although early surgery is performed in approximately half of patients for the treatment of infective endocarditis (IE), the optimal timing of surgery remains unclear. Appropriate early surgery can avoid death and severe complications, but nearly one-quarter of patients with indications for surgery do not receive surgical intervention. Multidisciplinary collaborations among cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and infectious disease specialists are required for appropriate decisions about indication and timing of surgical intervention. Moreover, the potential benefits of early surgery should be weighed against its operative risks and long-term consequences.

- **Main indications for early surgery**: The main indications for early surgery in patients with IE are heart failure (HF), uncontrolled infection, and prevention of embolism. The role of early surgery has been expanding, and a recent randomized trial demonstrated that early surgery performed within 48 hours after the diagnosis of IE effectively reduced systemic embolisms without increasing operative mortality or recurrence of IE. Urgent surgery is indicated in patients who have moderate to severe HF, uncontrolled infection, and large vegetations associated with severe valvular disease.

- **Timing considerations**: However, surgery should be delayed for 2–4 weeks in patients with large cerebral infarction and for at least 4 weeks in those with intracerebral hemorrhage if possible. This is because early surgery may pose significant risks of neurological deterioration and perioperative cerebral bleeding. The decision for surgical timing should be based on individual risk-benefit analysis, and early surgery is strongly recommended when indicated.

### Conservative versus surgical therapy in patients with infective endocarditis and surgical indication-meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data [^113sWSAV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Stroke before surgical decision was also inversely associated with surgery during the index hospitalization in the study by Chu et al, likely reflecting the uncertain timing and safety of surgery in patients with infectious endocarditis (IE) complicated by stroke. In a recent study by Diab et al. among 308 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery for left‐sided IE, preoperative stroke was present in 87 (28.2%) patients. Patients with preoperative stroke had a higher preoperative risk profile than patients without it: higher Charlson comorbidity index (8.1 ± 2.6 versus 6.6 ± 3.3) and higher incidence of S. aureus infection (43% versus 17%) and septic shock (37% versus 19%). Five‐year survival was worst in patients with severe neurological disability compared with mild disability.

However, neither preoperative stroke nor the degree of neurological disability appeared as an independent risk factor for short‐ or long‐term mortality by multivariate analysis. In addition, multivariate regression analysis including other variables, such as preoperative septic shock, vegetation ≥ 20 mm, and S. aureus IE, failed to identify preoperative stroke as an independent predictor of newly occurring postoperative stroke (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.47 [95% CI, 0.65–3.30], P = 0.354).

The authors concluded that patients with preoperative stroke present with a generally higher risk profile that may substantially affect decision‐making concerning surgical intervention. Indeed, the studies involved in the analysis and other important cohorts involving patients with IE report the fact that the surgical indication due to…

### Surgical timing in patients with infective endocarditis and with intracranial hemorrhage: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111E5m8D]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening disease that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Cardiac surgery is indicated in more than 50% of cases. However, surgery is not performed in a significant number of patients, ranging from 26% to 40% of patients with IE, despite evident surgical indication. The 30-day mortality among those patients who were denied surgical treatment is as high as 63%.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) represents the reason for denial of surgery in 15% of patients with IE. Although cardiac surgery can be life-saving in IE, it also carries significant risks in the presence of ICH, which is mainly related to the inevitable use of high-dose systemic anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass, bearing the risks of further bleeding and neurologic deterioration. On the other hand, early surgery has been shown to prevent re-embolic events and decrease mortality in patients with IE.

At the time of writing, there are no randomized controlled trials to guide the management of patients with IE complicated with ICH. The guidelines from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology recommend delaying cardiac surgery for at least 30 days in the presence of ICH in patients with IE to avoid neurological deterioration. However, these recommendations are based on observational studies with limited numbers of patients. In addition, the results of studies comparing early versus late surgery in patients with IE and with ICH are exposed to immortal-time bias.

### Early surgery to prevent embolic events in patients with infective endocarditis: a comprehensive review [^113wpNNE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a significant lethal illness with high mortality rates despite advances in both medical and surgical treatments. In-hospital mortality is 15–25%, and the 1-year mortality rate is about 30%. The standard treatment includes long-term antibiotic therapy or a combination of surgery and antibiotic therapy in some cases. Surgery combined with antibiotic therapy is chosen in 25–50% of cases. One of the three main indications for IE surgery is the prevention of embolic events, which is a feared and serious complication in patients with IE. The incidence of systemic embolization in patients with IE ranges from 10 to 50%, and cerebral embolization is particularly associated with high mortality rates.

Both the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) have developed guidelines providing recommendations for the proper timing of surgery in patients at risk of developing emboli. However, the level of evidence (LOE) is low. The previous ESC IE guidelines from 2015 recommended surgical treatment within days in cases of vegetation exceeding 15 mm and no prior embolic events, with a class IIB recommendation and LOE C. Similarly, the ACC and AHA recommend surgery during initial hospitalization and before the completion of full antibiotic treatment, with a class IIb, LOE B. In contrast, the ESC 2023 IE guidelines have recommended surgery for vegetation size reduced to 10 mm or above with no embolic events and low surgical risk, with a class IIb, LOE B. The new guidelines define early surgical treatment as occurring within 3–5 days.

Infective endocarditis continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite recent advances in its management and remains a serious and challenging condition requiring a multidisciplinary approach. Surgery is essential in at least 50% of cases. Surgical outcomes have improved with the introduction of newer techniques for valve reconstruction and depend on many factors, including the underlying cause, causative organism, tissues involved, and host factors.

Ethical approval of this analysis was not required as no human or animal subjects were involved. This review was registered with the National Institute for Health Research International Registry of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023387667).

The data underlying this article are available in the article and in its online supplementary material.

We performed a comprehensive literature search to identify studies reporting short‐ and long‐term outcomes in patients with infective endocarditis (IE) who had a formal surgical indication for valve surgery. Searches were run without time restriction in the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library (Wiley). The search strategy for Ovid MEDLINE is available in Table S1.

The study selection followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses strategy. After deduplication, records were screened by two independent reviewers (T.C. and H.K.). Any discrepancies and disagreements were resolved by a third author (M.D.). Titles and abstracts were reviewed against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were considered for inclusion if they were written in English, reported all‐cause mortality, and the data were displayed with a Kaplan–Meier curve showing direct comparison between patients with IE with surgical indication divided by patients who underwent valve surgery versus patients who were conservatively treated.

### Perspectives on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis [^113B2rJW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

In 2007, the American Heart Association published a guideline statement dramatically changing its previous position on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at risk of infective endocarditis (IE). This year, these views were incorporated in an update of the 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease. The new recommendations represent a dramatic shift regarding which patients should receive antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of IE and for what procedures.

- **A striking shift without new data**: The shift in recommendations is striking because they are based not on new data but on no data. There are no large, prospective, randomized double-blind trials testing the efficacy of IE prophylaxis. However, available data suggest that there may be no real risk associated with IE prophylaxis.

- **Risk-benefit analysis**: Even if few cases of IE are successfully prevented using antibiotic prophylaxis, those few cases may represent a favorable risk-benefit ratio. On an individual basis, patients with organic heart valve disease who are trying to delay or avoid surgical intervention have something very real to risk if they develop IE and a very real benefit if they avoid it. Pending data from prospective randomized trials, a strategy of individual decision-making by informed patients may be best.

Regarding surgical interventions for infective endocarditis, specifically with respect to indications for surgery in left-sided endocarditis and NVE, the AHA 2015 guidelines recommend considering early surgery in patients with left-sided native valve IE and any of the following conditions:

- **IE caused by fungi or highly resistant organisms**: Such as VRE and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.

- **Recurrent emboli and persistent or enlarging vegetations**: Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy.

- **Severe valve regurgitation and mobile vegetations**: Greater than 10 mm.

- **Mobile vegetations greater than 10 mm**: Particularly when involving the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve and associated with other relative indications for surgery.

### Infective endocarditis remains a deadly disease — it is bad news, especially whenandare involved: A call to action [^116fyoSv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The paradigm shift in the timing of surgery in infective endocarditis (IE) has been adopted in international guidelines, moving away from the concept of achieving sterility and operating late, toward early surgery to avoid heart failure, intractable sepsis, irreversible structural damage, and death. This move led to reduced all-cause mortality in a large meta-analysis, favoring surgery before 7 days compared with 8 to 21 days, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.50–0.74), albeit with a possible higher rate of recurrence in the early surgery group.

The modern approach to the management of IE is to actively identify the established indications for surgical intervention in every patient at the time of diagnosis and regularly thereafter, as a part of a multidisciplinary expert IE team. Despite this, the EuroENDO (European Infective Endocarditis) registry identified that 69.3% of patients had an indication for surgery, with only 51.2% of patients actually undergoing surgical intervention; the remaining 18.1% had the highest rates of mortality. Of those undergoing surgery, just 31.5% went to the operating theater emergently or urgently, with 32.0% operated beyond the first week, and 36.5% electively.

In the study, the population statistics preclude identification of surgical indications; however, operative rates declined steadily from 24.8% in 2010–2011 to 17.6% in 2016–2017. If we are to reduce mortality in IE further, it is imperative we reconfigure our services to improve response times. Training a cohort of cardiologists to identify IE early and manage it aggressively is essential.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: Updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^115zBmBZ]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

The aim of infective endocarditis (IE) services is addressed through new recommendations, which, in the absence of high-quality evidence, are based on Working Party consensus. IE is an uncommon and challenging condition, and management by experienced multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) is widely considered the standard of care. The primary aim of the IE team is, in our opinion, to improve patient outcomes, with a secondary aim to enhance the efficiency of care. It is essential for all hospitals to have IE teams, as patients with IE or suspected IE can present at any acute facility; however, this has not been sufficiently emphasized. The functions and composition of an IE team will vary in different settings and may need to be dynamic, allowing individuals to rotate into the role depending on resources and local staffing arrangements.

- **Functions of the multidisciplinary IE team**: We believe that early diagnosis of IE leads to improved outcomes, which is likely dependent on the early initiation of optimal antibiotic therapy and the optimal timing of surgery. A reduction in time to targeted antibiotic therapy and the first transthoracic echocardiogram was observed in one MDT evaluation. Educational packages to raise awareness of the risk of IE in patients with S. aureus bacteremia may also help to expedite diagnosis. One factor likely to positively affect outcomes for many patients is prompt access to cardiac surgery. Since this is best assessed in a heart center, clear pathways for consultation and referral between non-surgical and surgical centers, along with objective criteria to guide referral, are needed.

### Conservative versus surgical therapy in patients with infective endocarditis and surgical indication-meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data [^113CFAef]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

In approximately one-third of patients with infective endocarditis (IE), recommended surgical intervention is not performed. When compared to patients who undergo surgical intervention, these individuals experience significantly worse short-term and long-term survival. Studies suggest heterogeneity in outcomes depending on the indication for surgical intervention. The prevention of embolism as an indication is less relevant compared to heart failure and uncontrolled infection when predicting mortality in patients who are refused surgical treatment. Even if the causes for rejecting surgical intervention are manifold, a better understanding of the role and timing of surgery in patients with IE is needed.

Regarding surgical interventions for infective endocarditis, specifically in terms of the timing of surgery, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering urgent or emergency surgery. This consideration should weigh the likelihood of achieving a meaningful neurological outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and an unstable clinical status due to heart failure, uncontrolled infection, or persistent high embolic risk.

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: updated guidance from the Joint British Societies [^1154t2gS]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

- **Endocarditis teams**: All hospitals involved in the care of patients with confirmed or suspected infective endocarditis (IE) should have an IE team. The IE team should include at a minimum, an infection specialist and a cardiologist who is an accredited specialist in echocardiography, or a cardiologist and an additional accredited specialist in echocardiography, who can be a cardiologist or clinical physiologist/scientist. At heart centers, hospitals with cardiac surgical units, there should also be access to cardiac surgeons and cardiologists with expertise in the removal of infected implantable cardiac electronic devices. Where patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) are managed, there should be access to a cardiologist with ACHD expertise. The IE team should have access to pediatric infection specialists and pediatric cardiologists, unless there is a dedicated pediatric IE team.

- **Guidelines and review**: Local guidelines should be in place to guide diagnosis, investigation, and the empirical and directed antibiotic therapy of suspected or confirmed IE. In addition to routine daily clinical care, there should be regular, at least weekly, IE team review of patients with confirmed or suspected IE. This can take the form of a multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting and/or bedside patient review. Additional ad hoc MDT meetings may be needed to manage emergencies.

### Infective endocarditis: diagnosis and management [^115btGnE]. Nature Clinical Practice. Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Despite advances in antimicrobial therapy, diagnostic imaging, and cardiac surgery, infective endocarditis (IE) remains a clinical challenge and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis relies on several factors: initial clinical suspicion, microbiological data, and echocardiographic findings. The use of an integrated diagnostic schema, such as the modified Duke criteria, is useful. Transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography should be performed promptly for all suspected IE cases. Although the choice of investigation might be influenced by availability, the approach to imaging should be tailored to the individual's clinical situation.

Promptly administered intravenous antimicrobial therapy is essential, while the use of antiplatelet or antithrombin therapy to prevent embolic complications is not supported by clinical data. Deciding whether to undertake cardiac surgery for the treatment of IE can be extremely difficult. The principal indications are the development of heart failure from acute, severe aortic or mitral regurgitation, or perivalvular extension of infection. The timing of surgery following central nervous system embolization is problematic because of the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Prophylactic surgery to prevent embolization is currently advocated only for managing large, mobile vegetations, when performed at centers with high volumes of heart valve surgery.

In this review, we describe diagnostic approaches for IE, particularly echocardiography, and provide recommendations for treatment, paying particular attention to individual patient circumstances.

### Conservative versus surgical therapy in patients with infective endocarditis and surgical indication-meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data [^115BGoo3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment during the past decades, infective endocarditis (IE) remains associated with a poor prognosis, with an in-hospital and 1-year mortality rate of around 20% and 40%, respectively. Managing IE involves a combination of antimicrobial treatment and surgical intervention when complications arise. European and American guidelines provide similar recommendations for surgery, which have remained consistent for decades.

There are three main reasons to undergo surgery in the setting of acute IE: heart failure, uncontrolled infection, and prevention of septic embolization. The percentage of patients with IE undergoing cardiac surgery, however, exhibits substantial variation in different studies, ranging from 10% to 73%, most probably influenced by inherent referral biases. Jensen et al. recently conducted an analysis of the Danish nationwide IE registry, mitigating the risk of a referral bias. A total of 8,804 patients experiencing their first episode of IE between 1999 and 2018 were enrolled in the study. Among them, 1,981 individuals (22.5%) underwent surgical intervention during their hospital admission. However, it is not mentioned how many of the patients had an indication for surgical intervention but did not receive surgery. Indeed, several studies have shown that despite the benefits of surgical treatment being firmly established in cases with a clear indication, surgery is not performed in up to one-third of patients. For example, in the 2008 prospective population-based French survey on IE comprising 303 patients, according to…

Regarding specific circumstances for infective endocarditis, particularly in patients with neurological complications, the timing of valve surgery is critical. The ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the delay of valve surgery for at least 4 weeks in hemodynamically stable patients with infective endocarditis and major ischemic stroke with extensive neurological damage or intracerebral hemorrhage.
