## Question

Food poisoning after eating a chicken sandwich

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about food poisoning after eating a chicken sandwich. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the key elements of the history that narrow the differential. Then, I should verify the most likely pathogens and toxins given the food vehicle and timing. Next, I will review red flags and when to escalate care or test. After that, I should outline evidence-based management, including rehydration and when to use antibiotics. Finally, I will consider prevention, public health implications, and what to do if symptoms persist or worsen, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the critical history elements I need to elicit: exact timing of symptom onset relative to the sandwich, predominant symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever), severity and duration, comorbidities or high-risk status, and whether others who ate the same food are ill. I should also ask about preparation details, storage, and whether the chicken was cooked and held at safe temperatures, because these factors shape pretest probabilities and management decisions [^112xmJPy] [^115uzh14].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should categorize the illness pattern by incubation and symptoms to estimate the likely mechanism. Rapid-onset vomiting within 30 minutes to 8 hours suggests a preformed toxin such as Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus, whereas diarrhea with or without fever starting after 6 hours points toward infection with organisms like Salmonella, Campylobacter, or Clostridium perfringens. This categorization guides both testing and treatment urgency [^114ugiG5].

> I will now examine the most likely etiologies for a chicken sandwich. Staphylococcus aureus is high on the list if the chicken was cooked, then held improperly, allowing toxin production; the incubation is typically 30 minutes to 8 hours with prominent vomiting and cramping, and fever is usually absent, which fits many sandwich-related outbreaks [^114ugiG5]. Wait, let me verify the temperature ranges: S. aureus grows and produces enterotoxin optimally between roughly 35–41°C, and the toxins are heat-stable, so reheating does not reliably inactivate them, which explains why poor holding temperature is so consequential [^114deeET].

> Next, I should review Campylobacter jejuni, which is strongly linked to poultry and can present with fever, cramping, and sometimes bloody diarrhea; complications like Guillain-Barré are rare but important, and attribution studies suggest poultry accounts for a substantial fraction of human cases, so undercooked or cross-contaminated chicken remains a credible source even without a clear temperature breach [^111TDPoL]. I need to ensure I ask about travel, farm exposure, and whether the chicken appeared undercooked or pink, as these details adjust the likelihood of Campylobacter [^111TDPoL].

> Let me consider Salmonella as well, since chicken is a major reservoir. Non-typhoidal Salmonella typically causes diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps with an incubation of 6 hours to 6 days; severe cases can progress to bacteremia or focal infections, so I should double-check for systemic features or persistent fever beyond 48–72 hours that would lower my threshold for antibiotics and further workup [^114ugiG5] [^115uzh14]. But wait, what if the patient is high risk? In older adults, immunocompromised hosts, or those with chronic disease, Salmonella carries higher risks of invasive disease, so I should maintain a lower threshold for therapy and closer follow-up [^115uzh14].

> I should also keep Clostridium perfringens in mind, especially with large-batch, slow-cooked, or held foods. The presentation is watery diarrhea with cramping and a relatively short duration, and outbreaks have been linked to improperly cooled chicken, including fatal cases in institutional settings with impaired motility or medication effects, so I need to ask about batch cooking, cooling practices, and comorbidities that slow gut transit [^115HdCip] [^114ugiG5]. Hold on, I should verify that the incubation is indeed 6–24 hours, which aligns with the classic pattern for C. perfringens enterotoxin-mediated disease [^114ugiG5].

> Now, I need to check for red flags that mandate escalation: severe dehydration with orthostasis, intractable vomiting precluding oral rehydration, high fever above 39°C, bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, neurologic symptoms, immunocompromise, pregnancy, or age extremes. These features warrant urgent evaluation, IV fluids, and consideration of early diagnostics and antibiotics when indicated [^115uzh14] [^11271Nja]. I should confirm that persistent symptoms beyond 3–5 days, weight loss, or systemic signs also push me toward stool testing and targeted therapy rather than continued empiric care [^115uzh14].

> For diagnostic strategy, let me think about when to test and what to order. In mild, nonbloody, afebrile cases with a short duration, supportive care without testing is reasonable, but I should obtain stool cultures if there is fever, blood in stool, immunocompromise, severe illness, outbreak suspicion, or symptoms persisting beyond about 3–5 days. I should also request culture for Campylobacter and Salmonella and consider C. difficile if antibiotic exposure or risk factors are present, recognizing that culture yield is imperfect and results may be delayed [^113wXrZw] [^115uzh14]. Hold on, I should verify that stool is the specimen of choice in outbreaks as well; yes, collecting stool from 5–10 ill persons early in the course improves etiologic confirmation and public health action [^112y1N8s].

> Management hinges on rehydration and supportive care. I should confirm that oral rehydration is first-line for mild to moderate dehydration and that IV fluids are indicated for severe dehydration, intractable vomiting, or high-risk patients. Antiemetics can facilitate oral rehydration, and antidiarrheals may be used cautiously in adults without dysentery or high fever, avoiding them in children or when invasive disease is suspected [^1132ywqx] [^115uzh14]. Let me reconsider antibiotics: for most nonsevere, nonbloody diarrheas in immunocompetent hosts, antibiotics are not routinely indicated, but I should treat if there is high fever, dysentery, immunocompromise, pregnancy, severe illness, or specific pathogens like Campylobacter or Salmonella in high-risk hosts, tailoring to local resistance patterns and culture results when available [^115uzh14] [^116TUHa3].

> I should double-check public health steps if multiple people are ill or if the exposure points to a commercial source. Reporting to local health authorities is appropriate, and investigators will assess incubation, symptoms, and food histories to determine whether this represents a cluster or outbreak, which can trigger traceback and control measures even before lab confirmation returns [^115uzh14] [^1112BiBf]. But wait, what if the patient is unsure whether to report? I should advise that outbreaks are often detected via complaints, so timely reporting improves detection and prevention of additional cases [^115W9uGc].

> Next, I should review prevention counseling to reduce recurrence. The CDC's Clean, Separate, Cook, Chill framework applies: wash hands and surfaces, prevent cross-contamination between raw chicken and ready-to-eat foods, cook poultry to a safe internal temperature of 165°F verified with a thermometer, and refrigerate perishables within 2 hours. These steps directly address the common failure points seen in sandwich-related outbreaks [^111DoaVJ] [^111DoaVJ]. I need to ensure I emphasize that raw chicken should not be washed, as this increases sink contamination without improving safety, and that leftovers be reheated to 165°F before consumption [^111m8zMf].

> Let me verify follow-up and when to broaden the differential. If symptoms persist beyond 5–7 days, recur, or new features develop, I should reconsider alternative diagnoses such as parasitic infection, C. difficile, inflammatory bowel disease, or even noninfectious etiologies, and I should reassess for complications like reactive arthritis or postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome, particularly after Campylobacter or Salmonella [^115uzh14] [^111TDPoL]. I should confirm that patients with high-risk features have clear return precautions and that any ongoing public health concerns are communicated promptly [^115uzh14].

> In summary, after a chicken sandwich, the most likely culprits are preformed toxins such as Staphylococcus aureus if symptoms began within hours, or bacterial infections such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, or Clostridium perfringens if diarrhea and possibly fever began after 6 hours. Management is primarily supportive with rehydration, selective testing, and antibiotics reserved for specific indications or high-risk hosts, while prevention counseling and public health reporting when appropriate are essential to limit spread and recurrence [^113fKRXi] [^115uzh14] [^111DoaVJ].

Food poisoning from a chicken sandwich is most often due to **Salmonella** or **Campylobacter** from undercooked or contaminated chicken, with symptoms starting 6–72 hours after eating and lasting 2–7 days [^114ugiG5] [^115dqtnU]. Supportive care with **oral rehydration** is the mainstay; antibiotics are reserved for severe or high-risk cases [^1132ywqx] [^116TUHa3]. Most people recover fully, but complications can occur in vulnerable groups, so seek care for severe symptoms, high fever, blood in stool, or dehydration [^115uzh14] [^11271Nja]. Prevent recurrence by cooking chicken to 165°F, avoiding cross-contamination, and refrigerating promptly [^111m8zMf] [^111DoaVJ].

## Common pathogens and toxins

Several **pathogens and toxins** can cause food poisoning from a chicken sandwich:

| **Pathogen/toxin** | **Source** | **Incubation period** | **Symptoms** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Salmonella | Undercooked or contaminated chicken | 6–72 hours | - Diarrhea <br/> - Fever <br/> - Abdominal cramps <br/> - Vomiting [^114ugiG5] |
| Campylobacter | Undercooked or contaminated chicken | 2–5 days | - Diarrhea (often bloody) <br/> - Fever <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Nausea [^115dqtnU] |
| Staphylococcus aureus (preformed toxin) | Contaminated deli meats, mayonnaise, or improper food handling | 30 minutes–8 hours | - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Abdominal cramps <br/> - Diarrhea [^113fKRXi] |
| Clostridium perfringens | Large batches of cooked chicken held at unsafe temperatures | 6–24 hours | - Watery diarrhea <br/> - Abdominal cramps <br/> - Mild fever [^114ugiG5] |
| Listeria monocytogenes | Contaminated deli meats or processed chicken | 1–4 weeks | - Fever <br/> - Muscle aches <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Diarrhea <br/> - Risk of severe complications in vulnerable populations [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical presentation and timeline

Symptoms typically begin within **6–72 hours** after consumption, depending on the pathogen and toxin load [^114ugiG5]. Common symptoms include:

- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea (may be watery or bloody)
- Abdominal cramps
- Fever
- Headache
- Muscle aches
- Dehydration

Most cases resolve within **2–7 days**, but severe cases can persist longer, especially in vulnerable populations [^115uzh14].

---

## Risk factors

Certain factors increase the risk of **severe illness**:

- **Age**: Children under 5, older adults, and pregnant women are at higher risk [^11271Nja].
- **Immune status**: Immunocompromised individuals are more susceptible to severe infections [^11271Nja].
- **Food handling**: Improper cooking, cross-contamination, and poor hygiene increase risk [^111m8zMf].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by **patient history** and symptom assessment [^115uzh14]. Laboratory testing may include:

- **Stool cultures**: For bacterial pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli) [^113wXrZw].
- **Toxin assays**: For detecting preformed toxins (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins) [^111Jztoq].
- **Blood tests**: For severe cases or suspected systemic infection [^notfound].

---

## Treatment and management

Most cases are **self-limited** and managed with supportive care:

- **Rehydration**: Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are first-line for mild to moderate dehydration [^1132ywqx].
- **Antiemetics**: For severe nausea and vomiting.
- **Antibiotics**: Reserved for severe cases, high-risk patients, or specific pathogens (e.g. Salmonella, Campylobacter) [^115uzh14].
- **Hospitalization**: For severe dehydration, systemic infection, or complications [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Complications can occur, particularly in **high-risk individuals**:

- **Dehydration**: Especially in children and older adults [^115HdCVa].
- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Due to prolonged vomiting and diarrhea.
- **Renal failure**: From severe dehydration or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [^notfound].
- **Guillain-Barré syndrome**: A rare complication of Campylobacter infection [^115dqtnU].
- **Sepsis**: Particularly in immunocompromised individuals [^notfound].

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventing food poisoning from chicken sandwiches involves **safe food handling** and cooking practices:

- **Cooking**: Ensure chicken is cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) [^111m8zMf].
- **Hygiene**: Wash hands thoroughly before and after handling raw chicken [^111m8zMf].
- **Cross-contamination**: Keep raw chicken separate from ready-to-eat foods [^111m8zMf].
- **Storage**: Refrigerate cooked chicken promptly and consume within safe timeframes [^111m8zMf].

---

## Public health implications

Food poisoning from chicken sandwiches has significant **public health implications**, including:

- **Burden of disease**: Millions of cases annually, leading to substantial healthcare costs and productivity losses [^115vdWw1].
- **Outbreaks**: Often linked to restaurants, delis, and catered events, necessitating public health investigations and interventions [^115W9uGc].
- **Regulatory efforts**: Ongoing surveillance, food safety regulations, and public education campaigns [^112fstWL].

### Food poisoning [^117QsXPw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Food poisoning is encountered throughout the world. Many of the toxins responsible for specific food poisoning syndromes are no longer limited to isolated geographic locations. With increased travel and the ease of transporting food products, it is likely that a patient may present to any emergency department with the clinical effects of food poisoning. Recognizing specific food poisoning syndromes allows emergency health care providers not only to initiate appropriate treatment rapidly but also to notify health departments early and thereby prevent further poisoning cases. This article reviews several potential food-borne poisons and describes each agent's mechanism of toxicity, expected clinical presentation, and currently accepted treatment.

### How safe is our food? [^114u4QP6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Estimates of the relative burden of disease caused by specific pathogens are crucial for improving our understanding of foodborne illness risks, but they are insufficient on their own. To target interventions (which are almost always food specific), illnesses must be quantified in terms of food–pathogen combinations. Doing so, in turn, requires development of what have been termed food attribution data. That is, how much salmonellosis is caused by eating contaminated chicken versus eggs, beef, or pork? How often is beef, compared with produce, the source of infection with E. coli O157:H7? Likewise, summary statistics such as number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths ignore at-risk subpopulations and chronic sequelae such as end-stage renal disease, congenital toxoplasmosis, and irritable bowel syndrome. As such, the World Health Organization and many industrialized countries are increasingly reporting integrated measures of disease, such as disability-adjusted life years, which more fully capture disease symptoms and severities. Furthermore, to reduce specific foodborne hazards, we need information about the many factors along the complex farm-to-table pathway that can lead to the introduction or amplification of pathogens that contaminate food. This information would also help determine feasibility and efficacy of potential interventions.

As outlined in a recent Institute of Medicine report, implementation of a modern, risk-based food safety system in the United States will ultimately require much better data and a strong analytic capacity at the federal level that cuts across current agency lines. Although we still have a long way to go to bring our food safety system into the current century, the articles by Scallan et al. are critical steps in the right direction.

### Foodborne illness [^114hNJNH]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

While few patients with foodborne illness present with life-threatening symptoms, there are a number of foodborne infectious diseases and toxins that the emergency physician or other health care provider must consider in the evaluation of these patients. Given the frequency of international travel, as well as the risk associated with recurrent outbreaks of foodborne illness from commercial food sources, it is important to recognize various syndromes of foodborne illness, including those which may require specific evaluation and management strategies. This article reviews a number of the most common causes of foodborne illness, as well as several less common pathogens with the potential for causing significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly identified and treated.

Food safety

Food poisoning

Some foods more commonly cause food poisoning than others, including raw or undercooked meat and poultry, raw seafood, raw or undercooked eggs, raw (unpasteurized) milk and soft cheeses made from raw milk, raw flour, and uncooked or unwashed fruits and vegetables. A variety of germs can contaminate these foods and cause illness, such as norovirus and bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. CDC estimates that 48 million people in the US become ill due to foodborne infections every year. These infections can spread directly from person-to-person and through contaminated foods.

Depending on the germ causing the illness, symptoms may appear within 30 minutes to up to 7 days after ingestion. Typical symptoms of food poisoning include nausea, vomiting, cramps or abdominal pain, diarrhea, and may also include fever. In mild cases, symptoms last for 24–72 hours. In more severe cases, vomiting and diarrhea may be prolonged, people may become dehydrated due to a lack of adequate fluid intake, diarrhea may be bloody, and fever may be higher than 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit).

Anyone can get food poisoning. Most people who do have mild cases. However, some people are at higher risk of more severe disease. These higher risk individuals are those whose immune systems are not functioning normally. Individuals in this category include children under 5 years old, individuals who are pregnant, adults aged 65 years or older, anyone who may be receiving immunosuppressive treatments, such as cancer or transplant patients, and patients with HIV/AIDS, diabetes, or liver or kidney disease.

### Outbreak of staphylococcal food poisoning from a military unit lunch party-United States, July 2012 [^1158et1S]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Green beans with potatoes

On the morning of July 30, the green bean and potato dish was prepared by combining canned green beans and chopped potatoes in a slow cooker on a high setting.

All precooked food was maintained in slow cookers for transport on July 30 and reheated at the venue in separate slow cookers with the exception of the chicken wings, which were placed in a foil container after preparation and never reheated. The food was served buffet style at approximately 11:00 a.m. using utensils owned by the preparer. Throughout the food preparation and food service process, food preparers did not wear gloves. The preparers did not have any open wounds on their hands, and their hands were not tested for any organisms.

Editorial Note

Staphylococcal food poisoning, one of the most common foodborne illnesses in the United States, is caused by ingestion of one or more preformed staphylococcal enterotoxins. S. aureus is able to grow and express enterotoxins in a wide variety of foods (e.g. milk, meat, and egg products; mixed foods; cakes; and ice cream). Intoxication is characterized by rapid onset of nausea, violent and copious vomiting, and abdominal cramping (with or without diarrhea). Fever usually is absent. The incubation period ranges from 30 minutes to 8 hours (3 hours on average), depending on individual susceptibility and the amount of toxin ingested. Illness usually is self-limited, resolving in 24–48 hours, and rarely is severe enough to warrant hospitalization.

What is already known on this topic?

Staphylococcus aureus intoxication is a common foodborne illness that usually is not detected or reported because outbreaks are sudden and short-lived, have a low mortality rate, and laboratory confirmation is not obtained. Staphylococcal enterotoxin A is the most common cause of staphylococcal food poisoning.

What is added by this report?

This report describes 22 cases of staphylococcal intoxication associated with a lunch party at a military base. Epidemiologic analysis suggested a preformed enterotoxin in a chicken, sausage, and rice dish. Isolation of S. aureus along with identification of staphylococcal enterotoxin A in food confirmed the cause of illness. Rapid detection methods, which are widely available commercially, were used to detect the enterotoxin in food samples, establishing the likely cause of the outbreak before culture results were available.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) common food coallergies — Observed occurrence by food group: Reported coallergy patterns include Solid food (any) with Any solid food < 16%, Solid food (any) with Another solid food < 44%, Solid food (any) with CM or soy < 25%, Grains (rice, oats, etc) with Other grains (including rice) About 50%, and Poultry with Other poultry < 40%. Caution is warranted because these data derive from single centers and more severe populations and might overestimate actual coallergy risk.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^112xRB6w]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Overview of Chapter 2. Fundamental concepts of public health surveillance and foodborne disease — clinical presentation and incubation are described: illnesses from preformed toxins manifest rapidly, often in a matter of minutes or hours, and the most common symptom is vomiting; illnesses caused by infections take longer, ranging from hours to days or weeks; symptoms usually include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps; fever and an elevated white blood cell count also can occur. Because certain pathogens are commonly associated with certain foods, the suspected food in an outbreak can occasionally suggest a particular disease agent, but most foods can be associated with a variety of pathogens and new vehicles emerge each year, so care must be taken in inferring an etiologic agent on the basis of a suspected food.

### An allergist's approach to food poisoning [^113jShZz]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Foodborne illnesses represent a significant global health concern. These preventable diseases lead to substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide. Substantial overlap with food allergy exists with similar clinical presentations and symptom onset. Knowledge of the typically implicated microorganisms and toxins can help properly identify these diseases. A thorough history is essential to differentiate between these 2 disorders. The types of food implicated may be similar including milk, egg, fish, and shellfish. The timing of symptom onset may overlap and lead to misdiagnosis of disorders such as food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome. Classically, histamine-related food poisoning is also typically confused with true food allergy and may be seen as related to fish and cheese. Knowledge of epidemiology, patterns, and etiology of allergic conditions and foodborne illness may help the allergist differentiate among these common diseases.

### Campylobacter jejuni infections: update on emerging issues and trends [^115dqtnU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Infection with Campylobacter jejuni is one of the most common causes of gastroenteritis worldwide; it occurs more frequently than do infections caused by Salmonella species, Shigella species, or Escherichia coli O157:H7. In developed countries, the incidence of Campylobacter jejuni infections peaks during infancy and again during early adulthood. Most infections are acquired by the consumption and handling of poultry. A typical case is characterized by diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. Obtaining cultures of the organism from stool samples remains the best way to diagnose this infection. An alarming recent trend is the rapid emergence of antimicrobial agent — resistant Campylobacter strains all over the world. Use of antibiotics in animals used for food has accelerated this trend. It is fortunate that complications of C. jejuni infections are rare, and most patients do not require antibiotics. Guillain-Barré syndrome is now recognized as a post-infectious complication of C. jejuni infection, but its incidence is < 1 per 1000 infections. Careful food preparation and cooking practices may prevent some Campylobacter infections.

### Mass aconite poisoning from a mislabelled spice product [^112TX6MS]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aconitine is a potentially lethal alkaloid found in more than 200 plant species belonging to the genus Aconitum (aconite). Most cases of poisoning involve the improper processing of traditional Chinese medicine. We report a mass poisoning event caused by consumption of unprocessed aconite root powders mislabeled as sand ginger.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective case series of patients who presented to two hospitals in the Greater Toronto area with aconite poisoning from a chicken dish eaten at a local restaurant. Demographic, management, and outcome data were collected by review of the electronic medical record.

Results

Over an 8h period, 11 patients presented to hospital with features of aconite poisoning. Symptoms began shortly after ingestion and included perioral paraesthesia (91%) and nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain (64%). In the hospital, the spectrum of illness varied from paraesthesia requiring no intervention (9%) to refractory ventricular dysrhythmias (73%) managed with infusions of sodium bicarbonate, amiodarone, and vasopressors. Two patients received mechanical ventilation for 48h. No patients died. A public health investigation identified a mislabelled sand ginger spice product imported from China as the source of unprocessed aconite (aconitine 0.55%).

Discussion

With the increasing availability of internationally sourced spice products, such events are likely to recur.

Conclusions

This series demonstrates the potential for mass aconite poisoning through contaminated food and highlights the critical role of poison centers and public health systems in responding to such events.

### A case-control study of food poisoning seen at an accident and emergency department [^1158678E]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

We investigated the hypothesis that sporadic food poisoning is a result of the consumption of food cooked or prepared outside the home. We did a case-control study, set in an urban emergency department, to find out the odds ratios for the risk of food poisoning associated with various patterns of consumption. We found that recent eating out (exposure on the day of or day before presentation) was associated with an odds ratio of 2.41 (95% CI 1.29–4.50) for presenting with food poisoning.

### Outbreak of staphylococcal food poisoning from a military unit lunch party-United States, July 2012 [^114deeET]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What are the implications for public health practice?

This report highlights the importance of immediate public health outbreak response, adds to the understanding of food poisoning caused by S. aureus, and confirms the need to communicate better food safety practices to both food workers and the general public. Laboratory use of toxin detection kits can provide rapid identification of staphylococcal enterotoxins directly from food and help guide the response of public health authorities.

S. aureus produces numerous serologically distinct enterotoxins, (A through V, excluding F). Staphylococcal enterotoxin A is considered the main cause of staphylococcal food poisoning. Illness can be caused by ingestion of as little as 20 ng of enterotoxin. Although staphylococci commonly are found on environmental surfaces and in various food products, food handlers carrying enterotoxin-producing S. aureus in their noses or on their hands are regarded as the main source of contamination.

Temperature limits for S. aureus replication and enterotoxin production are 43°F–118°F (6°C–48°C) and 50°F–115°F (10°C–46°C), respectively. Optimal growth temperatures for S. aureus replication and enterotoxin production are 95°F–106°F (35°C–41°C) and 93°F–104°F (34°C–40°C), respectively. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are resistant to heat treatment, low pH, and proteolytic enzymes (all of which easily destroy S. aureus). Once toxins are produced, they are retained through subsequent food preparation and storage processes and digestive tract ingestion. Measures to prevent the proliferation of the S. aureus organism therefore are critical.

In this outbreak, the initial source of contamination of the perlo is unknown but might have occurred while the preparer was handling the chicken after it was initially cooked. The overnight storage of the precooked perlo in an unrefrigerated environment was the probable cause of organism proliferation and enterotoxin production. Subsequent rewarming of the perlo for approximately 1 hour the following day did not destroy the heat-stable toxin and might have further increased toxin load.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^114ZWvJ4]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Signs, symptoms, incubation period, and duration of illness — categorization of suspected foodborne illness can aid agent identification. In identifying the likely etiologic agent on the basis of signs, symptoms, incubation period, and duration of illness, it is often helpful to first categorize a suspected foodborne illness as resulting from a preformed toxin, enterotoxin, or infection, and illnesses from preformed toxins are caused by ingestion of food already contaminated by toxins.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^113fKRXi]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Etiologic agents associated with foodborne diseases — preformed toxins versus infections explains that preformed toxins most often result from bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium botulinum, that release toxins into food during growth in the food; the preformed toxin is ingested and live bacteria do not need to be consumed, illness manifests more rapidly, and the incubation period is often minutes or hours, with signs and symptoms that commonly include vomiting and other symptoms ranging from nausea and diarrhea to interference with sensory and motor functions (e.g., double vision, weakness, respiratory failure, numbness, tingling of the face, disorientation), and fever is rarely present. In contrast, infections result from growth of a microorganism in the body via two mechanisms — organisms invade tissues and directly damage them, or organisms invade and multiply and then release toxins (enterotoxins) — so the incubation periods for infections are relatively long, often days, compared with minutes or hours as with preformed toxins; symptoms of infection usually include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps, fever and an elevated white blood cell count can also occur, and if spread to the bloodstream occurs, organs such as the liver, spleen, gallbladder, bones, and meninges can be affected with longer duration and increased severity.

Alpha-gal syndrome — dietary management and emergency self-care centers on dietary elimination and preparedness. The cornerstone is diet change, as "The cornerstone of managing alpha-gal syndrome is eliminating alpha-gal from the diet", and patients "should be counseled to not eat pork, beef, venison, and other mammalian meat", while "Fish, seafood, turkey, chicken, and other fowl are acceptable for patients with alpha-gal". Gelatin-containing foods "also may be problematic". For accidental exposure, patients should "take 1 or 2 diphenhydramine 25 milligram tablets, and make sure that they have access to self-injectable epinephrine". The article adds that "there are no prospective controlled studies that document acupuncture as an effective treatment".

Food safety — food poisoning highlights implicated foods, burden, symptoms, and high‑risk groups. CDC estimates that 48 million people in the US become ill due to foodborne infections every year. Depending on the germ, symptoms may appear within 30 minutes to up to 7 days after ingestion; mild cases last for 24–72 hours, while in more severe cases fever may be higher than 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit). Higher‑risk individuals include children under 5 years old, individuals who are pregnant, adults aged 65 years or older, anyone who may be receiving immunosuppressive treatments, and patients with HIV/AIDS, diabetes, or liver or kidney disease. A variety of germs can contaminate foods and cause illness, such as norovirus and bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella.

### Food safety for first responders [^115kPPT8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Relatively few published reports of intentional food contamination are available. However, after the anthrax attacks of 2001, biologic terrorism vulnerability assessments have determined that intentional food poisoning is a plausible means to widely disseminate pathogens, with potentially devastating effect. As a consequence, food security has emerged as one of the major priorities for bioterrorism preparedness. We describe a naturally occurring incident that demonstrates the potential for premeditated food contamination to target specific populations who are critical for protecting public safety, in this instance, a city police force. Measures to mitigate the risk of this scenario type are provided.

On the evening of December 19, 1998, local hospital emergency departments notified the Hawaii Department of Health that an unusually high number of police officers were coming to the hospitals with acute gastroenteritis. Earlier that day, several police-affiliated support associations had cosponsored a holiday event. The food was catered by a food service establishment that routinely provided meals at the police department headquarters in Honolulu. Active and retired police officers and their family members participated in the event. The food service at the event consisted of "bento lunch boxes" containing luncheon meat, a hot dog, teriyaki beef, fried chicken, and rice. Approximately 1,100 lunches were distributed at the event, some of which were taken offsite to be consumed by others, including on-duty officers at satellite police stations.

### Diagnosis and management of foodborne illness [^115uzh14]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that each year, one in six Americans will experience a foodborne illness. The most common causes in the United States are viruses, such as norovirus; bacteria, such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, and Listeria; and parasites, such as Toxoplasma gondii and Giardia. Resources are available to educate consumers on food recalls and proper handling, storage, and cooking of foods. Diagnosis and management of a foodborne illness are based on the history and physical examination. Common symptoms of foodborne illnesses include vomiting, diarrhea (with or without blood), fever, abdominal cramping, headache, dehydration, myalgia, and arthralgias. Definitive diagnosis can be made only through stool culture or more advanced laboratory testing. However, these results should not delay empiric treatment if a foodborne illness is suspected. Empiric treatment should focus on symptom management, rehydration if the patient is clinically dehydrated, and antibiotic therapy. Foodborne illnesses should be reported to local and state health agencies; reporting requirements vary among states.

Foodborne illness prevention

Food preparation

To reduce the chance of people getting food poisoning, the US CDC and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend 4 simple rules: clean, separate, cook, and chill (see Supplementary Material, Figure).

Clean

Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running water. Wash your hands before, during, and after meal preparation, especially when handling uncooked meat, poultry, seafood, eggs or flour. After the meal is prepared, wash all used utensils and cutting boards with hot, soapy water either by hand or in a dishwasher. Clean with disinfectant all countertops and other soiled surfaces. Choose a disinfectant marketed for use on kitchen or bathroom surfaces per the disinfectant brand's instructions. Wash your hands before eating.

Separate

Keep uncooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs contained apart from ready-to-eat foods when stored in the refrigerator and while being handled during meal preparation on cutting boards, plates, etc. Use appropriate containers to keep juices from raw foods from contacting ready-to-eat foods.

Cook

Cook foods to specific internal temperatures to kill any contaminating germs (see Supplementary Material, Table). Cook microwaved food to an internal temperature of 74 o C/165 o F. Use food thermometers inserted midway into the food to ensure food has reached appropriate internal temperatures.

Chill

Most bacteria multiply more rapidly at room temperature. To help prevent foodborne illness, refrigerate uncooked perishable food like meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, dairy, fruit, and vegetables, as well as cooked leftovers within 2 hours of being at room temperature. Keep refrigerators at 4 o C/40 o F or below. Keep freezers –18 o C/0 o F or below. Discard all foods before they are likely to spoil (see Supplementary Material, Table).

Of note, in this section, our primary focus is on preventing foodborne illnesses from contaminated food products. However, we also emphasize the importance of preventing the transmission of other infectious diseases while handling food for others. Individuals exhibiting respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea, may inadvertently contaminate food during preparation and potentially pass on infectious illnesses to others. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that individuals involved in food preparation do not have symptoms of illness, as outlined in Appendicesand.

### Foodborne botulism in the United States, 1990–2000 [^112Gdezx]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Our data have several limitations. Most clinical data were collected at one point, when antitoxin was sought by the treating clinician from CDC or a state health department. Changes in reporting format during the period reported resulted in incomplete data for a substantial portion of cases. Differences in toxin type–specific rates of intubation and deaths on a subset of cases must be cautiously interpreted in light of these facts.

Foodborne botulism, while rare, remains a public health emergency because of its severity and epidemic potential. Home-canned foods and Alaska Native foods remain the leading causes in the United States, and restaurant-associated outbreaks continue to account for a disproportionate number of illnesses. All suspected cases of botulism should be reported to public health authorities immediately. Prompt epidemiologic investigation helps prevent additional cases and can identify new risk factors for intoxication.

Following an extensive evaluation, he was diagnosed with Salmonella -associated myopericarditis. This case aims to raise awareness within the medical community about the cardiac effects of Salmonella infection. It emphasises the clinical symptoms observed and offers valuable perspectives on diagnostic methods for this uncommon but potentially fatal cause of myopericarditis. Swift identification and proper treatment are essential for positive outcomes, emphasising the significance of comprehensive care involving various medical disciplines in similar instances.

In healthy adults and children in developed countries, most foodborne and water-borne infections are short-lived and resolve without specific treatment. In developing areas, these infections may produce acute mortality and chronic morbidity caused by developmental impairment. Immune-compromised hosts are at increased risk of life-threatening complications. This article reviews recommendations for the treatment of the most common and important foodborne illnesses, focusing on those caused by infections or toxins of microbial origin. The cornerstone of life-saving treatment remains oral rehydration therapy, although the use of other supportive measures as well as antibiotics for certain infections is also recommended.

### Signs and symptoms of food allergy and food-induced anaphylaxis [^111R1Zbn]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Food allergies are increasing in prevalence. In order for pediatric clinicians to appropriately diagnose and manage food allergies, the characteristic signs and symptoms of these potentially severe reactions must be recognized. Unlike nonimmunologic adverse food reactions (such as lactose intolerance and food poisoning), food allergies by definition are immune-mediated responses that occur reproducibly on food ingestion. The varying clinical presentations of food allergy include IgE-mediated disorders, mixed IgE- and cell-mediated disorders, and cell-mediated food allergies. This review describes the clinical manifestations of each of these categories of food allergy, with special emphasis on recognition of food-induced anaphylaxis.

### Randomized controlled trial of active physician-based surveillance of foodborne illness [^116KsHGP]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Consent was given for the Public Health Unit's food inspectors to follow up 13 cases, 6 of which represented multiple associated cases with possible public health implications. In one family, three members had pain, altered temperature sensation, and lower limb weakness 4 to 36 hours after eating portions of flowery cod; they were diagnosed as suffering from ciguatera poisoning. This potentially serious condition is caused by consumption of heat-stable ciguatoxin concentrated in the tissues of certain types of reef fish that have ingested toxin-producing plankton. Ciguatera poisoning has wide global distribution, including the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean regions; it has important public health implications because of its frequency and severity, and the fact that prompt recognition and treatment can lead to a good clinical outcome

Better ascertainment of foodborne illness is required to improve food safety in Australia, including removing suspect foods from circulation. We found that passive surveillance of single cases increased the reporting of suspected foodborne illness by family physicians, while active surveillance based on telephone contacts elicited notification of clusters of associated cases, one of which required prompt public health action. At the least, this pilot suggests vast underreporting of food poisoning and that different strategies are available to improve reporting. A large-scale study would be required to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and value to public health of this form of enhanced surveillance.

### Preventing Campylobacter at the source: why is it so difficult? [^111TDPoL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Campylobacteriosis in humans, caused by Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, is the most common recognized bacterial zoonosis in the European Union and the United States. The acute phase is characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms. The long-term sequelae (Guillain-Barré syndrome, reactive arthritis, and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome) contribute considerably to the disease burden. Attribution studies identified poultry as the reservoir responsible for up to 80% of the human Campylobacter infections. In the European Union, an estimated 30% of the human infections are associated with consumption and preparation of poultry meat. Until now, interventions in the poultry meat production chain have not been effectively introduced except for targeted interventions in Iceland and New Zealand. Intervention measures (eg, biosecurity) have limited effect or are hampered by economic aspects or consumer acceptance. In the future, a multilevel approach should be followed, aiming at reducing the level of contamination of consumer products rather than complete absence of Campylobacter.

### Fatal foodborne Clostridium perfringens illness at a state psychiatric hospital – Louisiana, 2010 [^115HdCip]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

Clostridium perfringens, the third most common cause of foodborne illness in the United States (1), most often causes a self-limited, diarrheal disease lasting 12–24 hours. Fatalities are very rare, occurring in < 0.03% of cases (1). Death usually is caused by dehydration and occurs among the very young, the very old, and persons debilitated by illness (2). On May 7, 2010, 42 residents and 12 staff members at a Louisiana state psychiatric hospital experienced vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Within 24 hours, three patients had died. The three fatalities occurred among patients aged 41–61 years who were receiving medications that had anti-intestinal motility side effects. For two of three decedents, the cause of death found on postmortem examination was necrotizing colitis. Investigation by the Louisiana Office of Public Health (OPH) and CDC found that eating chicken served at dinner on May 6 was associated with illness. The chicken was cooked approximately 24 hours before serving and not cooled in accordance with hospital guidelines. C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) was detected in 20 of 23 stool specimens from ill residents and staff members. Genetic testing of C. perfringens toxins isolated from chicken and stool specimens was carried out to determine which of the two strains responsible for C. perfringens foodborne illness was present. The specimens tested negative for the beta-toxin gene, excluding C. perfringens type C as the etiologic agent and implicating C. perfringens type A. This outbreak underscores the need for strict food preparation guidelines at psychiatric inpatient facilities and the potential risk for adverse outcomes among any patients with impaired intestinal motility caused by medications, disease, and extremes of age when exposed to C. perfringens enterotoxin.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^115vNCJc]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Complaint systems — group complaints note that unrelated diarrhea cases may be inadvertently grouped with outbreak cases because annually approximately 48 million persons in the United States — or one of six — "normally" experience diarrhea, and inclusion of misclassified cases hinders the detection of associations between exposures and disease, decreasing the likelihood of discovering a common source. When reported clusters are small, the possibility must be considered that the reported cluster results from coincidence rather than causal association (type I probability error). With unusual syndromes such as neurologic symptoms associated with botulism or ciguatera fish poisoning, the likelihood of misclassification and type I probability error is low, and system specificity can be increased by identifying a specific agent or disease marker or by increasing the specificity of symptom information or by obtaining exposure information. Because exposures associated with group events are relatively few and can be described specifically, recall tends to be good and timing is less an issue than with pathogen-specific surveillance or independent complaints; in studies of food recall accuracy, the positive predictive value of individual food items ranged from 73% to 97% and the negative predictive value ranged from 79% to 98%. The more specific exposure-related questions are, the better recall will be, and interviews of food-preparation staff additionally provide valuable information by listing ingredients that cases may not recall or know about. Interviews of cases for group complaints capture two types of information: specific exposures associated with the reported event and individual food histories of cases to rule out alternate hypotheses and exclude misclassified cases; because individual food histories include a broad range of possible exposures and are associated with difficulties in recall, cases should be interviewed promptly for this aspect to be effective.

### Rare postoperative complication: septic shock following elective abdominal surgery [^116bnGp1]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Postoperative infections are one of the most common complications in general surgery, and while rates have reduced with the routine administration of perioperative antibiotics, around 5% of patients undergoing a surgical procedure will develop an infective complication. 1 The Gram-positive, obligate anaerobe, Clostridium perfringens, is a well-known pathogen that forms part of both the environmental and gastrointestinal flora. 2 While more commonly associated with food poisoning, anaerobic cellulitis and traumatic gas gangrene, rare cases of spontaneous non-traumatic gas gangrene of abdominal viscera have also been recorded. 3 Although potentially treatable with appropriate antibiotic cover, cases of C. perfringens can rapidly progress into fulminant and fatal sepsis. 4 Moreover, the timing of symptom onset postoperatively can vary significantly, reports ranging from hours to days. 5 6 We report a case of C. perfringens- induced septic shock following elective bowel resection.

### Glucagon kit (Glucag0n) [^113MA8do]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Turn the patient on his/her side. When an unconscious person awakens, he/she may vomit. Turning the patient on his/her side will prevent him/her from choking.

FEED THE PATIENT AS SOON AS HE/SHE AWAKENS AND IS ABLE TO SWALLOW. Give the patient a fast-acting source of sugar (such as a regular soft drink or fruit juice) and a long-acting source of sugar (such as crackers and cheese or a meat sandwich). If the patient does not awaken within 15 minutes, give another dose of glucagon and INFORM A DOCTOR OR EMERGENCY SERVICES IMMEDIATELY.

Even if the glucagon revives the patient, his/her doctor should be promptly notified. A doctor should be notified whenever severe hypoglycemic reactions occur.

INFORMATION ON HYPOGLYCEMIA

Early symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) include:

If not treated, the patient may progress to severe hypoglycemia that can include:

The occurrence of early symptoms calls for prompt and, if necessary, repeated administration of some form of carbohydrate. Patients should always carry a quick source of sugar, such as candy mints or glucose tablets. The prompt treatment of mild hypoglycemic symptoms can prevent severe hypoglycemic reactions. If the patient does not improve or if administration of carbohydrate is impossible, glucagon should be given or the patient should be treated with intravenous glucose at a medical facility. Glucagon, a naturally occurring substance produced by the pancreas, is helpful because it enables the patient to produce his/her own blood glucose to correct the hypoglycemia.

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS WITH GLUCAGON TREATMENT

Side effects may include nausea and vomiting, a temporary increase in heart rate, and allergic reactions to glucagon or to one of the inactive ingredients in glucagon.

If you experience any other reactions which are likely to have been caused by glucagon, please contact your doctor.

STORAGE

Store the kit at controlled room temperature between 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) before mixing glucagon with the diluent.

Glucagon that has been mixed with diluent should be used immediately. Discard any unused portion. Solutions should be clear and of a water-like consistency at time of use.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^113Sg2f3]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

FoodNet Atlas of Exposures — statistical comparison of case exposures and illustrative outbreaks: The page notes, "The observed consumption rate of a food item among case can be tested against known or estimated background consumption rates by using a binomial distribution probability model", and that "For food items with a relatively low expected frequency of consumption (e.g., oysters), even a small number of interviews can yield highly suggestive data", whereas "For common food items (e.g., eggs or chicken), additional and more specific product data (e.g., brand and place of purchase or consumption) are necessary". It describes the Atlas as "one source of food consumption estimates, although it covers only a few dozen food items, represents only the population of FoodNet sites, and does not account for potential changes in consumption patterns since the last time the survey was performed". Example findings include bagged spinach identified from "only six structured interviews (with five persons reporting having eaten bagged, prewashed spinach)" alongside survey data that "only about 17% of the U.S. population recalled eating any kind of fresh spinach within a given week". In a Salmonella Tennessee outbreak, "By December 1, 52 isolates from 25 states were linked", "In January 2007, 31 patients were interviewed… with over 200 items", and "Two food commodities (turkey and peanut butter) were identified with greater frequency of consumption than expected", after which "Of six cases re-interviewed to assess peanut butter exposures, five reported a common brand". The page concludes that "the practice of collecting detailed exposure information during hypothesis-generating interviews has sufficient evidence to be promoted as a standard practice", while cautioning that "the findings must be extrapolated carefully to other populations".

### Erythromelalgia associated with clitocybe acromelalga intoxication [^116rG5hj]. Clinical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Erythromelalgia is a rare disorder characterized by reddening, severe burning pain, and swelling of the extremities. Food poisoning by Clitocybe acromelalga, a poisonous mushroom, is known to induce erythromelalgia; however, its treatment protocol remains unclear. We describe here three cases of erythromelalgia following the consumption of C. acromelalga with varying clinical courses.

Case Details

Of the three patients, the first patient presented 22 days after the onset of erythromelalgia; although he was treated with aspirin, numbness in the limbs persisted as sequela. Patient 2 presented at 3 days after the symptomatic onset and was immediately treated with high-dose intravenous nicotinic acid, with a dramatic symptomatic improvement. Patient 3, who had milder symptoms, spontaneously recovered within a week without any treatment.

Discussion

The clinical manifestations and varying clinical courses associated with C. acromelalga toxicity are discussed here, with the pathogenesis of this mycotoxin and a potential treatment. Detailed interviews of such patients are important, particularly because of the remarkably slow course of this mycotoxin as compared with common food poisonings. Treatment with intravenous nicotinic acid was associated with improvement in one patient. We believe that this painful disorder might thus be treatable, although the mechanism underlying the treatment remains unclear.

### Investigation of lead and chromium exposure after consumption of contaminated cinnamon-containing applesauce-United States, November 2023-April 2024 [^11712Z9E]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Although lead poisoning can cause detrimental health effects, it is largely preventable. Common exposure sources include contaminated soil, water, and lead-based paint in homes built before the 1978 ban on residential lead-containing paint. In North Carolina, testing for lead is encouraged for all children at ages 1 and 2 years, and is required for children covered by Medicaid. In October 2023, routine pediatric blood lead testing and follow-up investigations conducted by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services identified four asymptomatic cases of lead poisoning associated with consumption of cinnamon-containing applesauce packaged in pouches. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified lead in the cinnamon as the source of contamination; chromium was later also detected in the cinnamon. FDA alerted the public on October 28, and the distributor initiated a voluntary recall the following day. To estimate the impact of the event and characterize reported cases, CDC initiated a national call for cases (defined as a blood lead level [BLL] ≥ 3.5 μg/dL in a person of any age in ≤ 3 months after consuming a recalled cinnamon-containing applesauce product). During November 22, 2023-April 12, 2024, a total of 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico reported 566 cases (55% in children aged < 2 years, including 20% that were temporally associated with symptoms). The median maximum venous BLL was 7.2 μg/dL (range = 3.5–39.3 μg/dL). The hundreds of children poisoned by this incident highlight the importance of preventing toxic metal contamination of food and promoting routine childhood blood lead testing and follow-up to identify lead exposure sources. Clinicians and public health practitioners should be aware of the potential for exposure to toxic metals from less common sources, including food.

Investigation of clusters and outbreaks — detection and scope is described as recognition of similar illnesses among persons with a common exposure leading to complaint or notification, or identification of case clusters through pathogen-specific surveillance, and only a systematic investigation can confirm an outbreak; because many agents transmitted by food also can be transmitted by water and from person to person, animal to person, or other mechanisms, investigators must keep an open mind and not rule out other causes prematurely when a potential foodborne outbreak is detected.

Complaint, cluster, and outbreak investigation procedures — after illnesses are detected through complaints or case clusters through pathogen-specific surveillance, a preliminary investigation should be undertaken to determine whether the reported illnesses may be part of an outbreak. For complaints of group illness attributed to a particular event or establishment, multiple cases with similar symptoms and an incubation period consistent with the timing of the reported exposure are suggestive of an outbreak. For case clusters identified through pathogen-specific surveillance, cases defined by subtype characteristics clearly in excess of the expected number and demographic features or known exposures of cases suggestive of a common source are clues that the cluster might represent an outbreak.

Food and beverage poisoning — botulism: Botulism is a potentially deadly disease caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, with symptoms that initially include blurred vision, difficulty speaking, and weakness, but can progress to paralysis. The illness may manifest and be transmitted multiple ways, including foodborne botulism, wound botulism, and infant botulism, and most pertinent to international travel is foodborne botulism caused by eating food contaminated with the botulinum toxin. Preserved foods, including smoked fishes and other cured meats, can pose a risk if not stored at proper temperatures, and pickled or preserved foods also pose a risk if they do not contain the proper amounts of salt or acidity; other countries may not have food safety guidelines for canned and preserved foods. Medical tourists are at risk of iatrogenic botulism when too much botulinum toxin is injected to treat conditions such as chronic pain, excessive sweating, migraine headaches, muscle spasticity, obesity, or wrinkles. Wound botulism can occur when bacteria enter a wound and produce the toxin, an exposure that can occur with use of intravenous drugs, and this type of botulism can be prevented by properly caring for wounds and seeking medical attention if an infection is suspected. Infant botulism is caused by ingestion of bacteria spores by infants, often associated with consumption of contaminated honey or corn syrup.

### Investigation of lead and chromium exposure after consumption of contaminated cinnamon-containing applesauce-United States, November 2023-April 2024 [^112DG3by]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Although lead poisoning can cause detrimental health effects, it is largely preventable. Common exposure sources include contaminated soil, water, and lead-based paint in homes built before the 1978 ban on residential lead-containing paint. In North Carolina, testing for lead is encouraged for all children at ages 1 and 2 years, and is required for children covered by Medicaid. In October 2023, routine pediatric blood lead testing and follow-up investigations conducted by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services identified four asymptomatic cases of lead poisoning associated with consumption of cinnamon-containing applesauce packaged in pouches. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified lead in the cinnamon as the source of contamination; chromium was later also detected in the cinnamon. FDA alerted the public on October 28, and the distributor initiated a voluntary recall the following day. To estimate the impact of the event and characterize reported cases, CDC initiated a national call for cases (defined as a blood lead level [BLL] ≥ 3.5 μ g/dL in a person of any age in ≤ 3 months after consuming a recalled cinnamon-containing applesauce product). During November 22, 2023–April 12, 2024, a total of 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico reported 566 cases (55% in children aged < 2 years, including 20% that were temporally associated with symptoms). The median maximum venous BLL was 7.2 μ g/dL (range = 3.5–39.3 μ g/dL). The hundreds of children poisoned by this incident highlight the importance of preventing toxic metal contamination of food and promoting routine childhood blood lead testing and follow-up to identify lead exposure sources. Clinicians and public health practitioners should be aware of the potential for exposure to toxic metals from less common sources, including food.

### Cake decorating luster dust associated with toxic metal poisonings-rhode island and Missouri, 2018–2019 [^116SA2C5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

In October 2018, the RIDOH Center for Acute Infectious Disease Epidemiology (CAIDE) investigated a report that six children aged 1–11 years became ill after attending a child's birthday party. Symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea began 30 minutes to 10 hours after consumption of the cake, and usually lasted less than 10 hours. One person was reported to have experienced longer symptom duration and visited an emergency department for treatment. Investigators identified the birthday cake as a common food item consumed by all the children who became ill, and noted the party as the only common event. The cake, ordered from a local bakery, had been decorated with a thick layer of frosting mixed with luster dust described on the label as "gold dust" (Figure 1). CAIDE interviewed four persons who did not become ill and who reported either not eating any cake frosting (three) or eating no cake at all (one). Symptoms and illness onsets were consistent with a heavy metal poisoning, and the cake frosting was identified as the suspected food item. CAIDE obtained a picture of the cake and shared this information with the RIDOH Center for Food Protection (CFP) for further investigation.

CFP environmental health food specialists investigated the Rhode Island bakery on-site and implemented immediate control measures. In addition, a food flow analysis, conducted with CDC's National Environmental Assessment Reporting System (NEARS) manager, traced each step in the bakery's food preparation system to identify potential hazards and to collect evidence of contributing factors and environmental antecedents to understand and address the root causes of the foodborne illnesses. The cake ingredients and preparation process were recorded. The cake had been baked, frozen, and frosted; luster dust was added to a butter extract and painted on the cake with a brush in intervals to produce a thick layer. The luster dust applied as a decoration to the cake's frosting was labeled as rose gold dust, and marked as "nonedible", "nontoxic", and "for decoration only".

### Attributing illness to food [^111iqMXe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Food Categorization

For the purposes of attributing illnesses to foods, food vehicles must be grouped into suitable categories. Although the idea may seem simple, the need for a single food categorization scheme has emerged as a critical issue. At a general level, a list of major food commodities might include 11 categories: poultry, eggs, pork, beef, dairy, fish, mollusks, crustaceans, wild game, row crops (e.g. lettuce and corn), and tree crops (e.g. apples and oranges). Each of these commodities could be divided further, leading to such subcategories as broiler chickens and raw oysters. Additionally, classification could include level of processing (raw, fresh-cut, canned, frozen), origin (domestic, imported), and location of preparation (home, food processor, food service). When illnesses are linked to foods with multiple ingredients, such as soups or casseroles, the choices include whether to omit these cases from analysis, to categorize multiple-ingredient foods by "essential" ingredient, or to attribute illnesses by the proportion of individual ingredients.

A common food categorization scheme is essential if different sources of data are to be combined or compared. Because of lack of agreement in categorization, data from CDC, state health departments, and FDA and USDA and their constituent agencies are often not directly comparable. As a first step in any approach to food attribution, food categories need to be standardized across government agencies, with a scheme acceptable to industry, academia, and consumer groups.

### Serogroup-specific risk factors for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection in Australia [^111vs6NM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is an important cause of foodborne illness. In Australia, risk factors for STEC infection have not been examined at a national level.

Methods

We conducted a case-control study in 6 Australian jurisdictions from 2003 through 2007. A case patient was defined as a person from whom STEC was isolated or toxin production genes were detected in stool. Case patients were recruited from notifiable disease registers, and 3 control subjects frequency matched by age were selected from databases of controls. Using structured questionnaires, interviewers collected data on clinical illness, foods consumed, and exposures to potential environmental sources.

Results

We recruited 43 case patients infected with STEC serogroup O157, 71 case patients infected with non-O157 serogroups, and 304 control subjects. One patient infected with serogroup O157 and 7 infected with non-O157 serogroups developed hemolytic uremic syndrome. Compared with control subjects, case patients infected with STEC O157 were more likely to eat hamburgers, visit restaurants, have previously used antibiotics, or have family occupational exposure to red meat. Case patients infected with non-O157 STEC were more likely to eat sliced chicken meat or corned beef from a delicatessen, camp in the bush, eat catered meals, or have family occupational exposure to animals. Negative associations were observed for certain foods, particularly homegrown vegetables, fruits, or herbs.

Conclusion

This study of risk factors for STEC infection by serogroup highlights risks associated with eating hamburgers and occupational handling of raw meat. To prevent infection, hamburgers must be cooked thoroughly, and people handling raw meat or who have close contact with animals must ensure adequate hygiene.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^115W9uGc]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Investigation of clusters and outbreaks — outbreaks of foodborne illness are detected by recognition of similar illnesses among persons with a common exposure via complaint or notification of health officials or identification of case clusters through pathogen-specific surveillance, with complaints responsible for the detection of approximately 75% of foodborne disease outbreaks and pathogen-specific surveillance through public health laboratories enabling detection of widely dispersed outbreaks caused by commercially distributed food products. These events are initially recognized as clusters of cases defined by subtype characteristics, and distribution of cases by time, space, and personal characteristics provides clues about a common source, but only a systematic investigation of the cluster can confirm whether it actually is an outbreak and whether it is a foodborne disease outbreak. Identifying the route of transmission is critical for implementing effective control measures but is not always possible through agent identification or clinical presentation.

### Severe morel mushroom poisonings in France-a nationwide French poison centres study 2010–2020 [^114Hka4i]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2023, two fatalities attributed to the ingestion of uncooked morels (Morchella spp.) were reported in the United States; both patients developed severe gastrointestinal symptoms. Morel-induced gastrointestinal toxicity is well recognized, but no deaths had been reported until 2023, suggesting a potential shift in the severity of morel poisoning.

Methods

Using the Poisoning Severity Score, we analyzed the severity of symptomatic cases of morel ingestion recorded in the French National Database of Poisonings from 2010 to 2020.

Results

We found 446 cases of exposure in which morels were the sole mushroom species involved. Of these, 83.6 per cent and 53.3 per cent developed gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, respectively. Eight patients developed shock attributed to severe gastrointestinal symptoms, resulting in two deaths.

Discussion

Morel ingestion can lead to severe complications. As in the United States, the deaths reported in this study were attributed to imported cultivated morels. The shift, since 2006, towards a predominance of cultivated over wild morel sales may have played a role in the reporting of severe cases of morel poisoning.

Conclusions

Reports of severe morel poisoning highlight the need for cautious consumption, particularly of raw or undercooked preparations. Emerging complications signal potential changes in toxicity. Surveillance and awareness are key to reducing the risks of consuming morels.

### Ceftazidime-resistant Salmonella enterica, Morocco [^115PGcHh]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Nontyphoidal salmonellosis (NTS) is a major food-borne illness worldwide. Extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) are currently preferred drugs for treatment of children with NTS. However, resistance to ESCs has emerged worldwide and has become a serious public health problem. This resistance is caused by production of various class A extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and class C cephalosporinases in Salmonella enterica.

National surveillance systems, ideally based on integration of data for animals, food, and humans, are needed to develop strategies for containing antimicrobial drug resistance. Such systems are primarily based on a network of public or private clinical laboratories that refer Salmonella isolates to public health laboratories for identification. However, this laboratory-based surveillance system in developing countries is hampered by cost constraints and poor access to quality health facilities, resulting in a low rate of isolation of bacterial pathogens from patients having mild infections. These constraints account for the lack of data and underestimation of the number of NTS cases in many countries, including Morocco.

According to the World Health Organization Global Salm Surv database, the Moroccan National Institute of Hygiene reported only 210 human non-Typhi isolates and 999 animal non-Gallinarum isolates during 1999–2003. Antimicrobial drug resistance data are extremely rare. We report the presence of nontyphoidal Salmonella isolates resistant to ESCs during an outbreak of food poisoning and in food products in Morocco.

In March 2008, an S. enterica serotype Typhimurium strain was isolated from stool samples of 45 persons who had attended a wedding ceremony in Errachidia. Clinical symptoms were diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, beginning 24–72 hours after these persons had eaten a tagine prepared with poorly cooked broiler chickens. Five patients were hospitalized for 3 days, but no deaths were recorded. S. enterica serotype Typhimurium was isolated from leftovers of a broiler carcass stored in a refrigerator.

### Avian toxins and poisoning mechanisms [^115BZ7Yf]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The toxicologic risk from exposure to various poisonous birds lies on a spectrum. Most often, dermal exposure leads to mild symptoms, while ingestion leads to systemic and even lethal toxicity. While most reports of human toxicity have been observed in both quail (C. c. coturnix) and the North American ruffed grouse (B. umbellus), the risk of human toxicity from the other avian species is extremely low based on the limited to no reports of human exposure or toxicity.

Poisonous birds have evolved multiple strategies to use chemicals as defense against predators and to protect their broods. From dietary sources to symbiotic relationship with bacteria, these bird species have developed sophisticated methods of using chemical defense. Globally, poisonous birds alike have evolved to use their environment as part of their defense strategies. Apart from the hoopoes and woodhoopoes, most poisonous birds acquire their toxins secondarily through diet of either plant or invertebrate species.

Most intriguing is the ability of birds to manage sequestered defensive chemicals and not succumb to self-intoxication. While there have been studies on other vertebrate and invertebrate species to investigate this protection, the direct mechanism of protection, whether it be modification of toxins to non-toxic bases during storage or nucleotide polymorphisms in targeted receptors in birds has yet to be elucidated fully. Further studies defining the intricacies of avian chemical defense and their potential clinical applications are warranted.

### Botulism type E outbreak associated with eating a beached whale, Alaska [^1171Z1fA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Because botulism may have nonspecific symptoms (e.g. abdominal cramping, diarrhea, vomiting), rapid diagnosis can be difficult, even in Alaska, where the index of suspicion is comparatively elevated. However, some specific signs and symptoms (e.g. descending paralysis) may be detectable early on and are virtually diagnostic (Figure). The clinical signs and symptoms of botulism from toxin types A, B, and E are similar; however, a clinical comparison in the United States from 1975 to 1988 showed that patients with illness from type E toxin have slightly shorter incubation periods and less frequently required intubation (39% with type E, 52% with type B, and 67% with type A). Additional current reports on botulism, including the epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy, outbreak response, and reference laboratories have been recently published.

In conclusion, clinicians confronted with a suspected botulism case should review the clinical diagnostic criteria and not rely on the mouse bioassay for toxin detection to guide clinical decision-making. In addition, although public health efforts and clinical improvements have drastically reduced botulism death rates among Alaska Natives, the average annual incidence of foodborne botulism in Alaska since 1970 is substantially higher than it was before 1970, possibly, in part, because of modern influences, such as availability of plastic, sealable containers. Finally, because of the numerous beneficial health (not to mention cultural) effects of traditional food consumption, we recommend that Alaska Native leaders continue to promote traditional food consumption among their people, while educating them about the potential hazards of improper storage and preparation.

Determining the etiologic agent in an outbreak — clinical specimens and food testing: Laboratory testing of clinical specimens from patients is critical in determining the etiology of a foodborne disease outbreak; for most foodborne diseases, stool is the specimen of choice, and in an outbreak specimens are collected as soon as possible after onset of symptoms; ideally, specimens from 5–10 persons are collected and tested. Isolation of the etiologic agent from food is challenging, food samples collected during the investigation might not reflect foods eaten at the time of the outbreak, and food testing results should be interpreted with caution. Predominant signs and symptoms and the average incubation period can provide insights into the etiologic agent before laboratory test results are available.

Food Preparation Findings

Food for the July 30 lunch party was purchased during July 27–28, with the exception of the pork, which was purchased approximately 1 week earlier. All perishable products (chicken thighs, chicken wings, breakfast sausage, and pork) were stored in a freezer.

Perlo

On July 29, the raw chicken thighs and sausage were defrosted in the microwave. The defrosted chicken thighs were cooked in a stock pot of boiling water. After cooling, the chicken was removed from the thigh bones by hand and placed back into the stock pot. Sausage was cooked in a skillet and added to the pot. Onions and other seasonings were sautéed in the sausage oil and added to the pot. To complete the perlo, rice was added to the stock pot and cooked until all remaining water was absorbed. The pot of cooked perlo then was placed in an unheated oven for approximately 8 hours overnight. On the morning of July 30, the perlo was found to be warm. It was transferred to a slow cooker for reheating for approximately 1 hour on a high setting before transport and consumption.

Chicken wings

On July 28, the raw chicken wings were defrosted in the refrigerator overnight. On July 29, they were seasoned and placed back in the refrigerator. On the morning of July 30, they were fried and placed in a foil-covered pan for transport and consumption on July 30.

Pulled pork

The raw pork was defrosted in the microwave on July 29 and cooked overnight in a slow cooker for approximately 8 hours on a low setting before transport and consumption on July 30.

### Chronic ciguatera poisoning: a case report [^116FqXzE]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Ciguatera is a common marine, toxin-borne illness caused by the consumption of fish that contain toxins that activate voltage-sensitive sodium channels. The clinical manifestations of ciguatera are typically self-limited, but chronic symptoms may occur in a minority of patients. This report describes a case of ciguatera poisoning with chronic symptoms, including pruritus and paresthesias. A 40-y-old man was diagnosed with ciguatera poisoning after consuming amberjack while vacationing in the US Virgin Islands. His initial symptoms, including diarrhea, cold allodynia, and extremity paresthesias, evolved into chronic, fluctuating paresthesias and pruritus that became worse after the consumption of alcohol, fish, nuts, and chocolate. After a comprehensive neurologic evaluation failed to reveal another cause for his symptoms, he was diagnosed with chronic ciguatera poisoning. His neuropathic symptoms were treated with duloxetine and pregabalin, and he was counseled to avoid foods that triggered his symptoms. Chronic ciguatera is a clinical diagnosis. Signs and symptoms of chronic ciguatera can include fatigue, myalgias, headache, and pruritus. The pathophysiology of chronic ciguatera is incompletely understood but may involve genetic factors or immune dysregulation. Treatment involves supportive care and avoidance of foods and environmental conditions that may exacerbate symptoms.

### Foodborne disease prevention and broiler chickens with reduced Campylobacter infection [^117UeFWC]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Campylobacter spp. is the most common cause of enteritis in humans in the European Union; 190,566 cases were reported in 2008. However, it has been estimated that only 2.1% of all cases are reported and that in the European Union the true incidence of campylobacteriosis is ≈9 million cases per year. From 2008 through 2009, the number of human infections in the European Union increased 4%, although there was no statistically significant trend from 2005 through 2009. The incidence of campylobacteriosis seems to differ among European countries. In addition, campylobacteriosis and its sequelae are calculated to cost 0.35 million disability-adjusted life-years per year, totaling €2.4 billion per year.

Campylobacteriosis is largely perceived to be a foodborne disease. Poultry meat is considered the primary source, causing 20%–30% of all cases; and 50%–80% of all cases might be attributed to the chicken reservoir as a whole. The incidence of campylobacteriosis cases among humans has been shown to correlate with the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. among broiler chickens. The prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in broiler chicken batches varies considerably between EU countries; in 2008, prevalence ranged from 2% to 100% (average 71%). Therefore, an international priority for ensuring food safety is the elimination of Campylobacter spp. from broiler chicken flocks. However, even strict compliance with all biosecurity regulations has failed to control infections in broiler chicken houses during peak months in the summer, indicating that transmission routes, and the blocking of these routes, remain to be fully elucidated and understood.

### Sodium azide poisoning at a restaurant-Dallas county, Texas, 2010 [^115kF3N5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

In April 2010, Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) staff members investigated reports of acute-onset dizziness among patrons in a local restaurant. Symptoms, which included fainting resulting from low blood pressure, occurred within minutes of consuming food from the restaurant and were consistent with chemical poisoning. Toxicologic and epidemiologic investigations were begun to determine the cause of the poisonings and identify potentially exposed persons. This report summarizes the results of those investigations, including a case-control study that identified iced tea as the likely contaminated food or drink (odds ratio [OR] = 65; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.4–3,292). Approximately 5 months after the incident, extensive laboratory testing identified sodium azide (NaN3) and hydrazoic acid (formed when sodium azide contacts water) as the toxic agents in the iced tea. All five ill restaurant patrons recovered from their symptoms. For rapid-onset foodborne illnesses, chemical poisons should be considered as a potential cause, regardless of negative initial toxicologic screening tests. Although unusual chemicals can be challenging to detect, a multidisciplinary approach involving public health officials and forensic and medical toxicologists can lead to appropriate testing. In the absence of an identified agent, epidemiologic tools are valuable for active case-finding and confirming suspected contaminated food vehicles.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^1112BiBf]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Foods associated with a processor/producer — control of source during foodborne disease outbreaks emphasizes coordinated regulatory action and criteria for market removal. Trace-back investigations can help identify contamination points and guide targeted environmental assessments, and early engagement with the processor/producer and the appropriate food-regulatory agency can help identify implicated products. When implicated foods might be in distribution, at retail establishments, or in the homes of consumers, the food-regulatory agency will take the lead on recall activities if it has adequate information to accurately identify the contaminated item. Contact the appropriate regulator with jurisdiction; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates most foods while the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates meat, poultry, and most out-of-shell egg products. Regulators may coordinate with manufacturers on recalls and may ask retailers to remove product and distributors to withhold distribution; recall at the processor level generally requires federal and/or state action, and in some jurisdictions local health jurisdictions will embargo food, and under the Food Safety Modernization Act, FDA can order the embargo of food for up to 30 days without a court order. Questions to ask in considering whether to remove food from the market include "Is risk to consumers ongoing?", "Is the product still on the market or in the distribution system?", and "Is the product likely to be in the homes of consumers?", and removal is justified if there is a strong epidemiologic association between illness and consumption of the food even if the pathogen has not been isolated, OR if definitive lab results show the outbreak pathogen is present in the product based on a representative, properly handled sample to avoid cross-contamination.

Etiologic agents associated with foodborne diseases — overview: Foodborne illnesses have myriad causes including microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, viruses, parasites, and marine algae) and their toxins, mushroom toxins, fish toxins, heavy metals, pesticides, and other chemical contaminants. Human illness caused by these agents is often categorized into those caused by preformed toxins versus those caused by multiplication of the pathogen in the host with damage from toxins produced within the host or invasion of host cells (infection).

### Chicken and food poisoning | Food safety… [^111m8zMf]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Raw chicken can contain foodborne germs that can make you sick.
- Use a food thermometer to make sure chicken is cooked to a safe internal temperature of 165°F.
- Keep raw chicken and its juices away from ready-to-eat foods, like salads or food that is already cooked.
- Raw chicken is ready to cook and doesn't need to be washed first. If you eat undercooked chicken, you can get food poisoning. You can also get sick if you eat other foods or beverages that are contaminated by raw chicken or its juices. CDC estimates that Salmonella causes more foodborne illnesses than any other bacteria. Chicken is a major source of these illnesses. Every year in the United States about 1 million people get sick from eating contaminated poultry. Spotlight on Salmonella Salmonella. Prepping chicken
- Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw chicken.
- Raw chicken is ready to cook. It doesn't need to be washed first.

According to a USDA study, 1 in 7 peoplewho cleaned their sink after washing chicken still had germs in the sink.
- **If you choose to wash chicken, do so as safely as possible**:
- Run the water gently over the chicken to reduce splashing.
- Immediately clean the sink and area around the sink with hot, soapy water and sanitize them thoroughly.
- Wash your hands for 20 seconds.
- Use a separate cutting board for raw chicken. Never place cooked food or fresh produce on a plate, cutting board, or other surface that previously held raw chicken.
- Wash cutting boards, utensils, dishes, and countertops with hot, soapy water after preparing chicken and before you prepare the next item. While cooking
- Use a food thermometer to make sure chicken is cooked to a safe internal temperature of 165°F.
- If cooking a microwaveable meal that includes frozen raw chicken, handle it as you would fresh raw chicken. Follow cooking directions carefully to prevent food poisoning.
- If you think the chicken you are served at a restaurant or anywhere else is not fully cooked, send it back for more cooking. After eating Refrigerate or freeze leftover chicken within 2 hours.

### Histamine poisoning from insect consumption: an outbreak investigation from Thailand [^113DrD24]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Insect consumption is a common practice in the Asian culture and all over the world. We are reporting an outbreak investigation of histamine poisoning from ingestion of fried insects.

Methods

On 24 July 2014, a group of students at a seminar presented to Angthong Provincial Hospital, Thailand, with pruritic rash after ingesting snacks consisting of fried insects from a vendor. We initiated an outbreak investigation with retrospective cohort design and collected samples of remaining foods for analyses. Attack rates, relative risks and their confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.

Results

Out of 227 students, 28 developed illnesses that were consistent with our case definition which included, flushing, pruritus, urticarial rashes, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea and bronchospasm. Two children were hospitalized for progressive bronchospasm overnight without serious complications. The types of food ingested included a lunch that was provided at the seminar for all students and snacks that 41 students bought from the only vendor in the vicinity. The snacks included fried grasshoppers, silkworm pupae, common green frogs, bamboo borers, crickets and meat balls. The attack rates were highest (82.6 and 85.0%) among students who ingested fried grasshoppers and silkworm pupae and lowest (4.4 and 5.3%) among those who did not ingest them, with relative risk of 18.7 (95% CI 9.6–36.4) for grasshoppers and 16.0 (95% CI 8.8–29.3) for silkworm pupae. Histamine concentrations in the fried grasshoppers and silkworm pupae were 9.73 and 7.66mg/100g, respectively.

Discussion and Conclusion

Through epidemiological analysis and laboratory confirmation, we have illustrated that histamine poisoning can occur from ingestion of fried insects. We postulate that histidine, which is present in high concentration in grasshoppers and silkworm pupae, is decarboxylated by bacteria to histamine, a heat stable toxin. The ingestion of histamine is responsible for the clinical pictures being reported.

### Outbreak of staphylococcal food poisoning from a military unit lunch party-United States, July 2012 [^111Jztoq]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Toxin detection kits are commercially available and can detect staphylococcal enterotoxins A through E directly from food. The commercial testing platforms usually are passive agglutination or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The B. cereus and S. aureus enterotoxin tests used in this outbreak are only approved for food samples; the test for the C. perfringens enterotoxin is approved only for stool specimens. The commercial kits were helpful in the identification of S. aureus toxin as the cause of this outbreak and might be useful for state and local public health agencies.

In this outbreak, as in many others, poor food handling practices and inadequate refrigeration of foods were identified as the main contributing factors. Staphylococcal contamination and subsequent intoxication can be prevented by ensuring clean food preparation, storage, and equipment surfaces, and by immediately cooling and storing prepared "potentially hazardous" foods at temperatures below 41°F (5°C). To permit rapid cooling after preparation, food should be stored in small portions in containers that are shallow and loosely covered to facilitate adequate air flow and rapid transfer of heat from the food to the container. Consuming food immediately after preparation or removal from refrigeration also is advisable. Finally, handwashing for 20 seconds using soap and water before handling food and food preparation and storage materials is a simple but effective preventive measure to avoid staphylococcal contamination.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^116K3caG]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Complaint systems — limitations and misclassification risks: For true outbreaks, absence of an agent makes misclassification of cases more likely and misclassification makes linking an outbreak and exposure more difficult. Without a detailed food history, surveillance of independent complaints is sensitive only for short incubation illness or illness with unique symptoms because persons often associate illness with the last meal, although this is not a limitation if full interviews are conducted. Notification of illness in groups is less sensitive to widespread low-level contamination than pathogen-specific surveillance, and the value of single-case complaints is limited by available exposure information and by the lack of specific agent or disease information; reported illness might not be foodborne or typical.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^114QB7Af]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Foodborne illness prevention — food preparation states that the CDC and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend "4 simple rules: clean, separate, cook, and chill". Clean includes rinsing fresh fruits and vegetables under running water, washing hands before, during, and after preparation (and before eating), and cleaning used utensils, cutting boards, countertops, and other soiled surfaces. Separate directs keeping uncooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs contained apart from ready‑to‑eat foods during storage and handling. Cook guidance includes cooking microwaved food to an internal temperature of 74°C/165°F and using food thermometers inserted midway into the food. Chill guidance includes refrigerating uncooked perishables and cooked leftovers within 2 hours of being at room temperature, keeping refrigerators at 4°C/40°F or below, and keeping freezers −18°C/0°F or below. To prevent transmitting illness while preparing food for others, "it is strongly recommended that individuals involved in food preparation do not have symptoms of illness, as outlined in Appendices B1 and B2".

### Food-borne botulism: still actual topic [^114aTrnH]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Even though since the mid-1990s the number of food-borne botulism cases has systematically decreased and it now occurs in Poland relatively rarely, it is still a real epidemiological problem. There are about 30 cases of botulism in Poland a year, which ranks Poland the first among the European Union. In most cases the symptomatology of botulism is typical, however it does not always fully coincide with the one described in medical manuals which emphasise the dramatic clinical course of botulism with its frequent fatal consequences. Diagnosis of botulism may be difficult because of its rare prevalence and a variable clinical course, especially in old patients. Authors of this paper describe two cases of botulism and diagnostic problems associated with it.

Food-Product Recalls — Food recalls are one indication of food-safety problems, and during 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) reported more than 258 recalls of food associated with microbial contamination; recalled products were distributed locally, nationally, or internationally and were sold in a variety of retail settings; the most commonly identified contaminating pathogens were Listeria monocytogenes, Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli, and Salmonella species, and the latter two were associated most frequently with recalls resulting from the investigation of human illness.

Foodborne disease surveillance and outbreak detection — surveillance cannot prevent initial cases yet is a sensitive tool for identifying failures across food-supply systems, and it complements regulatory and commercial monitoring by providing primary feedback on prevention programs. Surveillance coupled with outbreak investigation has driven major public health actions, including the recall of hundreds of millions of pounds of contaminated products, but current practices vary widely, are unevenly resourced, and generally exploit only a fraction of the system's potential. Early in a possible outbreak, investigators will not know whether illness is foodborne, waterborne, or attributable to other causes and must keep an open mind to avoid prematurely ruling out potential causes. Disease surveillance is used to identify clusters of possible foodborne illness, with two general methods used in outbreak detection — pathogen-specific surveillance and complaint systems — and a third, syndromic surveillance, used in some jurisdictions but with a limited role; these methods are most effective when used together and integrated with food, veterinary, and environmental monitoring programs. In pathogen-specific surveillance, health-care providers and laboratorians report individual cases when selected pathogens (such as Salmonella enterica or Escherichia coli O157:H7) are identified in patient specimens; the method also includes specific clinical syndromes with or without laboratory confirmation (such as hemolytic uremic syndrome and botulism), uses exposure interviews, and is enhanced by data and pathogens from food, animal, or environmental programs, as well as the national notifiable disease reporting system and molecular subtyping available through the National Molecular Subtyping Network.

Paralytic shellfish poisoning — Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is the most common and most severe form of shellfish poisoning and is caused by eating shellfish contaminated with saxitoxins produced by various dinoflagellates; a wide range of shellfish can cause PSP, but most cases occur after people eat clams or mussels. PSP occurs worldwide but is most common in temperate waters off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America, including Alaska, with additional reported cases from countries in the Americas (Chile), Asia (China and the Philippines), Europe (Ireland and Scotland), and the Pacific (Australia and New Zealand). Symptoms usually appear 30–60 minutes after a person eats toxic shellfish and include numbness and tingling of the face, lips, tongue, arms, and legs, with possible diarrhea, vomiting, headache, and nausea; severe cases are associated with ingestion of large doses of toxin and features such as ataxia, dysphagia, flaccid paralysis, mental status changes, and respiratory failure, and the case-fatality ratio depends on the availability of modern medical care, including mechanical ventilation, with rates of death among children particularly high.

Foodborne disease surveillance — complaint and syndromic systems are described as follows: Complaint systems involve health-care providers or the public identifying and reporting suspected disease clusters or individual complaints, with exposure information acquired by interviews with cases; syndromic surveillance generally involves systematic (usually automated) gathering of data on nonspecific health indicators (for example, purchase of loperamide, visits to emergency departments for diarrheal complaints, or calls to poison control hotlines), and exposure information is not routinely collected. This chapter notes it reviews major features, strengths, and limitations of each surveillance method and provides recommendations for increasing effectiveness.
