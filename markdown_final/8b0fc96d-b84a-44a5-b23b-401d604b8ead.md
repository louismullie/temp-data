## Question

What is the recommended metronidazole regimen for trichomoniasis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended metronidazole regimen for trichomoniasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the first-line regimen for non-pregnant women. Then, I should verify when a single-dose regimen is appropriate. Next, I will review special populations such as women with HIV, pregnant patients, and men. After that, I need to examine supporting efficacy data, resistance considerations, and follow-up. I will also check dosing adjustments in hepatic impairment, clarify the role of intravaginal formulations, and outline validated alternatives like tinidazole and secnidazole, keeping an eye on cost and access as well as FDA labeling nuances.

> Let me first confirm the standard regimen for adult and adolescent women without pregnancy, because that anchors all other decisions. The CDC 2021 guidelines recommend metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as first-line therapy for female patients with trichomoniasis, which is concordant with the WHO 2024 guidance that advises 400–500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days in adolescents and adults, including pregnant women [^11488KRC] [^115PQwis].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about single-dose therapy in women; I need to check when it is appropriate and how it performs. While metronidazole 2 g orally once is an accepted alternative when adherence to a multidose regimen is a major concern, multiple data sources show lower efficacy of the single 2 g dose in women compared with the 7-day regimen, particularly in the context of HIV or concomitant ART, so it should be reserved for adherence-challenged scenarios rather than used routinely in women [^112GEJDK] [^113qU3km] [^113hTRS5] [^115rNFKj].

> I should confirm the recommendation for women with HIV infection, because outcomes differ in this group. The CDC 2021 explicitly recommends metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days for HIV-infected females with trichomoniasis, and observational comparative data show substantially higher treatment failure with single-dose regimens among women on ART, supporting the multidose strategy as preferred in this population [^115zacrg] [^114DvLTn].

> For pregnancy, let me think carefully and reconcile guidance with safety and outcome data. The WHO 2024 guideline includes pregnant women in the 7-day 400–500 mg twice-daily recommendation and considers single-dose metronidazole when adherence is problematic, though some older randomized pregnancy trials did not show improved preterm birth outcomes and even raised concern for harm when treating asymptomatic infection mid-gestation; more recent observational data suggest treatment of symptomatic infection may be protective against preterm birth, so preference is for the 7-day regimen in symptomatic pregnant patients, with shared decision-making if single dose is considered for adherence issues [^115PQwis] [^113qTjAk] [^115ZS72K].

> Next, I should review the regimen for men, as it differs from women. For male patients with trichomoniasis, CDC 2021 recommends metronidazole 2 g orally as a single dose as first-line therapy, and this approach remains standard in the absence of strong evidence favoring a multidose regimen in men [^113o9tb4].

> I will now examine the supporting efficacy evidence to ensure the strength of the recommendations is clear. An open-label randomized trial in HIV-uninfected women demonstrated that metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days significantly reduced infection at the 1-month test-of-cure compared with a single 2 g dose, and contemporary reviews synthesize similar findings, reinforcing that the 7-day multidose regimen achieves higher cure rates in women than single-dose therapy [^113hTRS5] [^115rNFKj].

> But wait, what about resistance and treatment failure mechanisms, since these affect regimen choice? In vitro metronidazole resistance among T. vaginalis isolates in U.S. surveillance has remained low, around 4.3% with mostly low-level elevations in minimum lethal concentrations, and clinical failures often relate more to reinfection or suboptimal regimens than to high-level resistance; susceptibility testing is not routine but can be arranged through CDC for persistent cases after supervised therapy and partner management [^1155tXCH] [^111VNU6f] [^117ACqaE].

> Let me consider practical care steps that reduce recurrence, because reinfection is common. Partner treatment is essential and recommended; male partners should receive appropriate therapy, commonly a single 2 g oral dose of a nitroimidazole, and women should be rescreened at about 3 months given high rates of reinfection, whereas routine test-of-cure is not recommended if the patient is asymptomatic after completing therapy, absent special circumstances [^112xUasi] [^111VNU6f] [^11499zmj].

> I should double-check dosing in hepatic impairment, since metronidazole is hepatically metabolized. In severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), the SPL recommends reducing the trichomoniasis dose to 375 mg once daily, reflecting slower clearance and risk of accumulation; this is a nuanced, label-based adjustment that may require infectious disease or pharmacy input to balance efficacy with safety [^117YDyfd].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about intravaginal metronidazole gel; could that treat trichomoniasis while minimizing systemic exposure? I need to ensure I don't misapply BV data. Metronidazole vaginal gel is indicated for bacterial vaginosis and achieves minimal systemic levels, far below those seen with oral dosing, and should not be used to treat trichomoniasis where systemic therapy is required for cure, so oral nitroimidazoles remain standard for T. vaginalis [^114gb27d] [^114Q8k4s] [^113w1y7e].

> Next, I should review validated alternatives when metronidazole is unsuitable or poorly tolerated, bearing in mind pregnancy and access. Tinidazole 2 g orally as a single dose is FDA-labeled and effective for trichomoniasis, often better tolerated, but generally avoided during pregnancy, whereas secnidazole 2 g orally as a single dose has RCT-proven efficacy in women comparable to multidose metronidazole with good tolerability, though cost and coverage can be limiting in many U.S. settings and guidelines caution against use in pregnancy pending more data [^111mPuSJ] [^112U9hmn] [^111wKJp1] [^111i5fp7] [^112GEJDK] [^113vc9zU].

> I should confirm that my summary aligns with both guidelines and FDA labeling, and here is where I need to be careful about an earlier assumption. Initially, I thought FDA prescribing information uniformly endorsed 400–500 mg twice daily for 7 days for trichomoniasis, but hold on, I should verify the product SPLs; the FDA SPLs list both multidose regimens and single-day 2 g dosing across metronidazole products, which can appear inconsistent, so in practice I will prioritize guideline-concordant 7-day dosing for women and 2 g single-dose for men while recognizing that labels may list multiple acceptable regimens and that practice has shifted with newer trial data [^112BBgHT] [^116fMY9w] [^11488KRC] [^113o9tb4].

> To synthesize and ensure nothing is missing: for women, metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days is preferred, with 2 g single-dose reserved for adherence challenges; for women with HIV, use the 7-day regimen; for pregnant women with symptomatic infection, favor the 7-day regimen with consideration of single dose only if adherence is a major barrier; and for men, metronidazole 2 g orally once is first-line, all with partner treatment and 3‑month retesting to mitigate reinfection risks [^11488KRC] [^115zacrg] [^115PQwis] [^113o9tb4] [^111VNU6f].

---

The recommended metronidazole treatment course for trichomoniasis is **500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** [^11488KRC] for women [^115PQwis], including pregnant and HIV-infected women [^115zacrg]. For men, a **single 2 g oral dose** [^113o9tb4] is recommended. Sexual partners should be treated simultaneously [^112xUasi] to prevent reinfection, and patients should abstain from sexual activity until treatment is complete and symptoms resolve. Retesting is advised at 3 months [^111VNU6f] due to high reinfection rates.

---

## Recommended metronidazole treatment regimens

The **CDC 2021 guidelines recommend** [^115zacrg] the following metronidazole regimens for trichomoniasis:

| **Patient population** | **Recommended regimen** |
|-|-|
| Women (including pregnant and HIV-infected) [^115PQwis] | Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^11488KRC] [^115zacrg] |
| Men | Metronidazole 2 g orally as a single dose [^113o9tb4] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommended regimens

Recent clinical trials [^113hTRS5] and meta-analyses [^115rNFKj] show that the **7-day metronidazole regimen is superior** to single-dose therapy in women, including those with HIV infection. In a randomized controlled trial [^113hTRS5], the 7-day regimen significantly reduced persistent infection versus a single dose (relative risk [RR] 0.43, 95% CI 0.25–0.75). Meta-analyses [^115rNFKj] have **confirmed this superiority**, particularly in HIV-infected women.

---

## Special considerations

### Pregnancy

During pregnancy, **metronidazole is considered safe** [^115PQwis], including in the first trimester, and is recommended for symptomatic trichomoniasis to reduce the risk of preterm birth [^115ohGkK]. The 7-day regimen is preferred in pregnant women because of its superior efficacy [^11488KRC].

---

### HIV infection

In women with HIV infection, **the 7-day metronidazole regimen is recommended** [^115zacrg], as single-dose therapy has been associated with higher rates of persistent infection [^114DvLTn].

---

### Metronidazole resistance

Metronidazole resistance is **relatively rare** [^111VNU6f] but can occur; in such cases, alternative regimens such as tinidazole or secnidazole may be considered [^113nNMgf] [^112GEJDK] [^114M7v4Y].

---

## Patient adherence and side effects

Adherence to the 7-day regimen is generally good, but gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, metallic taste) may occur. Patients should be advised to **avoid alcohol during treatment and for at least 24 hours after completion** to prevent disulfiram-like reactions.

---

## Follow-up and retesting

Retesting is recommended [^115zacrg] at **3 months post-treatment** [^111VNU6f] because reinfection rates are high, and **sexual partners should be treated simultaneously** [^112xUasi] to prevent reinfection.

---

The recommended metronidazole treatment course for trichomoniasis is **500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** for women, including pregnant and HIV-infected women [^11488KRC], and a **single 2 g oral dose** for men [^113o9tb4].

### Diagnosis and management of Trichomonas vaginalis: Summary of evidence reviewed for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^111VNU6f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is likely the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million women and men in the United States. Health disparities are prominent in the epidemiology of trichomoniasis, as African Americans are more than four times as likely to be infected compared to persons of other races. Since the publication of the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, additional data have bolstered the importance of T. vaginalis infection sequelae in women, including increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition, cervical cancer, preterm birth, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Less is known about the clinical significance of infection in men.

Newly available diagnostic methods, including point-of-care assays and multiple nucleic acid amplification tests, can be performed on a variety of genital specimens in women and men, including urine, allowing for more accurate and convenient testing and screening of those at risk for infection. Repeat and persistent infections are common in women; thus, rescreening at three months after treatment is recommended. In vitro antibiotic resistance to 5-nitroimidazole in T. vaginalis remains low (4.3%) but should be monitored. High rates of T. vaginalis among sexual partners of infected persons suggest a role for expedited partner treatment.

A randomized controlled trial in HIV-uninfected women demonstrated that multidose metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for seven days reduced the proportion of women with Trichomonas infection at the one-month test of cure.

### Tinidazole therapy for metronidazole-resistant vaginal trichomoniasis [^113nNMgf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients with metronidazole-refractory vaginal trichomoniasis constitutes a major therapeutic challenge, and treatment options are extremely limited. Although the majority of patients infected with trichomonads, who demonstrate reduced in vitro susceptibility to metronidazole, respond to high-dose but poorly tolerated regimens of metronidazole, clinical failure is by no means uncommon. We report a cure rate of 22 (92%) of 24 patients with refractory trichomoniasis treated with high doses of oral and vaginal tinidazole. This series included 15 cases with increased in vitro minimal lethal concentration values of metronidazole.

Tinidazole, despite the high doses used, was extremely well tolerated, with few side effects. Topical paromomycin was effective in 7 (58%) of 12 patients treated, but frequent local vulvovaginal adverse reactions precluded extensive use. Widespread reports of metronidazole resistance and limited treatment options emphasize the need for additional trichomonacidal agents.

### Single-dose versus 7-day-dose metronidazole for the treatment of trichomoniasis in women: An open-label, randomised controlled trial [^113hTRS5]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2018). High credibility.

Among women, trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection worldwide and is associated with serious reproductive morbidity, poor birth outcomes, and amplified HIV transmission. Single-dose metronidazole is the first-line treatment for trichomoniasis. However, bacterial vaginosis can alter treatment efficacy in HIV-infected women, and single-dose metronidazole treatment might not always clear the infection. We compared single-dose metronidazole with a 7-day dose for the treatment of trichomoniasis among HIV-uninfected, non-pregnant women and tested whether efficacy was modified by bacterial vaginosis.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter, open-label, randomised controlled trial, participants were recruited at three sexual health clinics in the United States. We included women positive for *Trichomonas vaginalis* infection according to clinical screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a single dose of 2 g of metronidazole (single-dose group) or 500 mg of metronidazole twice daily for 7 days (7-day-dose group). The randomisation was done by blocks of four or six for each site. Patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignment. The primary outcome was *T. vaginalis* infection by intention to treat, at test-of-cure 4 weeks after completion of treatment. The analysis of the primary outcome per nucleic acid amplification test or culture was also stratified by bacterial vaginosis status.

### Metronidazole [^114Rr35y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Metronidazole extended-release 750 mg tablets are indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in non-pregnant women. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of metronidazole extended-release tablets and other antibacterial drugs, these tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

- **Bacterial vaginosis (BV)**: When culture and susceptibility information is available, it should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

- **Tinidazole 2 g PO**: Administered as a single dose, except during pregnancy.
- **Secnidazole 2 g PO**: Administered as a single dose, except during pregnancy.
- **Ornidazole 1.5 g PO**: Administered as a single dose, except during pregnancy, if metronidazole or tinidazole is not available.

### The influence of ART on the treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis among HIV-infected women [^114DvLTn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Among women who are human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV+), both prevalent and persistent infections with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are common. TV has been shown to increase vaginal shedding of HIV, which may influence HIV sexual and perinatal transmission, making prevention important. In one cohort of HIV+ women in Kenya, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, mostly nevirapine-based, was associated with lower cure rates of TV for single-dose therapy. The objective of the study was to repeat this research in a US-based cohort of HIV+/TV+ women and compare outcomes to those with multidose therapy.

A secondary data analysis was performed on a multicentered cohort of HIV+/TV+ women who were randomized to single-dose (2 grams) or 7-day (500 mg twice daily) multidose metronidazole (MTZ) treatment. Test of cure visits, via culture, occurred 6–12 days after treatment completion. Information was collected on sex partner treatment and sexual exposures. Persistent TV infection rates were compared for women on ART at baseline vs. not on ART.

Of the 226 women included, those on ART had more treatment failures than women not on ART (24/146 [16.4%] vs. 5/80 [6.3%]; p = 0.03). When stratified by treatment arm, more treatment failures were seen in the single-dose arm (17/73 [23.3%] vs. 3/39 [7.7%]; p = 0.05) than in the multidose arm (7/73 [9.6%] vs. 2/41 [4.8%]; p = 0.39).

ART usage was associated with a higher TV persistent infection rate among those receiving the single-dose treatment but not the multidose, providing more evidence that multidose should be the preferred method.

### Updates in trichomonas treatment including persistent infection and 5-nitroimidazole hypersensitivity [^115rNFKj]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to update information on the treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis. T. vaginalis is estimated to be the most common treatable sexually transmitted infection in the world and is associated with poor birth outcomes, cervical cancer, sperm motility and morphology issues, and HIV acquisition and transmission.

Recent findings indicate that the efficacy of the recommended 2-g oral single-dose metronidazole (MTZ) for the treatment of T. vaginalis in women has been challenged. Two recent multicentered randomized trials and a meta-analysis have demonstrated that the 7-day dose of MTZ 500 mg taken twice daily was nearly two times more efficacious at clearing infection compared with the 2-g dose. Partner treatment is also essential since up to 70% of male sexual partners can be infected, and rescreening of treated women at 3 months is recommended given the high repeat infection rates. Future studies should examine the importance of treating asymptomatic T. vaginalis, the best treatment for men, the influence of the microbiome on treatment efficacy, and different formulations of intravaginal treatments for hypersensitivity.

In summary, the 7-day 500 mg twice daily MTZ regimen should be used as the first-line treatment for T. vaginalis-infected women.

### Trichomonas vaginalis antimicrobial drug resistance in 6 US cities, STD surveillance network, 2009–2010 [^1155tXCH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Nitroimidazoles (metronidazole and tinidazole) are the only recommended drugs for treating Trichomonas vaginalis infection, and previous samples that assessed resistance of such isolates have been limited in geographic scope. We assessed the prevalence of in vitro aerobic metronidazole and tinidazole resistance among T. vaginalis isolates from multiple geographic sites in the United States. Swab specimens were obtained from women who underwent routine pelvic examinations at sexually transmitted disease clinics in 6 US cities. Cultured T. vaginalis isolates were tested for nitroimidazole resistance (aerobic minimum lethal concentration [MLC] > 50 µg/mL).

Of 538 T. vaginalis isolates, 23 (4.3%) exhibited low-level in vitro metronidazole resistance (minimum lethal concentrations 50–100 µg/mL). No isolates exhibited moderate- to high-level metronidazole resistance or tinidazole resistance. Results highlight the possibility that reliance on a single class of antimicrobial drugs for treating T. vaginalis infections may heighten vulnerability to emergence of resistance. Thus, novel treatment options are needed.

### Tindamax [^112U9hmn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Trichomoniasis**: Tinidazole (2 g single oral dose) use in trichomoniasis has been well documented in 34 published reports from the world literature involving over 2,800 patients treated with tinidazole. In four published, blinded, randomized, comparative studies of the 2 g tinidazole single oral dose where efficacy was assessed by culture at time points after treatment ranging from one week to one month, reported cure rates ranged from 92% (37/40) to 100% (65/65) (n = 172 total subjects). In four published, blinded, randomized, comparative studies where efficacy was assessed by wet mount between 7–14 days post-treatment, reported cure rates ranged from 80% (8/10) to 100% (16/16) (n = 116 total subjects). In these studies, tinidazole was superior to placebo and comparable to other anti-trichomonal drugs. The single oral 2 g tinidazole dose was also assessed in four open-label trials in men (one comparative to metronidazole and three single-arm studies). Parasitological evaluation of the urine was performed both pre- and post-treatment and reported cure rates ranged from 83% (25/30) to 100% (80/80) (n = 142 total subjects).

- **Giardiasis**: Tinidazole (2 g single dose) use in giardiasis has been documented in 19 published reports from the world literature involving over 1,600 patients (adults and pediatric patients). In eight controlled studies involving a total of 619 subjects of whom 299 were given the 2 g × 1 day (50 mg/kg × 1 day in pediatric patients) oral dose of tinidazole, reported cure rates ranged from 80% (40/50) to 100% (15/15).

### High-dose vaginal metronidazole for recurrent bacterial vaginosis — a pilot study [^112Wq5jB]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate high-dose intravaginal metronidazole, with or without miconazole, in enhancing cure rates in women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (reBV).

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 43 women with symptomatic reBV were enrolled in a 4-arm study comparing 500 mg versus 750 mg of metronidazole, with or without miconazole, administered intravaginally for 7 days. Tests of cure, including saline wet mount and 10% potassium chloride microscopy, pH measurement, Gram stain for Nugent score, and yeast culture, were performed three times post-treatment: 3 to 7 days, 30 to 35 days, and 60 to 70 days.

- **Results**: The overall cure rate for the entire group was 92.6% at visit 2, 62.1% at visit 3, and 51.4% at visit 4. At visit 2, there was no difference in cure rates among patients who received metronidazole 750 mg ± miconazole daily (90.5%) compared with metronidazole 500 mg ± miconazole daily (85%). At visit 3, there was a significant improvement in cure rates among patients who received metronidazole 750 mg ± miconazole daily (78.9%) compared with metronidazole 500 mg ± miconazole daily (44.4%). Indicators of BV (Nugent score > 4 or pH > 4.4) at the first visit after treatment predicted recurrence. The addition of miconazole did not enhance BV response rates.

- **Conclusions**: Cure rates for bacterial vaginosis were high in this refractory cohort and appeared dose-dependent.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: Results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^111wKJp1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

As providers move toward multidose metronidazole (MTZ) as the preferred regimen for all women with trichomoniasis, our findings support the use of single-dose secnidazole (SEC). With efficacy rates for the treatment of trichomoniasis comparable to those of multidose MTZ, SEC has favorable attributes that may provide advantages over other options. In vitro studies of T. vaginalis isolates showed that the minimal lethal concentration of SEC is 56% lower compared with MTZ. SEC also differs from other 5-nitroimidazoles with a notably longer half-life (17 hours) versus MTZ (7–8 hours) and tinidazole (TDZ) (12 hours).

Single-dose options are convenient and likely to improve adherence overall, especially in populations at risk for noncompliance. Of note, compliance with multidose MTZ has been low (50%–63%) in some studies. Factors that may impact adherence include gastrointestinal complaints, treatment duration, and lifestyle restrictions. In one study, 23% of patients reported nausea in the single-dose and multidose MTZ groups. In our study, 2.7% of patients reported nausea with SEC. Additionally, SEC does not have an alcohol restriction based on data from in vitro studies.

### Treatment of trichomoniasis in pregnancy and preterm birth: an observational study [^115ZS72K]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

To investigate the association between the treatment of maternal trichomoniasis with oral metronidazole and preterm birth, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using Medicaid billing data and birth certificate records for 144,737 live births in South Carolina from 1996 through 2002. Cases of trichomoniasis were identified using billing codes. The risk of preterm birth among women with treated versus untreated trichomoniasis was modeled as a time-varying covariate in Cox proportional hazards regression. Women who were initially diagnosed with trichomoniasis at ≥ 35 weeks or delivered < 2 days after the diagnosis were excluded from the modeling. We also examined the effect of excluding women who gave birth within 14 days following the diagnosis.

There were 4,274 (3.0%) women diagnosed with trichomoniasis. Of these, 3,579 women were diagnosed with trichomoniasis prior to 35 weeks' gestation and remained pregnant until at least the second day after the diagnosis. A total of 1,436 (40.1%) of these women filled a prescription for oral metronidazole within 14 days. Among treated women, 12.7% delivered prior to 37 weeks compared with 15.3% of women who were not treated within 14 days. In the multivariable proportional hazards regression, treatment appeared to be protective both for women with and without another genitourinary infection at some point during pregnancy (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.50, 0.95 in women with another infection; HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.52, 0.92 in women without another infection). After excluding women who delivered within 14 days of the diagnosis, the hazard ratio…

### Impact of oral metronidazole treatment on the vaginal microbiota and correlates of treatment failure [^114eScta]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Oral metronidazole treatment alone may not be sufficient for women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (reBV) or for women at risk of complications caused by pathobionts, such as pregnant women. Additional treatments are urgently needed, including biofilm-disrupting treatments and drugs that specifically target all G. vaginalis clades or pathobionts.

### Interventions for trichomoniasis in pregnancy [^115qkmDC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Vaginitis due to Trichomonas vaginalis is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Trichomoniasis also affects women during pregnancy; however, it is not clearly established whether it causes preterm birth and other pregnancy complications.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of various treatments for trichomoniasis during pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register was searched in March 2002.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials comparing antitrichomonas agents during pregnancy were included. Trials, including symptomatic or asymptomatic women with trichomoniasis, were eligible.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Eligibility and trial quality were assessed by one reviewer.

- **Main results**: Two trials with 842 pregnant women were included. In both trials, about 90% of women were cleared of trichomonas in the vagina after treatment. In the US trial, women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis between 16 to 23 weeks were treated with metronidazole on two occasions, at least two weeks apart. The trial was stopped before reaching its target recruitment because metronidazole was not effective in reducing preterm birth and there was a likelihood of harm (relative risk: 1.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 2.7). The South African trial recruited women later in pregnancy and did not have the design and power to address adverse clinical outcomes.

- **Reviewer's conclusions**: Metronidazole, given as a single dose, is likely to provide a parasitological cure for trichomoniasis, but it is not known whether this treatment reduces adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### Trichomonas vaginalis antimicrobial drug resistance in 6 US cities, STD surveillance network, 2009–2010 [^117LHsUJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this study is the first multisite evaluation conducted to assess the prevalence of in vitro T. vaginalis resistance in the United States. Although metronidazole has been used to treat T. vaginalis infections for approximately 40 years, we found a low prevalence of in vitro metronidazole resistance. Minimum lethal concentrations (MLCs) of tinidazole were lower than MLCs of metronidazole, and we did not detect tinidazole resistance.

The prevalence of in vitro metronidazole and tinidazole resistance is consistent with previously published US estimates. Three studies conducted in the southeastern United States among women attending STD or gynecology clinics from 1997 through 2005 found a metronidazole-resistance prevalence of 2.4%–9.5%. Most metronidazole-resistant isolates in these studies exhibited low-level resistance. In two of these studies, tinidazole resistance was also tested: Krashin et al. did not detect tinidazole resistance, and Schwebke and Barrientes detected one isolate (0.6%) that exhibited low-level tinidazole resistance (MLC 50 µg/mL) among the 178 isolates tested. Among 91 isolates collected in Spain during 1995 and 1999, 2.2% exhibited low-level resistance to metronidazole. A small study conducted among women from Papua New Guinea found 21 (91%) of 23 studied isolates had MLCs of metronidazole of > 50 µg/mL, including four (17%) with MLCs of 200 µg/mL. However, the sampling method used to enroll women was not described and may not have been systematic, thus substantially limiting the ability to estimate the population-level prevalence of resistance.

### Metronidazole vaginal [^114Q8k4s]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Following a single intravaginal 5 gram dose of metronidazole vaginal gel (equivalent to 37.5 mg of metronidazole) administered to 12 normal subjects, a mean maximum serum metronidazole concentration of 237 ng/mL was reported (range: 152 to 368 ng/mL). This concentration is approximately 2% of the mean maximum serum metronidazole concentration reported in the same subjects who received a single oral 500 mg dose of metronidazole (mean Cmax = 12,785 ng/mL, range: 10,013 to 17,400 ng/mL). These peak concentrations were obtained 6 to 12 hours after dosing with metronidazole vaginal gel and 1 to 3 hours after dosing with oral metronidazole.

The extent of exposure, measured as the area under the curve (AUC), of metronidazole following administration of a single intravaginal 5 gram dose of metronidazole vaginal gel (equivalent to 37.5 mg of metronidazole) was approximately 4% of that from a single oral 500 mg dose of metronidazole (4977 ng-hr/mL and approximately 125,000 ng-hr/mL, respectively).

Dose-adjusted comparisons of AUCs demonstrated that, on a mg-to-mg comparison basis, the absorption of metronidazole when administered vaginally was approximately half that of an equivalent oral dosage.

### Metronidazole vaginal [^113w1y7e]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Metronidazole vaginal gel provides minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure (AUCs) compared to 500 mg oral metronidazole dosing. Although these lower levels of exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral metronidazole, the possibility of these and other reactions cannot presently be excluded. Data from well-controlled trials directly comparing metronidazole administered orally to metronidazole administered vaginally are not available.

- **General**: Patients with severe hepatic disease metabolize metronidazole slowly, leading to the accumulation of metronidazole and its metabolites in the plasma. Accordingly, for such patients, metronidazole vaginal gel should be administered cautiously. Known or previously unrecognized vaginal candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms during therapy with metronidazole vaginal gel. Approximately 6–10% of patients treated with metronidazole vaginal gel developed symptomatic Candida vaginitis during or immediately after therapy. Disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol has been reported with oral metronidazole, thus the possibility of such a reaction occurring while on metronidazole vaginal gel therapy cannot be excluded. Metronidazole vaginal gel contains ingredients that may cause burning and irritation of the eye. In the event of accidental contact with the eye, rinse the eye with copious amounts of cool tap water.

- **Information for the patient**: The patient should be cautioned about drinking alcohol while being treated with metronidazole vaginal gel.

### Effectiveness of two tinidazole regimens in treatment of bacterial vaginosis: A randomized controlled trial [^111NtLG5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

To assess the effectiveness at 21–30 days after treatment of tinidazole administered orally at 1 g once daily for 5 days and 2 g once daily for 2 days, compared with placebo, in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, rigorous U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended criteria were used to define cure.

A total of 235 women at 10 U.S. centers participated in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The presence or absence of all five of the following criteria was required to define diagnosis or cure of bacterial vaginosis:

1. Clue cells were at least 20% of squamous cells in microscopic examination of vaginal fluid.
2. Positive potassium hydroxide whiff test.
3. A homogeneous, thin, white-gray vaginal discharge.
4. Vaginal pH greater than 4.5.
5. Nugent score greater than or equal to 4 on Gram-stained vaginal fluid.

Compliance, tolerability, and safety were assessed using patient diaries and interviews at 8–10 days and 21–30 days after treatment. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistical analysis with Bonferroni adjustment was used to compare outcomes.

Superior efficacy was demonstrated by tinidazole for the 1 g once daily for 5 days regimen (36.8% cured, p < 0.001, number needed to treat 3.2) and for the 2 g once daily for 2 days regimen (27.4% cured, p < 0.001, number needed to treat 4.5), when compared with placebo (5.1% cured) in the primary endpoint analysis. Using more traditional criteria for cure, efficacy was greater. Compliance with study therapy and tolerability were comparable in the three treatment groups.

### Management of trichomonas vaginalis in women with suspected metronidazole hypersensitivity [^1155bhMn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

The standard treatment for *Trichomonas vaginalis* is metronidazole or tinidazole. Hypersensitivity to these drugs has been documented but is poorly understood. Desensitization is an option described in limited reports of women with hypersensitivity to nitroimidazoles. The purpose of this analysis is to improve the documentation of management for *Trichomonas* infections among women with metronidazole hypersensitivity.

- **Study design**: Clinicians who consulted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concerning patients with suspected hypersensitivity to metronidazole were provided with treatment options and asked to report outcomes.

- **Results**: From September 2003 to September 2006, complete information was obtained for 59 women. The most common reactions were urticaria (47%) and facial edema (11%). Fifteen of these women (25.4%) were treated with metronidazole desensitization, and all had eradication of their infection. Seventeen women (28.8%) were treated with alternative intravaginal drugs, which were less successful; 5 of 17 infections (29.4%) were eradicated.

- **Conclusion**: Metronidazole desensitization was effective in the management of women with nitroimidazole hypersensitivity.

### Trichomoniasis: Challenges to appropriate management [^111FME8R]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infection is a common cause of vaginal irritation in women and is the most common nonviral sexually transmitted disease in the world. It has been associated with serious sequelae, the most notable of which are prematurity, low birth weight, and increases in human immunodeficiency virus transmission. We review advances in diagnosis and treatment and the controversies regarding management.

### Disparities in adherence to retesting guidelines in women with Trichomonas vaginalis infection [^115RSLtV]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Trichomoniasis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with numerous studies indicating disproportionately higher prevalence rates in non-Hispanic Black women. Given the high rates of reinfection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends retesting women treated for trichomoniasis. Despite these national guidelines, few studies have examined adherence to retesting recommendations for patients with trichomoniasis. Adherence to retesting guidelines has been shown in other infections to be an important determinant of racial disparities.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to describe Trichomonas vaginalis infection rates, evaluate adherence to retesting guidelines, and examine characteristics of women who were not retested according to the guidelines in an urban, diverse, hospital-based obstetrics and gynecology clinic population.

- **Study design**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients from a single hospital-based obstetrics and gynecology clinic who were tested for Trichomonas vaginalis between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019. Descriptive statistics were used to examine guideline-concordant testing for reinfection among patients with trichomoniasis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify characteristics associated with testing positive and with appropriate retesting. Subgroup analyses were performed for patients who were pregnant and tested positive for Trichomonas vaginalis.

- **Results**: Among the 8809 patients tested for Trichomonas vaginalis, 799 (9.1%) tested positive.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: Results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^111i5fp7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

- **Efficacy**: In the mITT population, the microbiologic cure rate at TOC was significantly higher (P < .001) in the secnidazole (SEC) versus placebo group, achieving 92.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 82.7%–97.4%] compared to 1.5% [95% CI: 0–8.0%]. In the PP population, the cure rate at TOC was also significantly higher (P < .001) in the SEC versus placebo group, with a cure rate of 94.9% [95% CI: 85.9%–98.9%] compared to 1.7% [95% CI: 0–8.9%]. There were no significant demographic differences between patients who were not cured (i.e. at visit 2 in the SEC group and at visit 3 in the placebo group) and those who were cured.

In the subgroup of patients with vaginal symptoms at baseline, the microbiological cure rate at TOC was 92.9% (95% CI: 82.7%–98.0%) in the SEC group; no patient in the placebo group had a negative T. vaginalis culture at TOC (P < .001). In women with HIV, 100% (4/4) had a microbiological cure at TOC; no patient in the placebo group had a negative T. vaginalis culture at TOC. In patients with bacterial vaginosis (BV) at baseline, the microbiological cure rate at TOC was 95.2% (95% CI: 76.2%–99.9%) in the SEC group; no patient in the placebo group had a negative T. vaginalis culture at TOC (P < .001).

- **Safety**: In the safety population, treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) rates were lower in the SEC group compared to the placebo group. All TEAEs were mild. Only one patient in the SEC group discontinued treatment due to TEAEs.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: Results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^117VTgWT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of secnidazole versus placebo in women with trichomoniasis.

- **Methods**: Women with trichomoniasis, confirmed by a positive T. vaginalis culture, were randomized to receive a single-dose oral secnidazole tablet of 2 g or a placebo. The primary endpoint was the microbiological test of cure (TOC) by culture, performed 6–12 days after dosing. At the TOC visit, participants were given the opposite treatment and followed for the resolution of infection, with treatment offered at subsequent visits if needed. Fifty patients per group (N = 100) provided approximately 95% power to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment groups.

- **Results**: Between April 2019 and March 2020, 147 women were enrolled at 10 sites in the United States. The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population included 131 randomized patients (secnidazole group: n = 64; placebo group: n = 67). Cure rates were significantly higher in the secnidazole group compared to the placebo group for the mITT population (92.2% [95% confidence interval {CI}: 82.7%-97.4%] vs 1.5% [95% CI: .0%-8.0%]) and for the per-protocol population (94.9% [95% CI: 85.9%-98.9%] vs 1.7% [95% CI: .0%-8.9%]). Cure rates were 100% (4/4) in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 95.2% (20/21) in women with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Secnidazole was generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were vulvovaginal candidiasis and nausea (each 2.7%). No serious TEAEs were observed.

- **Conclusions**: A single oral dose of secnidazole was effective and well-tolerated for treating trichomoniasis in women, including those with HIV and BV.

### Characterization and treatment of recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^114h7Zfb]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common but treatable condition, with several effective treatments available, including oral and intravaginal metronidazole, clindamycin, and oral tinidazole. However, as many as 50% of women with BV experience recurrence within one year of treatment for the initial disease. Some reasons for recurrence include the persistence of residual infection, resistance, and possibly reinfection from either male or female partners. Persistence may occur due to the formation of a biofilm that protects BV-causing bacteria from antimicrobial therapy. Poor adherence to treatment among patients with genitourinary infections may lead to resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms of recurrent BV are not known.

Recommended treatment for recurrent BV consists of an extended course of metronidazole (500 mg twice daily for 10–14 days). If ineffective, metronidazole vaginal gel 0.75% for 10 days, followed by application twice per week for 3–6 months, is an alternate treatment regimen. Past studies of clindamycin and tinidazole in the treatment of recurrent BV have focused on patients with evidence of metronidazole resistance. Secnidazole may be an attractive new option due to its one-time dosing. Initial studies on biofilm disruption, use of probiotics and prebiotics, and botanical treatments have shown some promise but must be studied further before clinical use. Despite limitations, antimicrobial therapy will remain the mainstay of treatment for recurrent BV for the foreseeable future.

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^111iJRDJ]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Recent improvements in 16S rRNA sequencing have enhanced the ability to identify and more accurately quantify the composition of the vaginal microbiota in bacterial vaginosis (BV), finding that the transition is frequently associated with an abundance of *Lactobacillus iners* (Li). Despite the association between Li and incidence of BV, identifying how Li dictates communities of optimal and non-optimal microbiota remains elusive, as the vaginal microbiota can change significantly over time and vary between women — especially in the presence of metronidazole (MNZ). The recommended treatment regimen for BV consists of oral or vaginal MNZ, which selectively targets anaerobic bacteria with little effect on *Lactobacillus spp.*; however, the high variability in efficacy indicates that further study is required to understand the reestablishment of optimal vaginal microbiota ecosystems.

Recent research in the HIV microbicide field has highlighted the importance of vaginal microbiome composition in drug treatment efficacy. In a landmark study, variability in tenofovir (TFV) microbicide efficacy was accounted for by differences in the vaginal microbiome, specifically the presence of the non-target species *Gardnerella vaginalis* (Gv), which were shown to metabolize TFV. Likewise, for MNZ treatment of *Trichomonas vaginalis*, a proposed mechanism of treatment failure was decreased bioavailability of MNZ due to the absorbance of the antibiotic by other microorganisms in the vagina. In the context of BV, it is difficult to discern the role of multiple possible interactions that have the potential to influence MNZ efficacy, including MNZ metabolism.

### Treatment considerations for bacterial vaginosis and the risk of recurrence [^1117pJbh]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

Recommended regimens for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) have similar efficacy; thus, the choice of treatment should consider additional factors such as the risk of BV recurrence and the side effect profile. The purpose of this study was to investigate BV recurrence rates and rates of acquiring vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) after different BV treatments in a commercially insured population.

- **Methods**: Private administrative insurance claims from 2004 to 2006 were used. Study subjects were continuously enrolled females aged 12–50 years who filled prescriptions for BV treatment (n = 32,268). The four BV treatments (single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%), multiple-dose clindamycin vaginal regimens, vaginal metronidazole, and oral metronidazole) were compared for rates of recurrent BV and VVC after treatment using multivariate analyses. Covariates included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.

- **Results**: Overall, the rate of BV recurrence (2.7%) and VVC post-treatment (2.9%) were low. Women who were treated with single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%) showed no significant difference from women treated with oral metronidazole in the likelihood of BV recurrence. However, women who received other vaginal treatments were significantly more likely to experience BV recurrence compared with women who received oral metronidazole (p < 0.01). Moreover, women who were treated with single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%) and vaginal metronidazole were significantly less likely to have VVC compared with those treated with oral metronidazole (p < 0.01).

### Metronidazole vaginal [^114EVfJi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Patients with bacterial vaginosis reported a mean maximum serum metronidazole concentration of 214 ng/mL on day one, following single and multiple 5 gram doses of metronidazole vaginal gel to four patients. This increased to 294 ng/mL (range: 228 to 349 ng/mL) on day five. Steady-state metronidazole serum concentrations following oral doses of 400 to 500 mg BID have been reported to range from 6,000 to 20,000 ng/mL.

- **Microbiology**: The intracellular targets of action of metronidazole on anaerobes are largely unknown. The 5-nitro group of metronidazole is reduced by metabolically active anaerobes, and studies have demonstrated that the reduced form of the drug interacts with bacterial DNA. However, it is not clear whether interaction with DNA alone is an important component in its bactericidal action on anaerobic organisms.

Culture and sensitivity testing of bacteria are not routinely performed to establish the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Standard methodology for the susceptibility testing of potential bacterial vaginosis pathogens, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., and Mycoplasma hominis, has not been defined. Nonetheless, metronidazole is an antimicrobial agent active in vitro against most strains of the following organisms reported to be associated with bacterial vaginosis: Bacteroides spp. Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp.

### Randomized trial of periodic presumptive treatment with high-dose intravaginal metronidazole and miconazole to prevent vaginal infections in HIV-negative women [^115yEJcm]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Vaginal infections are common, frequently recur, and may increase women's risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We tested the efficacy of a novel regimen to prevent recurrent vaginal infections.

- **Methods**: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative women aged 18–45 years with one or more vaginal infections, including bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), were randomly assigned to receive vaginal suppositories containing metronidazole 750 mg plus miconazole 200 mg or a matching placebo for 5 consecutive nights each month for 12 months. The primary endpoints, evaluated every 2 months, were BV (Gram stain) and VVC (positive wet mount and culture).

- **Results**: Participants (N = 234) were randomly assigned to the intervention (N = 118) or placebo (N = 116) group. Two hundred seventeen (93%) women completed an end-of-study evaluation. The intervention reduced the proportion of visits with BV compared to placebo (21.2% vs. 32.5%; relative risk [RR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48–0.87). In contrast, the proportion of visits with VVC was similar in the intervention (10.4%) versus placebo (11.3%) arms (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.62–1.37).

- **Conclusions**: Monthly treatment with intravaginal metronidazole plus miconazole reduced the proportion of visits with BV during 12 months of follow-up. Further study will be important to determine whether this intervention can reduce women's risk of STIs.

### Metronidazole vaginal [^114gb27d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Metronidazole vaginal gel is indicated in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, Corynebacterium vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis).

- **Indications and usage**: For purposes of this indication, a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that (a) has a pH of greater than 4.5, (b) emits a "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and (c) contains clue cells on microscopic examination. Gram's stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include (a) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, (b) predominance of Gardnerella morphotype, and (c) absent or few white blood cells.

Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis, such as Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans, and Herpes simplex virus, should be ruled out.

### Interventions for trichomoniasis in pregnancy [^113qTjAk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Vaginitis due to *Trichomonas vaginalis* is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Trichomoniasis affects women during pregnancy as well, but it is not clearly established whether it causes preterm birth and other pregnancy complications.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of various treatments for trichomoniasis during pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (14 January 2011).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials comparing anti-trichomonas agents during pregnancy were included. Trials involving symptomatic or asymptomatic women with trichomoniasis were eligible.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality.

- **Main results**: We included two trials with 842 pregnant women. In both trials, around 90% of women were cleared of trichomonas in the vagina after treatment. In the US trial, women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis between 16 and 23 weeks were treated with metronidazole on two occasions at least two weeks apart. The trial was stopped before reaching its target recruitment because metronidazole was not effective in reducing preterm birth and there was a likelihood of harm (risk ratio 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 2.66). The South African trial recruited women later in pregnancy and did not have the design and power to address adverse clinical outcomes. We excluded two recent studies identified for the update because they did not address the primary question.

### Reversible optic neuropathy secondary to metronidazole [^111zAuEk]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic used in treating anaerobic bacteria and protozoal infections. It was first licensed for the treatment of *Trichomonas vaginalis* but is now used in the management of various gastrointestinal and genitourinary infections. Many neurological side effects are well documented, although there is scarce literature illustrating optic neuropathy secondary to metronidazole.

We describe a case report of a 36-year-old man who presented with symptomatically reduced central visual loss on a background of a 2-year history of metronidazole use for a perianal fistula. Electrophysiology demonstrated bilateral optic neuropathy, with pattern visual evoked potential traces demonstrating marked latency and small amplitude responses of the P100 waves, which improved to within normal limits on cessation of metronidazole. This case study demonstrates the clinical and electrophysiological reversibility of optic neuropathy secondary to high dose and prolonged metronidazole use.

### Tinidazole vs metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis [^112VoTeV]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of two different doses of tinidazole with metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis and to compare the side effects of the drugs.

- **Study design**: Women were assigned randomly to receive metronidazole 500 mg twice daily, tinidazole 500 mg twice daily, or tinidazole 1 g twice, all for 7 days. Follow-up visits were conducted at days 14 and 28.

- **Results**: Five hundred ninety-three women were enrolled. There were no significant differences between the treatment arms. Overall cure rates were 76.8% at 14 days and 64.5% at 1 month. Women who admitted to engaging in sexual intercourse during the study were significantly more likely to have bacterial vaginosis at the follow-up visit. There were no significant differences in adverse events across treatment arms.

- **Conclusion**: There were no differences in cure rates between metronidazole and either of the tinidazole dosing regimens that were studied. In addition, there were no important differences in the side-effect profiles of metronidazole and tinidazole.

### Trichomonas vaginalis antimicrobial drug resistance in 6 US cities, STD surveillance network, 2009–2010 [^114xaGBq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The distribution of minimum lethal concentrations (MLCs) of tinidazole and metronidazole was studied through the STD Surveillance Network from 2009 to 2010, consisting of 538 samples. Susceptibility to metronidazole and tinidazole is defined as an MLC of ≤ 400 μg/mL.

Sixteen women submitted two evaluable isolates, and one woman submitted three isolates. Among these seventeen women, the median duration between sample collection was 128 days, ranging from 2 to 392 days. Three women submitted the second specimens within 30 days of the initial submission, with initial MLCs of metronidazole ranging from 0.8 to 3.1 µg/mL; three other women submitted theirs within 60 days, with initial MLCs ranging from 1.6 to 6.3 µg/mL; and one within 90 days with an initial MLC of 0.8 µg/mL. Data on sexual re-exposure were available for only one of these seven women.

For initial isolates from two women, the MLCs of metronidazole were found to be > 12.5 µg/mL (50 µg/mL in both cases). In one instance, the second isolate was collected 158 days after the first, and the woman reported having 12 sex partners in the preceding 3 months. In the other instance, the second isolate was collected 308 days later, and the MLC of metronidazole for this strain was 0.8 µg/mL.

### Trichomonas vaginalis antimicrobial drug resistance in 6 US cities, STD surveillance network, 2009–2010 [^117ACqaE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Inconsistency does exist between in vitro susceptibility results and clinical outcomes of treatment, particularly for infections with low-level in vitro resistance. Clinical resistance and treatment failure have occurred with T. vaginalis isolates for which MLCs of nitroimidazoles were as low as 12.5 µg/mL, and treatment success has occurred in infections with T. vaginalis isolates for which MLCs of nitroimidazoles were 100–200 µg/mL. In general, however, elevated MLCs are associated with a greater likelihood of treatment failure. A recent evaluation of the utility of susceptibility testing in women for whom clinical treatment has failed found that treatment recommendations based on susceptibility results may have a beneficial role in informing the clinical management of some women with persistent infection. T. vaginalis susceptibility testing is not available routinely; such testing should be conducted by a qualified laboratory and is available at CDC (1–800-INFO).

As a cross-sectional evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial drug susceptibility, the study was not designed to detect clinical treatment failures. Multiple isolates were collected from 17 women. However, we did not systematically collect data on sexual re-exposure after treatment or adherence, so we were not able to determine whether any of these cases resulted from treatment failure. The MLCs of metronidazole for the initial isolates were low, suggesting that clinical resistance was unlikely. In two cases, the initial isolate exhibited low-level resistance (MLC of metronidazole 50 µg/mL) and a second isolate was found.

### Impact of oral metronidazole treatment on the vaginal microbiota and correlates of treatment failure [^113XcAMa]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Metronidazole is the first-line treatment for bacterial vaginosis, but cure rates are suboptimal and recurrence rates high.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the impact of a standard course of oral metronidazole treatment (500 mg twice per day for 7 days) on the vaginal microbiota of Rwandan bacterial vaginosis patients using microscopy and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and to evaluate correlates of treatment failure.

- **Study design**: HIV-negative, nonpregnant women aged 18–45 years with bacterial vaginosis and/or Trichomonas vaginalis (N = 68) were interviewed and sampled before and after metronidazole treatment. They were also screened and treated, if applicable, for other urogenital infections. The vaginal microbiota was assessed by Gram stain Nugent scoring, Illumina 16S rRNA HiSeq sequencing (relative abundances), and BactQuant 16S gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction (estimated concentrations). Only women with a pretreatment Nugent score of 7–10 and a valid posttreatment Nugent score (N = 55) were included in metronidazole treatment failure analyses, with treatment failure defined as a posttreatment Nugent score of 4–10.

- **Results**: The bacterial vaginosis cure rate by Nugent scoring was 54.5%. The mean total vaginal bacterial concentration declined from 6.59 to 5.85 log 10/μL (p < 0.001), which was mostly due to a reduction in mean bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes concentration (all bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobe taxa combined) from 6.23 to 4.55 log 10/μL (p < 0.001). However, only 16.4% of women had a bacterial vaginosis anaerobes concentration reduction.

### Trichomonas vaginalis virus among women with trichomoniasis and associations with demographics, clinical outcomes, and metronidazole resistance [^111yGsnb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis virus (TVV) is a non-segmented, 4.5–5.5 kilo-base pair (kbp), double-stranded RNA virus infecting T. vaginalis. The objectives of this study were to examine the TVV prevalence in US Trichomonas vaginalis isolates and TVV's associations with patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and metronidazole resistance.

- **Methods**: Archived T. vaginalis isolates from the enrollment visits of 355 women participating in a T. vaginalis treatment trial in Birmingham, Alabama, were thawed and grown in culture. Their total RNA was extracted using a Trizol reagent. Contaminating single-stranded RNA was precipitated using 4.0 M Lithium Chloride and centrifugation. The samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis to visualize a 4.5 kbp band representative of TVV. In vitro testing for metronidazole resistance was also performed on 25/47 isolates obtained from the women's test of cure visits.

- **Results**: TVV was detected in 142/355 (40%) isolates at the enrollment visit. Women with TVV-positive (TVV+) isolates were significantly older (P = .01), more likely to smoke (P = .04), and less likely to report a history of gonorrhea (P = .04). There was no association between the presence of clinical symptoms or repeat T. vaginalis infections with TVV+ isolates (P = .14 and P = .44, respectively). Of 25 test of cure isolates tested for metronidazole resistance, 0/10 TVV+ isolates demonstrated resistance, while 2/15 TVV-negative isolates demonstrated mild to moderate resistance (P = .23).

In conclusion, TVV was detected in a significant proportion of T. vaginalis isolates from the study population, with certain demographic and clinical characteristics associated with TVV+ status. However, no significant resistance to metronidazole was observed in TVV+ isolates.

### Impact of oral metronidazole treatment on the vaginal microbiota and correlates of treatment failure [^115kcTLF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

We screened 176 women, and 68 women completed metronidazole treatment, with ineligibility reasons referenced in Appendix A, Figure A.1. Among these women, 82.4% had bacterial vaginosis (BV) alone, 2.9% had Trichomonas vaginalis alone, and 14.7% had both BV and T. vaginalis. The median age was 31 years (range 19–42), and most were sex workers. Thirteen women (26.5%) reported unusual vaginal discharge at the pretreatment visit, but none had proactively sought care for these symptoms before joining the study. Some women (26.5%) received another antibiotic in addition to metronidazole for another condition, or had an ongoing Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection during metronidazole treatment (38.2%).

At the posttreatment visit, all women were BV-negative by modified Amsel criteria and T. vaginalis-negative by culture and wet mount. No women reported urogenital symptoms, including unusual vaginal discharge, adverse events such as vomiting, or social harms. Of the 56 women with Nugent scores of 7–10 pretreatment, 30 (54.5%) had Nugent scores of 0–3, 11 (20.0%) had scores of 4–6, and 14 had scores of 7–10 posttreatment.

### What's new in bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis [^115iKS42]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Use of biochemical profiles and new molecular microbiologic methodologies is transforming our understanding of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Most importantly, there is a recognition of different subgroups of women with BV who are at varying risk for certain obstetric and gynecologic complications. New diagnostic tests may soon be available, allowing women to test self-obtained specimens. Treatment of BV has lagged, although innovative methods appear to be helpful in managing recurrences of the disease.

Eighty-nine women with either bacterial vaginosis, Trichomonas vaginalis, or both, who also had a positive fetal fibronectin test result were randomized to two courses of metronidazole treatment as part of a Maternal-Fetal Medicine Network Units study of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. In this subgroup analysis, compared with the placebo group, women who were treated with metronidazole had a nonsignificant reduction in spontaneous preterm birth from 14.6% to 8.3%.

### Trichomonas vaginalis antimicrobial drug resistance in 6 US cities, STD surveillance network, 2009–2010 [^111yviKD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Trichomoniasis, caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, is one of the most common nonviral sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Annually, approximately 248 million incident cases occur worldwide, and about 7.4 million cases occur in the United States. The estimated US prevalence of T. vaginalis infection is 3.1%, with a higher prevalence among Black women and women of low socioeconomic status than among other women. Trichomoniasis is a frequent cause of vaginitis and can contribute to premature rupture of membranes during pregnancy, preterm birth, and low birth weight, and may facilitate HIV acquisition.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STD Treatment Guidelines recommends the use of a 5-nitroimidazole antimicrobial agent, either metronidazole or tinidazole, for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection. Metronidazole has been the mainstay of treatment for several decades; however, tinidazole has better in vitro activity and is well tolerated.

The reliance on a single drug class for treating T. vaginalis infections may be problematic if resistance to nitroimidazole becomes widespread in T. vaginalis strains. Three small studies that examined the prevalence of in vitro resistance in the United States have been conducted during the past 15 years, but they were limited in geographic scope. Our objective was to assess the prevalence of in vitro aerobic metronidazole and tinidazole resistance among a broad sample of T. vaginalis isolates from multiple geographic sites in the United States.

### Trichomonas vaginalis antimicrobial drug resistance in 6 US cities, STD surveillance network, 2009–2010 [^114xunp8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Isolates were assayed for metronidazole and tinidazole susceptibility under aerobic conditions, according to the method developed by Meingassner and Thurne using serial dilutions of drug concentrations from 0.2 to 400 µg/mL. The minimum lethal concentration (MLC) was the lowest dilution at which no motile trichomonads could be observed from an isolate assay. Isolates were tested in triplicate, and the assay was repeated twice. Control strains were CDC 085 (resistant) and CDC 520 (sensitive). If results differed, the modal result was used. Low-level resistance was defined as aerobic MLC 50–100 µg/mL, moderate-level resistance as 200 µg/mL, and high-level resistance as > 400 µg/mL.

If multiple isolates were submitted from a single patient, the first submitted isolate was included in the analytic dataset. Median MLCs of metronidazole and tinidazole were compared using the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test to account for intra-isolate correlation. The prevalence of metronidazole and tinidazole resistance among isolates was assessed, and the prevalence of resistance to each agent by geographic site was compared using the χ² test. Median metronidazole MLCs by geographic site were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Demographic and clinical data for women infected with a resistant isolate (metronidazole or tinidazole MLC > 50 µg/mL) were compared with data for women infected with a susceptible isolate using the χ² or Fisher exact test for dichotomous data and t-test for continuous data. p values were 2-tailed and considered significant at p < 0.05.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: Results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^116Xsz4f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

In our study, cure rates were 92%–100% in the overall population and in subgroups of women with genital symptoms, HIV, and/or BV. Previous research showed that trichomoniasis treatment significantly decreases HIV viral load and viral shedding, and may reduce HIV transmission. Although only four patients had HIV, our finding that all were cured is reassuring, and larger clinical trials in this patient population are warranted to confirm these results. Moreover, coinfection of BV and *T. vaginalis* is common, with rates of 60%–80%. Thus, a single treatment for BV and trichomoniasis may have multiple benefits.

A potential limitation of this study was the use of *T. vaginalis* culture to achieve a shorter timeframe to TOC. Although InPouch may be less sensitive than NAAT, the accuracy in this study was high, as supported by the low placebo responder rate (~1%). Other limitations include the lack of long-term follow-up and the exclusion of men and pregnant women. However, two non-US-based studies of SEC for trichomoniasis in patients, including a small subgroup of men, showed cure rates of 91.7%–100% at 2–20 days after treatment. Although our study did not include pregnant women, and data on the use of SEC during pregnancy are limited, reproductive preclinical toxicology studies have shown no evidence of toxicity, and SEC is not contraindicated during pregnancy. The CDC recommends that trichomoniasis treatment be considered for symptomatic pregnant women, regardless of pregnancy stage. Finally, 5-nitroimidazole susceptibility testing was not performed on trichomonas isolates in the study.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^1122BST5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Women who seek care and can follow up at sexual health clinics and primary care offices differ from many in disadvantaged groups for whom there may be only one opportunity to address their symptoms when seen in the emergency department (ED). Empirical treatment of vaginitis carries risks of overtreatment, although using a single-dose regimen would minimize stewardship concerns for collateral adverse antibiotic effects. Furthermore, overall treatment effectiveness must be considered in the context of a woman's specific circumstances and needs, such as CDC-endorsed empirical expedited partner therapy (EPT) treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and in the case of sexual assault, for which compliance with follow-up visits is acknowledged to be poor.

For women with a clinical diagnosis of vaginitis, particularly in EDs where point-of-care nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is not available, we believe empirical treatment with 2-g single-dose tinidazole for bacterial vaginosis (BV) and trichomoniasis (TV), and 150-mg single-dose fluconazole for Candida should be offered through shared decision-making. Reliance on microscopy testing poses a substantial risk of underdiagnosis and undertreatment, leading to persistent symptoms, additional health care visits, and risk of transmission. Alternatively, if the patient believes she can comply, the CDC-recommended second-day 2-g tinidazole dose or 7-day 500-mg twice-daily metronidazole regimen can also be prescribed empirically to treat BV and TV. Women with a history of recurrent or persistent Candida infection can be prescribed a Day 4 and 7 fluconazole dose. Whether empirical or microscopy/point-of-care NAAT-directed treatment is preferred, a careful consideration of individual patient circumstances is crucial.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^112S4V3C]. BMC Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Many of the previous partner trials opted for single 2g doses of oral metronidazole to improve adherence, as adherence is essential to the success of any intervention. However, the short duration of activity of this single dose may have had limited impact on the male genital microbiota. Newer single-dose nitroimidazoles approved for the treatment of BV, such as 2g oral secnidazole, have similar efficacy to metronidazole but a longer half-life and thus may be more suited to partner treatment. Secnidazole and tinidazole have similar resistance patterns to metronidazole, and other drug classes or combinations of antimicrobials may be required to cover candidate BV pathogens.

Clindamycin, commonly used in women with a contraindication to nitroimidazoles but also used first-line, is a lincosamide antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive cocci as well as anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Clindamycin has been shown to have greater efficacy than the nitroimidazoles against A. vaginae, Gardnerella spp., and Mobiluncus spp., and planktonic clinical isolates of Gardnerella exhibit a relatively higher susceptibility rate and lower resistance rate to clindamycin compared to metronidazole. This suggests clindamycin may be more optimal for reducing the abundance of Gardnerella. While the effectiveness of metronidazole and clindamycin in clearing BVAB from women is still debated, data is needed to show if these agents are effective on BVAB in men.

New biofilm-disrupting agents, for example, dequalinium chloride and TOL-463, may offer additional treatment options. Further research into these agents is necessary to evaluate their effectiveness in partner treatment for bacterial vaginosis.

### Tindamax [^115hqpFE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Tinidazole is indicated for various treatments:

- **Indications and usage**: Tinidazole is approved for the following conditions:

	- **Trichomoniasis**: Tinidazole is used to treat trichomoniasis caused by *Trichomonas vaginalis*. Identification of the organism should be performed using appropriate diagnostic procedures. As trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious consequences, it is recommended that partners of infected patients also receive treatment to prevent re-infection [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

	- **Giardiasis**: Tinidazole treats giardiasis caused by *Giardia duodenalis* (also known as *G. lamblia*) in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

	- **Amebiasis**: Tinidazole is indicated for treating intestinal amebiasis and amebic liver abscess caused by *Entamoeba histolytica* in adults and pediatric patients older than three years. It is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic cyst passage [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)].

	- **Bacterial vaginosis**: It is used to treat bacterial vaginosis, formerly known as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis, in adult women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].

### Sexual intercourse association with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas vaginalis treatment in relationship to preterm birth [^115yhB2R]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether sexual intercourse was associated with the treatment efficacy or the incidence of preterm birth in two large randomized trials in which metronidazole treatment of bacterial vaginosis or Trichomonas vaginalis did not reduce preterm birth.

Secondary analysis of two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials was conducted in which women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis on Gram stain or asymptomatic T. vaginalis on culture were randomized at 16 to 23 weeks of gestation to receive metronidazole or a placebo. In both studies, women took 2 g of metronidazole or placebo in the presence of a nurse (first dose) and were given a second dose to take 48 hours later. This regimen was repeated (third and fourth doses) at 24 to 29 weeks. At the time of the third dose, bacterial vaginosis and T. vaginalis specimens were collected again. Patients who were randomly selected to receive metronidazole were analyzed for bacterial vaginosis and T. vaginalis at 24 to 29 weeks and for preterm birth of less than 37 weeks of gestation, according to intercourse between first and second doses and between the second and third doses. Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, while categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test, Fisher exact test, or the Mantel-Haenszel test of trend.

Sexual intercourse between the first and second doses or between the second and third doses did not influence the incidence of bacterial vaginosis (18% vs. 24%; relative risk, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–1.1) or T. vaginalis.

### Metronidazole is still the drug of choice for treatment of anaerobic infections [^1119nS5Y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Metronidazole has been used for the treatment of infections for over 45 years and is still successfully used for the treatment of trichomoniasis, amoebiasis, and giardiasis. Anaerobic bacterial infections caused by Bacteroides species, fusobacteria, and clostridia respond favorably to metronidazole therapy. Good clinical results in the treatment of vaginosis due to Gardnerella vaginalis have also been reported. Rates of resistance to metronidazole are still generally low; however, several studies have reported decreased susceptibility among Bacteroides species, as well as different mechanisms of resistance. Metronidazole-resistant Helicobacter pylori strains have been described, but combination therapy (e.g. metronidazole, amoxicillin, or clarithromycin plus omeprazole) is still recommended for eradication of this pathogen in patients with gastroduodenal ulcers. Metronidazole is considered to be a cost-effective drug because of its low cost, good activity against pathogenic anaerobic bacteria, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and minor adverse effects. Metronidazole is still the criterion standard for therapy of anaerobic infections, as was described by Tally and colleagues 35 years ago.

### Antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis or Trichomonas vaginalis in pregnancy: A systematic review [^115JC2T2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

To determine whether antibiotic treatment for bacterial vaginosis or Trichomonas vaginalis during pregnancy decreases the risk of preterm birth and associated adverse outcomes, a comprehensive search was conducted. Pre-MEDLINE and MEDLINE (1966–2003), EMBASE (1980–2003), and the Cochrane Library were searched using the keywords "bacterial vaginosis", "Trichomonas", "Trichomonas vaginalis", "Trichomonas vaginitis", "Trichomonas infections", "pregnancy", "pregnant", "antibiotics", and "antibiotic prophylaxis".

The search yielded 1,888 titles, with 1,256 abstracts reviewed further. Of these, 1,217 were found ineligible. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials comparing antibiotics with no antibiotics or placebo for women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, with symptomatic or asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis or Trichomonas vaginalis, intact membranes, and not in labor. Exclusion criteria included publications in non-English languages, dropout rates exceeding 20% in either group, and lack of usable outcomes. Of the 39 papers reviewed in detail, 14 studies were included in the meta-analysis.

One of the authors reviewed the titles obtained from the searches, and two reviewers independently reviewed the abstracts. They excluded those that were ineligible, identified eligible papers, and abstracted the data. For women with bacterial vaginosis, antibiotics reduced the risk of persistent infection but did not reduce the risk of preterm birth or the incidence of adverse outcomes.

### Impact of oral metronidazole treatment on the vaginal microbiota and correlates of treatment failure [^115gKorY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Metronidazole is the first-line treatment for bacterial vaginosis, but cure rates are suboptimal and recurrence rates are high.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the impact of a standard course of oral metronidazole treatment (500 mg twice per day for 7 days) on the vaginal microbiota of Rwandan bacterial vaginosis patients using microscopy and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and to evaluate correlates of treatment failure.

- **Study design**: HIV-negative, nonpregnant women aged 18–45 years with bacterial vaginosis and/or Trichomonas vaginalis (N = 68) were interviewed and sampled before and after metronidazole treatment. They were also screened, and treated if applicable, for other urogenital infections. The vaginal microbiota was assessed by Gram stain Nugent scoring, Illumina 16S rRNA HiSeq sequencing (relative abundances), and BactQuant 16S gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction (estimated concentrations). Only women with a pretreatment Nugent score of 7–10 and a valid posttreatment Nugent score (N = 55) were included in metronidazole treatment failure analyses, with treatment failure defined as a posttreatment Nugent score of 4–10.

- **Results**: The bacterial vaginosis cure rate by Nugent scoring was 54.5%. The mean total vaginal bacterial concentration declined from 6.59 to 5.85 log 10 /μL (P < 0.001), which was mostly due to a reduction in mean bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes concentration (all bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobe taxa combined) from 6.23 to 4.55 log 10 /μL (P < 0.001). However, only 16.4% of women had a bacterial vaginosis anaerobes concentration reduction.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: Results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^1117g5Bv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Statistical analysis assumes microbiological cure rates of 75% and 40% with secnidazole (SEC) and placebo, respectively. A sample size of 100 patients (50 patients per group) provided approximately 95% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups using a two-sided, two-sample comparison of proportions at the α = .05 level of significance. Considering an attrition rate of 30%, 144 patients needed to be randomly assigned to either SEC or placebo.

The primary efficacy endpoint was compared between the active and placebo treatment groups using a two-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. This test was stratified by the presence or absence of clinical symptoms of trichomoniasis at baseline, HIV status, and bacterial vaginosis (BV) status, with a significance level of α = .05. As required by the FDA and determined a priori, the primary efficacy analysis was based on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population. This population was defined as all randomized patients who had a positive T. vaginalis culture at baseline and negative chlamydia and gonorrhea nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) at baseline. Secondary efficacy endpoint analysis was based on the per protocol (PP) population, defined as patients in the mITT population who received their assigned study medication and had a test-of-cure (TOC) visit.

Post hoc efficacy analyses of the microbiological cure rate at TOC compared SEC- versus placebo-treated patients with trichomoniasis who were (1) symptomatic and asymptomatic, (2) infected with HIV, and (3) had BV at baseline. All analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).

Safety endpoints included the incidence, severity, and relationship to the study treatment.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^113vc9zU]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Secnidazole is substantially more expensive than metronidazole and tinidazole, well beyond the means of many women. Based on data accessed on March 1, 2025, for major chain pharmacies in multiple U.S. cities, the cost of metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days and a 2-g single-dose tinidazole is about $10; however, the cost of a 2-g single-dose secnidazole is approximately $300. Tinidazole is widely available in U.S. pharmacies and could be easily stocked in emergency departments. An author review of Medicaid Preferred Drug Lists (PDL), conducted in December 2024, indicates that tinidazole is included in 25 states presently, with nine additional states requiring prior authorization. Metronidazole is included in 44 states, while secnidazole is included in two states. Notably, five states have no publicly accessible online PDL, and 11 do not specifically address these treatments. Medicaid would cover the costs of emergency department testing and treatment, similar to many other insurances, through bundled payments, impacting the hospital's bottom line.

Regardless of the diagnostic and treatment approach to vaginitis, it is crucial to emphasize that a careful history regarding STI risk and a pelvic examination remain important. Vaginal discharge and discomfort can also be symptoms of gonococcal and chlamydial cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease, indicating that broader STI screening may be warranted. Unlike NAAT for vaginitis pathogens, gonococcal and chlamydial NAAT is relatively inexpensive and consistently covered by insurance. Additionally, laboratories are required to report these infections to local public health agencies, which helps ensure proper follow-up care.
