## Question

Cmv wart hand

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about what "CMV wart hand" means, how to diagnose and manage it, and how to differentiate it from HPV warts on the hand and other similar conditions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to consider whether "CMV wart hand" is a recognized medical entity or a misnomer. Then, I should review the causes of hand warts and which HPV types are typically involved. Next, I will look into the skin manifestations of CMV and whether it can cause wart-like lesions on the hand. After that, I should outline the diagnostic approach, including when to perform a biopsy and which additional tests can help distinguish between HPV, CMV, or HSV. Finally, I will review evidence-based treatments for HPV hand warts and CMV disease, and consider special situations such as immunosuppression and coinfections, making sure to check guideline-backed dosing and duration for CMV therapy when indicated.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. "CMV wart hand" is not a standard medical term. I need to ensure we are not conflating HPV verruca vulgaris of the hand with cutaneous CMV infection, which is a different, much rarer entity typically seen in immunocompromised hosts and not characterized by wart-like hyperkeratotic papules, so the phrase likely reflects confusion rather than a defined diagnosis [^113aJMc7] [^1111j9hX].

> Next, I should review the etiology of common hand warts. Common warts on the hands are caused by HPV, with cutaneous types such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 27, and 57 predominating in immunocompetent children and adults; they present as hyperkeratotic, rough papules or nodules that may be single or multiple and are usually asymptomatic but can be cosmetically bothersome or tender with trauma [^115cseP8] [^1162a246] [^116ggnf4].

> Now, I will examine whether CMV causes warts on the hand. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Cutaneous CMV disease typically manifests as ulcerations, papulopustules, or vascular-endothelial cytopathic changes rather than verrucous papules, and it is strongly associated with immunosuppression such as HIV/AIDS, transplant recipients, or advanced malignancy, so it does not produce classic wart-like lesions on the hand [^1111j9hX] [^112KHrK3] [^113mzLYf].

> Wait, let me verify a potential source of confusion. Case reports describe atypical exophytic HSV-2 lesions with concurrent CMV infection in immunosuppressed patients, which can mimic warts or tumors clinically. These are HSV/CMV coinfections rather than CMV "warts", reinforcing that CMV does not itself cause verrucous warts on the hand and that atypical herpesvirus lesions can be mistaken for HPV warts in the right clinical context [^114KPfdz].

> I will now outline the diagnostic approach for a hand lesion suspected to be a wart. Visual inspection is the primary diagnostic method for HPV warts, and biopsy is indicated if the diagnosis is uncertain, the lesion fails standard therapy, or if features raise concern for malignancy such as pigmentation, induration, fixation, bleeding, or ulceration; importantly, there is no role for HPV testing to diagnose or manage visible warts in this setting [^113XPQw8] [^114vnqWz].

> If CMV is a concern based on atypical features or host factors, I should double-check that tissue diagnosis is pursued. Histopathology with CMV immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization can identify characteristic large cells with cytoplasmic inclusions, and CMV PCR from tissue or blood supports the diagnosis; IHC reliably distinguishes CMV from HSV and VZV but cannot distinguish among the many HPV types, so HPV identification requires molecular methods when needed [^115QkZL3] [^1111j9hX] [^112KHrK3].

> Next, I should review evidence-based treatment for HPV hand warts. First-line therapy is topical salicylic acid, which shows a modest but significant benefit over placebo and may perform better on hands than feet; cryotherapy is commonly used and may be combined with salicylic acid for additive benefit, and other options like contact immunotherapy or intralesional antigens can be considered for recalcitrant lesions; in immunocompromised patients, response may be slower and recurrence more common, warranting patience and sometimes escalation of therapy [^116jCSKW] [^112uJZBU] [^113Rg1Rs] [^111p1cio].

> But wait, what if CMV cutaneous disease is actually present. I need to ensure antiviral therapy is aligned with guidelines for CMV end-organ disease. Induction with valganciclovir 900 mg orally twice daily for 14–21 days followed by maintenance 900 mg daily is standard for CMV retinitis and is extrapolated to other serious CMV disease contexts, with treatment duration often continuing until immune recovery in HIV, typically 3–6 months after sustained CD4 increases; severe disease may require IV ganciclovir initially, and cidofovir or foscarnet are reserved for refractory cases due to toxicity considerations [^1129mYfr] [^115xDttv] [^112yfFMc].

> Hold on, I should verify prevention and counseling points if CMV is in the differential. CMV is transmitted via body fluids, and consistent hand hygiene and barrier precautions are key; in people with HIV, counseling on CMV shedding in semen, cervical secretions, and saliva and recommending condom use during sexual contact can reduce exposure risk, although CMV is ubiquitous and prevention options are limited [^114965Sj] [^116qxztu].

> In summary, I need to ensure we are precise: "CMV wart hand" is a misnomer. Hand warts are HPV-related verrucae, whereas cutaneous CMV disease is uncommon, typically ulcerative or papulopustular, and largely confined to immunocompromised hosts. Accurate diagnosis relies on clinical judgment with biopsy and targeted virologic testing when atypical, and treatments diverge substantially, with salicylic acid and cryotherapy for HPV warts versus ganciclovir or valganciclovir for CMV disease when truly present [^115cseP8] [^1111j9hX] [^116jCSKW] [^1129mYfr].

CMV does not cause warts on the hands; warts are caused by HPV [^116qzHxT]. CMV can rarely cause **cutaneous ulcers or papules** [^1111j9hX], especially in immunocompromised patients, but these are distinct from warts and require biopsy with CMV immunohistochemistry for diagnosis [^113mzLYf] [^115QkZL3]. Hand warts are best managed with salicylic acid or cryotherapy [^116jCSKW]; CMV skin disease is treated with antivirals such as ganciclovir or valganciclovir [^117S11PY] [^114KPfdz]. Accurate diagnosis is essential to avoid mistaking CMV lesions for warts and to ensure appropriate therapy [^114KPfdz].

## Clinical features of CMV lesions on the hands

CMV **cutaneous lesions** are rare and atypical [^1111j9hX]; when they occur on the hands, they may present as:

- **Ulcerations**: Chronic, non-healing ulcers, often with undermined edges [^116we8zm].

- **Papules or nodules**: Firm, erythematous papules or nodules, sometimes with central necrosis [^112KHrK3].

- **Atypical features**: Lesions may be indurated, fixed, or pigmented, mimicking malignancy or other infections [^114KPfdz].

These lesions are most often seen in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV infection, transplant recipients, or individuals undergoing immunosuppressive therapy [^111XRUVL].

---

## Diagnostic methods for CMV lesions on the hands

Accurate diagnosis of CMV lesions on the hands requires a combination of clinical evaluation, histopathological examination, and virological testing:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed history and physical examination, focusing on immunocompromised status and lesion characteristics [^1112Gs4t].

- **Histopathology**: Skin biopsy demonstrating characteristic CMV cytopathic changes, including enlarged endothelial cells with intranuclear inclusions (owl's eye inclusions) [^113mzLYf].

- **Immunohistochemistry**: CMV-specific immunostaining confirms the presence of CMV antigens in tissue samples [^115QkZL3].

- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)**: Detection of CMV DNA in blood or tissue samples, useful for confirming active infection [^112KHrK3].

---

## Treatment options for CMV lesions on the hands

Treatment of CMV lesions on the hands primarily involves **antiviral therapy**:

- **Ganciclovir**: Intravenous ganciclovir is the first-line treatment for severe CMV disease, including cutaneous manifestations [^115xDttv].

- **Valganciclovir**: Oral valganciclovir is an effective alternative, particularly for outpatient management and maintenance therapy [^112yfFMc].

- **Foscarnet or cidofovir**: Reserved for refractory cases or ganciclovir-resistant CMV strains.

- **Supportive care**: Local wound care, pain management, and infection control measures are essential adjuncts to antiviral therapy [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence rates

The prognosis of CMV lesions on the hands depends largely on the patient's immune status and the timeliness of antiviral therapy. In immunocompromised patients, **recurrence is common**, particularly if immunosuppression persists or if antiviral therapy is discontinued prematurely [^1112Gs4t]. Immune reconstitution through antiretroviral therapy (ART) or reduction of immunosuppressive therapy significantly improves outcomes and reduces recurrence rates [^115Yfrx8].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention of CMV infection and its cutaneous manifestations involves:

- **Hand hygiene**: Regular handwashing, particularly in healthcare settings and among immunocompromised individuals [^115Yfrx8].

- **Safe sex practices**: Use of condoms to reduce sexual transmission of CMV [^114965Sj].

- **Screening and prophylaxis**: Regular screening for CMV in high-risk populations (e.g. transplant recipients) and prophylactic antiviral therapy when indicated [^115sz5ci].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

If left untreated, CMV lesions on the hands can lead to **chronic ulcerations**, secondary bacterial infections, and dissemination to other organ systems, including the retina, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system [^112KHrK3]. In immunocompromised patients, untreated CMV infection can result in significant morbidity and mortality [^111BWWq4].

---

## Current research and advancements

Recent research has focused on improving diagnostic methods, including rapid PCR assays and advanced immunohistochemical techniques [^115QkZL3]. Additionally, novel antiviral agents and immunotherapies are being investigated to enhance treatment efficacy and reduce recurrence rates [^1112Gs4t].

CMV does not cause warts on the hands; warts are caused by **HPV** [^116ggnf4]. CMV can rarely cause cutaneous ulcers or papules, especially in immunocompromised patients, but these are distinct from warts and require biopsy with **CMV immunohistochemistry** for diagnosis [^112KHrK3] [^115QkZL3]. Hand warts are best managed with salicylic acid or cryotherapy [^116jCSKW]; CMV skin disease is treated with antivirals such as **ganciclovir or valganciclovir** [^115xDttv] [^114KPfdz]. Accurate diagnosis is essential to avoid mistaking CMV lesions for warts and to ensure appropriate therapy [^114KPfdz].

Treatments include physical and chemical destruction, surgical removal, and biological response modifiers to enhance the natural immune response. The choice of therapy is an art, and depends upon patient preference, finances, number of lesions, and lesional morphology. However, the therapy of these lesions can sometimes be very painful and expensive, and therapy should not be worse than the disease.

### Human cytomegalovirus: clinical aspects, immune regulation, and emerging treatments [^1112Gs4t]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

After initial infection, human cytomegalovirus remains in a persistent state with the host. Immunity against the virus controls replication, although intermitent viral shedding can still take place in the seropositive immunocompetent person. Replication of cytomegalovirus in the absence of an effective immune response is central to the pathogenesis of disease. Therefore, complications are primarily seen in individuals whose immune system is immature, or is suppressed by drug treatment or coinfection with other pathogens. Although our increasing knowledge of the host-virus relationship has lead to the development of new pharmacological strategies for cytomegalovirus-associated infections, these strategies all have limitations-eg, drug toxicities, development of resistance, poor oral bioavailability, and low potency. Immune-based therapies to complement pharmacological strategies for the successful treatment of virus-associated complications should be prospectively investigated.

### Clinical overview of CMV and congenital CMV… [^117CqdfW]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Types CMV is a member of the herpesvirus family, which includes:

- Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2
- Varicella-zoster virus
- Epstein-Barr virus These viruses share a characteristic ability to establish lifelong latency. Once a person becomes infected, the virus remains latent and resides in cells without causing detectable damage or illness. CMV may reactivate occasionally. Reactivation of CMV infection rarely causes disease unless the person's immune system is suppressed due to therapeutic drugs or disease. How it spreads CMV is spread through:

- Contact with infectious body fluids
- Sexual contact
- Transplanted organs and blood transfusions
- Contact with the mother's genital secretions during delivery Although the virus is not highly contagious, it has been shown to spread among household members and young children in daycare centers. CMV infects people of all ages.

In the United States; nearly one in three children are infected with CMV by age five. Over half of adults have been infected with CMV by age 40, most with no signs or symptoms. CMV is transmitted by direct contact with infectious body fluids, such as urine, saliva, blood, tears, semen, and breast milk. CMV can be transmitted sexually and through transplanted organs and blood transfusions. Long-term health problems About 40 to 60% of infants born with signs of congenital CMV disease at birth will have long-term health problems. These can be:

- Hearing loss
- Developmental and motor delay
- Vision loss
- Microcephaly
- Lack of coordination or weakness
- Seizures Some babies may have hearing loss that may or may not be detected by newborn hearing test. Treatment and recovery No treatment is currently indicated for CMV infection in healthy people.

Antiviral treatment is used for people with compromised immune systems who have either sight-related or life-threatening illnesses due to CMV infection. Treat early Antiviral medications such as ganciclovir or valganciclovir may improve hearing and developmental outcomes in newborns with signs of congenital CMV. Ganciclovir can have serious side effects and has only been studied in infants with symptomatic congenital CMV disease. There is limited information on the effectiveness of ganciclovir or valganciclovir to treat infants with hearing loss alone.

### Circumscribed hypokeratosis: report on a series of 7 Mexican cases and review of the literature [^116khqPi]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2016). Low credibility.

Circumscribed palmoplantar hypokeratosis is a recently described condition with well-defined clinical and histopathologic features. Eight additional cases from Mexican patients-six cases have been published in the literature, we report 7. In 6 cases, a hyperkeratotic edge was demonstrated histologically. One case was very similar to viral wart. Two of our patients had lesions on their fingers. Since palms and soles are not the only sites that can be affected, we suggest the name circumscribed hypokeratosis. Two of the cases were treated with surgical excision, so this treatment for small lesions is recommended.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) disease — treatment of genital warts in adults and adolescents with HIV: Patient-applied options for uncomplicated external warts include topical imiquimod 5% cream applied at bedtime on three nonconsecutive nights per week for up to 16 weeks with wash-off 6–10 hours after application (BII), topical podophyllotoxin (e.g., podofilox 0.5% solution or 0.5% gel) applied twice a day for 3 days followed by 4 days off and repeated weekly for up to four cycles (BIII), topical sinecatechins 15% ointment applied three times a day for up to 16 weeks until warts are cleared (BIII), or topical cidofovir 1% used daily for 5 days per week for 6 weeks (CIII). Provider-applied options include cryotherapy repeated every 1–2 weeks for up to 4 weeks until lesions are no longer visible (BIII), trichloroacetic or bichloroacetic acid cauterization using 80–90% aqueous solution repeated weekly for up to 6 weeks (BIII), intralesional cidofovir 15 mg/mL with a maximum 1 mL per session repeated every 4 weeks for a total of 3–4 treatments (CIII), and surgical excision (BIII) or laser surgery (CIII) for external or anal warts. Intralesional interferon is usually not recommended (CIII), recurrence despite treatment is high in patients with HIV, and there is no consensus on oral wart therapy; surgery is most common for oral warts that interfere with function or for aesthetic reasons.

### Topical treatments for cutaneous warts [^116jCSKW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Viral warts are a common skin condition, which can range in severity from a minor nuisance that resolve spontaneously to a troublesome, chronic condition. Many different topical treatments are available.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of local treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts in healthy, immunocompetent adults and children.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to May 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2010), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), and CINAHL (from 1981). We searched reference lists of articles and online trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of topical treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials and extracted data; a third author resolved any disagreements.

Main Results

We included 85 trials involving a total of 8815 randomised participants (26 new studies were included in this update). There was a wide range of different treatments and a variety of trial designs. Many of the studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in one or more areas of trial design. Trials of salicylic acid (SA) versus placebo showed that the former significantly increased the chance of clearance of warts at all sites (RR (risk ratio) 1.56, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.20 to 2.03). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 5.01) and feet (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.55), suggested it might be more effective for hands than feet. A meta-analysis of cryotherapy versus placebo for warts at all sites favoured neither intervention nor control (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.23). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 15.94) and feet (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.07), again suggested better outcomes for hands than feet. One trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both placebo and SA, but only for hand warts. There was no significant difference in cure rates between cryotherapy at 2-, 3-, and 4-weekly intervals. Aggressive cryotherapy appeared more effective than gentle cryotherapy (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.15), but with increased adverse effects. Meta-analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in effectiveness between cryotherapy and SA at all sites (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.71) or in subgroup analyses for hands and feet. Two trials with 328 participants showed that SA and cryotherapy combined appeared more effective than SA alone (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.43). The benefit of intralesional bleomycin remains uncertain as the evidence was inconsistent. The most informative trial with 31 participants showed no significant difference in cure rate between bleomycin and saline injections (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.78). Dinitrochlorobenzene was more than twice as effective as placebo in 2 trials with 80 participants (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.26). Two trials of clear duct tape with 193 participants demonstrated no advantage over placebo (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.05). We could not combine data from trials of the following treatments: intralesional 5-fluorouracil, topical zinc, silver nitrate (which demonstrated possible beneficial effects), topical 5-fluorouracil, pulsed dye laser, photodynamic therapy, 80% phenol, 5% imiquimod cream, intralesional antigen, and topical alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid (which showed no advantage over placebo). We did not identify any RCTs that evaluated surgery (curettage, excision), formaldehyde, podophyllotoxin, cantharidin, diphencyprone, or squaric acid dibutylester.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from two new trials comparing SA and cryotherapy have allowed a better appraisal of their effectiveness. The evidence remains more consistent for SA, but only shows a modest therapeutic effect. Overall, trials comparing cryotherapy with placebo showed no significant difference in effectiveness, but the same was also true for trials comparing cryotherapy with SA. Only one trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both SA and placebo, and this was only for hand warts. Adverse effects, such as pain, blistering, and scarring, were not consistently reported but are probably more common with cryotherapy. None of the other reviewed treatments appeared safer or more effective than SA and cryotherapy. Two trials of clear duct tape demonstrated no advantage over placebo. Dinitrochlorobenzene (and possibly other similar contact sensitisers) may be useful for the treatment of refractory warts.

### Dirt under the finger-nails-more malignant than malignancy [^112AxaAB]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

A young boy developed steroid refractory GVHD post haploidentical transplant for relapsed B-ALL. He was on systemic immunosuppression with two immunosuppressants, and had history of CMV reactivation and tuberculosis. Eight months post-transplant, he was hospitalized with multi-drug-resistant gram-negative sepsis, and during the same episode, he developed penile lesions which progressed to dry gangrene of glans-penis. Fusarium grew in blood and penile lesions. On retrospective thinking, it was discerned that his onychomycoses were the probable cause of his penile lesions with hematogenous dissemination, as nails also grew Fusarium. This case highlights the need for a vigilant skin and nail examination in immunocompromised patients. This is important for two perspectives. First, cultures from potential colonized sources can help early identification and escalation of treatment. Secondly, appropriate precautions and treatment of superficial infections can help prevent dissemination.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) diagnosis — warts/condyloma in HIV — is made by visual inspection and can be confirmed by biopsy; biopsy is needed only if the diagnosis is uncertain, lesions do not respond to standard therapy, or warts are pigmented, indurated, fixed, bleeding, or ulcerated, and no data support the use of HPV testing for screening, diagnosis, or management of visible genital/oral warts or oral HPV disease in patients HIV infection.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115zJcNW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Varicella‑zoster virus (VZV) in immunosuppressed patients — serostatus and risk of zoster or dissemination: VZV is one of the 2 most frequent herpesviruses to cause cutaneous infection in immunosuppressed patients, and between 65% and 70% of adult patients are seropositive for VZV. Herpes zoster occurs most frequently during the first year following chemotherapy treatment or following receipt of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or a solid organ transplant (SOT). Depending on the intensity of treatment or type of transplant, 25%–45% develop dermatomal zoster, with a 10%–20% risk of developing dissemination without prompt and effective antiviral therapy.

### Gianotti-crosti syndrome as presenting sign of cytomegalovirus infection: a case report and a critical appraisal of its possible cytomegalovirus etiology [^115Gc7Rj]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Gianotti-Crosti syndrome (GCS) is a self-limiting exanthem of acute onset with a characteristic acral distribution, usually occurring in children. It is characterized by symmetric pink to red-brown papular or papulovesicular lesions that are a few millimetres in diameter, distributed on the face, buttocks and limbs. It may be accompanied by low-grade fever, hepato-splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. GCS is considered a unique cutaneous response to viral infection, mostly associated with hepatitis B virus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but other viruses, bacterial infections and recent immunizations may be inciting factors. We report a case of a 3-year-old girl presenting generalized, pruritic, papulovesicular eruption on the face and extremities for one month. In our case, GCS was related to cytomegalovirus (CMV) primary infection and may be considered the presenting sign of the infection.

### Atypical presentation of exophytic herpes simplex virus type 2 with concurrent cytomegalovirus infection: a significant pitfall in diagnosis [^114KPfdz]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2013). Low credibility.

We report 3 unusual cases of atypical exophytic cutaneous herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 with concurrent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in immunosuppressed patients and raise awareness to the significant clinical and pathologic challenges in establishing the correct diagnosis. In all the 3 cases, the lesions presented as fungating plaques and nodules with areas of superficial erosion. Initial clinical differential included genital warts, syphilis, versus cutaneous malignancy. All the 3 patients were referred to the dermatology clinic where a combination of cutaneous biopsies, viral cultures of the lesions, polymerase chain reaction, CMV antigenemia, and immunoperoxidase stains for CMV and HSV confirmed the diagnosis of HSV type 2 with concurrent CMV infection. All the 3 patients were treated with oral valganciclovir with significant improvement noted at the follow-up visit. In addition, we review the previously reported HSV/CMV cutaneous coinfection cases.

### Diagnosis… [^115Yfrx8]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

CMV is a member of the Herpesviridae family, which includes the Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, varicellazoster virus, and herpesvirus 6, 7, and 8. Primary infection is usually inapparent. As with other herpes viruses, CMV remains latent within the host, reactivating and shedding when the host's immune system is compromised. CMV is not highly contagious. It is contracted from close personal contact with people who excrete the virus in their body fluids. It also can be shed from the throat and uterine cervix. Initial infection in newborns and reactivation of the virus in immunocompromised persons can result in severe pathology. CMV also is a serious pathogen in patients who have received an organ transplant.

Family physicians are most likely to encounter CMV during the work-up of patients presenting with an infectious mononucleosis syndrome, acute hepatitis, or as an opportunistic infection in persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Infection Control The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend withdrawing children with known CMV infection from day care, because CMV is nearly universally present. Health care workers with known CMV infection need not be restricted from work, because strict handwashing and education about standard precautions can control transmission of CMV. The natural course of untreated CMV retinitis results in disease progression within approximately two weeks. Before HAART, therapy would only delay the progression of retinitis by two months in most patients treated with intravenous anti-CMV medications. For those treated with intravitreous ganciclovir implants, the progress of the disease could be delayed by seven months.

HAART is the cornerstone of therapy for preventing recurrent retinitis. 21 HAART can increase a patient's CD4 count and decrease the replicative abilities of CMV. The immunorestoration and protective benefits provided by HAART may cause pro-inflammatory complications, such as vitreitis and cystoid macular edema, which develop from an enhanced T-lymphocyte response to CMV. 19, 21 If a patient's retinitis remains stable with anti-CMV therapy and HAART restores the CD4 count to above 100 per mm 3 for a three- to six-month period, then it may be possible to stop anti-CMV therapy.

To the Editor. — Cutaneous manifestations of cytomegalovirus infection are rare. On the basis of characteristic CMV-induced cytopathic changes observed in skin biopsy specimens, a wide range of cutaneous lesions have been incriminated as specific manifestations of CMV infection. 1To evaluate the incidence of CMV-induced histopathologic changes and to determine the clinical characteristics of lesions presenting cytomegalic cells, skin biopsy specimens taken from a group of 10 patients with anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibodies and an active CMV extracutaneous infection were studied. The age of the patients ranged from 25 to 59 years. All patients were classified as being in group IV of the Centers for Disease Control's classification for patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

The CMV infection was demonstrated on the basis of the clinical criteria: 1552–1553.

External genital and anal warts — provider-applied and procedural treatments in adults and adolescents with HIV include TCA/BCA protocols and selected alternatives as follows: TCA and BCA (80% to 90%) are applied to warts and the treatment can be repeated weekly for up to 6 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible (BIII). Surgical treatments can be used for external genital and anal warts (BIII), and laser surgery is an option but is usually more expensive (CIII). Topical application of cidofovir has reported activity against genital warts (CIII), but no topical formulation is commercially available. Intralesional interferon has been used for genital warts but, because of cost, administration difficulty, and potential systemic side effects, it is not recommended for first-line treatment (CIII). Podophyllin resin may be an alternative provider-applied treatment, with strict adherence to recommendations on application, though its inconsistent potency and potential toxicity may limit routine use in clinical practice.

### Cutaneous infections caused by herpesviridae: a review [^1157uvtW]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The herpes family of viruses accounts for a significant proportion of human cutaneous disease. Although most episodes of viral infection can be diagnosed clinically, a small subset of these outbreaks will require biopsy for histologic interpretation and diagnosis. Most herpesviruses cause characteristic architectural and cytologic changes in the context of active infection, whereas the effects of some will not manifest until the future as malignant disease. Other infections may go unnoticed secondary to a lack of specific histologic findings. Because herpesviruses cause such a wide spectrum of cutaneous conditions, it is prudent that pathologists be aware of the varied clinical and histopathologic presentations so that these infections will not persist undiagnosed. Additionally, methods of virus detection will briefly be reviewed.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) disease — HIV-associated cervical and anal neoplasia risk: In the United States and Western Europe, women with HIV/AIDS have significantly higher rates of cervical cancer than the general population, and recent cohort data show a relationship between low CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count and cervical cancer risk. HIV infection and low CD4 cell count have been consistently and strongly associated with HPV infection and with precancerous cervical lesions, including low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and the precursor to cervical cancer, CIN 3. Higher rates of HPV infection and CIN are seen in adolescents with HIV, regardless of whether HIV was acquired vertically or horizontally. Among female adolescents with perinatal HIV infection, 30% had an abnormality on their first Pap test and genital warts had a cumulative rate of 12% by age 19 years. CD4 cell count has been related to risk of anal cancer, and high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) is more common in adults and adolescents who are HIV seropositive than in those who are HIV seronegative.

### Characteristics of cutaneous cytomegalovirus infection in non-acquired immune deficiency syndrome, immunocompromised patients [^1111j9hX]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Although cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is a severe complication among immunocompromised patients, its cutaneous features have not been frequently reported. As herpes simple virus (HSV) infection commonly develops in CMV skin lesions, a study is needed on the pathogenetic role of CMV in cutaneous lesion formation.

Objectives

The purpose of this study is to characterize the clinical and histopathological features of cutaneous CMV infection and to determine whether CMV plays a true pathogenetic role in cutaneous lesions, or if it is just an innocent bystander during HSV infection among non-AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), immunocompromised patients.

Patients and Methods

A total of nine human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients diagnosed with cutaneous CMV infection from July 1999 to February 2005 at Samsung Medical Center were analysed in terms of their clinical and histopathological characteristics. In addition, we examined for the co-presence of HSV by performing immunohistochemical analysis and polymerase chain reaction.

Results

All the patients were immunocompromised; five had haematological diseases and four were organ transplant recipients. The clinical and histopathological features were similar to those of previous studies of patients with AIDS. Multiple anogenital ulcerations were the most frequent cutaneous presentation (66.7%). Most cytopathic changes were found in the dermis, particularly within the vascular endothelial cells (77.8%) and macrophages (66.7%). However, the association of CMV with concurrent HSV infection was even lower than that seen in patients with AIDS. Only one patient revealed a co-existing cutaneous HSV infection.

Conclusions

In non-AIDS individuals, the cutaneous lesions from CMV infection showed similar clinical and histopathological features to those of patients with AIDS. However, skin lesions may not be highly associated with HSV, and CMV does seem to contribute to lesion development as a cutaneous manifestation among the CMV infected, non-AIDS, immunocompromised patients.

We report the case of a woman who developed melanotic macules on her fingers and elbow 16 years after the onset of pigmentation of her lips. This unusual feature of LHS in our patient was associated with irritant contact dermatitis and viral warts. Only two cases of an association with an inflammatory dermatosis have been reported previously in the literature.

### Viral warts in organ transplant recipients: new aspects in therapy [^115yvQhk]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The long-term success of organ transplantation depends on the prevention of allograft rejection and improvement in quality of life for the patients. This has been achieved through better immunosuppressive regimens with lower dosages and a new generation of immunosuppressive drugs. However, these immunosuppressive agents not only impair the patient's reactivity to the graft, but also to infectious organisms, thereby making them more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens. Because of this, organ transplant recipients are predisposed to epithelial malignancies and infections. The majority of transplant recipients will develop warts induced by human papillomavirus (HPV). Some of these viral warts may present with atypical histological features and may progress into squamous cell carcinomas. The risk for cutaneous cancers after transplantation is much higher than in the immunocompetent population. Current therapies for HPV-associated skin tumours mainly depend on the destruction of affected skin areas. These treatment modalities are of limited efficacy and are usually painful for the patients. A promising novel therapeutic agent is imiquimod, an immune response modifier. Clinical efficacy of imiquimod has been observed for different skin lesions, including viral warts in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112Ti9jJ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

CMV retinitis — clinical manifestations and progression: Retinitis is the most common clinical manifestation of CMV end-organ disease in people with HIV and presents as unilateral disease in two-thirds of cases, but ultimately progresses to bilateral in most affected people in the absence of therapy or immune recovery. Peripheral retinitis may be asymptomatic or present with floaters, scotomata, or peripheral visual field defects, whereas posterior retinal lesions, especially those impinging on the macula or optic disc, are associated with decreased visual acuity or central visual field defects. CMV retinitis is a full-thickness necrotizing retinal infection that typically produces fluffy, yellow-white retinal lesions, with or without intraretinal hemorrhage, and the most typical feature is the lesion border with tiny, dry-appearing, granular, dot-like "satellites" at the interface between infected and normal retina; vitreous humor inflammation is unlikely unless immune recovery with antiretroviral therapy (ART) occurs, blood vessels near lesions may appear sheathed, and lesions — particularly peripheral — may have only a granular appearance. In the absence of effective ART or specific anti-CMV therapy, retinitis lesions invariably enlarge; untreated lesions in severely immunodeficient people will involve the entire retina within 6 months, with movement of lesion borders at variable rates causing a characteristic "brushfire" pattern with granular leading edges advancing before an atrophic gliotic scar.

Abstract

Herpesvirus infection classically presents as a clustered, vesicular rash over mild erythema. However, unusual presentations may mimic tumors and be a potential pitfall. We describe the case of a 55-year-old HIV positive woman with this unusual manifestation of a common disease which was initially diagnosed as a benign neoplasm. Review of pathology revealed histologic features characteristic of this form of herpesvirus eruption. Awareness of this rare clinical and microscopic presentation is important to guide appropriate use of immunostains, prevent misdiagnosis, and promptly institute of antiviral therapy.

### Cutaneous cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in a patient with metastasized lung cancer [^112KHrK3]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing cutaneous cytomegalovirus (CMV) is difficult due to its rarity and diverse manifestations, and early recognition is crucial as it may indicate disseminated disease and a poor prognosis. We examined a 71-year-old Taiwanese male presenting with a 1-week history of progressive, painful papulopustules associated with superficial ulcers and thick yellowish crusts on the scalp. He had been diagnosed with stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma 6 weeks earlier, and the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFRI) erlotinib and radiotherapy had been started to treat brain metastases 1 month before he came to our clinic. Histopathological examination of a scalp lesion and ELISA and PCR testing of blood samples were indicative of disseminated CMV infection. Unfortunately, the patient passed away the day after his scalp biopsy, before the investigations confirmed the infection. We would like to highlight the importance of remaining vigilant for cutaneous CMV in end-stage cancer patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and recognizing how this potentially life-threatening viral infection can masquerade as a possible side effect of erlotinib.

### Pulsed dye laser and intralesional bleomycin for the treatment of recalcitrant cutaneous warts [^1171dFTy]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Viral warts are a common ailment. Clinicians often combine multiple treatments to boost efficacy. One such novel combination is pulsed dye laser with bleomycin intralesionally (PDL+BI), described for the successful treatment of single hand warts.

Objective

To evaluate PDL+BI for the treatment of poor prognosis hand and foot warts.

Study Design/Patients and Methods

This 4-year retrospective case series examined the efficacy of PDL+BI used consecutively on patients whose warts were treated with this modality alone. PDL 595nm was used in stacking mode to achieve hemorrhagic blistering prior to intralesional bleomycin (1mg/ml normal saline).

Results

Twenty cases (65% male, age 13–62, mean age 42) were identified. Two (10%) were immunocompromised. Twenty five percent of warts affected hands, 55% feet, 20% both. Thirty five percent were solitary > 1cm(2), 40% were multiple or mosaic verucae. The mean duration was 5.1 years (0.5–15). Seventy five percent received local anesthetic. Mean number of treatments was two. Post-operative pain varied from none to severe, sometimes causing difficulty in walking. Blistering and crusting disappeared after 17 days (range 7–42). Outcome had a mean follow-up of 24 months (3–53) with 60% complete response, 15% partial, 25% no response. Mean satisfaction level was 7 (range 0–10, 10 highest). Outcome was better with local anesthetic (complete response 75%) as it permitted more aggressive treatment. Patients that had both anesthetic and repeat treatment sessions experienced 92% complete response.

Conclusion

PDL+BI offers a novel method for treatment of recalcitrant warts, but local anesthetic and repeat treatments are recommended.

HPV-associated anogenital warts are known to be transmitted by sexual contact, with reported prevalences of 0% in non-abused pre-pubertal children, 1.7/1000 in children referred to a tertiary care hospital, and 1.8% in children with suspected sexual abuse; in one study of children with anogenital warts, 24% had an adult caregiver with a history of genital warts, 63% had a mother with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and 48% had a family member with extra-genital warts, suggesting non-sexual transmission as the route of infection. Incidence of JORRP in the United States is around 1.7 to 4.3 per 100,000.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Treating genital and oral warts in patients with HIV — "Patients with HIV infection may have larger or more numerous warts, may not respond as well to therapy for genital warts as individuals who are immunocompetent, and may have more frequent recurrences after treatment". "Genital warts are not life-threatening, and they may regress without therapy, even in patients with HIV, especially when immunity is relatively preserved". "Treatments are available for genital warts, but none are uniformly effective or uniformly preferred. Lacking RCTs specific to individuals with HIV infection, guidelines for the treatment of STDs in patients with HIV infection should be followed". "More than one treatment option may be required for refractory or recurrent lesions in patients with HIV infection. Histologic diagnosis should be obtained for refractory lesions to confirm the absence of high-grade disease. Intra-anal, vaginal, or cervical warts should be treated and managed by a specialist". "Patient-applied treatments are generally recommended for uncomplicated external warts that can be easily identified and treated by the patient". Imiquimod "(5% cream)… should be applied at bedtime on three non-consecutive nights per week, for up to 16 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible. The treated area should be washed with soap and water 6 to 10 hours after the application (BIII)". Podofilox "0.5% solution or gel should be applied to visible anogenital warts twice a day for 3 days, followed by 4 days of no therapy. This cycle can be repeated, as necessary, up to four times (BIII)". Sinecatechins "(15% ointment)… should be applied three times daily for up to 16 weeks, until warts are completely cleared and not visible (BIII). No clinical trials of this latter treatment option have been conducted in individuals with HIV infection". Provider-applied options include "cryotherapy, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), bichloroacetic acid (BCA), and surgery", typically recommended for complex or inaccessible lesions or based on preference. Cryotherapy "should be applied until each lesion is thoroughly frozen, with treatment repeated every 1 to 2 weeks, for up to 4 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible (BIII)", and "allowing the lesion to thaw and freezing a second time in each session (BIII)" is also recommended by some specialists.

### Clinical overview of CMV and congenital CMV… [^117S11PY]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Types CMV is a member of the herpesvirus family, which includes:

- Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2
- Varicella-zoster virus
- Epstein-Barr virus These viruses share a characteristic ability to establish lifelong latency. Once a person becomes infected, the virus remains latent and resides in cells without causing detectable damage or illness. CMV may reactivate occasionally. Reactivation of CMV infection rarely causes disease unless the person's immune system is suppressed due to therapeutic drugs or disease. How it spreads CMV is spread through:

- Contact with infectious body fluids
- Sexual contact
- Transplanted organs and blood transfusions
- Contact with the mother's genital secretions during delivery Although the virus is not highly contagious, it has been shown to spread among household members and young children in daycare centers.

Signs and symptoms Most healthy people, children, and infants who acquire CMV after birth have few symptoms and no long-term health complications from infection. Some people who acquire CMV infection may experience a mononucleosis-like condition with prolonged fever and hepatitis. Long-term health problems About 40 to 60% of infants born with signs of congenital CMV disease at birth will have long-term health problems. These can be:

- Hearing loss
- Developmental and motor delay
- Vision loss
- Microcephaly
- Lack of coordination or weakness
- Seizures Some babies may have hearing loss that may or may not be detected by newborn hearing test. Treatment and recovery No treatment is currently indicated for CMV infection in healthy people. Antiviral treatment is used for people with compromised immune systems who have either sight-related or life-threatening illnesses due to CMV infection.

Treat early Antiviral medications such as ganciclovir or valganciclovir may improve hearing and developmental outcomes in newborns with signs of congenital CMV. Ganciclovir can have serious side effects and has only been studied in infants with symptomatic congenital CMV disease. There is limited information on the effectiveness of ganciclovir or valganciclovir to treat infants with hearing loss alone.

Neutropenic patients with skin lesions — diagnostic evaluation and testing — Blood cultures should be obtained, and skin lesions in this population of patients should be aggressively evaluated by culture aspiration, biopsy, or surgical excision as they may be caused by resistant microbes, yeast, or molds (strong, moderate). The sensitivity of a single serum fungal antigen test is low particularly in patients receiving antifungal agents, and benefits from laboratory tests for fungal antigen or DNA detection remain inconsistent (strong, moderate). PCR in peripheral blood for HSV and VZV might be helpful in establishing a diagnosis of disseminated infection in patients with unexplained skin lesions (weak, moderate).

### Human cytomegalovirus-associated oral and maxillo-facial disease [^117Ph7P5]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Human cytomegalovirus is a ubiquitous pathogen with protean clinical manifestations. After initial infection, the virus remains in a persistent state in the host. Immunity plays a pivotal role in counteracting its virulence, albeit intermittent virus shedding occurs in immunocompetent individuals. Should deficiencies in immunity occur, e.g., as a consequence of AIDS or iatrogenic immunosuppression, then virus replication and subsequent pathogenic manifestations ensue. In the oral and maxillo-facial region, the virus causes a wide variety of diseases, mainly atypical chronic ulcerations and sialadenitis. These morbidities are rarely reported and sometimes cause significant problems for clinicians.

### Cytomegalovirus infections [^113aJMc7]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades, there has been an escalation in the number of patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy following solid organ or bone marrow transplantation, as well as a dramatic increase in the incidence of AIDS. As a result, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) — once considered a neonatal disease — has captured great interest and importance as a major pathogen in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Like other members of herpesviridae family, HCMV establishes latency in myeloid lineage cells with potential for reactivation. The natural history of HCMV infection can be divided into primary infection, latency, and reinfection. This review article briefly discusses the molecular pathogenesis of HCMV, then focuses on the clinical picture of this disease, with emphasis on the skin pathology. Diagnostic methods and treatments are also discussed.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114ka37R]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Anogenital warts in adults and adolescents with HIV — patient-applied treatments are recommended generally for uncomplicated external warts that can be identified easily and treated by the patient; imiquimod (5% cream) should be applied at bedtime on 3 nonconsecutive nights per week, for up to 16 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible, and the treatment area should be washed with soap and water 6 to 10 hours after the application (BII). Podofilox 0.5% solution or gel should be applied to visible anogenital warts twice a day for 3 days, followed by 4 days of no therapy, and this cycle can be repeated, as necessary, up to four times (BIII). Another option is sinecatechins (15% ointment), which should be applied three times daily for up to 16 weeks, until warts are cleared completely and not visible (BIII), although no clinical trials of this latter treatment option have been conducted in people with HIV. Topical application of cidofovir or intralesional cidofovir has reported activity against genital warts (CIII), but topical formulation is not commercially available and may be compounded in pharmacies with required equipment.

### Giant verruca vulgaris [^111RNoAR]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Common warts (verrucae vulgares) are hyperkeratotic papulonodules that are most often seen on the hands, arms, and legs, but they can be seen anywhere on the glabrous skin. Common warts represent the most frequent clinical lesions produced by the human papillomavirus (HPV).

Objective

Although they are diagnosed easily, giant, chronic, isolated, solitary, recalcitrant verruca vulgaris involving nail and nail bed on the digits can be misdiagnosed, and the differential diagnosis should be made carefully and verified by biopsies.

Method

A 50-year-old male patient had a giant periungual verruca vulgaris on his left second finger. It was present for 2 years, was unresponsive to any treatment modality, and was treated by surgical excision.

Results

After 18 months of follow-up, there was no evidence of recurrence, and both aesthetic and functional results were quite satisfactory.

Conclusion

Lesions of long duration generally lose their characteristic histopathologic features, and HPV cannot be detected in these lesions by polymerase chain reaction. Therefore, multiple sections should be examined histopathologically, and extreme care should be taken in order to avoid misdiagnosis.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) clinical manifestations in HIV include genital, anal, and oral warts; CIN; VIN; VAIN; AIN; anogenital squamous cell cancers; and cervical adenocarcinomas, and a subset of oropharyngeal cancers are also caused by HPV. Oral, genital (condyloma acuminata), and anal warts are usually flat, papular, or pedunculated growths, and lesions may measure a few millimeters to 1 to 2 cm in diameter; most warts are asymptomatic but can be associated with itching or discomfort, and in more severe immunosuppression, enlargement may cause dyspareunia or dyschezia. Intraepithelial neoplasias are often asymptomatic but may manifest with bleeding or itching, and related cancers may be asymptomatic or present with bleeding, pain, odor, or a visible/palpable mass.

### Management of cutaneous warts: an evidence-based approach [^116qzHxT]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Cutaneous warts are benign epidermal proliferations caused by human papillomavirus infection. Treatment aims to cure the patient's physical and psychological discomfort, and to prevent the spread of infection by contact with other body areas or with other individuals. Among the available medical and destructive therapeutic options for cutaneous warts, none is uniformly effective or virucidal. Moreover, in most cases the safety and efficacy of these treatment options has not been assessed in randomized controlled trials, so that the reproducibility of many of the listed treatments is difficult to evaluate and a possible placebo effect cannot be ruled out. This article provides indications for the management of patients with cutaneous warts through an evidence-based approach, considering a first-, second-, and third-line therapy for each clinical form. The first line includes medical treatments useful to cure single, or few, and/or small common warts of short duration (< 1 year). If these treatments have failed or are contraindicated, cryotherapy may be considered as second-line therapy. For recurrent or difficult-to-treat lesions, a third-line of therapy includes a variety of alternative therapeutic options that are in clinical use but are not necessarily approved by the US FDA, and their use may be further limited by adverse effects.

### Advances in antiviral therapy [^112kk6QN]. Dermatologic Clinics (2005). Low credibility.

Infections with five of the herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus 1 [HSV-1], HSV-2, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus) are treated with topical or systemic antiviral therapies. There are more than 100 genotypes of human papillomaviruses (HPVs), which may manifest as warts, skin cancers, cervical cancer, anogenital cancers, and upper digestive tract cancers. Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a common, benign viral infection of the skin. Immunomodulating agents, such as imiquimod, act on HPV and MC indirectly by inducing host immune responses, such as cytokines and cell-mediated immunity, and thereby reduce recurrences. There are multiple vaccines available for certain viral diseases and others in development for HSV-2 and HPV.

### Cutaneous cytomegalovirus infection on multi dermatomal herpes zoster scars: an isotopic immune response [^116we8zm]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

As more patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are surviving, despite severe immune suppression, clinicians are faced with atypical manifestations of both common and uncommon dermatoses. A 30-year-old black South African woman presented with a 10-month history of multiple chronic ulcers appearing on a multidermatomal herpes zoster (HZ) scar. The woman was infected with HIV, and her CD4 count was 45 cells/μL. Histology and PCR revealed cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This case highlights an unusual presentation of cutaneous CMV occurring as an isotopic immune response on a pre-existing multidermatomal HZ scar.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111k5vLB]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) in HIV — epidemiology and antiretroviral therapy (ART) associations — notes that more recent registry-based results have found significant decreases in cervical and anal cancer risk in men and women with HIV infection, while use of ART did not affect CIN rates in adolescents with perinatally or horizontally acquired HIV. The incidence of high-grade VIN was not reduced with ART use, even though rates of low-grade vulvar lesions and anal or genital warts did decrease with ART, and some but not other studies reported increased rates of oral warts following ART initiation. Overall, whether the burden of HPV-related cancers will decrease or even increase over time is difficult to gauge because the risk remains high relative to the general population, and increasing use of HPV vaccination in adolescents and young adults may begin to reduce the risk of HPV-associated cancers in persons with HIV infection in later life.

### Immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of cutaneous viral infections – part I. cutaneous viral infections by herpesviruses and papillomaviruses [^115QkZL3]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cutaneous viral infections are of increasing clinical importance, particularly in patients who are immunocompromised.

Objective

The use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the diagnosis of cutaneous infections provides a rapid morphological diagnosis and can be applied to confirm the diagnosis of specific viral infections that may be difficult to diagnose with certainty using routine microscopy alone, thus facilitating clinical decisions in patient care.

Methods

Several immunostains for specific viruses that have been useful in dermatopathology are reviewed. Emphasis is placed on new stains and novel uses of existing stains.

Results

This article is an up-to-date overview of the potential uses and limitations of IHC in the histopathologic diagnosis of cutaneous viral infections by herpesviruses and papillomaviruses.

Limitations

Whereas specific monoclonal antibodies effectively distinguish infections by herpes simplex virus-1, herpes simplex virus-2, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus, IHC does not distinguish between the 120 antigenically distinct strains of human papillomavirus.

Conclusions

IHC may assist dermatopathologists to appropriately diagnose viral infections caused by herpesviruses and papillomaviruses.

### Degos-like lesions as a cutaneous manifestation of cytomegalovirus infection: a rare and serious complication in a patient with drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome [^111BWWq4]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus causes a myriad of clinical features, potentially affecting any organ system, significantly increasing morbidity and even mortality. Vascular endothelial cell infection by cytomegalovirus has been implicated in the development of vasculopathy, possibly accounting for the clinical association between cytomegalovirus and vascular thrombosis. In contrast with visceral organ involvement, the cutaneous manifestations of cytomegalovirus are variable and rarely described. Malignant atrophic papulosis, commonly known as Degos disease, is an unusual small vessel arteriopathy with a pathognomonic clinical appearance of atrophic porcelain-white central papules surrounded by telangiectatic erythema. As with the arterial occlusive process, Degos disease may be idiopathic or secondary to autoimmune disorders or viral infection. All in all, cytomegalovirus-related Degos-like presentation has never been described. This report describes a case in which disseminated cytomegalovirus disease developed 4 weeks after the onset of drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome with prominent Degos-like skin lesions. Our case highlights a rare example of Degos-like lesions occurring due to cytomegalovirus disease and emphasizes the importance of early recognition of the characteristic cutaneous eruption as a diagnostic clue leading to the prompt management of this life-threatening infection.

### Viral venereal diseases of the skin [^11574DRW]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Viral venereal diseases remain difficult to treat. Human papilloma virus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) are two common viral venereal diseases. HPV infections are characterized by anogenital warts and less commonly by premalignant or malignant lesions. HSV infections classically present as grouped vesicles on an erythematous base with associated burning or pain; however, immunosuppressed patients may have atypical presentations with nodular or ulcerative lesions. This review discusses the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of anogenital HPV and HSV infections with an emphasis on treatment modalities for the practicing dermatologist. Diagnosis of these diseases typically relies on clinical assessment, although multiple diagnostic techniques can be utilized and are recommended when diagnosis is uncertain or evaluating an individual with increased risk of malignancy. Management of HPV and HSV infections involves appropriate counseling, screening, and multiple treatment techniques. Particularly for HPV infections, a practitioner may need to use a combination of techniques to achieve the desired outcome.

Genital warts treatment — Multiple treatments for HPV-associated skin and external genital lesions exist, but no one treatment is ideal for all patients or all lesions (CIII). Treatment can induce wart-free periods, but the underlying viral infection can persist, resulting in recurrence, and treatment modalities for external genital warts are the same for HIV-infected and -uninfected populations. Individuals who are immunosuppressed because of HIV may have larger or more numerous warts and may not respond as well; topical treatments may be ineffective in patients with larger or extensive lesions. Self-applied therapies include podofilox (0.5%) solution or gel, imiquimod (5%) cream, and sinecatechin ointment; provider-applied agents include trichloroacetic or bichloroacetic acid (TCA; BCA) (80%–90% aqueous solution). Other treatments include intralesional interferon-alfa (IFN-α) or 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]/epinephrine gel implant, and cidofovir topical gel (1%); cidofovir gel (1%) has been evaluated in a limited number of adults for anogenital HPV infection (CIII).

Warts are regularly treated by dermatologists, and while many respond readily to first-line treatments, others may represent a therapeutic challenge. Large, deep, numerous, and extensive warts; treatment-resistant lesions with higher risk for side effects, such as hypopigmentation; or patients unable to tolerate or comply with our treatment regimen, may need alternative treatment options. In this work we review the characteristics of select modalities that should be considered for difficult-to-treat warts. We discuss efficacy and tolerability data as well as practical features that can guide us to select the best treatment for every scenario. Novel approaches, still in an investigational phase, are also discussed to illustrate potential future directions of wart treatment.

### Genital warts and other HPV infections: established and novel therapies [^111Tkdjz]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Wart therapies involve methods of targeted lesion destruction, as well as selective immunologic modification. While there are several therapeutic options, no treatment has been proven to be superior in terms of clinical clearance or recurrence. Controlled trials comparing treatments are currently lacking. Many factors are used in the selection of treatment. Variables that should be taken into account include but are not limited to the morphology of the lesions such as thickness and size, quantity, anatomic location, human papilloma virus (HPV) classification, immunocompromized or immune competent status, as well as the preferences of the patient and the provider, cost and availability. No current treatment completely eradicates the human papillomavirus virus. The availability of vaccinations against HPV infection is contributing to the decreasing incidence of this disease. This contribution highlights conventional therapies, off-label treatment strategies including combination therapies, and prophylaxis for condylomata acuminata.
