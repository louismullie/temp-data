## Question

Why use lovenox over heparin for dvt profilaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why Lovenox (enoxaparin) is used instead of unfractionated heparin (UFH) for DVT prophylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic distinctions between enoxaparin and UFH and how those translate into practical advantages. Then, I should verify the comparative efficacy data in major prophylaxis populations: orthopedic surgery, general/abdominal surgery, and acutely ill medical patients. Next, I will examine safety, especially HIT and bleeding, and I should confirm monitoring requirements. After that, I need to consider operational and economic factors like outpatient feasibility and cost-effectiveness. Finally, I will review guideline positions and special populations where enoxaparin may not be preferred, and then synthesize a concise, clinically grounded conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic differences that matter clinically. Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin with predominantly anti–factor Xa activity, predictable subcutaneous bioavailability, and a longer half-life enabling once- or twice-daily dosing, whereas UFH has mixed anti-Xa/anti-IIa effects, variable pharmacokinetics, and requires intravenous infusion with frequent aPTT monitoring; importantly, LMWHs and UFH are not interchangeable unit-for-unit, so dosing must follow product-specific instructions [^1116UaWh] [^116VJ5AW] [^113Sm1Za].

> Now, I should review efficacy in orthopedic surgery, where baseline VTE risk is high. Wait, let me verify the directionality of benefit here: multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show enoxaparin regimens reduce VTE compared with UFH or placebo, and extended prophylaxis after hip replacement further lowers DVT rates. For example, extended enoxaparin 40 mg daily for 3 weeks post-discharge reduced total and proximal DVT versus placebo, and in arthroplasty trials, enoxaparin has outperformed comparators like ximelagatran, reinforcing its effectiveness in this setting [^115WykGD] [^1157p6pw] [^113s39Jq].

> Next, I will examine general and abdominal surgery. Hold on, I should verify whether enoxaparin is equivalent or superior to UFH here. In colorectal and cancer surgery populations, enoxaparin 40 mg once daily has shown comparable efficacy to UFH 5000 units every 8 hours, with similar major bleeding, supporting enoxaparin's role as an effective once-daily alternative in these surgical patients [^1112jBJz] [^111E8Xdu] [^111w3oak].

> For acutely ill medical patients, I need to check whether enoxaparin reduces clinically meaningful VTE. The MEDENOX program demonstrated that enoxaparin 40 mg daily significantly reduced VTE versus placebo in medically ill patients, and an individual patient data meta-analysis found enoxaparin reduced total and symptomatic VTE versus UFH without increasing major bleeding; however, wait, I should double-check a newer trial: SYMPTOMS in older medical inpatients did not show superiority of enoxaparin over placebo for symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death at 30 days, reminding me that population, dose, and endpoint definitions can shift results, so I should be cautious in overgeneralizing here [^111nkMZH] [^112ePhvK] [^112hhQCE].

> I will now examine safety, especially HIT. Let me verify comparative HIT risk: enoxaparin has a lower risk of immune-mediated HIT than UFH, and UFH carries about a 2–3% risk in some contexts, whereas LMWHs are roughly one-tenth of that. Importantly, enoxaparin is contraindicated in patients with recent HIT or circulating antibodies, so I need to ensure HIT history is screened before use [^116ZfwMq] [^115SYKyv] [^113zzJub].

> Next, I should review bleeding risk. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: across multiple prophylaxis trials, enoxaparin and UFH generally have similar rates of major bleeding, with any small differences often not statistically significant. For example, in colorectal surgery, major bleeding did not differ between enoxaparin and UFH, and in medical patient meta-analyses, enoxaparin reduced VTE without increasing major bleeding versus UFH, supporting a favorable or at least comparable safety profile in prophylaxis doses [^111E8Xdu] [^112ePhvK].

> I need to ensure I address monitoring and operational considerations. Enoxaparin's predictable pharmacokinetics allow fixed-dose subcutaneous administration without routine lab monitoring in most patients, whereas UFH infusion requires aPTT checks and pump setup; this operational simplicity facilitates early mobilization, earlier discharge, and outpatient prophylaxis, which has been demonstrated in trials allowing home therapy with enoxaparin and in real-world practice patterns [^116VJ5AW] [^114vPXXP] [^115WykGD].

> Let me consider cost and resource utilization. Initially, I thought UFH is always cheaper and therefore preferable where resources are constrained; wait, I should verify total cost analyses. Several studies show that while UFH has lower drug acquisition cost, enoxaparin can reduce length of stay and VTE-related complications, yielding lower total hospital costs; in trauma, a randomized trial suggested UFH every 8 hours might be noninferior and far less costly than enoxaparin, but the study was underpowered for key endpoints and expert guidance still favors enoxaparin in high-risk trauma, so I should be cautious about substituting solely on drug price [^113RiiH6] [^113VFuPg] [^114AGLLi].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor practice. Major guidelines endorse LMWH or UFH for VTE prophylaxis in medical and surgical patients, with many favoring LMWH for convenience and possibly lower HIT risk. ASH guidance for hospitalized patients supports pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH or UFH, balancing benefits and harms, and ACCP guidance details LMWH pharmacology and practical dosing without routine monitoring in most adults [^112FJbRp] [^1116UaWh] [^113Sm1Za].

> But wait, what about special populations where enoxaparin may not be preferred. In severe renal impairment, UFH is often preferred because enoxaparin is renally cleared and can accumulate; in patients with recent HIT or circulating antibodies, enoxaparin is contraindicated; in obesity or critical illness, standard enoxaparin doses may be subtherapeutic by anti-Xa levels, prompting weight-based or anti-Xa–guided dosing strategies, though clinical outcome benefits of anti-Xa targeting remain uncertain; in neuraxial anesthesia, both agents carry a boxed warning for epidural/spinal hematoma, so timing and risk mitigation are essential [^116VJ5AW] [^115SYKyv] [^113dXqBn] [^117DRwJ8] [^1178Aocg].

> Let me synthesize the clinical rationale succinctly. Enoxaparin is preferred over UFH for DVT prophylaxis in many settings because it provides at least equivalent and often superior efficacy in high-risk orthopedic populations, comparable efficacy in general and abdominal surgery, and meaningful VTE risk reduction in acutely ill medical patients, while offering a lower HIT risk, no routine monitoring for most patients, simpler outpatient administration, and favorable or comparable total costs when complications are considered. UFH remains valuable when rapid reversibility, severe renal impairment, or cost constraints predominate, and the two are not interchangeable in dose [^115WykGD] [^1112jBJz] [^112ePhvK] [^116ZfwMq] [^116VJ5AW] [^113RiiH6].

---

Lovenox (enoxaparin) is preferred over unfractionated heparin (UFH) for DVT prophylaxis because it provides **equivalent or superior efficacy** with **predictable pharmacokinetics** [^1116UaWh], enabling fixed-dose subcutaneous administration without routine lab monitoring [^113Sm1Za]. Lovenox has a **lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)** [^111W5Qca] and allows once-daily dosing, improving adherence and enabling outpatient use [^114vPXXP]. UFH is reserved for patients with severe renal impairment, high bleeding risk, or when rapid reversal is needed, as Lovenox is renally cleared and has a longer half-life [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological differences

| **Parameter** | **Enoxaparin (Lovenox)** | **Unfractionated heparin (UFH)** |
|-|-|-|
| Molecular weight | Low (≈4,500 Da) | High (≈15,000 Da) |
| Half-life | Longer (≈4–6 h) | Shorter (≈1–2 h) |
| Bioavailability | High and predictable after SC injection | Low and variable |
| Elimination | Renal | Hepatic/renal |
| Monitoring | Routine monitoring not required | Frequent aPTT monitoring required |
| Dosing | Fixed SC doses (once or twice daily) | IV infusion or SC q8–12h |

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Orthopedic surgery**: Lovenox 30 mg SC q12h or 40 mg SC q24h significantly reduces DVT/PE after hip/knee replacement, with extended prophylaxis further lowering VTE [^113s39Jq] [^115WykGD].

- **Abdominal surgery**: Lovenox 40 mg SC q24h is comparable to UFH 5,000 U SC q8h for DVT prevention [^1112jBJz].

- **Medical patients**: Lovenox 40 mg SC q24h reduces VTE in acutely ill medical patients [^111nkMZH] [^112ePhvK].

- **Treatment of DVT/PE**: Lovenox 1 mg/kg SC q12h or 1.5 mg/kg SC q24h is equivalent to UFH for recurrent VTE prevention [^1142aXTo] [^115vwU4Y].

---

## Safety profile

- **Bleeding risk**: Similar major bleeding rates to UFH in prophylaxis and treatment settings [^115vwU4Y] [^111E8Xdu].

- **HIT risk**: Lower HIT risk than UFH due to less platelet activation [^111W5Qca].

- **Osteoporosis**: Lower risk than UFH with prolonged use.

---

## Practical advantages

- **Administration**: SC injection allows outpatient/home use; UFH typically requires IV infusion or frequent SC dosing [^116VJ5AW].

- **Monitoring**: No routine lab monitoring needed for most patients; UFH requires frequent aPTT checks [^113Sm1Za].

- **Adherence**: Once-daily dosing improves adherence vs UFH's multiple daily doses.

---

## Limitations and considerations

Lovenox is renally cleared, so **dose adjustment or avoidance is needed in severe renal impairment**; UFH is preferred in this setting [^notfound]. Its longer half-life means slower reversal if bleeding occurs; UFH can be rapidly reversed with protamine. Cost is higher than UFH, though total costs may be lower due to fewer monitoring needs and shorter hospital stays [^113RiiH6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ASH and ACCP recommend LMWH (including Lovenox) over UFH for most patients needing pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, except when rapid reversal is required or in severe renal impairment [^1116UaWh].

---

Lovenox is preferred for DVT prophylaxis because it offers **predictable PK**, fixed SC dosing, no routine monitoring, lower HIT risk, and strong efficacy across settings, while UFH is reserved for specific scenarios like severe renal impairment or when rapid reversal is needed.

### An open-label, comparative study of the efficacy and safety of once-daily dose of enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin in the treatment of proximal lower limb deep-vein thrombosis [^111MyZoB]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) with a once-daily regimen of enoxaparin, rather than a continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is more convenient and allows for home care in some patients. This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of these two regimens for the treatment of patients with proximal lower limb DVT.

Methods

201 patients with proximal lower limb DVT from 13 centers in Brazil were randomized in an open manner to receive either enoxaparin [1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous (s.c.) OD] or intravenous (i.v.) UFH (adjusted to aPTT 1.5–2.5 times control) for 5–10 days. All patients also received warfarin (INR 2–3) for at least 3 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent DVT (confirmed by venography or ultrasonography), and safety endpoints included bleeding and serious adverse events. The rate of pulmonary embolism (PE) was also collected. Hospitalization was at the physician's discretion.

Results

Baseline patient characteristics were comparable between groups. The duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter with enoxaparin than with UFH (3 versus 7 days). In addition, 36% of patients receiving enoxaparin did not need to be hospitalized, whereas all of the patients receiving UFH were hospitalized. The treatment duration was slightly longer with enoxaparin (8 versus 7 days). There was a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in the rate of recurrent DVT with enoxaparin versus UFH, and similar safety.

Conclusions

A once-daily regimen of enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous is at least as effective and safe as conventional treatment with a continuous intravenous infusion of UFH. However, the once daily enoxaparin regimen is easier to administer (subcutaneous versus intravenous), does not require aPTT monitoring, and leads to both a reduced number of hospital admissions and an average 4-day-shorter hospital stay.

WARNING: SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMAS

Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients who are anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or heparinoids and are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:

Use of indwelling epidural catheters
Concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, and other anticoagulants
A history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures
A history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery
Optimal timing between the administration of Lovenox and neuraxial procedures is not known

Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary.

Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].

### Fondaparinux for prevention of venous thromboembolism in major orthopedic surgery [^112AkzmN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review clinical information related to fondaparinux, a synthetic pentasaccharide recently approved for the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgeries and for extended DVT prophylaxis after hip fracture surgery.

Data Sources

Primary and review articles were identified by MEDLINE (1983-June 2003) using the key words pentasaccharide, Org31540, SR90107A, DVT prophylaxis, and fondaparinux. Additional sources were found listed in articles, abstracts, and unpublished data on file from the manufacturer. Articles selected were based on their coverage of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of fondaparinux.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All of the articles identified were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included.

Data Synthesis

Fondaparinux is a selective antithrombin-dependent, indirect inhibitor of activated factor Xa. It has a favorable and predictable pharmacokinetic profile when administered subcutaneously, and has a long half-life, allowing once-daily dosing. Fondaparinux lacks in vitro cross-reactivity with heparin-induced antibodies. Major Phase III studies have demonstrated that subcutaneous fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg given at least 6 hours postoperatively resulted in a 55% reduction in the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, total hip replacement surgery, or knee replacement surgery compared with standard enoxaparin therapy. It has a safety profile similar to that of enoxaparin with respect to clinically relevant major bleeding, including fatal bleeding, nonfatal bleeding, and bleeding requiring repeat surgery. The use of fondaparinux for prolonged prophylaxis after hip fracture has demonstrated further reduction in VTE events without increasing the risk of bleeding.

Conclusions

Fondaparinux is the first of a new class of synthetic factor Xa inhibitors that demonstrated greater efficacy compared with enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE in major orthopedic surgery without an increase in clinically relevant bleeding. Given the favorable cost-effectiveness analysis and improved efficacy profile, fondaparinux should be considered for formulary addition for DVT prophylaxis in patients undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery. In patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, fondaparinux should be considered the DVT prophylaxis of choice. Extended thromboprophylaxis up to 28 days resulted in additional reduction in VTE (both symptomatic and venography-proven DVT) in patients with hip fracture surgery.

### Evaluation of the pharmacological properties and clinical results of the synthetic pentasaccharide (fondaparinux) [^1167FFR8]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

Fondaparinux (Arixtra) is the first of a new class of selective indirect antithrombin-dependent factor Xa inhibitors, which inhibits thrombin generation. Fondaparinux is a completely synthetic pentasaccharide. It is a single molecular entity with a well-defined pharmacological target. Fondaparinux has nearly complete bioavailability after subcutaneous injection. The pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux appears predictable and consistent. The peak plasma level is obtained about 2 h after the subcutaneous injection, indicating that a rapid onset of antithrombotic activity is obtained on initiation of treatment. The elimination half-life is about 17 h and it is dose-independent, which allows a convenient once-daily dosing regimen. Fondaparinux is eliminated exclusively by the kidneys. Thus, the estimation of the renal function especially in elderly patients is important for the treatment with fondaparinux, whereas it is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Phase II clinical studies have identified a subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mg once daily for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery. Four phase-III clinical trials using bilateral phlebography for the diagnosis of DVT, demonstrated a combined 50% relative risk reduction of asymptomatic venous thromboembolic events in orthopaedic surgery patients in comparison to the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin. Hemorrhagic complications for fondaparinux were either comparable or higher than those for LMWH but the authors did not judge that the increased bleeding was clinically relevant. A dose ranging study led to the selection of the dose of 7.5 mg at a single daily subcutaneous injection as optimal for the treatment of VTE. In two phase III clinical trials, the dose of 7.5 mg/day is expected to be as efficacious and safe as heparin for the treatment of DVT or PE, respectively. Phase II studies show that the efficacy-to-safety ratio of fondaparinux in the treatment of unstable angina or as an adjunct to thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction is promising. These results demonstrated that a single anti-Xa agent devoid of antithrombin activity is a potent antithrombotic drug. Fondaparinux has obtained FDA and European health authorities approval. Its use on a large scale will allow the evaluation of its efficacy and tolerance in the daily clinical practice. Chemical modifications of the original synthetic pentasaccharide increase the affinity to AT resulting in a more potent inhibition of FXa and longer half-life. Idraparinux is the first of these new oligosaccharides that we named "meta-pentasaccharides". After subcutaneous injection the half-life of idraparinux is about 80 h allowing a single injection per week. A dose-finding study has established the optimal dose given once a week to be compared with warfarin for the treatment of DVT.

### Comparing venous thromboembolism prophylactic agents after hip fracture surgery: a national database study [^116Kf72j]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of thromboprophylaxis after surgery for hip fracture is the standard of care to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The use of thromboprophylaxis has markedly reduced both short-term and long-term VTE rates after hip fracture surgery from upward of 80% in the past to 1% to 6% in recent years.

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is commonly used as VTE prophylaxis and has been shown in various orthopaedic procedures to have relatively low complication profiles compared with alternatives such as fondaparinux, unfractionated heparin, aspirin, and adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonists. Lovenox (enoxaparin) is a commonly used LMWH with anti-Factor Xa activity to prevent thrombosis given as a parenteral injection once or twice daily.

Newer agents, such as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), have been introduced as potential alternatives to LMWH with the added benefits of oral administration and fewer drug-drug interactions. Eliquis (apixaban) is a commonly used DOAC that inhibits Factor Xa to prevent VTE, although it is currently only approved for prevention of VTE after total hip or knee arthroplasty and not specifically for acute trauma situations. The potential benefits of DOACs are particularly appealing for the geriatric population, where ease of administration is a major consideration; blood levels do not need to be checked; and administration does not require frequent dosing adjustments (as is often the case with Coumadin administration).

Few studies have directly compared the effectiveness of DOACs after hip fracture surgery with traditionally used agents such as LMWH. In a subanalysis of two large clinical trials (FAITH and HEALTH), most patients after hip fracture surgery received Lovenox (> 70%), whereas only 2% were given DOACs, highlighting the limitations in the existing literature for examining the efficacy of DOACs after hip fracture surgery. Comparative analyses between agents were not conducted.

Rivaroxaban — clinical use and evaluated doses: "Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor and is currently approved in many countries, including the United States, for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement surgery". Development includes "the treatment of VTE and the prevention of acute ischemic stroke in patients with AF". In phase III trials it was "more effective than the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin" for postoperative VTE prevention and "more effective than placebo" for secondary prevention after an initial "6- to 12-month" anticoagulation course. "The doses evaluated were 10 mg once daily in major orthopedic surgery and 20 mg once daily in the long-term secondary prevention of VTE".

5.4 Risk of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia with or without Thrombosis

Enoxaparin sodium may cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITTS). HITTS may lead to organ infarction, limb ischemia, or death. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely.

Use of enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of immune-mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in the presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Circulating antibodies may persist for several years.

Only use enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of HIT if more than 100 days have elapsed since the prior HIT episode and no circulating antibodies are present. Because HIT may still occur in these circumstances, the decision to use enoxaparin sodium in such a case must be made only after a careful benefit-risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments are considered.

5.5 Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of enoxaparin sodium.

Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm3and 50,000/mm3) occurred at a rate of 1.3% in patients given enoxaparin sodium, 1.2% in patients given heparin, and 0.7% in patients given placebo in clinical trials.

Platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3occurred at a rate of 0.1% in patients given enoxaparin sodium, in 0.2% of patients given heparin, and 0.4% of patients given placebo in the same trials.

Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3, enoxaparin sodium should be discontinued.

5.6 Interchangeability with other Heparins

Enoxaparin sodium cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with heparin or other low molecular weight heparins as they differ in manufacturing process, molecular weight distribution, anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, units, and dosage. Each of these medicines has its own instructions for use.

### Thrombosis prophylaxis in the acutely ill medical patient: insights from the prophylaxis in MEDical patients with ENOXaparin (MEDENOX) trial [^117GgsN8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2000). Low credibility.

The clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of routine thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients has been well documented, but use of this approach in general medical patients remains controversial. Following is an overview of major insights from the prophylaxis in Medical patients with Enoxaparin (MEDENOX) trial, which was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of 2 dosage regimens of the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin for prevention of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill medical patients. MEDENOX was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, which enrolled 1,102 hospitalized patients from 68 centers in 9 countries. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 40 mg of enoxaparin, 20 mg of enoxaparin, or placebo, given subcutaneously once a day for 6–14 days. The primary outcome was venous thromboembolism (deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) between days 1 and 14. At the 40-mg dose, the risk of venous thromboembolism was significantly reduced in patients with heart failure, as well as in patients with other medical illnesses, including respiratory failure, infectious disease, or rheumatic disorders. The incidence of venous thromboembolism was 5.5% in the group that received 40 mg of enoxaparin as compared with 14.9% in the group that received placebo (p < 0.001), a benefit that was maintained at 3-month follow-up. There was no significant difference in the incidence of venous thromboembolism between the group that received 20 mg of enoxaparin (15%) and the placebo group. Adverse effects did not significantly differ between the placebo group and either enoxaparin group. This study clearly establishes an effective strategy for lowering the risk of venous thromboembolism in the acutely ill population and provides a framework for future trials in this area.

### Enoxaparin in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^11144R41]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Low-molecular-weight heparins have been compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) for treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, a comparison of their efficacy in the presence or absence of pulmonary embolism (PE) has not been studied. We estimated the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin vs UFH in patients with proximal DVT with/without symptomatic PE using a meta-analysis of individual data from randomized controlled trials.

Design and Setting

Randomized controlled trials were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, abstracts from international meetings on venous thromboembolism (VTE), previous meta-analyses, and trial data provided by the sponsor.

Participants

For inclusion, randomized controlled trials had to be properly randomized; include patients with objectively diagnosed DVT; compare enoxaparin twice daily with UFH; use objective methods to assess recurrent symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, and death at 3 months; and include blind evaluation of clinical events.

Measurements

A meta-analysis was performed using the logarithm of the relative risk (RR) method. Enoxaparin in DVT treatment with/without symptomatic PE was considered noninferior to UFH for preventing VTE at 3 months if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the RR (enoxaparin/UFH) was lower than a prespecified noninferiority margin (1.61). No increase in major bleeding or mortality should be observed.

Results

The meta-analysis included individual data from three randomized controlled trials (749 patients and 754 patients in the enoxaparin and UFH groups, respectively). The observed RR (enoxaparin/UFH) of VTE was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.52 to 1.26) for the intention-to-treat population (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.13; for per-protocol analysis). Results did not differ for patients with clinical PE (235 patients; RR, 0.84) and without clinical PE (1,268 patients; RR, 0.71), with a nonsignificant heterogeneity test between groups (p = 0.76). A trend in favor of enoxaparin was observed for reduced mortality and major bleeding.

Conclusions

The efficacy and safety of enoxaparin vs UFH for DVT treatment is not modified by the presence of symptomatic PE.

### Enoxaparin sodium [^1178v7kk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Similarly, in a multicenter, open-label, parallel group study, patients with acute proximal DVT were randomized to enoxaparin sodium or heparin. Patients who could not receive outpatient therapy were excluded from entering the study. Outpatient exclusion criteria included the following: inability to receive outpatient heparin therapy because of associated comorbid conditions or potential for non-compliance and inability to attend follow-up visits as an outpatient because of geographic inaccessibility. Eligible patients could be treated in the hospital, but ONLY enoxaparin sodium patients were permitted to go home on therapy (72%). A total of 501 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 96 years (mean age 57.8 years) with 60.5% men and 39.5% women. Patients were randomized to either enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously or heparin intravenous bolus (5,000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion administered to achieve an aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds (in-patient treatment). All patients also received warfarin sodium as described in the previous study. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days. Enoxaparin sodium was equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 22).

### Parenteral anticoagulants: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1116UaWh]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) — derived from unfractionated heparin (UFH) by chemical or enzymatic depolymerization — are described as having reduced inhibitory activity against thrombin relative to factor Xa, a more favorable benefit-to-risk ratio than heparin in animal models, use to treat VTE, and superior pharmacokinetic properties. Structurally, LMWHs are about one-third the molecular weight of UFH, with a mean molecular weight of 4,000 to 5,000 — which corresponds to about 15 saccharide units — and a range of 2,000 to 9,000. Because different depolymerization methods yield agents with differing properties and recommended dosing, these drugs are not interchangeable on a unit-for-unit basis. Preparation methods include: Bemiparin — Alkaline degradation; Dalteparin (Fragmin) — Nitrous acid depolymerization; Nadroparin calcium (Fraxiparine) — Nitrous acid depolymerization; Enoxaparin sodium (Lovenox/Clexane) — Benzylation followed by alkaline depolymerization; Tinzaparin (Innohep) — Enzymatic depolymerization with heparinase; and Danaparoid sodium (Orgaran) — Prepared from animal gut mucosa; contains heparan sulfate (84%), dermatan sulfate (12%), and chondroitin sulfate (4%).

### Use of prestudy heparin did not influence the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in patients treated for symptomatic venous thromboem-bolism in the EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies [^111MA58Y]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Rivaroxaban is an oral factor Xa inhibitor that has a peak anticoagulant effect within 2 to 4 hours after dosing and predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that obviate the need for routine anticoagulation laboratory monitoring. 1, 2 Rivaroxaban has been shown to be associated with a dose‐dependent inhibition of factor Xa activity across all doses investigated, 1, 2, 3, 4 and maximum inhibition did not vary significantly between initial and steady‐state administration. 2 The onset of action of rivaroxaban is as rapid as that of low‐molecular‐weight heparins (LMWHs). 5 Consequently, rivaroxaban has been evaluated in phase III studies as a fixed‐dose monotherapy without an initial course of heparin for the treatment of acute symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or both. 6, 7

In patients with symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE), an initial course of therapeutic heparin for at least 5 days is required to cover the slow onset of action of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy. 8 Patients who do not reach therapeutic levels of anticoagulation within 48 hours of commencing heparin show an increased risk of recurrent VTE (relative risk of 4.5). 9 At 3 months, the incidence of recurrent VTE has been shown to range between 16 and 25% in patients not receiving initial heparin and those who receive inadequate heparin doses. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

In the EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies, 6, 7, 14 patients with confirmed acute symptomatic DVT and/or PE were treated with the combination of body weight–adjusted enoxaparin overlapping with and followed by a VKA (international normalized ratio [INR] = 2.0 to 3.0) or fixed‐dose rivaroxaban given as a single‐drug treatment. The results of a pooled analysis of these studies, encompassing over 8,000 patients, showed that rivaroxaban was noninferior to enoxaparin/VKA therapy and was associated with a substantial reduction in the occurrence of major bleeding. 14

### Meta-analysis comparing the efficacy, safety, and cost-benefit of direct acting oral anticoagulants versus enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis to prevent venous thromboembolism among hospitalized patients [^1178DNrZ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potentially fatal complication of hospitalization. Thromboprophylaxis using subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) can result in local irritation, pain, and ecchymoses, leading to nonadherence. Direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are an alternative, but their efficacy and safety for short-term inpatient-only use versus LMWH, in medically hospitalized patients, has not been rigorously assessed. We performed a systematic review with meta-analyses and exploratory cost effectiveness analysis of Phase III randomized controlled trials comparing DOACs to LMWH for VTE prophylaxis to determine the risk and benefit of each. The primary efficacy end point (composite of total VTE and any-cause mortality) occurred in 1,321 of 10,978 (11.4%) of patients receiving DOAC prophylaxis and 1,084 of 10,600 (10.2%) with LMWH (odds ratio [OR] 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63 to 1.13). The primary safety end point (composite of major bleeding and clinically relevant bleeding) occurred in 519 of 16,131 (3.2%) of patients receiving DOACs and 381 of 14,616 (2.6%) with LMWH (OR 1.12; 95%CI 0.83 to 1.53). Subgroup analyses for efficacy (n = 9,233) and safety (n = 12,584) was conducted on patients randomized to Apixaban or LMWH. The primary efficacy end point occurred in 294 of 4618 (6.4%) patients on Apixaban and 383 of 4615 (8.3%) on Enoxaparin (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.24). Major and clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 157 of 6278 (2.50%) and 185 of 6,306 (2.9%), respectively (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.26). Exploratory cost effectiveness analysis suggested that Apixaban compared with Enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis could result in long-term cost savings. In conclusion, this systematic review of randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis, stratified by type of patients and drug, indicates noninferiority of DOACs in efficacy, safety, and cost for short-term VTE thromboprophylaxis among patients hospitalized for medical illness.

Rivaroxaban — EINSTEIN-DVT treatment and extension: > 3,400 patients with acute symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were assigned rivaroxaban 15 mg bid for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily or enoxaparin (1 mg/kg bid) plus warfarin to an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0; symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurred in 36 vs 51 patients (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.44–1.04; P < .0001 for noninferiority). After 6 to 12 months of initial anticoagulation, patients were randomized to rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily or placebo for an additional 6 to 12 months, with superior efficacy over placebo and a nonsignificant increase in major bleeding alongside an increase in clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.

### Approach to outcome measurement in the prevention of thrombosis in surgical and medical patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115tMygH]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) outcome estimation — strategy 3 (baseline risk from observational studies without surveillance, relative effect from RCT combined end points) begins with identifying observational studies of symptomatic VTE without venographic or ultrasound surveillance and then applying relative risk reductions from RCTs using the combined symptomatic and asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) end point. Advantages are that baseline risks come from real-world populations, are not subject to biases from treating asymptomatic events or misattributing symptoms after discovering venographic DVT, and can be reasonably precise with large samples; a key disadvantage is the persisting assumption that treatment effects are identical for symptomatic and asymptomatic events. The authors judge that the advantages outweigh disadvantages only if large observational studies have a low risk of bias and specify prophylaxis exposure, ideally reporting results separately for those receiving and not receiving prophylaxis; such studies are rarely available.

### Enoxaparin sodium [^112sBoab]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary endpoint observed during the first 30 days was maintained over a 12 month follow-up period (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier Plot – Death or Myocardial Re-infarction at 30 Days – ITT Population

There is a trend in favor of enoxaparin sodium during the first 48 hours, but most of the treatment difference is attributed to a step increase in the event rate in the UFH group at 48 hours (seen in Figure 2), an effect that is more striking when comparing the event rates just prior to and just subsequent to actual times of discontinuation. These results provide evidence that UFH was effective and that it would be better if used longer than 48 hours. There is a similar increase in endpoint event rate when enoxaparin sodium was discontinued, suggesting that it too was discontinued too soon in this study.

The rates of major hemorrhages (defined as requiring 5 or more units of blood for transfusion, or 15% drop in hematocrit or clinically overt bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage) at 30 days were 2.1% in the enoxaparin sodium group and 1.4% in the unfractionated heparin group. The rates of intracranial hemorrhage at 30 days were 0.8% in the enoxaparin sodium group and 0.7% in the unfractionated heparin group. The 30-day rate of the composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or ICH (a measure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower in the enoxaparin sodium group (10.1%) as compared to the heparin group (12.2%).

14.3 Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis in Medical Patients with Severely Restricted Mobility during Acute Illness

In a double blind multicenter, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium 20 mg or 40 mg once a day subcutaneously was compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in medical patients with severely restricted mobility during acute illness (defined as walking distance of < 10 meters for ≤ 3 days). This study included patients with heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV); acute respiratory failure or complicated chronic respiratory insufficiency (not requiring ventilatory support): acute infection (excluding septic shock); or acute rheumatic disorder (acute lumbar or sciatic pain, vertebral compression [due to osteoporosis or tumor], acute arthritic episodes of the lower extremities). A total of 1102 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1073 patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 40 to 97 years (mean age 73 years) with equal proportions of men and women. Treatment continued for a maximum of 14 days (median duration 7 days). When given at a dose of 40 mg once a day subcutaneously, enoxaparin sodium significantly reduced the incidence of DVT as compared to placebo. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 20).

At approximately 3 months following enrollment, the incidence of venous thromboembolism remained lower in the enoxaparin sodium 40 mg treatment group versus the placebo treatment group.

Study Selection

Covidence, 26 an online systematic review platform was used to initially screen articles on the basis of the title and abstract. Records were imported from various databases into Covidence, where duplicates were removed. Two review authors (A.K. A.T.) independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified citations for potential eligibility. Full texts of articles retrieved were judged potentially eligible by at least 1 review author.

Data Collection Process

Both review authors then independently screened the full‐text article for eligibility using an explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The screening process was documented in Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta‐analysis flow chart of study selection (Figure 1). A data extraction form was developed in the Covidence web platform to extract the information from relevant clinical trials. Both review authors independently extracted data from each included study. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third reviewer (WW). After consensus, both reviewers analyzed the resulting papers in full text independently.

Data Items

The primary efficacy outcome of this study was VTE defined as the composite of symptomatic and asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). We also reported symptomatic VTE and PE as an independent outcome, considering it to be an important predictor of death. Considering the differential risk of proximal and distal DVT on PE and death, the events of proximal and distal DVT were also reported separately. Included studies assessed patients for DVT by systematic bilateral ascending venography of the legs, magnetic resonance venography, or‐dimer test. PE was assessed by a lung scan, pulmonary angiography, and helical computed tomography or at autopsy. All‐cause mortality at day 90 after surgery was also reported. Mortality assessment at 90 days was chosen, as increased risk of VTE‐related mortality has been indicated as 60 to 90 days following surgeries. 12 The safety outcome was the incidence of major bleeding, a composite outcome that included fatal bleeding; bleeding that was retroperitoneal, intracranial, or intraspinal or that involved any other critical organ; bleeding leading to reoperation; or overt bleeding, with hemoglobin level declined > 2 g/dL, or requirement of transfusion of ≥ 2 units of blood as reported in major clinical trials. 11, 12, 15, 27 Safety measures also included minor bleeding, which included any bleeding event not qualified as major bleeding. To assist clinical decision making, we also reported net clinical benefit in which we combined VTE and major bleeding events for each study.

### Individual patient data meta-analysis of enoxaparin vs. unfractionated heparin for venous thromboembolism prevention in medical patients [^112ePhvK]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are both recommended for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients.

Objective

To perform an individual patient data meta-analysis to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of the LMWH enoxaparin and UFH in preventing VTE in hospitalized medical patients.

Methods

Randomized clinical trials comparing subcutaneous enoxaparin (4000 IU once-daily) and UFH (5000 IU subcutaneous two- or three-times daily) for VTE prevention were identified by a systematic search. Individual patient data were obtained from each eligible trial.

Results

Overall, four trials were eligible, including 3600 patients randomized to receive enoxaparin (n = 1799) or UFH (n = 1801). Median patient age was 71 years, and 49.3% were female. Compared with UFH, enoxaparin was associated with risk reductions of 37% for total VTE [relative risk (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51–0.77] and 62% for symptomatic VTE (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17–0.85) at day 15. RR for total VTE in stroke and non-stroke patients was 0.59 (95% CI 0.47–0.74) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.51–1.50), respectively. Major bleeding rates were consistently low and similar between treatment groups at day 15 (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.53–2.44). There was a trend towards reduced risk for mortality in patients receiving enoxaparin (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.64–1.08), compared with UFH.

Conclusions

Enoxaparin significantly reduces VTE in hospitalized medical patients, compared with UFH, without increasing the risk for major bleeding, and was associated with a trend towards reduced all-cause mortality.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was pre‐registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO).

Search strategy

Four online databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar) were searched from inception to 15 June 2024 to identify all the studies investigating the outcomes of aspirin versus LMWH following TKR and THR. The following keywords and their derivative were included 'Arthroplasty' OR 'replacement' AND 'Hip' OR 'knee' AND 'venous thromboembolism' OR 'VTE' OR 'Deep Venous thrombosis' OR 'DVT' OR 'Pulmonary embolism' OR 'PE' AND 'Aspirin' AND 'LMWH' OR 'Enoxaparin' OR 'Dalteparin' OR 'Anticoagulant'. See Supporting Information S1: Appendix for detailed search strategies.

Eligibility criteria

Studies were considered eligible if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) original RCTs; (2) comparing the outcomes of aspirin to LMWH (enoxaparin or dalteparin); (3) in both knee and hip arthroplasty performed for the treatment of osteoarthritis; (4) no restriction on the type of implants; (5) published in the English language. Exclusion criteria included (1) studies not reporting any of the outcomes of interest (VTE, bleeding, mortality rate); (2) studies comparing combined thromboprophylaxis agents protocol where the standalone effect of aspirin versus LWMH is confounded; (3) observational studies, review articles, preclinical, cadaveric and anatomical studies, and case reports; (4) studies with incomplete or unextractable data for analysis. See Supporting Information S1: Appendix for a detailed PICO framework.

The main outcome of interest was the occurrence of symptomatic or asymptomatic VTE, in the form of pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or both. Secondary outcomes included major bleeding events (organ, limb or muscle compromise requiring urgent saving surgery), minor bleeding events (wound ooze or minor bleed) and mortality within 90 days postoperatively.

Study screening

Two authors conducted the screening process independently and blindly by screening the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles. For studies meeting the prespecified eligibility criteria, a full‐text review was performed. Any disagreement between the two authors was resolved by discussion with a more senior author. References of included articles were manually sought to ensure all relevant studies were included.

SVT in pediatrics — indirect adult randomized evidence and estimated benefits/harms: Adult literature included 3 randomized studies that enrolled 3914 patients with non–CVAD-related lower-limb SVTs comparing fondaparinux for 6 weeks, LMWH or NSAIDs for ~2 weeks, and rivaroxaban or fondaparinux for 6 weeks, with outcomes at 3 months. Anticoagulation versus no anticoagulation was not significantly associated with reduced mortality (RR 1.87 [95% CI, 0.17–20.67]) with 1 more death per 1000 (95% CI, 1 fewer to 10 more). For pulmonary embolism, anticoagulation was not associated with a significant reduction (RR 0.31 [95% CI, 0.06–1.54]) but corresponded to 3 fewer PE complications per 1000 (95% CI, 3 fewer to 2 more). For deep vein thrombosis, anticoagulation may favor a reduction (RR 0.53 [95% CI, 0.26–1.04]) with 7 fewer DVT complications per 1000 (95% CI, 10 fewer to 1 more). Major bleeding in trials was 0.1% in CALISTO, none in STENOX, and 0.4% in SURPRISE; overall, major bleeding risk did not differ between anticoagulation and no anticoagulation (1/1715 [0.10%] vs 1/1600 [0.1%]; RR 0.93 [95% CI, 0.05–14.09]) with 0 more per 1000 (95% CI, 1 fewer to 9 more). Effect estimates grouped prophylactic and therapeutic LMWH, with only ~6% receiving a therapeutic regimen, and overall certainty of these effects is very low due to indirectness and imprecision.

### Safety and efficacy of apixaban vs enoxaparin for preventing postoperative venous thromboembolism in women undergoing surgery for gynecologic malignant neoplasm: a randomized clinical trial [^113LrgyC]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), remains one of the most lethal complications in women who undergo surgery for gynecologic cancer. Because gynecologic tumors growing within the pelvis involve lymphatic drainage in direct contact with lower extremity vessels, VTE rates are significantly higher in women with gynecologic cancer compared with other cancers. Rates of DVT after gynecologic cancer have been reported as high as 26% in untreated women and as high as 9% for postoperative PE. Pulmonary embolism is associated with mortality, and death may occur in up to 18% to 20% of patients with this complication. In addition, there is a risk for major bleeding after gynecologic surgery given the extent of dissection often involved.

The cost to the health care system of VTE complications is quite high because these patients require extended anticoagulation therapy and surveillance for 6 months after treatment. If a second DVT or PE occurs, lifelong anticoagulation therapy is usually necessary. The extended anticoagulation therapy time adds both financial and resource strain to health care systems because additional monitoring and imaging are required for these women to ensure that VTE is not worsening. The American Society of Clinical Oncology has developed guidelines for postoperative VTE prophylaxis in oncology patients to reduce the health care burden of these complications. These have been further validated with the adoption of the CHEST 2016 guidelinesand include the use of preoperative heparin, sequential compression devices during surgery, and postsurgical DVT prophylaxis using heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin. Current recommendations include 28 days of postoperative prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously daily).

For a variety of reasons, the use of subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin has not proven to be ideal. Although the drug has been associated with a decrease in VTE, its use has come into question. Common patient complaints related to low-molecular-weight heparin use include injection site reaction, pain with autoinjection, bruising, bleeding, nausea, vomiting, and cost. Although the rate of adherence to outpatient postoperative thromboprophylaxis in women with gynecologic cancers has not been elucidated, data from the orthopedics literature identified an adherence rate of only approximately 60%. With enoxaparin use in outpatient prophylaxis demonstrating poor adherence, a more cost-effective and easier to use medication could affect VTE outcomes.

2.1	Pretreatment Evaluation

Evaluate all patients for a bleeding disorder before starting Lovenox treatment, unless treatment is urgently needed.

Abdominal Surgery

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 40 mg by subcutaneous injection once a day (with the initial dose given 2 hours prior to surgery) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 30 mg every 12 hours administered by subcutaneous injection in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. Administer the initial dose 12 to 24 hours after surgery, provided that hemostasis has been established. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

A dose of Lovenox of 40 mg once a day subcutaneously may be considered for hip replacement surgery for up to 3 weeks. Administer the initial dose 12 (± 3) hours prior to surgery.

Medical Patients during Acute Illness

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 40 mg once a day administered by subcutaneous injection for medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications due to severely restricted mobility during acute illness. The usual duration of administration is 6 to 11 days [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism, who can be treated at home in an outpatient setting.

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously or 1.5 mg/kg once a day administered subcutaneously at the same time every day for inpatient (hospital) treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism or patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism (who are not candidates for outpatient treatment).

In both outpatient and inpatient (hospital) treatments, initiate warfarin sodium therapy when appropriate (usually within 72 hours of Lovenox). Continue Lovenox for a minimum of 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect has been achieved (International Normalization Ratio 2 to 3). The average duration of administration is 7 days [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

### Comparison of ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, with enoxaparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following total hip replacement. A randomized, double-blind study [^1157p6pw]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Prophylaxis is recommended following total joint replacement because of the high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Postoperative low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) reduces the incidence of venographically detected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) to about 10–15% in total hip replacement (THR) patients. Ximelagatran is a novel, oral direct thrombin inhibitor that selectively and competitively inhibits both free and clot-bound thrombin. We compared the efficacy and safety of ximelagatran with those of enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing THR.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blind study conducted principally in the USA and Canada. Patients received fixed-dose oral ximelagatran 24 mg bid or subcutaneous enoxaparin 30 mg bid and matched placebo for 7–12 days; both regimens were initiated the morning after surgery. The incidence of VTE (by postoperative day 12) included thrombosis determined by mandatory venography of the leg on which surgery was performed and symptomatic, objectively proven DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). VTE and bleeding events were interpreted by an independent central adjudication committee for primary analysis.

Results

Of the 1838 patients randomized, 1557 had either adequate venography or symptomatic, proven VTE (efficacy population). Overall rate of venography acceptable for evaluation was 85.4%. Overall rates of total VTE were 7.9% (62 of 782 patients) in the ximelagatran group and 4.6% (36 of 775 patients) in the enoxaparin group, with an absolute difference of 3.3% and a 95% confidence interval for the difference of 0.9% to 5.7%. Proximal DVT and/or PE occurred in 3.6% (28 of 782 patients) in the ximelagatran group and 1.2% (nine of 774 patients) in the enoxaparin group. Major bleeding events were observed in 0.8% (seven of 906) of the ximelagatran-treated patients and in 0.9% (eight of 910) of the enoxaparin-treated patients (P > 0.95). Non-inferiority of ximelagatran 24 mg bid based on a prespecified margin of 5% was not met, resulting in superiority of the enoxaparin regimen.

Conclusions

Both ximelagatran and enoxaparin decreased the overall rate of VTE compared with that reported historically. However, in this study, enoxaparin 30 mg bid was more effective than ximelagatran 24 mg bid for prevention of VTE in THR. Oral ximelagatran was used without coagulation monitoring, was well tolerated, and had bleeding rates comparable to those of enoxaparin. Further refinement by testing a higher dose of ximelagatran in the patients undergoing THR is warranted.

### Weight-based enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in young trauma patients: analysis of the CLOTT-1 registry [^115SiD3j]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common and potentially lethal complication after injury. Endothelial dysfunction resulting from trauma-induced local and systemic inflammatory signals significantly increases the risk of DVT and PE, even in baseline healthy individuals. Risk can be reduced through the use of mechanical and chemical VTE prophylaxis. A 2013 Cochrane database meta-analysis estimated the rate of DVT and PE in trauma patients receiving no prophylaxis at 8.7% and 3.3%, respectively. VTE prophylaxis of any kind (chemical, mechanical, or both) was associated with a significant reduction in DVT (relative risk [RR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32–0.84), but not PE. The authors also reported that chemoprophylaxis was more effective than mechanical prophylaxis in reducing overall DVT risk (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25–0.95).

Enoxaparin is the preferred agent for chemoprophylaxis in severely injured patients without contraindications for low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH); however, controversy remains regarding optimal dosing strategies. Early administration of LMWH has been associated with lower rates of DVT, PE, and in-hospital mortality when compared with unfractionated heparin (UH). These studies typically used one of two fixed dosing regimens: 40 mg daily (once a day) or 30 mg every 12 hours (two times per day). Recent recognition that these regimens may not achieve adequate biochemical prophylaxis, as measured by anti-Xa activity level, has increased the support for alternative dosing strategies. Obesity has been identified as a possible risk factor for subtherapeutic prophylaxis, leading to the adoption of weight-adjusted dosing schemes. Weight-adjusted enoxaparin prophylaxis is clearly linked to increased anti-Xa activity. Despite evidence that patients with higher anti-Xa levels have reduced rates of VTE, a large meta-analysis of 24 studies was unable to correlate any type of dosing adjustment aimed at achieving target anti-Xa levels with a reduction in VTE incidence. Additionally, a recent systematic review of 45 studies evaluating the effect of standard fixed-dose and weight-based (WB) chemoprophylaxis regimens on anti-Xa levels and VTE rates in obese trauma and surgical patients was unable to establish the superiority of a particular dosing strategy.

### How complete is the evidence for thromboembolism prophylaxis in general medicine patients? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114PxRzP]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Guidelines recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis for hospitalized medical patients at increased risk of thromboembolism. Despite recommendations, multiple studies demonstrate underutilization. Factors contributing to underutilization include uncertainty that prophylaxis reduces clinically relevant events, as well as questions about the best form of prophylaxis. We sought to determine whether prophylaxis decreases clinically significant events and to answer whether unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is either more effective or safer.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched through June 2008. Relevant bibliographies and conference proceedings were reviewed and LMWH manufacturers were contacted.

Study Selection

Randomized trials comparing UFH or LMWH to control, as well as head-to-head comparisons of UFH to LMWH in general medicine patients.

Data Extraction and Analysis

End points of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), proximal or symptomatic DVT, pulmonary embolism, mortality, bleeding, and thrombocytopenia were extracted from individual trials. Pooled relative risks were calculated using random effects modeling.

Results

We identified 8 trials comparing prophylaxis to control, and 6 trials comparing UFH to LMWH. Prophylaxis reduced DVT (relative risk [RR] = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36–0.92), proximal DVT (RR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.31–0.69), and pulmonary embolism (RR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.53–0.93). Prophylaxis increased the risk of any bleeding (RR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.15–2.06) but not major bleeding. Across trials comparing LMWH to UFH, there were no differences for any outcome.

Conclusions

Among medical patients, pharmacologic prophylaxis reduced the risk of thromboembolism without increasing risk of major bleeding. The current literature does not demonstrate superior efficacy of UFH or LMWH.

### Relative effects of two different enoxaparin regimens as comparators against newer oral anticoagulants: meta-analysis and adjusted indirect comparison [^116C4dqq]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Two different regimens of enoxaparin (40 mg once daily or 30 mg bid) have been used as control arms in trials of new oral anticoagulants. The choice of enoxaparin comparator may influence the perceived relative efficacy and safety of the newer agents, and we aimed to identify any significant differences between the two enoxaparin regimens.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials that compared enoxaparin to oral anticoagulant (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban) thromboprophylaxis in elective total knee or hip arthroplasty. Total VTE and bleeding events were pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis and heterogeneity assessed with the I2 statistic. We conducted adjusted indirect comparisons of bid vs once-daily enoxaparin regimes based on new oral anticoagulants as common comparators.

Results

Fourteen randomized controlled trials in hip and knee replacement surgery met the inclusion criteria. Adjusted indirect comparison showed that bid enoxaparin was significantly more effective in preventing VTE than enoxaparin once daily (relative risk [RR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61–0.83; P < .00001). For major and clinically relevant hemorrhage, adjusted indirect comparison showed that enoxaparin bid was nonsignificantly associated with increased risk of bleeding (RR 1.27; 95% CI, 0.97–1.65; p = 0.08) above that of enoxaparin once daily. Subgroup analysis limited to total knee arthroplasty trials showed similar results.

Conclusions

The use of once-daily enoxaparin regimen as control in clinical trials will lead to more favorable estimates of relative efficacy for the new oral anticoagulants than if enoxaparin 30 mg bid had been chosen as a comparator.

### Subcutaneous heparin versus low-molecular-weight heparin as thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing colorectal surgery: results of the Canadian colorectal DVT prophylaxis trial: a randomized, double-blind trial [^111E8Xdu]. Annals of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness and safety of low-dose unfractionated heparin and a low-molecular-weight heparin as prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism after colorectal surgery.

Methods

In a multicenter, double-blind trial, patients undergoing resection of part or all of the colon or rectum were randomized to receive, by subcutaneous injection, either calcium heparin 5,000 units every 8 hours or enoxaparin 40 mg once daily (plus two additional saline injections). Deep vein thrombosis was assessed by routine bilateral contrast venography performed between postoperative day 5 and 9, or earlier if clinically suspected.

Results

Nine hundred thirty-six randomized patients completed the protocol and had an adequate outcome assessment. The venous thromboembolism rates were the same in both groups. There were no deaths from pulmonary embolism or bleeding complications. Although the proportion of all bleeding events in the enoxaparin group was significantly greater than in the low-dose heparin group, the rates of major bleeding and reoperation for bleeding were not significantly different.

Conclusions

Both heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously every 8 hours and enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily provide highly effective and safe prophylaxis for patients undergoing colorectal surgery. However, given the current differences in cost, prophylaxis with low-dose heparin remains the preferred method at present.

14.1	Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis following Abdominal Surgery in Patients at Risk for Thromboembolic Complications

Abdominal surgery patients at risk include those who are over 40 years of age, obese, undergoing surgery under general anesthesia lasting longer than 30 minutes or who have additional risk factors such as malignancy or a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

In a double-blind, parallel group study of patients undergoing elective cancer surgery of the gastrointestinal, urological, or gynecological tract, a total of 1116 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1115 patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 32 to 97 years (mean age 67 years) with 52.7% men and 47.3% women. Patients were 98% Caucasian, 1.1% Black, 0.4% Asian and 0.4% others. Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously, administered once a day, beginning 2 hours prior to surgery and continuing for a maximum of 12 days after surgery, was comparable to heparin 5000 U every 8 hours subcutaneously in reducing the risk of DVT. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 14).

In a second double-blind, parallel group study, Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously once a day was compared to heparin 5000 U every 8 hours subcutaneously in patients undergoing colorectal surgery (one-third with cancer). A total of 1347 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 50.1 years) with 54.2% men and 45.8% women. Treatment was initiated approximately 2 hours prior to surgery and continued for approximately 7 to 10 days after surgery. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 15).

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) Lovenox 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) Lovenox 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of Lovenox or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Lovenox or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both Lovenox regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

Idraparinux — In a phase 2 dose-finding trial in proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 659 patients were randomized after a 5- to 7-day enoxaparin course to once-weekly subcutaneous idraparinux (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, or 10 mg) or warfarin (international normalized ratio [INR] of 2–3) for 12 weeks; major bleeding showed a dose-response with an unacceptably high frequency at 10 mg, and the lowest dose had less bleeding than warfarin (P = 0.029), leading to selection of 2.5 mg once weekly for further trials. In phase 3 Van Gogh trials, 2,904 DVT and 2,215 pulmonary embolism (PE) patients were randomized to idraparinux 2.5 mg weekly or conventional therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or heparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist with INR between 2 and 3; in DVT, recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) at 3 months was 2.9% vs 3.0% and clinically relevant bleeding 4.5% vs 7.0% (P = 0.004) for idraparinux vs conventional therapy, while in PE, recurrent VTE was 3.4% vs 1.6% and clinically relevant bleeding 5.5% vs 8.2%. In the Van Gogh extension, 1,215 patients who completed 6 months of initial therapy were randomized to an additional 6 months of idraparinux vs placebo, with a 72.9% relative reduction in recurrent VTE (P = 0.002) compared with placebo.

5.4	Risk of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia with or without Thrombosis

Lovenox may cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITTS). HITTS may lead to organ infarction, limb ischemia, or death. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely.

Use of Lovenox in patients with a history of immune-mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in the presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Circulating antibodies may persist for several years.

Only use Lovenox in patients with a history of HIT if more than 100 days have elapsed since the prior HIT episode and no circulating antibodies are present. Because HIT may still occur in these circumstances, the decision to use Lovenox in such a case must be made only after a careful benefit-risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments are considered.

5.5	Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of Lovenox.

Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm3and 50,000/mm3) occurred at a rate of 1.3% in patients given Lovenox, 1.2% in patients given heparin, and 0.7% in patients given placebo in clinical trials.

Platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3occurred at a rate of 0.1% in patients given Lovenox, in 0.2% of patients given heparin, and 0.4% of patients given placebo in the same trials.

Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3, Lovenox should be discontinued.

5.6	Interchangeability with other Heparins

Lovenox cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with heparin or other low molecular weight heparins as they differ in manufacturing process, molecular weight distribution, anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, units, and dosage. Each of these medicines has its own instructions for use.

### Goal directed enoxaparin dosing provides superior chemoprophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis [^117DRwJ8]. Injury (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Optimal enoxaparin dosing for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis remains elusive. Prior research demonstrated that trauma patients at increased risk for DVT based upon Greenfield's risk assessment profile (RAP) have DVT rates of 10.8% despite prophylaxis. The aim of this study was to determine if goal directed prophylactic enoxaparin dosing to achieve anti-Xa levels of 0.3–0.5IU/ml would decrease DVT rates without increased complications.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective review of trauma patients having received prophylactic enoxaparin and appropriately timed anti-Xa levels was performed. Dosage was adjusted to maintain an anti-Xa level of 0.3–0.5IU/ml. RAP was determined on each patient. A score of ≥ 5 was considered high risk for DVT. Sub-analysis was performed on patients who received duplex examinations subsequent to initiation of enoxaparin therapy to determine the incidence of DVT.

Results

306 patients met inclusion criteria. Goal anti-Xa levels were met initially in only 46% of patients despite dosing of > 40mg twice daily in 81% of patients; however, with titration, goal anti-Xa levels were achieved in an additional 109 patients (36%). An average enoxaparin dosage of 0.55mg/kg twice daily was required for adequacy. Bleeding complications were identified in five patients (1.6%) with three requiring intervention. There were no documented episodes of HIT. Subsequent duplex data was available in 197 patients with 90% having a RAP score > 5. Overall, five DVTs (2.5%) were identified and all occurred in the high-risk group. All patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.

Conclusion

An increased anti-Xa range of 0.3–0.5IU/ml was attainable but frequently required titration of enoxaparin dosage. This produced a lower rate of DVT than previously published without increased complications.

### The pharmacoeconomics of deep vein thrombosis treatment [^111W5Qca]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, remains a common and costly condition that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment options for initial management of DVT include unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), and fondaparinux, which is the first of a new class of pentasaccharide antithrombotic agents with anti-factor Xa activity. LMWHs are an important tool in DVT management, offering advantages over UFH such as ease of dosing, lack of need for coagulation monitoring, and reduced risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Fondaparinux is also characterized by a simple dosing regimen, no need for coagulation monitoring, and potentially a lower risk of HIT compared with LMWH. In a recent clinical trial of DVT management, efficacy and bleeding rates with fondaparinux appeared similar to those observed with LMWH. In contrast to LMWH, fondaparinux is generally given as a fixed dose across a range of patient weights rather than calculated per individual patient weight. Given the increasing economic burden of VTE, particularly due to its increased rate among the elderly, pharmacoeconomic analyses have become a particularly useful tool to aid in selecting among similarly effective and safe agents for VTE treatment. A recent cost-effective analysis demonstrated that fondaparinux use offers an attractive economic alternative to other agents for initial DVT therapy that could yield cost savings without compromising clinical outcomes or patient safety.

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) monitoring and anti-Xa targets — coagulation monitoring is not generally necessary, though some authorities suggest monitoring in obese patients and in those with renal insufficiency, and monitoring may also be advisable when treatment doses are given during pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial comparing monitored and unmonitored dalteparin therapy for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) showed no benefit of monitoring; monitoring is thus not recommended for the majority of patients, and if monitoring is required, the anti-Xa level is the recommended test. For treatment of VTE, a conservative peak anti-Xa level with twice-daily enoxaparin or nadroparin is 0.6 to 1.0 units/mL, and the target range for peak anti-Xa levels measured 4 h after dosing with once-daily enoxaparin is likely to be above 1.0 units/mL, whereas it is 0.85 units/mL with tinzaparin and 1.3 units/mL and 1.05 units/mL with nadroparin and dalteparin, respectively.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of enoxaparin sodium IV (also known as Lovenox):
- **Decreased platelet count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as thrombocytopenia can occur with the use of enoxaparin.
- **Gasping syndrome**: use caution in infants, as enoxaparin sodium vials contain benzyl alcohol preservative.
- **Hemorrhage**: use caution in patients undergoing PCI. If manual compression is used at the puncture site after PCI, remove the sheath 6 hours after the last enoxaparin dose. Administer the next scheduled dose no sooner than 6–8 hours after sheath removal.
- **Hemorrhage**: use caution in patients with bleeding disorder, uncontrolled hypertension, or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, renal dysfunction, or hemorrhage.
- **Hemorrhage**: use extreme caution in patients at high risk of hemorrhage, including bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative or angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, recent brain, spinal, or ophthalmologic surgery, or concomitant use of platelet inhibitors.
- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as enoxaparin may cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with or without thrombosis.
- **Prosthetic valve thrombosis**: use caution for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, as the risk of thromboembolism is higher in this population. Obtain frequent monitoring of peak and trough anti-factor Xa levels and adjust the dosage.

14.6 Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis in Adult Patients

In a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute symptomatic DVT without PE, fondaparinux sodium 5 mg (body weight less than 50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50 kg to 100 kg), or 10 mg (body weight greater than 100 kg) subcutaneously once daily (fondaparinux sodium treatment regimen) was compared to enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours. Almost all patients started study treatment in hospital. Approximately 30% of patients in both groups were discharged home from the hospital while receiving study treatment. A total of 2,205 patients were randomized and 2,192 were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 years to 95 years (mean age 61 years) with 53% men and 47% women. Patients were 97% Caucasian, 2% black, and 1% other races. Patients with serum creatinine level more than 2 mg/dL (180 micromol/L), or platelet count less than 100,000/mm3 were excluded from the trial. For both groups, treatment continued for at least 5 days with a treatment duration range of 7 ± 2 days, and both treatment groups received vitamin K antagonist therapy initiated within 72 hours after the first study drug administration and continued for 90 ± 7 days, with regular dose adjustments to achieve an INR of 2 to 3. The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed, symptomatic, recurrent VTE reported up to Day 97. The efficacy data are provided in Table 15.

### Meta-analysis of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in medically ill patients [^111xcJBR]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in medically ill patients has received a level 1A recommendation in previously published clinical guidelines. Pharmacologic prophylaxis for VTE includes unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and fondaparinux. Few direct comparisons between anticoagulants exist in medically ill patients.

Objective

This meta-analysis was conducted to assess UFH and LMWH (including the selective factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux) in the reduction of in-hospital VTE in unselected medically ill patients.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry databases from January 1981 through September 2007 (English language) for randomized controlled trials using the following terms: dalteparin, enoxaparin, fondaparinux, nadroparin, and heparin. References of included articles and key review papers for additional studies were also searched. Data from studies were included in the analysis if the studies included medically ill patients with risk factors for VTE who had been followed up for 7 to 21 days.

Results

A total of 12,391 patients (of whom 8357 were in placebo-controlled trials) from 9 studies were included. Mean age for the entire cohort was 72.8 years; mean (SD) body mass index, 25.6 kg/m2; and mean (SD) actual body weight, 68.2 kg. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was significantly reduced with the addition of an LMWH compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR], 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47–0.75; P ≤ 0.001), but rates of DVT were similar when comparing LMWH with UFH (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.56–1.52). No significant differences in pulmonary embolism (PE) or death were found among the UFH, LMWH, and placebo groups. LMWH was associated with a significant increased risk for minor bleeding compared with placebo (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.18–2.29; P = 0.003). However, no significant difference was found between LMWH and UFH (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.27–1.70). Major bleeding events were similar among all groups: LMWH/fondaparinux versus placebo, OR, 1.65 (95% CI, 0.8–3.4); LMWH/fondaparinux versus UFH, OR, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.29–1.68); LMWH/fondaparinux versus UFH or placebo, OR, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.66–2.04).

Conclusions

This analysis suggests that VTE prophylaxis with an LMWH (including fondaparinux) or UFH is effective in reducing the rate of DVT, but this benefit did not extend to enhanced protection against PE. Additionally, LMWH and UFH had similar bleeding outcomes.

14.4 Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) enoxaparin sodium 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5,000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

### Rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after hip arthroplasty [^114NvfbD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

The study RECORD1 was published by Eriksson BI and colleagues in 2008 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Hip osteoarthritis and Hip fracture. In the RECORD1 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of rivaroxaban for extended thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty? In the RECORD1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the RECORD1 study, the population was: 4433 patients (2462 female, 1971 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The key exclusion criteria were bilateral hip arthroplasty; pregnancy or lactation; active bleeding or a high risk of bleeding; contraindications for prophylaxis with enoxaparin or a condition that might require an adjusted dose of enoxaparin; substantial liver disease; severe renal impairment. In the RECORD1 study, the interventions were: n = 2209 rivaroxaban (10 mg PO once daily) n = 2224 enoxaparin (40 mg SC once daily). In the RECORD1 study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in DVT, nonfatal PE, or death from any cause at 36 days (1.1% vs. 3.7%; AD -2.6%, 95% CI -3.7 to -1.5). In the RECORD1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in major VTE (0.2% vs. 2%; AD -1.7%, 95% CI -2.5 to -1) Significant decrease in DVT (0.8% vs. 3.4%; AD -2.7%, 95% CI -1.2 to -2.7). In the RECORD1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major bleeding (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p = 0.18). In the RECORD1 study, the conclusion was: in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty, rivaroxaban was superior to enoxaparin with respect to DVT, nonfatal PE, or death from any cause at 36 days.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^111VqFkS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

In the context of COVID-19, another consideration is the frequency of dosing. Unfractionated heparin prophylaxis is often administered twice or thrice daily, whereas LMWH, especially enoxaparin, is dosed daily. International guidelines also state that once-daily regimens of LMWH may be advantageous over UFH because missed doses may be associated with worse outcomes, will reduce healthcare worker exposure, and conserve personal protective equipment.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

1) In the absence of contraindications, we recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with either LMWH or UFH for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and moderate quality of evidence).
2) If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH for VTE prophylaxis to minimize risk to healthcare workers (UG best practice statement).
3) We recommend against the use of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).
4) Because of limited evidence, we suggest against the use of "enhanced" or "intermediate" prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients in LMICs (weak recommendation and low quality of evidence).
5) In hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on current available evidence, we recommend against the initiation of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation without clinical suspicion for VTE (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).
6) If contraindications exist to chemical prophylaxis, we recommend mechanical prophylaxis with IPC devices or GCS for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).

How should clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19–related VTE be managed in LMICs?

Rationale.

Management of VTE requires timely diagnosis, knowledge of risk factors for both thrombosis and bleeding, safe administration of medications, and ability to monitor, when indicated. Clinical suspicion for PE should arise if a patient develops a sudden deterioration of oxygenation, respiratory distress, or hypotension disproportional to pulmonary involvement by COVID-19. According to COVID-19 clinical management guidelines from the WHO, NIH, and various societies, patients with suspected or confirmed VTE should receive therapeutic anticoagulation as would be indicated in those without COVID-19. The optimal approach to managing VTE related to COVID-19 in LMICs remains unknown.

14.1 Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Abdominal Surgery in Patients at Risk for Thromboembolic Complications

Abdominal surgery patients at risk include those who are over 40 years of age, obese, undergoing surgery under general anesthesia lasting longer than 30 minutes or who have additional risk factors such as malignancy or a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

In a double-blind, parallel group study of patients undergoing elective cancer surgery of the gastrointestinal, urological, or gynecological tract, a total of 1116 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1115 patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 32 to 97 years (mean age 67 years) with 52.7% men and 47.3% women. Patients were 98% Caucasian, 1.1% Black, 0.4% Asian and 0.4% others. Enoxaparin sodium injection 40 mg subcutaneously, administered once a day, beginning 2 hours prior to surgery and continuing for a maximum of 12 days after surgery, was comparable to heparin 5000 U every 8 hours subcutaneously in reducing the risk of DVT. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 14).

In a second double-blind, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium injection 40 mg subcutaneously once a day was compared to heparin 5000 U every 8 hours subcutaneously in patients undergoing colorectal surgery (one-third with cancer). A total of 1347 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 50.1 years) with 54.2% men and 45.8% women. Treatment was initiated approximately 2 hours prior to surgery and continued for approximately 7 to 10 days after surgery. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 15).

### Thromboelastogram-guided enoxaparin dosing does not confer protection from deep venous thrombosis: a randomized controlled pilot trial [^115vzdyD]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) remains high in general surgery and trauma patients despite widespread prophylaxis with enoxaparin. A recent study demonstrated decreased incidence of DVT if patients on enoxaparin had a change in R time (ΔR) of greater than 1 minute when heparinase-activated thromboelastography (TEG) was compared with normal TEG. We hypothesized that using ΔR-guided dosing would result in decreased DVT rates.

Methods

A prospective, randomized controlled trial was performed at a Level 1 trauma center. Both trauma and general surgery patients were included. Upon enrollment, demographic data including age, sex, body mass index, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were obtained. Enrolled patients were randomized to standard (30 mg twice a day) or TEG-guided dosing. Dose-adjusted patients underwent daily enoxaparin titration to achieve an ΔR of 1 minute to 2 minutes. Venous thromboembolism screening was performed per institutional protocol. Antithrombin III (AT-III) and anti-Xa levels were drawn at peak enoxaparin concentrations.

Results

A total of 87 patients were enrolled. There was no difference in demographic data between the groups. No pulmonary emboli were identified. The control group had a DVT rate of 16%, while the experimental group had a rate of 14% (p = nonsignificant). The experimental group's median enoxaparin dosage, 50 mg twice a day, was significantly higher than that of the control (p < 0.01). TEG ΔR was not different between the control and experimental groups. Beginning at Day 3, anti-Xa levels were higher in the experimental group (p < 0.05). There was no difference in AT-III activity between the two groups; 67% of the patients demonstrated AT-III deficiency.

Conclusion

TEG adjusted enoxaparin dosing led to significant increases in anti-Xa activity, which did not correlate with a decreased DVT rate. Failure to reduce the DVT rate and increase ΔR despite increased dosing and increased anti-Xa activity is consistent with the high rate of AT-III deficiency detected in this study cohort. These data suggest that the future of DVT prevention may not lie in the optimization of low molecular weight heparin therapy but rather in compounds that increase antithrombin directly or operate independently of the AT-III pathway.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic study, level III.

### Enoxaparin is associated with lower rates of mortality than unfractionated heparin in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [^111ac9ix]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

There are a few limitations of this study. First, Enoxaparin and Heparin differ in FDA label indications. The label for Enoxaparinincludes the prophylaxis and treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) in various settings, the prophylaxis of ischemic complications of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI), and the treatment of acute ST-segment elevation MI managed medically or with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention. On the other hand, the label for unfractionated Heparinincludes similar prophylactic indications as well as the treatment of a broader spectrum of acute embolic events including peripheral arterial embolism and embolism in the setting of atrial fibrillation, the treatment of consumptive coagulopathies, and usage as an anticoagulant in high-risk patient groups such as those undergoing blood transfusions, extracorporeal circulation, and dialysis procedures. As a result, it is possible that the patient population receiving unfractionated Heparin is more severely or acutely ill to begin with.

Another limitation of this study is that the data were not created or collected to answer the specific research question for this analysis. As a result, the results of this study may be influenced by unmeasured confounding variables which are not recorded in this dataset, such as socioeconomic factors. In addition, there may be misclassification bias if the anticoagulant medications for some of these patients were entered incorrectly into the EHR. Due to the relatively short time period of this study, bias due to changing eligibility criteria over time is unlikely because the medication codes to identify the cohorts of patients who were administered Enoxaparin and unfractionated Heparin has remained constant over the course of the study.

Overall, the results of this study motivate future studies to investigate biological mechanisms underlying differences in the outcomes and future trials that could enable the development of more efficacious standard of practice in regards to administration of anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients. Prospective analyses comparing the efficacy of Enoxaparin and unfractionated Heparin are warranted. In follow-up analyses, it may be interesting to consider outcomes stratified by initial laboratory values such as eGFR and-dimer levels as well.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^113RiiH6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Full anticoagulation is now being provided for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in many centers. However, rates of bleeding in such patients appear to be high. Therefore, based on available evidence, we do not endorse routine full anticoagulation for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Rigorous prospective studies to better understand the risk-benefit of therapeutic or enhanced dose anticoagulation in the absence of documented or clinical suspicion of VTE is needed.

Pharmacological prophylaxis is generally available in LMICs and can be delivered feasibly and safely. The WHO Essential Medicines List includes both heparin and enoxaparin. Mechanical modalities may not be available in many LMIC settings and there is the additional challenge of ensuring proper use, although mechanical prophylaxis has the advantage of reusability.

The higher drug cost of LMWH has been mentioned as a reason for using UFH for VTE prevention before the era of COVID-19. A review from Latin America supports the preferred use of treatment-dose heparin over LMWH. One hospital-based study performed in a HIC involving acute ischemic stroke patients determined that the average cost per patient due to VTE or bleeding events was lower with prophylactic enoxaparin versus UFH (US$422 versus US$662, respectively; net savings US$240). The average anticoagulant cost, including drug administration cost per patient, was lower with UFH versus enoxaparin (US$259 versus US$360, respectively; net savings US$101). However, when both clinical events and drug acquisition costs were considered, the total hospital cost was lower with enoxaparin versus UFH (US$782 versus US$922, respectively; savings US$140). A similar conclusion was reached from a different U. S.–based study, which found total average costs per patient of US$1,264 for enoxaparin, US$1,585 for UFH, and US$2,245 for no prophylaxis. It was unclear why enoxaparin prophylaxis was more costly than UFH prophylaxis. For the healthcare payer, considering all direct medical costs associated with VTE up to 2 years after an admission for acute illness, prophylaxis with enoxaparin appears to be more effective and less costly than UFH. Similar comprehensive studies have not been performed in LMIC settings. Estimation of total cost for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, rather than only direct drug cost, might aid in medication choice for policy makers in LMICs.

14.3 Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis in Medical Patients with Severely Restricted Mobility During Acute Illness

In a double blind multicenter, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium injection 20 mg or 40 mg once a day subcutaneously was compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in medical patients with severely restricted mobility during acute illness (defined as walking distance of < 10 meters for ≤ 3 days). This study included patients with heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV); acute respiratory failure or complicated chronic respiratory insufficiency (not requiring ventilatory support): acute infection (excluding septic shock); or acute rheumatic disorder (acute lumbar or sciatic pain, vertebral compression [due to osteoporosis or tumor], acute arthritic episodes of the lower extremities). A total of 1102 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1073 patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 40 to 97 years (mean age 73 years) with equal proportions of men and women. Treatment continued for a maximum of 14 days (median duration 7 days). When given at a dose of 40 mg once a day subcutaneously, enoxaparin sodium injection significantly reduced the incidence of DVT as compared to placebo. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 20).

At approximately 3 months following enrollment, the incidence of venous thromboembolism remained lower in the enoxaparin sodium injection 40 mg treatment group versus the placebo treatment group.

Which thromboprophylaxis for which patients in the ICU?

Unfractionated heparin versus low molecular weight heparin

In general surgical patients and medically ill in-patients, LMWH and UFH have similar efficacy and safety. In patients with major trauma, enoxaparin (LMWH) was more effective than subcutaneous UFH. In patients with heart failure or severe respiratory disease, enoxaparin 40 mg once daily was as effective as 5,000 UI UFH three times daily for prevention of thromboembolic events.

Until now, the PROTECT study is the only RCT to have compared UFH with LMWH as VTE prophylaxis in the ICU, excluding patients at very high risk of bleeding. Overall, 3,764 patients, including 90% mechanically ventilated patients, were randomly allocated to receive 5,000 UI subcutaneous dalteparin once daily plus placebo once daily, or 5,000 UI subcutaneous UFH twice daily. DVT was screened for using CUS within 48 hours after admission, and then twice weekly or in case of clinical suspicion. There was no significant difference in proximal DVT: 5.1% DVT in the dalteparin group versus 5.8% in the UFH group (P = 0.57). However, the rate of PE was significantly lower in the dalteparin group (1.3%) compared with the UFH group (2.3%) (P = 0.01).

A recent review described a significant reduction in PE, but not DVT, with LMWH compared with UFH, with a similar rate of bleeding. ACCP recommends the use of LMWH or UFH thromboprophylaxis in critical care patients at moderate risk for VTE and LMWH for critical care patients at higher risk (major trauma or orthopedic surgery patients) (grade Ia).

### Delayed subdural hematoma after receiving enoxaparin for prevention of thromboembolic events from high-risk surgery [^1169agcj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Enoxaparin (Lovenox) is a low–molecular weight heparin used to prevent deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty. Anticoagulation in a patient after trauma may be dangerous and lead to significant hemorrhage. An elderly man fell and sustained a concussion and a hip fracture. His initial computed tomographic scan of the head was normal. He received enoxaparin perioperatively and developed a delayed extensive subdural hematoma. Although enoxaparin has been shown to be an effective and a safe drug for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in orthopedic surgeries and trauma, severe bleeding may rarely occur, especially in the setting of head trauma. Other therapies for venous thromboembolic prophylaxis, such as mechanical thromboembolism prophylaxis methods, should be considered.

### Economic analyses of venous thromboembolism prevention strategies in hospitalized patients: a systematic review [^114Xhirv]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

In this review, low-molecular-weight heparins appeared to offer superior prophylaxis efficacy compared with warfarin, unfractionated heparin, and placebo for orthopedic, general surgical, and medical patients. Fondaparinux was found to be economically more attractive for venous thromboembolism prevention compared with heparins because of greater efficacy in surgical and orthopedic patients, but may also be associated with increased bleeding. Among 11 economic analyses comparing enoxaparin with fondaparinux, all found that fondaparinux was economically attractive. More than half of these studies were either directly sponsored by the manufacturers of fondaparinux, or were based on original randomized controlled trials funded by the manufacturer.

Historically, many economic evaluations of new drugs have been sponsored by the drug manufacturer. However, this introduces the potential for bias in model construction and interpretation of the results. In a retrospective analysis of 107 trials in five leading medical journals with regard to outcome and sources of funding, studies sponsored by pharmaceutical companies were much less likely to favor traditional therapy over new drug treatment. It is not surprising that new agents are incrementally efficacious; this is the nature of progress in medicine. However, new agents, typically still under patent protection, are virtually always substantially more expensive than comparator drugs. In our systematic review, 25 of the 39 studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, and, with the exception of a single study, each of these found the sponsored drug more economically attractive than the comparator drug. Such consistency in incremental cost-effectiveness among more-expensive drugs is striking. Importantly, we could not detect a consistent bias in outcome between sponsored and nonsponsored evaluations; however, only a minority of evaluations did not receive sponsorship.

### Fondaparinux or enoxaparin for the initial treatment of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis: a randomized trial [^117NquVq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The current standard initial therapies for deep venous thrombosis are low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin. In a dose-ranging study of patients with symptomatic deep venous thrombosis, fondaparinux had efficacy and a safety profile similar to those of low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin).

Objective

To evaluate whether fondaparinux has efficacy and safety similar to those of enoxaparin in patients with deep venous thrombosis.

Design

Randomized, double-blind study.

Setting

154 centers worldwide.

Patients

2205 patients with acute symptomatic deep venous thrombosis.

Intervention

Fondaparinux, 7.5 mg (5.0 mg in patients weighing < 50 kg and 10.0 mg in patients weighing > 100 kg) subcutaneously once daily, or enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg of body weight, subcutaneously twice daily for at least 5 days and until vitamin K antagonists induced an international normalized ratio greater than 2.0.

Measurements

The primary efficacy outcome was the 3-month incidence of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolic complications. The main safety outcomes were major bleeding during initial treatment and death. An independent, blinded committee adjudicated all outcomes.

Results

43 (3.9%) of 1098 patients randomly assigned to fondaparinux had recurrent thromboembolic events compared with 45 (4.1%) of 1107 patients randomly assigned to enoxaparin (absolute difference, -0.15 percentage point [95% CI, -1.8 to 1.5 percentage points]). Major bleeding occurred in 1.1% of patients receiving fondaparinux and 1.2% of patients receiving enoxaparin. Mortality rates were 3.8% and 3.0%, respectively.

Limitations

Follow-up was incomplete in 0.4% of fondaparinux-treated patients and 1.0% of enoxaparin-treated patients.

Conclusions

Once-daily subcutaneous fondaparinux was at least as effective (not inferior) and safe as twice-daily, body weight-adjusted enoxaparin in the initial treatment of patients with symptomatic deep venous thrombosis.

### A user guide to the American Society of Hematology clinical practice guidelines [^112FJbRp]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines — strength of recommendations and benefit–harm balance (GRADE) — the strength of a recommendation reflects the extent to which the panel is confident that the desirable consequences of an intervention outweigh the undesirable consequences, with a strong recommendation indicating that desirable consequences clearly outweigh undesirable consequences and a conditional recommendation expressing that the balance is close or uncertain. The GRADE approach is followed to determine the strength of recommendations, and the first key determinant is the balance between the desirable and undesirable health effects of alternative strategies. As an example, for critically ill patients, pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) probably reduces mortality, pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with minimal increase in bleeding and negligible inconvenience and costs, so advantages outweigh disadvantages and support a strong recommendation. Conversely, in pregnant women with acute lower-extremity DVT, thrombolysis may reduce severe postthrombotic syndrome at the expense of a significant increase in major bleeding, and when advantages and disadvantages are closely balanced this warrants a conditional recommendation.

### Enoxaparin, effective dosage for intensive care patients: double-blinded, randomised clinical trial [^113683HU]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Geerts et al. determined the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients not receiving prophylaxis to be in the range of 10–80%. The critically ill patient is especially predisposed to thromboembolism, possessing many inherent risk factors: cardiac failure, trauma, sepsis, cancer, increasing age, and obesity. The acquisition of others, for example: respiratory support with decreased mobility and invasive monitoring, further tips the scale in favor of thrombosis during the ICU stay. Thus, these patients should undergo routine assessment for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The use of routine thromboprophylaxis will probably be justified in most.

Discerning DVT in critically ill patients is difficult. The history and physical examination are often of little use, and thus, these patients are vulnerable to a delay in diagnosis. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are often used as a safe and effective means of prophylaxis against VTE in medical and surgical patients. However, the efficacy of LMWHs in critically ill patients is less certain.

The antithrombotic activity of LMWHs is often determined by aFXa assay, despite several studies finding no direct correlation between aFXa activity and clinical outcome. Mayr concluded that the European standard daily dose of 40 mg enoxaparin was ineffective in ICU patients to achieve the recommended, albeit unproven, aFXa levels of 0.1 to 0.3 IU/ml. Thus, existing guidelines in other patient populations should not be directly applied to critical care patients without further study.

Most intensive care physicians widely acknowledge the need for evidence-based guidelines for antithromboembolic prophylaxis in this patient population and lament the dearth of research on VTE in critical care patients. This study aims to establish the optimal dose of enoxaparin for ICU patients.

### Subcutaneous enoxaparin once or twice daily compared with intravenous unfractionated heparin for treatment of venous thromboembolic disease [^115vwU4Y]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Low-molecular-weight heparins administered subcutaneously once or twice daily have been reported to be as safe and efficacious as intravenous unfractionated heparin in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolic disease.

Objective

To determine whether subcutaneous enoxaparin administered once or twice daily is as effective as continuously infused unfractionated heparin in acute symptomatic venous thromboembolic disease.

Design

Randomized, controlled, partially blinded equivalence trial.

Setting

74 hospitals in 16 countries.

Patients

900 patients with symptomatic lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis, including 287 (32%) with confirmed pulmonary embolism.

Interventions

Initial therapy with dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin compared with subcutaneous enoxaparin at fixed dosages of 1.0 mg/kg of body weight twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily. Long-term oral anticoagulation was started in all patients within 72 hours of randomization.

Measurements

Clinical end points assessed during a 3-month follow-up period.

Results

Equivalent efficacy was seen in the heparin group and both enoxaparin groups. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism recurred in 12 of 290 patients receiving unfractionated heparin (4.1%), 13 of 298 patients receiving once-daily enoxaparin (4.4%), and 9 of 312 patients receiving twice-daily enoxaparin (2.9%). Compared with unfractionated heparin, the treatment difference was 0.2% (95% CI, -3.04% to 3.49%) for once-daily enoxaparin and -1.2% (CI, -4.2% to 1.7%) for twice-daily enoxaparin. Incidence of major hemorrhage did not differ among the three treatment groups. Major hemorrhage occurred in 6 of 290 patients (2.1%) in the unfractionated heparin group, 5 of 298 patients (1.7%) in the once-daily enoxaparin group, and 4 of 312 patients (1.3%) in the twice-daily enoxaparin group.

Conclusions

Subcutaneous enoxaparin once or twice daily is as effective and safe as dose-adjusted, continuously infused unfractionated heparin in the prevention of recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolic disease.

### Heparin versus enoxaparin for prevention of venous thromboembolism after trauma: a randomized noninferiority trial [^113VFuPg]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Research comparing enoxaparin with unfractionated heparin (UFH) given every 12 hours for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis after trauma overlooks original recommendations that UFH be given every 8 hours. We conducted a prospective, randomized, noninferiority trial comparing UFH every 8 hours and standard enoxaparin every 12 hours. We hypothesized that the incidence of VTE in trauma patients receiving UFH every 8 hours would be no more than 10% higher than that in patients receiving enoxaparin every 12 hours.

Methods

Trauma patients who met criteria for VTE prophylaxis at a Level I trauma center were randomly assigned to 5,000-U UFH every 8 hours or 30-mg enoxaparin every 12 hours between November 2012 and September 2014. Surveillance duplex ultrasound was performed twice weekly on intensive care unit patients and weekly on ward patients. Primary end points were deep vein thrombosis diagnosed by duplex ultrasound and pulmonary embolism diagnosed by computed tomography angiography.

Results

Of 495 randomized patients, 220 received UFH and 216 received enoxaparin for analysis. Overall, 105 in the UFH group and 103 in the enoxaparin group underwent VTE surveillance or diagnostic testing. In the analysis of randomized patients who received treatment, UFH was noninferior compared with enoxaparin (absolute VTE risk difference, 3.1%; 95% confidence interval, -1.6% to 7.7%; p = 0.196); however, in the screening ultrasound group, the noninferiority of UFH was inconclusive (absolute VTE risk difference, 6.5%; 95% confidence interval, -2.9% to 15.8%; p = 0.179). The two treatments did not differ with regard to adverse events. The pharmaceutical cost for the regimen of UFH ($2,809) was nearly 20-fold lower than that for enoxaparin ($54,138).

Conclusion

A regimen of UFH every 8 hours may be noninferior to enoxaparin every 12 hours for the prevention of VTE following trauma. Given UFH's cost advantage, the use of UFH for VTE prophylaxis may offer greater value.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic/care management study, level II.

14.1 Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis following Abdominal Surgery in Patients at Risk for Thromboembolic Complications

Abdominal surgery patients at risk include those who are over 40 years of age, obese, undergoing surgery under general anesthesia lasting longer than 30 minutes or who have additional risk factors such as malignancy or a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

In a double-blind, parallel group study of patients undergoing elective cancer surgery of the gastrointestinal, urological, or gynecological tract, a total of 1116 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1115 patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 32 to 97 years (mean age 67 years) with 52.7% men and 47.3% women. Patients were 98% Caucasian, 1.1% Black, 0.4% Asian and 0.4% others. Enoxaparin sodium 40 mg subcutaneously, administered once a day, beginning 2 hours prior to surgery and continuing for a maximum of 12 days after surgery, was comparable to heparin 5,000 U every 8 hours subcutaneously in reducing the risk of DVT. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 14).

In a second double-blind, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium 40 mg subcutaneously once a day was compared to heparin 5,000 U every 8 hours subcutaneously in patients undergoing colorectal surgery (one-third with cancer). A total of 1347 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 50.1 years) with 54.2% men and 45.8% women. Treatment was initiated approximately 2 hours prior to surgery and continued for approximately 7 to 10 days after surgery. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 15).

The initial enoxaparin dose for trauma patients with a normal creatine clearance may also be based on weight. Options include 0.5 mg/kg twice daily, 0.6 mg/kg twice daily, or 30 mg for 50 to 60 kg patients, 40 mg for 61 to 99 kg patients, and 50 mg for patients greater than 100 kg. Patients who are initiated on higher doses of enoxaparin based upon weight should be monitored by anti-Xa levels because of the fluctuations in creatinine clearance after trauma that might lead to changes in the enoxaparin dose.

Although enoxaparin is preferable to heparin for pharmacologic prophylaxis, some institutions continue to dose unfractionated heparin at 5,000 U three times daily based in part on a randomized trial that suggested that this regimen might be noninferior and cost-effective compared with 30 mg of enoxaparin twice daily. This practice should be reconsidered as the trial was underpowered because of an assumed DVT rate of 44% for unfractionated heparin versus 31% for enoxaparin, and a 10% noninferiority margin for the power calculation. The actual difference in the VTE rate was 3.1%, which favored enoxaparin without reaching significance (unfractionated heparin, 8.2% vs. enoxaparin, 5.1%; p = 0.2). In addition, the study was not powered to detect a difference in the rate of PE or HIT, both of which impact the complication rate and health care costs. More recently, 30 mg of enoxaparin twice daily was established as superior to 5000 U of unfractionated heparin three times daily at the prevention of VTE and PE.

### Enoxaparin versus placebo to prevent symptomatic venous thromboembolism in hospitalized older adult medical patients [^112hhQCE]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

The study SYMPTOMS was published by Dominique Mottier and colleagues in 2023 in the journal NEJM Evid. This study is related to the following diseases: Deep vein thrombosis and Pulmonary embolism. In the SYMPTOMS study, the trial question was: what is the role of enoxaparin in medically ill, hospitalized older adult patients with symptomatic VTE? In the SYMPTOMS study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SYMPTOMS study, the population was: 2541 patients (1513 female, 1028 male). The inclusion criteria were older patients aged > 70 years hospitalized for acute medical conditions. The key exclusion criteria were hospitalization for a planned medical procedure or for reasons other than an acute medical condition; contraindication to LMWH; requirement of anticoagulant therapy for any indication or receipt of any anticoagulant therapy > 48 hours before inclusion; organ lesion prone to bleeding, hemorrhagic events, or bleeding tendency due to hemostasis disorders. In the SYMPTOMS study, the interventions were: n = 1278 enoxaparin (at a dose of 40 mg/day for 6–14 days) n = 1263 placebo (matching placebo for 6–14 days). In the SYMPTOMS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death at day 30 (1.8% vs. 2.2%; ARD -0.4, 95% CI -1.5 to 0.7). In the SYMPTOMS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death at day 90 (2% vs. 3%; ARD -1, 95% CI -2.2 to 0.2) No significant difference in atherothrombotic cardiovascular events at day 30 (0.7% vs. 0.6%; AD 0.1%, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.7) No significant difference in cardiovascular death at day 30 (1.3% vs. 0.8%; AD 0.5%, 95% CI -1.2 to 2.2). In the SYMPTOMS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding at day 30. In the SYMPTOMS study, the conclusion was: in older patients aged > 70 years hospitalized for acute medical conditions, enoxaparin was not superior to placebo with respect to symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death at day 30.

Extended Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis following Hip Replacement Surgery: In a study of extended prophylaxis for patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, patients were treated, while hospitalized, with Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously, initiated up to 12 hours prior to surgery for the prophylaxis of postoperative DVT. At the end of the peri-operative period, all patients underwent bilateral venography. In a double-blind design, those patients with no venous thromboembolic disease were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either Lovenox 40 mg (n = 90) once a day subcutaneously or to placebo (n = 89) for 3 weeks. A total of 179 patients were randomized in the double-blind phase of the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 47 to 87 years (mean age 69.4 years) with 57% men and 43% women. In this population of patients, the incidence of DVT during extended prophylaxis was significantly lower for Lovenox compared to placebo. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 19).

In a second study, patients undergoing hip replacement surgery were treated, while hospitalized, with Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously, initiated up to 12 hours prior to surgery. All patients were examined for clinical signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease. In a double-blind design, patients without clinical signs and symptoms of VTE disease were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either Lovenox 40 mg (n = 131) once a day subcutaneously or to placebo (n = 131) for 3 weeks. A total of 262 patients were randomized in the study double-blind phase and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 44 to 87 years (mean age 68.5 years) with 43.1% men and 56.9% women. Similar to the first study the incidence of DVT during extended prophylaxis was significantly lower for Lovenox compared to placebo, with a statistically significant difference in both total DVT (Lovenox 21 [16%] versus placebo 45 [34%]; p = 0.001) and proximal DVT (Lovenox 8 [6%] versus placebo 28 [21%]; p = < 0.001).

Synthesis of Results

Efficacy Outcome

Venous thromboembolism up to postoperative day 15

All 12 trials reported on the outcome measure of VTE; 243 of 4309 patients had VTE in the fondaparinux group versus 471 of 4357 patients in the LMWH group. The odds of VTE in the fondaparinux group were 0.49 times the odds of VTE in the LMWH group (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38–0.64; P < 0.001; Figure 4. Sensitivity analysis (Figure S1) did not impact the effect size (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.42–0.58; P < 0.001). The L'Abbe plot (Figure 5) shows that most of the studies lie in the bottom right (under the null effect line) of the plot. This indicates that the VTE event rates were higher in the LMWH group compared with fondaparinux. The overall trendline (OR line) shows that fondaparinux has a protective effect against VTE compared with LMWH. Reporting bias was not evident, as the funnel plot was symmetric (Figure S2).

The odds of total DVT in the fondaparinux group was 0.48 times the odds in the LWMH group (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.38–0.61; P < 0.001; Figure S3). The odds for proximal DVT in the fondaparinux group were 0.49 times the odds in the LMWH group (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29–0.84; P = 0.009; Figure S4). As far as distal DVT was concerned, the odds in the fondaparinux group were 0.50 times the odds in the LMWH group (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39–0.64; P < 0.001; Figure S5). Not much impact on effect size was observed during sensitivity analysis (Figures S6, S7, and S8). Reporting bias was not evident as presented by funnel plot (Figure S9).

### Fondaparinux sodium compared with low-molecular-weight heparins for perioperative surgical thromboprophylaxis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115JEsjp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Included studies in our meta‐analysis were from different countries. Thus, we reported pooled analysis of these studies, which were from different clinical settings, that might have impacted the results. Studies were also subgrouped by population (eg, North American and Australian, European, and Asian population) as well to address this issue. Two RCTs 12, 19 conducted in North America had some of their centers in Australia. We could not separate the American population from the Australian population because of the limitation to data access. Thus, we presented pooled analyses of these 2 populations. Our study considered all LMWHs in 1 group whether it was enoxaparin, nadroparin, or dalteparin. Nevertheless, it has been indicated by a meta‐analysis of 20 RCTs that all LMWHs produce similar relative safety and efficacy when compared for VTE prophylaxis. 48 There was a difference in the dose of the LMWH in studies from different countries, which might have impacted the outcomes as well. Also, there was a difference in the duration of the prophylaxis. This limitation is justified because of the fact that with the time there is a variation in the guidelines for the prophylaxis of VTE. 7, 49, 50, 51

Strengths

To our knowledge, this is the most current comprehensive meta‐analysis comparing subcutaneous fondaparinux with LMWH for perioperative surgical thromboprophylaxis. To maintain the high quality of systematic review, this study considered only randomized clinical trials in the analyses as per the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 28 We kept the definition of our outcomes consistent while analyzing the results. The cutoff point for the assessment of our study was set to 15 days. If any study among the included studies assessed the outcomes after 15 days, we excluded the event from our analysis. For example, Argun et al 21 reported an event of proximal DVT at day 19 with LMWH, which was not considered in our summary statistics. Thus, we maintained consistency throughout our study. To present the most comprehensive and robust results, we conducted several sensitivity and subgroup analyses as well to assist with the best clinical decision.

Conclusion

The results of this systematic review and meta‐analysis suggest that fondaparinux is significantly better in terms of reduction of VTE (composite of DVT and PE) for perioperative surgical thromboprophylaxis. However, for the symptomatic VTE and all‐cause mortality, fondaparinux was not found to be superior to LMWH in this study. Clinicians should be aware of the higher risk of major bleeding, especially surgical site bleeding with fondaparinux compared with LMWH. Nevertheless, net clinical benefit as per this study was in favor of fondaparinux compared with LMWH.
